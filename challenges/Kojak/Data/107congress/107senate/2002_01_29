Mr. President, yesterday there was an article in the \nnewspaper that caught my attention. I hope sincerely that the article \nwas incorrect. All Members have had the experience of being quoted in \nthe newspaper and wondering where the reporter got the information that \nwas the basis of the story. I hope that is the case with this article.\n  It was reported in the State of New Jersey a new set of history \nstandards have been adopted and that textbooks in New Jersey high \nschools dealing with American history will now fail to mention the \nnames of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, or Thomas Jefferson. \nFurther, it said the word ``war'' had been removed from the textbooks \nand in its place we have the word ``conflict,'' and there would be no \ndiscussion of wars.\n  Mr. President, I hope this is incorrect. It indicates that at least \nsomeone in New Jersey is prepared to make that State an isolated island \nof ignorance about American history. To think we can bring citizens \ninto maturity in this country without their having any understanding \nof, indeed, no mention of, the names of George Washington, Benjamin \nFranklin, Thomas Jefferson, and the other Founding Fathers is absurd.\n  One of the best-selling books currently in the marketplace is the \nhistory of John Adams by David McCullough. On the dust jacket of the \nbook, McCullough says, accurately, we as Americans cannot know too much \nabout our Founding Fathers. We must never forget them. We must always \nlearn as much as we possibly can about them.\n  I would say to those who are supporting this position in New Jersey \nschools, how are you going to explain to your students the fact that we \ntake the Fourth of July as a holiday in this country if you are not \ngoing to tell them anything about the Revolutionary War? If you cannot \neven use the word ``war,'' how are you going to explain to these \nstudents that the country honors those who founded it and who fought \nthat war; if you can't tell them the name of the commander of the \nContinental Army and the forces on the American side of that war \nbecause you think that name somehow no longer matters?\n  How are you going to describe what happened on the Fourth of July if \nyou cannot use the name of Thomas Jefferson, the author of the \nDeclaration of Independence, that was proclaimed to the country on that \nday? How are you going to explain to high school students who decide \nthey are going to enter public service, and take an oath of office, \nthat they are swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution of the \nUnited States when you will not have been able to describe the \nConstitutional Convention, the President of which was George \nWashington, and one of the leading figures in which was Benjamin \nFranklin, if you have exorcized the names of Washington and Franklin \nfrom your textbooks? What meaning does the oath of office have if you \ncannot explain where the Constitution came from or describe the \nconvention that created it?\n  How are you going to describe some of the major problems that have \nexisted in this country stemming from the great battle that was the \nCivil War, that went across five Aprils, and divided this country in a \nfundamental way that has taken us a century or more to heal?\n  No, we can't discuss that. We can talk about conflicts, but we will \nnot discuss the leaders of that war. We will not discuss many of the \nproblems of that war because it isn't politically correct to raise \nthose issues anymore.\n  We have talked about history in this Chamber before. There have been \nthose who have been trying to rewrite our history, trying to change it \nand shape it and slice it and dice it in ways that become politically \ncorrect in today's mode of conversation. You cannot do that and be \naccurate to the requirement of telling the truth about what really \nhappened.\n  That is Orwellian. We read the novel by George Orwell, ``1984,'' in \nwhich the hero of the novel spent all of his time at his job changing \nthe past. He worked for the Ministry of Truth and his job was to go \nback and correct the record so as to rob the present society of a true \nunderstanding of the past in the name of the state, thus the adjective \n``Orwellian'' entered our language.\n  What is being proposed in New Jersey is Orwellian. It is stupid and \nit needs to be condemned.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S194-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S194-S195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \namendment offered by my very distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, regarding unemployment benefits for Americans who \nare not now receiving them. The legislation offered by Senator Daschle \nhas a very important provision to extend unemployment benefits by 13 \nweeks for the people in this country who are receiving unemployment now \nand whose benefits are scheduled to run out in the very near future.\n  We have lost, in this country, almost 2 million jobs since January of \na year ago. Yet we have not done what this Congress has done in most \nprevious recessions, certainly the last two or three recessions, which \nis to extend unemployment benefits. Already in Minnesota, and I am sure \nin other States, the unemployment benefits are running out for people \nwho lost their jobs earlier in the year. It is just simple decency, it \nis simple justice, to be offering that extension now.\n  In fact, as you know, we have tried to do that in this body, for \ninstance, last September, at the time we passed legislation to prevent \na bankruptcy in our Nation's airlines. At that time, many of us wanted \nto increase the unemployment benefits duration and were then not able \nto do so.\n  This is something that is long overdue. I commend our majority leader \nfor making that a keystone of his proposal now on economic stimulus. I \nwas delighted to read the President purportedly will be indicating his \nsupport for extending unemployment benefits tonight. So I hope this is \nsomething we will be able to address on a bipartisan basis.\n  Additionally, however, reports are that over half of the Americans \nwho are out of work, who have lost their jobs during this last year, \nare not receiving any unemployment benefits whatsoever. They are not \neligible. Even though they were working Americans, even though they \nhave been in the workforce, because they held only part-time jobs, \nbecause maybe they held multiple part-time jobs, they are not receiving \nany unemployment benefits whatsoever. That is over half of the people \nwho are out of work in this country, including my State of Minnesota.\n\n  That is a national disgrace. That totally repudiates the kind of \nsafety net that we say we are going to create for people who, through \nno fault of their own, who through no choice of their own, are thrown \ninto economic hard times, their families into economic despair. They \nlose their health benefits; they lose their income; they lose their \njobs. No wonder people are devastated by that kind of experience.\n  The amendment of Senator Durbin very importantly would extend \nunemployment coverage for those 13 weeks to men and women throughout \nthis country who have just lost their jobs but are now not receiving \nany unemployment benefits whatsoever. The Durbin amendment would also \nslightly\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\nincrease the amount of money that those who are receiving unemployment \nbenefits will get during those 13 weeks because, again, we are talking \nabout people who, through no fault or choice of their own, are thrown \nout of the workforce.\n  In many States, those unemployment benefits are not even enough to \nreach a bare minimum poverty level. We can afford to be generous. We \ncan't afford not to be generous for people in that circumstance.\n  I commend Senator Durbin for this important addition to Senator \nDaschle's amendment. I hope we will receive today the kind of \ncompassion and support the President purportedly will be calling for \ntonight, and that we can do, in advance of his speech, what we should \nhave done months ago, which is to provide this extension and include \nothers in it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding, under a previous \nunanimous consent request, I am recognized now between 11 and 11:30 to \nshare time with those in support and in opposition to my amendment, and \nat 11:30 there will be a vote on my amendment No. 2714.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, there shall be 30 \nminutes of debate on the pending Durbin amendment No. 2714, to be \nequally divided in the usual form.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this is an amendment to the economic \nstimulus bill, and it relates to unemployment compensation. There are \nmany arguments that I will make about the justice and fairness of this \namendment, but that is not where I am going to start. I want to start \nwith the economics of this amendment.\n  This is an economic stimulus bill. It is not designed first and \nforemost to be a bill for restoring justice to unemployment \ncompensation, although I think this amendment achieves that. The first \nthing it is supposed to do is help the economy move forward. If there \nis a problem in America's economy today that is easily defined, it is \nthe fact that we have an overcapacity and overproduction of goods and \nservices and limited demand. As a result, businesses across America \nhave said: People are not buying as much as they used to, so we are \ngoing to cut back on production. We are going to lay off workers.\n  That has had a ripple effect in the wrong direction. It has created a \nrecession, which has created unemployment, which has lessened business \nactivity. First and foremost, whatever we do in an economic stimulus \npackage should attack this problem. First and foremost, it should \nstimulate demand and spending for goods and services. And in \nstimulating that demand, I believe it will increase the demand for \nproduction, and it will increase employment in production industries \nand start this economy back on the road again.\n  Here is something that should be kept in mind. For every dollar we \nput into the economy, we get an impact. We don't know what the impact \nmight be until we see who receives the dollar. If you happen to be a \nperson of great wealth who, frankly, doesn't take each dollar you \nreceive and put it into a purchase, then what they call the multiplier \neffect might not even be a dollar for a dollar. That dollar may go into \na savings account or into an investment. It won't go into the actual \ndemand for goods and services that creates the jobs I mentioned.\n  We know dollars given to unemployed people are dollars that are spent \nand respent in a hurry. In fact, the Labor Department has come out with \na study that says for every dollar in unemployment benefit we put into \nthe economy, it increases the gross domestic product, the sum total of \ngoods and services in America, by $2.15. These funds are spent and \nturned over several times in the economy. So if we want to really get \nthe engine roaring when it comes to demand, give the money to the \npeople who are struggling on a daily basis. They will spend it in a \nhurry. They need to spend it on the obvious necessities of life.\n  First and foremost, this is an economic stimulus amendment.\n  Let me speak to the justice and fairness of this amendment. It is a \nsad reality that only 33 percent of the people who are unemployed \nreceive unemployment insurance. This was not always the case. In fact, \nnot too long ago, 75 percent of unemployed people received unemployment \ninsurance. That was in 1975, 27 years ago. Now it is down to 33 \npercent. Why the difference? Why is it if you were unemployed in 1975, \nyou were much more likely, more than twice as likely to receive \nunemployment insurance? Because the nature of employment has changed in \nAmerica. It is no longer the full-time employee, the 40-hour-a-week \nemployee, who is unemployed. More and more, it is the part-time \nemployee. It is the mother with children, taking a job and only working \n4 days a week and who doesn't get any benefits on the job, who finally \nloses that job and then, unemployed, turns to a system which says: No, \nthe door is closed. We don't have unemployment insurance for part-time \nworkers.\n\n  My amendment seeks to do two things: first, to increase unemployment \ninsurance benefits by providing an additional 15 percent or $25, which \nisn't a huge sum, but it can be helpful to people who are unemployed. \nSadly, the unemployment insurance payments to individual workers across \nAmerica have been falling behind. Take Illinois, for example. The \naverage benefit is only $1,005 a month. The average rent for a two-\nbedroom apartment is $776 a month. A family couldn't even pay the rent \non that money, never mind food, clothes, utilities, and all other \nfamily expenses.\n  Since 1990, we have seen the percentage of lost income replaced by \nunemployment benefits falling 5 percent. The decline has had a serious \nimpact\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\non a lot of families. Benefits vary by State, but the maximum benefits \nare as low as $190 a week. Think about keeping a family together with \nan unemployment payment of $190 a week. What we are trying to do is to \ngive a slight increase, a deserved increase in unemployment insurance \nbenefits.\n  Secondly, we expand coverage. As I mentioned, take a look at \nunemployed Americans today compared to 25 years ago. You will find more \nand more unemployed part-time workers. Because of the calculation of \nunemployment insurance benefits, they ignore the 6 months before a \nperson loses the job. So many people who have only had a job for a \nshort period of time qualify for nothing. So you have fewer and fewer \npeople with this coverage.\n  We have to supplement this current unemployment insurance program to \nprovide coverage for welfare-to-work people, women and others who \nplayed by the rules and paid into the system. These workers finance the \nUI fund during many good times, and surely we ought to help them in the \nbad times.\n  Women comprise 70 percent of the part-time workforce, 65 percent of \nservice sector workers. They work in the industries hardest hit by the \neconomic downturn. Last year, only 23 percent of unemployed women in \nAmerica qualified for unemployment insurance benefits.\n  Remember what we are telling women. We are saying to women: We really \nwould like you to stay home with the kids more. That is kind of our \nmessage. Yet many women find they can't keep their family together \nunless they give a helping hand. Some of them are single mothers. They \ntake a part-time job, maybe the best they can get, maybe all they want, \nso they can spend more time with the kids. Then they lose their job. \nThen they get no help from unemployment insurance because they were \npart-time workers.\n  This amendment extends unemployment insurance benefits to cover those \npart-time workers, particularly helping those women who are a \ndisproportionate share of workers affected by it.\n  According to the GAO, low-wage workers are half as likely to receive \nbenefits than other unemployed workers, even though they are twice as \nlikely to be unemployed. So those are the things we do. We increase the \nbenefits under unemployment insurance. We expand the eligibility so \nthat temporary and part-time workers will at least get a helping hand.\n  The $15 billion that we estimate this will cost will come entirely \nout of the unemployment insurance funds in Washington. There is no \nburden placed on employers or States. It is money collected. It is \ntemporary. It is a kind of helping hand which will stimulate the \neconomy, No. 1, and, No. 2, do the right and fair thing for workers \nacross America.\n  What does it mean in a few States? Let me give an example. In \nIllinois, it means that 590,000 unemployed Illinoisans, because of this \namendment, will get a helping hand.\n  Let me pick another State. Let's try Iowa: 157,000 workers in Iowa, \nunder the Durbin amendment, will receive benefits or increased benefits \nthat they otherwise would not have received. Take a look at the part-\ntime workers in the State of Iowa: 11,000 people, unemployed part-time \nworkers in that State will now receive some benefit from unemployment \ninsurance. In my State of Illinois, it is 54,000, a larger State.\n  I can go through the list, and I am going to put it on the table when \nwe vote. Look at the real numbers of real people who are suffering in \nyour States because of being unemployed and falling through the cracks. \nThis Durbin Amendment tries to close the cracks. I thank Senator \nWellstone of Minnesota, Senator Dayton as well, and Senator Landrieu \nand those who have cosponsored this amendment. I will stop now because \nI want to give some of them an opportunity to speak.\n  I will yield to the Senator from Iowa or anyone who is going to \nspeak.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Does the Senator from Minnesota want some time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator can wait for the Senator from Iowa. We will \nsave some time for important closing remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, I need to know how much time our side \nhas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I will yield myself such time as I \nmight consume. If anybody on my side would like to have some time, I \nwill be glad to share some time with them.\n  First, I have a philosophical comment based on the history of \nunemployment compensation legislation. We have set some national \npolicy, but the details of our unemployment compensation regime \nhistorically--and I think I would be referring to six or seven decades \nof American history--have been left to the States to fill in the \ndetails. That is because we were then and still are a Nation that is \nvery geographically vast and a country where our population is very \nheterogeneous--more so now than 70 years ago--to a point where Members \nof Congress and Presidents have felt it would be wrong to pour one mold \nin Washington, DC, that we would call an unemployment compensation \ninsurance mold and have our country, which varies from one State to \nanother--and the needs of one State to another, consequently, vary--\nthat it would be wrong to pour that mold in Washington and force every \nState to treat unemployed workers exactly the same way.\n  All knowledge doesn't repose here in Washington, DC. There is a great \ndeal of knowledge--maybe more so--with the State legislators than in \nWashington, DC. Consequently, we have left it to the wisdom of a lot of \nStates to do, in a sense, their own thing with the broad Federal \npolicy--how to treat and compensate the safety net of unemployment \ninsurance. Now we have this approach, which I would not characterize as \nfederalizing unemployment compensation, but obviously it federalizes to \na much greater extent than we have right now the unemployment \ncompensation legislation.\n  Again, we are going to say--if we adopt this--that there is more \nwisdom in Washington, DC, and in the Congress of the U.S. than in the \nNew York legislature or the Illinois legislature as to how unemployed \npeople in those States ought to be treated or compensated, et cetera. I \noppose this amendment on that philosophical ground. But to be more \nspecific, as an example of the wisdom that the Senator from Illinois is \nsaying through his amendment that he knows better how part-time workers \nought to be treated than the State legislatures do. Several States do \nallow part-time workers to be covered. My State of Iowa is one of those \nStates that has decided to cover part-time workers.\n  So the legislature of my State, a very small State of 3 million \npeople, with a low unemployment rate of 3 and a half percent right \nnow--you might think, what is there about the Iowa legislature that \nthey would cover part-time workers and some other larger State might \nnot. Why did we leave it to the people of my State, the elected \nlegislators, to make that determination? Why is not important. The fact \nis they did it. They did it because Congress, over several decades, has \nsaid we are going to leave that decision to the State legislatures.\n\n  Why do we think that we have all the answers here in Washington, DC? \nSo it is fair to say that part-time workers are already eligible for \nunemployment benefits because there are no States that disqualify \nunemployed workers merely because they work part time. The issue is \nwhether part-time workers should be allowed to collect unemployment \nbenefits while refusing to accept a full-time job. If a job is \navailable, why should any worker collect unemployment instead of going \nback to work? Part-time workers--in other words, if there is a job \navailable--should not be on unemployment compensation. Unemployment \ncompensation is not an incentive to keep you out of the workforce. It \nis historically--and rightfully so--to tide you over from a period of \nbeing disconnected with one job until you get back to that job, or \nuntil you have an opportunity to take a job someplace else.\n  Part-time workers are not entitled to benefits simply because their \nemployer paid unemployment taxes. Employers pay unemployment taxes on \nnumerous categories of workers who are not entitled to benefits, for \nthat matter. Such categories would include corporate officers, full-\ntime students, professional athletes, workers who quit their jobs, \nworkers who are not seeking work,\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nworkers who are not available for work, and workers who even refuse \nsuitable work. There are a number of States that allow workers to limit \ntheir job search to part-time employment and still collect unemployment \ncompensation. If that is what that State decides it wants to do, let \nthat State do it accordingly.\n  However, this is voluntary State decision. The Federal Government has \nnever dictated such eligibility standards to the States. There is no \nneed for Congress to preempt State decisions on this matter. Expanding \neligibility on the basis of part-time work would create new \nadministrative burdens on the respective States. The States would have \nto decide what hours of the day and what days of the week are suitable \nfor part-time work. As an example, if a worker loses his Monday, \nTuesday, Wednesday, noon to 3 p.m. cashier job, can that person still \ncollect unemployment benefits if he refuses to accept a Thursday, \nFriday, Saturday 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. cashier job?\n  So State unemployment agencies, right now, lack the resources that it \ntakes to investigate contested claims, like I just described, and \nothers that are too numerous to describe at this point. Thus, it is for \nthat administrative body to make accurate determinations so that you \nhave the enforcement of the unemployment compensation laws done in a \nfair way. That is why it is wrong, it seems to me, to establish this \npolicy, as if Congress knows what is best for the 50 States and knows \nthat it can be enforced in a certain way, or let the individual State \nlegislatures make the determination on how they want to expand their \nunemployment compensation laws, and at the same time they will know \nwhether or not they have the administrative capability of enforcing the \nlaw the way the State legislature put it.\n  Case law for part-time workers is going to take years to develop. It \nis not going to take years in Iowa because we have that decision made \nand there is a lot of case law there right now. Most part-time workers \nlive with other workers. Thirty-five percent are married with a working \nspouse. Thirty percent of these part-time workers are children with \nworking parents. Most of the time when workers live with another \nworker, they will have less incentive to seek new employment--a factor \nthat should be taken into consideration when you start to cover a new \nclass of people at the Federal level without letting the States make \nthat determination. One of the premises of unemployment compensation \nfor anybody is that you be actively seeking a job, that you are out \nthere going door to door to put in your application, asking if there \nare any vacancies, and to try to benefit yourself during a process in \nwhich you are being helped by the unemployment compensation regime to \nmake sure that you have basic necessities while you are trying to make \nthis determination. It is not meant to pay people who are not actively \nseeking jobs.\n\n  So there ought to be some relationship between those and the extent \nto which we include part-time workers. Without the State making that \ndetermination, there might not be that continued relationship that is a \nbasic philosophical underpinning of our unemployment compensation laws.\n  It seems to me that if we allow this disincentive in accepting new \nemployment, this will lead to longer and more frequent spells of \nunemployment, more Government spending, and, in the process, reduced \neconomic growth because economic growth is directly related to the \nproductivity of the workers.\n  Moreover, the provision we are discussing will allow full-time \nworkers to switch to part-time status for unemployment purposes. This \nwill result in even more unemployment and further loss of economic \noutput.\n  At this point, I am going to yield the floor for colleagues, but I \nhave only spoken to one part of the Durbin amendment, that part dealing \nwith covering part-time workers. There are other parts to it, but I \nthink my underlying philosophical objection will apply to all parts: \nthat all knowledge on unemployment compensation does not rest in the \nCongress of the United States. We have had this seven-decade tradition \nof leaving it to the States to fill in the details.\n  This amendment departs from that tradition. Why should we depart from \nthat tradition? We are departing during a time of 5.8-percent \nunemployment. We did not depart to this extent when we had 10- and 12-\npercent unemployment, or at least on all these parts that the Senator \nfrom Illinois will try to change. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I cannot do this in a minute, but I \nwill try.\n  My colleague from Iowa is grasping at straws. This is not about \nStates rights; it is about workers' rights. This is about helping in \nMinnesota 217,218 workers. This is about helping working poor part-time \nworkers.\n  My phone is not ringing off the hook. In fact, we talked to people \nback home at the State level. Our State governments are not telling us \ndo not give us additional help on unemployment insurance. There is no \nadditional expenditure for the States. States are asking for the help. \nThis is a matter of workers' rights. This is a matter of helping part-\ntime workers, the working poor people, who then consume more which \nhelps the economy. It is win-win-win.\n  I doubt whether Senators are getting a lot of pressure from the \nworking families in their States, much less State officials, saying: \nPlease, do not help us with unemployment insurance with people flat on \ntheir backs through no fault of their own.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes forty-five seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise to support the Durbin \namendment, and I will follow up on what the Senator from Minnesota said \nin two other ways. No. 1, this amendment is truly a stimulative \namendment. Every dollar that will be paid out at no expense to our \nStates will help thousands of people who are unemployed and \nunderemployed by giving them a chance to collect some income while they \nlook for other work and get back into the workforce. Every single \ndollar is basically going to be circulated back into our economy.\n  This amendment, as much as it is for unemployed workers, is for \ngrocery stores, for restaurants, and for drugstores. It is for \nbusinesses, small businesses in Louisiana, in Illinois, in Minnesota, \nand in Iowa where the businesspeople are struggling. Why? Because no \none is walking into their restaurants to buy the meal or to buy the \nitem.\n  When we give, through unemployment benefits, dollars for our \nconstituents, what will they do with them? They are not going to put it \nin their savings account. They most certainly are not going to buy \nstock. They are going to spend the money at the local restaurant, at \nthe local drugstore, and at the local cleaners. That is why this effort \nhelps us get our economy back. When consumers spend more money, then \nthose business owners will hire another person or two and more people \nwill get back to work.\n  No. 2, extending these benefits only helps our States. We are picking \nup the tab for it. Does it cost something? Yes. Is it somewhat \nexpensive? Yes. But we can most certainly afford to help our States at \nthis time since the loss is not due to anything they have done but due \nto the terrorist attacks and other factors that have affected our \neconomy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, how much time do we have remaining on \nthis side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes eighteen seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Grassley, \nfor his statement. I will make a couple of points and echo some of the \nthings he said.\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\n  One point my colleague did not mention was how much this is going to \ncost. I have heard some people say this will cost $8 billion. I have \nheard other estimates that it will cost $10 billion.\n  I ask my colleague from Illinois, is that $15 billion in addition to \nthe underlying amendment or $15 billion total? He is indicating it is \nin addition. Am I correct, in addition?\n  I do not know, and I will ask my colleague from Illinois if we have a \nCBO estimate on the cost of the amendment. I have not seen it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a moment? I was wrong; it is \n$15 billion total, not in addition to the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If my memory serves me correctly, the Daschle amendment \nhas an unemployment extension of 13 weeks, and that is about $8 \nbillion, I believe. The cost of this is $15 billion. This amendment \ncosts a lot of money, as can be expected, because when we hear people \nsay it is going to benefit thousands of our constituents, from where is \nthe money coming? It is coming from the Federal Government.\n  This is primarily a State program. We have to decide: Are we going to \nhave the Federal Government take over State management of this program? \nThat is what we are doing with this amendment.\n\n  This amendment determines what quarter or what eligibility period. In \nthe past, States have always determined that. So we are going to tell \nevery Governor: You are going to have to use the last quarter. We have \nnot done that in the past. We are going to tell them: This is the \nquarter to use to determine eligibility and, incidentally, States, you \ncould have provided assistance to temporary workers if you so chose, \nbut now we are telling you you have to provide that assistance.\n  How do we define ``temporary''? My daughter is a senior at Oklahoma \nState University. She works X number of hours a week. That is \ntemporary. It is not 40 hours a week; it is less than 40 hours. Is she \neligible? I think she would be. She might be very displeased with my \nvote in just a moment.\n  This amendment costs a lot of money. A temporary worker is going to \nbe eligible to receive the same weekly benefits as a full-time worker. \nWeekly benefits in New York are a whole lot more than in Oklahoma or a \nwhole lot more than in North Dakota.\n  In some States, unemployment benefits are as low as $105 and some are \n$400. I believe New York is closer to $400, and I believe some States \nare only over $100. Yet we are going to tell those States not only that \nthey have to increase their benefit by at least 15 percent and/or $25, \nwhichever is greater but, yes, now it applies to temporary employees. \nDo those temporary employees work 10 hours a week, 20 hours a week, 4 \nhours a week? How far are we going to go in micromanaging who is \neligible?\n  We are going to take a program primarily financed by the States--\nStates have always determined eligibility; States have always \ndetermined benefits--and we are going to adjust those figures and say \nUncle Sam is going to pick it all up and it is going to cost $15 \nbillion.\n  I have serious reservations about that. I do not know that my \ndaughter who is working part time to go to school should be qualifying \nfor unemployment compensation. I do not think that is right. If the \nFederal Government assists her if she gets a student loan to go to \nschool, that is one way. I do not think the unemployment system is the \nway we should be financing full-time students through part-time work. I \nthink she would be eligible under this proposal. I do not think that is \nright.\n  I do not think it is right for us to use the guise of a so-called \nstimulus package and say let's just expand the program greatly beyond \nwhat most States have done. Most States do not pay unemployment \ncompensation for part-time workers. They decided that. They have a \nState legislature. They meet on this issue. They know how much it \ncosts, and yet we are going to do it very quickly and there are \nprobably not three Senators who know how much this will cost.\n  We are going to tell the States they have to do it.\n  I think it is a serious mistake. I urge my colleagues to vote no on \nthe amendment.\n  To alert my colleagues, I am going to make a budget point of order \nafter the conclusion of the debate.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How much time is remaining on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time remaining.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, since September 11, our Nation's \nworkers have come together in the face of new challenges. Today, more \nthan 8 million of these workers are unemployed and the unemployment \nrate is 5.8 percent and expected to climb to 6.5 percent. We need an \neffective economic recovery package to bring the unemployment rate down \nand help laid-off workers across the Nation.\n  We see more layoffs every day. United Airlines has laid off nearly \n20,000 people since October. Lucent Technologies in North Andover, MA, \nrecently laid off 1,700 workers. Toys R Us has just announced they were \nclosing more than 60 stores and laying off 1,900 employees.\n  Some say the recession's end is near and recovery is around the \ncorner. Even if those predictions come true, the consequences will \nlinger for working families.\n  The unemployment rate will continue to rise. Laid-off workers will \nstill have great difficulty finding new jobs, and other workers may \nstill be facing layoffs.\n  More than 58,000 laid-off Massachusetts workers have exhausted their \nbenefits in the last twelve months. This includes workers like \nChristina Young of Billerica, MA. Christina was laid off at the end of \nJune and, since then she has been looking for a new job. She recently \nlearned that she is pregnant. Christina's unemployment benefits, her \nhusband's income and their savings were keeping them afloat, paying the \nmortgage, the expensive winter heating bills, their bills for health \ncare and groceries. But Christina's unemployment benefits have run out, \nand now she can't afford her pre-natal care.\n  Selma Burgert of Malden, MA was laid off by Polaroid in May and her \nunemployment benefits ran out last month. She has been looking for work \nfor months. But every time she applies for a job, she finds herself \ncompeting with two hundred to three hundred other applicants. She is \nfortunate to have savings to get by. Selma knows many people who aren't \nas fortunate, and have had to sell their homes or cut down on the food \nthey provide for their families.\n  In communities throughout Massachusetts and the Nation, workers like \nChristina and Selma are running out of unemployment benefits while \ncompeting for the dwindling number of open jobs. How long are we going \nto wait before we help them? The time to do it is now. The amendment we \nare debating will make a big difference for these workers.\n  The American people strongly support our efforts to give workers the \nsupport and assistance they deserve. But some of our colleagues in \nCongress have stalled our efforts to help these courageous workers. \nDemocrats have proposed an effective and balanced plan to stimulate the \nfaltering economy, but our opponents have used procedural maneuvers to \nblock the measure. When House and Senate negotiators tried to reach a \ncompromise, our opponents delayed it at every turn.\n\n  They were unwilling to support any recovery package unless it \ncontained tens of billions of dollars for new tax breaks for wealthy \nindividuals and corporations, including $250 million in tax breaks for \nEnron. It makes no sense to hold laid-off workers hostage to such \nirresponsible and costly tax breaks.\n  Our opponents have consistently offered plans that failed the \nnation's workers. They offered a plan to extend unemployment benefits, \nbut only to laid-off workers in a few states. They offered a plan to \nuse National Emergency Grants for unemployment insurance, health care \nand job training, guaranteeing that few funds would actually go to \nunemployment insurance.\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n They offered a plan to provide Reed Act distributions that would \nprimarily be used for State tax cuts and could go into State \nunemployment trust funds, instead of offering new or extended benefits.\n  Our amendment demonstrates our commitment to helping workers.\n  It updates the unemployment insurance system to meet the urgent needs \nof the economy. By improving unemployment insurance, our amendment both \nstimulates the economy and helps the families who need help the most. \nEvery dollar invested in unemployment insurance boosts the economy by \n$2.15. Unemployment insurance also helps to prevent the loss of even \nmore jobs during a recession.\n  The amendment makes three important changes. First, it extends \nunemployment benefits for 13 weeks for laid-off workers across the \nnation. Second, it expands the coverage to include laid-off part-time \nand low-wage workers who do not currently receive benefits. Third, it \nincreases meager unemployment benefit levels. These changes will help \nnearly four-fifths of laid-off workers who currently are not receiving \nbenefits.\n  Even during good times, about a third of those receiving unemployment \ninsurance exhaust their benefits. During recessions, the number rises.\n  That's why Congress has provided federally-funded extended benefits \nrepeatedly during recessions in the past.\n  Today, more than two million laid-off workers have already exhausted \ntheir benefits. How much longer are we going to wait before we help \nthose workers? The time to help them is now.\n  Although part-time and low-wage workers are least likely to have \nsavings and other safety-nets to help them, few are eligible for \nunemployment benefits. Laid-off part-time and low-wage workers have \npaid into the system, but they often fail to receive the benefits they \nneed. Recent data suggest that only 18 percent of unemployed low-wage \nworkers were collecting benefits. Expanding coverage will benefit more \nthan 600,000 additional unemployed part-time and low-wage workers. The \ntime to do it is now.\n  It is also time to increase weekly unemployment benefits by the \ngreater of $25 a week, or 15 percent.\n  This increase in benefits, an average of $150 a month, will be an \nimmediate stimulus to the economy. Unemployed households will spend it \nto pay the rent or a medical bill, buy groceries, keep the family car \nrunning, or hire a babysitter during job interviews.\n  Currently, unemployment benefits do not replace enough lost wages to \nkeep workers out of poverty. In 2000, the national average unemployment \nbenefit only replaced 33 percent of workers' lost income, a major \nreduction from the 46 percent of workers' wages replaced by jobless \nbenefits during the recessions of the 1970's and 1980's. During an \neconomic crisis, unemployed workers have few opportunities to rejoin a \ndeclining workforce. They depend on unemployment benefits. Adding $150 \na month to unemployment benefits will stimulate the economy and help \nthese laid-off workers support their families while they look for a new \njob.\n  More than three hundred thousand laid-off workers in Massachusetts \nwould benefit from this amendment. At least thirteen million laid-off \nworkers would benefit nationwide.\n  The American public is ready for honest action that genuinely helps \nthese deserving workers. We passed an airline security bill, without \nproviding any help for workers. We adjourned for the recess without \nproviding any help for workers. We owe it to the millions of Americans \nwho have lost their jobs to act now to provide the support they need \nand deserve.\n  In conclusion, Madam President, at the time of September 11, I think \nmost of us believed there was a new spirit and a new atmosphere in this \ncountry. We have tried to respond to those who lost loved ones. We have \nseen generosity in reaching out to families all over this country. \nThere is a new spirit in America for people who are hurting and are in \nneed.\n  What we are talking about today are men and women who have lost their \njobs, often as a result of the terrorist acts. There are other \nincidents where they might not be directly related, but by and large it \nis as a result of the terrorist attack. In this Senate, we hear Members \nnickel and dime American workers who work hard, play by the rules, put \nin a good day's work, and as a result of economic conditions have lost \ntheir jobs.\n  There is $38 billion that has been paid into a fund that otherwise \nwould have gone to workers' salaries. That fund is out there, and we \nare using $15 billion. We used it four times in the 1990s, with seldom \nless than 90 votes--or 80 votes in the Senate. We are reaching out to \npart-time workers and low-income workers. They, too, have paid into \nthat fund. The money is there for this kind of circumstance. It is \nthere for the Federal Government to act.\n  Why? Because in many of these States there is an economic pinching. \nThey cannot afford to take the kind of economic action, and that is why \nthis program was developed. Now is the time to take the action. Let us \nnot nickel and dime America's workers who have suffered as a result of \nthe kinds of attacks we saw on this country. That is what this is \nabout. Are we going to stand up for those men and women who want to \nwork and should be able to work? This is what the Durbin amendment is \nabout, and I look forward to supporting it.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is not a State rights issue. It is all Federal \nmoney. The Governor of Oklahoma can decline the money. They do not have \nto help the 78,000 unemployed workers in Oklahoma who would be \nbenefited by this. They can exert their State rights. They would be \nfools to do it because they know these people need a helping hand in \nIowa, in Oklahoma, and in Illinois.\n  I really am saddened to hear the stereotype that unemployed people \nare lazy. Could any of us live on $1,000 a month? That is what these \npeople are struggling to get by with. To give them $25 a week is the \nbreaking point for too many Senators. Way too much, $25 a week?

Madam President, just as a note to all Senators, we expect \nto have another vote very soon.\n  I would be happy to yield to my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Nevada. I would like to announce \nto the Senate that 57 votes were cast on this last amendment. Three \nmembers on the Democratic side were absent because of business they had \nto attend. It is my intention to reoffer this amendment later in the \ndebate on this economic stimulus package.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I also want to extend my appreciation to \nthe minority. We could have, through procedural means, gotten another \nvote on this anyway. But rather than go through all of that and waste \nthe time of the Senate, we were told the Senator from Illinois could \nreoffer his amendment. I very much appreciate that.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2717\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be 15 minutes for debate prior to \na vote in relation to the Bond amendment No. 2717 with the time divided \nas follows: 10 minutes for Senator Bond, and 5 minutes for those who \noppose the Bond amendment; and, at that time there be a vote in \nrelation to that amendment with no amendments in order prior to that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nunderstand there are a couple more people on our side who wish to \ndebate the issue. The chairman of the Finance Committee just suggested \n30 minutes on each side. I know the Senator is also trying to work this \naround the two lunches. If he could modify his request and have 30 \nminutes on each side, that would be great.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest to my friend that maybe we ought to have 20 \nminutes on your side and 10 minutes on our side. In that way, we could \nbe finished at a reasonable time for the conferences, which are kind of \nimportant today.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will not object to that.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I amend my unanimous consent request to \nallow the Bond proponents to have 20 minutes and the opposition to have \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague. I say \nto my colleagues who said they wanted to speak on the amendment, we \nwill now have a vote on the Bond-Collins amendment at 12:35. If they \nstill wish to speak, they need to be coming to the Chamber shortly. I \nthank my friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes from the time \nallotted on the amendment on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am very pleased to join the Senator \nfrom Missouri in strong support of this amendment to help our small \nbusinesses. Over 95 percent of the businesses in this Nation qualify as \nsmall businesses. They are the businesses that are creating the vast \nmajority of new jobs. Small businesses are the engine of our economy \nand the backbone of virtually every community in our country. Yet the \neconomic stimulus package put forth by the majority leader does \nvirtually nothing to stimulate this essential part of our economy. The \nBond-Collins amendment would rectify this omission by allowing small \nbusinesses to expense up to $40,000 worth of new equipment that they \nplaced in service this year, or will next year. That would give a real \nboost to the economy, and it would encourage those small companies that \nhave put investment plans on hold, in the wake of the attacks on our \nNation and the economic downturn, to proceed with their investment \nplans. That, in turn, would stimulate the production of more equipment \nand the creation of new jobs.\n  Let me give you an example from my home State of Maine of the \npositive impact that this amendment would have.\n  Terry Skillin, of Skillins Greenhouses, is a fourth-generation Maine \nfamily business, founded in 1885. Skillins employs between 70 and 120 \nemployees, depending on the season, for its landscaping, greenhouse, \nand floral business.\n  Terry Skillins told me that his company is looking to expand but to \ndo so takes money. From tractors to conveyor belts to machines that \nbuild flowerpots automatically, the equipment that he needs to buy is \nexpensive. Terry said that raising the small business expense limit to \n$40,000 would help enormously, by allowing him to go ahead with a \nplanned expansion.\n  Terry said something else that I think is very important and that we \nneed to remember. He said it is critical that the increased expensing \nbe available not only for the remainder of this year but for next year \nas well. He told me that it often takes more than one year for a small \nbusiness to carry out an expansion plan, and that if the increased \nexpensing were available for two years, his ability to grow Skillins \nGreenhouses over the entire period would be far greater.\n  I think we should heed Terry's advice and help small businesses so \nthey can drive our economy back to prosperity.\n  It seems to me that, if we are striving to reach a consensus on the \neconomic recovery package, as I believe we must do, we should include \nan amendment that is specifically targeted to helping our small \nbusinesses pull through this difficult time. Our amendment has been \nendorsed by the Nation's largest small business group, the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses. The NFIB represents 600,000 \nmembers nationwide and is key-voting this amendment.\n  Finally, I note that the idea of an expansion in the small business \nexpensing provision has been common to many of the economic recovery \nplans that we have debated. It was part of both plans passed by the \nHouse of Representatives. It was included in the Centrist Coalition \nplan that six Members--three Members on each side of the aisle--\nnegotiated this past December. It was also included in the Democrats' \nplan, which was supported by the Senate Finance Committee. \nUnfortunately, however, it is not in the plan before us.\n  The Bond-Collins amendment would seek to remedy that omission by \nproviding the boost to small businesses. I am convinced that if we give \ntax incentive to small businesses, they will help to pull us through \nthese difficult economic times. Again, it is small businesses that \ncreate the vast majority of new jobs in this country, and we need to \ngive them the incentives they need to help boost our economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my 5 minutes, reserving time for our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spoken to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. Senator Nickles indicated there were people from the \nother side who wanted to speak for maybe more\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\nthan the 20 minutes. We have 10 minutes. At this date we don't find \nanyone in opposition to the amendment. So if you need more time, we \nwill be happy to give you some of ours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, seeing no one ready to speak from the \nother side, I will yield myself such time as I may consume. I urge my \ncolleagues who want to speak on the amendment to hurry up and get down \nhere. We have lots of work to do, and we are going to be able to finish \ndebate on this amendment fairly expeditiously. Anybody who wants to say \nanything about it, we invite them to come.\n  As my colleague and strong ally, the Senator from Maine, has said, \nthis amendment is very important to help small businesses in their \nrecovery. We know the entire economy took a severe hit on September 11, \non top of a recession that has really taken its toll on many small \nbusinesses. How we get out of this recession is to encourage small \nbusinesses to lead us out.\n  Small businesses are the dynamic engine that drives the economy. They \nprovide 75 percent of all new jobs. They are the ones that grow when \nthe rest of the economy is stagnant. There is no better vehicle than a \nstimulus package to include a provision to encourage small businesses \nto purchase more equipment. This amendment provides a direct stimulus \nto that small business sector by allowing them to write off new \nequipment purchases immediately.\n  If you have ever run a small business, as I have, you know the \nthought of having to set up a depreciation schedule for a tractor or a \npiece of equipment and figure out how to depreciate it over several \nyears is a daunting task. If you are a small business person, you don't \nwant to have to have an accounting department. It is usually you and \nthe frog in your pocket who are running the business. If you are an \nindividual proprietor or even if you have several employees, you don't \nwant to go through the time and expense of hiring somebody to set up a \ndepreciation schedule. So direct expenses would allow small businesses \nto avoid the complexity of depreciation rules as well as the \nunrealistic recovery period for most assets.\n\n  For example, under current law, if you buy a computer, it has to be \ndepreciated over 5 years. People who are very active users of computers \ntell me that the useful life is 2 to 3 years at best. Something new and \nsomething better has come out, but you are still depreciating the old \nequipment. You haven't been able to write it off on your taxes.\n  This amendment has several important advantages, especially in light \nof the current economic conditions. By allowing more equipment \npurchased to be deducted currently, right now, the year they are put in \nservice, it will provide much-needed capital for small business. With \nthat freed up capital, a business can invest in new equipment which \nwill benefit the small enterprise, but in turn it will stimulate other \nindustries that are producing and selling the equipment they are going \nto put in service.\n  Moreover, new equipment will contribute to continued productivity \ngrowth in the business community which Federal Reserve Chairman \nGreenspan has repeatedly stressed is essential to the long-term \nvitality and health of our economy.\n  That is what allows us to hire more people and pay better wages--to \nincrease productivity. A healthy and growing business keeps its \nemployees working, and we hope it will lead to new employees being \nadded to the payroll.\n  Finally, the amendment will simplify the tax law for countless small \nbusinesses. Greater expensing means less equipment subject to onerous \ndepreciation. Under this amendment, a business would be able to claim \nthe full $40,000 in expensing if it purchased and put in service no \nmore than $325,000 of property during the year. That is to make sure it \napplies primarily to small business.\n  In short, this amendment's equipment expensing changes are a win-win \nfor small business consumers, employees of small businesses, equipment \nmanufacturers, and our national economy.\n  Some have contended that maybe we ought to think about this only for \n1 year. We need to give small businesses not only an initial boost, but \nwe need to keep the support coming to sustain the recovery. If we use \nthe last recession of 1991 as an example, it took 21 months before the \nunemployment rates started to drop consistently. That is nearly 2 years \nfor small businesses and others to hire the people back who were laid \noff in the recession. Small businesses represent 99 percent of all \nemployers. They provide about 75 percent of the net new jobs. And with \npeople unemployed, we need to get those producers of the new jobs, the \nsmall businesses, into business.\n  Based on this unemployment data, limiting the amendment or any other \nsmall business stimulus to 1 year would not suffice. We need to keep \nthe small business stimulus going for at least 2 years to ensure the \nrecovery in the small business sector and the jobs market is sustained.\n  Madam President, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and \nurge them, if they want to support the amendment Senator Collins and \nmany other Senators and I have supported, to come to the Chamber. If \nthey have arguments against it, we will be interested in hearing those \nas well.\n  I yield such time as he may require to the distinguished minority \nwhip.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to compliment my colleagues, \nSenators Collins and Bond, for their leadership and persistence in \nsaying, let's get something in this bill to help create jobs. Both \nSenators Bond and Collins have spoken of the growth in small business \nand the need for small business to be able to grow. This particular \nprovision will create jobs. I compliment them.\n  I don't see much in the underlying proposal that will create jobs. \nThis one will create jobs because small business will be able to \nexpense more items up to $40,000. For a person who has a small business \nthat may have a few employees, that is a big deal. I used to have a \njanitor's service. It was my wife and myself and a few other people. If \nyou allow me to expense everything, I don't have to amortize all the \nequipment I am purchasing because, frankly, it is less than $40,000.\n  You get to expense it. You get to write it off when you write the \ncheck. Instead of spreading it out over several years, instead of \ntaking 3, 5, 8 years to recoup your investments, you can recoup it in \nthe year that you made the investment. That is a big deal for small \nbusiness. Most of the jobs that will be created this year will be in \nsmall business. It is not going to be General Motors or in the big \ncorporations, it is going to be in small business. You are saying, \nlet's expense up to $40,000, an improvement from $24,000.\n  It is an excellent amendment. It will help small business. By helping \nsmall business, we will be able to create more jobs.\n  I thank both of my colleagues for their leadership. I believe this \namendment is going to pass. I compliment them for that. This is one of \nthe few things we have seen that will actually stimulate the economy. \nWe have seen a lot of proposals. Let's write more checks, let's give \npeople money who didn't pay taxes, expand unemployment compensation, \npay people more not for working. This is a proposal that says, let's \ncreate an environment that will create jobs so people won't need \nunemployment compensation, so they won't be asking more from the \nGovernment. They will be getting a job.\n  I thank my colleagues for their excellent proposal. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis kind comments. The Senator from Oklahoma brought up a very \nimportant point. It is very burdensome recordkeeping for small \nbusinesses to have to deal with depreciation schedules and sometimes \nvery unrealistic recovery periods.\n  For example, most computers are required to be depreciated over a 5-\nyear period, but we all know from our experience that the usual life of \na computer is 2 to 3 years. The Senator from Oklahoma has raised an \nimportant point. Not only will this put more cash into the pockets of \nsmall businesses and\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nallow them to go ahead with investments that have been put on hold \nbecause of this tax incentive, but it will also relieve them from some \nvery burdensome recordkeeping requirements. That simplification is \nanother advantage of the Bond-Collins amendment.\n  I thank my colleague from Missouri who does such a great job as the \nranking minority member of the Senate Small Business Committee. It has \nbeen a great pleasure to work with him on this amendment. I believe \nthis is the one provision we have debated that will make a real \ndifference to those entrepreneurs throughout our country, to those \nsmall mom-and-pop firms that are creating good jobs in communities \nthroughout our country. So I hope we will have a strong show of support \nfor this amendment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I gather there are no more people seeking \nto speak on this amendment. Rather than wait, we can vote. But first, I \nthank my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, a real champion of \nmaking the economy grow by putting people back to work, and Senator \nCollins has been one of our great allies. Anytime I have a small \nbusiness provision, she wants to be a champion of it because she knows \nsmall businesses are driving the Maine economy, as well as in the rest \nof the country.\n  We are prepared to yield back all time on this side. I ask for the \nyeas and nays on this amendment.\n  Mr. DAYTON. We yield back all our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Is there a \nsufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from California (Mrs. Boxer), and the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign), \nthe Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Gregg), the Senator from Oklahoma \n(Mr. Inhofe), the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Thompson), and the \nSenator from Montana (Mr. Burns) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Inhofe) and the Senator from Montana (Mr. Burns) would \neach vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, on behalf of the Republican leader, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I am disappointed to hear objection to \npassing a bipartisan bill to help family farmers. We spent a great deal \nof time last year trying to pass a farm bill. I supported that effort. \nI support reviving that effort again this year.\n  The legislation that I am trying to pass today is also aimed at \nhelping ailing family farmers. The bill would extend chapter 12 of the \nbankruptcy code for 6 additional months. Chapter 12 offers expedited \nbankruptcy procedures for family farmers in an effort to accommodate \ntheir special needs. It was first enacted in 1986. It has been extended \nseveral times since then--most recently earlier this year.\n  The provisions of chapter 12 allow family farmers to reorganize their \ndebts as opposed to liquidating their assets. These provisions can be \ninvaluable to farmers struggling to stay in business during difficult \ntimes. Unfortunately, chapter 12 expired on October 1 last year.\n  My bill seeks to extend these provisions for six additional months \nand to reinstate them retroactively to the date when they expired. \nRetroactivity will ensure that there are no gaps in availability of \nthese procedures. I hope this will be the last extension that is \nnecessary.\n  The larger bankruptcy reform bill that is currently pending before a \nHouse-Senate conference committee includes a permanent extension of \nchapter 12. Nevertheless, American family farmers should not have to \nwait for us to complete our work on the bankruptcy reform bill. The \nvery least we can do to assist farmers now is to reenact these \nnoncontroversial procedures. That is why I am so puzzled by this \nanonymous objection.\n\n  Legislation extending these provisions passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 408 to 2 last year and subsequently passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent. The Judiciary Committee unanimously \nreported the bill I am seeking to pass today on a voice vote. \nFurthermore, the bill has several bipartisan cosponsors, including my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator Kit Bond; the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Leahy; and the lead sponsor of the Senate \nbankruptcy reform bill, Senator Grassley.\n  I urge any Senator who has any concern about this bill to speak with \nme. I will be more than happy to work to address any issues my \ncolleagues may have in an effort to secure expedited passage of this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I understand it, the pending business \nbefore the floor is amendment No. 2719, offered yesterday by Senator \nReid on this Senator's behalf. I rise to speak for a few minutes on \nthat amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for giving me the courtesy of going \nfirst because of the time schedule I have this afternoon.\n  Senator Baucus and Senator Daschle have provided great leadership on \nthis important issue of the stimulus. There is one part of the \namendment that is before us that is vitally important to all of our \nStates as we are facing this downturn in the economy. That part of the \namendment deals with the Federal share for Medicaid recipients in the \nStates. It is called FMAP, the Federal Match for Medicaid Program.\n  Under the provision in the underlying Daschle amendment, and under \nthe leadership of Senator Baucus, they did provide for three things. \nThey provided a 1.5-percent increase to every State in their 2002 \nFederal match for Medicaid. That would provide about $3.5 billion in \nadditional Federal Medicaid payments to the States.\n  I have a chart which shows what that would mean for every State and \nwhat my amendment would mean for every State. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this chart be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Baucus and Senator Daschle, by their amendment, \nput in a 1.5-percent increase to all States.\n  The second part was, because of unemployment measures previously \ncalculated, some States were scheduled to go down in 2002 in their \nFederal match. The amendment before us under Senator Baucus holds those \nStates harmless. That is about 29 States that would have lost money \nthis year. And under the Baucus amendment, they are held harmless.\n  The third part is that States with high unemployment would receive an \nadditional 1.5 percent in their 2002 Federal match. This would provide \nassistance to about 16 States that have very high rates of \nunemployment. This policy proposal is extremely important for the \nStates.\n  The pending amendment I have offered would only change one part of \nthat. It would take the 1.5-percent increase for all States and \nincrease it to 3 percent. In other words, it would add 1.5 percent to \nthe Federal match for all States. I believe that is important because \nwhen the committee developed this bill and the stimulus package, the \nNational Association of State Budget Officers had predicted a $15 \nbillion shortfall for the States for 2002. That was last fall. By the \nend of the year, the National Association of State Budget Officers had \nupdated their prediction for the shortfalls in our State budgets to $38 \nbillion--in other words, double. I have heard from my Governor --and I \nknow others have heard from their Governors and their legislatures--\nabout the cuts they are going to have to make in their State budgets.\n  The problem is, one of the places where they have to cut, because \nthat is the biggest pot for most States, is Medicaid. If a State cuts \n$1 out of their budget on Medicaid, they may lose $2 or $3 or $4 of \nFederal money. I don't\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nknow what it is for the Presiding Officer's State, and I don't know \nwhat the Medicaid match is there. I do know in Iowa it is about 3 to 1. \nSo that for every dollar the State would not have in their budget for \nMedicaid, they would lose $3 of Federal money. It isn't only that the \nState cuts its Medicaid budget by $1 and hurts one Medicaid recipient. \nIf it cuts Medicaid by $1, it is hurting three or four times as many \npeople. It has that kind of a multiplier effect.\n  While I am very supportive of what Chairman Baucus and Senator \nDaschle have done, we recognize now that these new projections of the \nshortfalls in our State budgets command us to put more into the program \nof reaching these States for their Federal match.\n  On the other two aspects of the amendment, on the one that holds \nStates harmless, that is still in my amendment. And on the other one \nthat provides the 1.5-percent increase to the States with unusually \nhigh unemployment, that is there also. I wanted to make sure that every \nState received the amount of Federal matching money they need.\n  Again, another reason why this is so important is because most States \nhave a requirement in their Constitution that they have to balance \ntheir budgets. It is a constitutional requirement. They can't get \naround it. When they start cutting, if they do across-the-board cuts, \nwhich seems at first blush to be the most logical, they just do a \nstraight percentage across-the-board cut, Medicaid, being the biggest \npart of the State budget, gets whacked the most. Then they lose the \nFederal dollars that come in as a match.\n  I believe this is critically important for our States. I also believe \nState fiscal relief is one of the best ways to stimulate the economy. \nThe Federal dollars we send out for Medicaid help to avert State budget \ncuts or tax increases that could be detrimental to the States in any \neconomic recovery.\n\n  People in my State of Iowa and all across the Nation have enough \ntrouble finding affordable, quality health care. They need our help and \nsupport during this recession. When it comes to protecting the \nvulnerable in these difficult times and getting our economy back on \ntrack, putting Iowans and all Americans back to work, it is critically \nimportant that we make sure that those who are out of work--they may \nhave lost their jobs; Medicaid may be the only source of health care \nfor them and their kids during this period of time, and then looking at \nthe States and facing the budget crunches they have--it became clear \nthat we had to add a little bit more money to this effort.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for focusing on this issue as he has done \nand for the work he has done in putting in that 1.5 percent. It has \nbecome clear in the last few weeks that the States are going to need \nmore than 1.5 percent.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not know if there are any Senators \nwho wish to debate the current amendment. At the appropriate time, I \nwill ask the Senator from Iowa to acknowledge there is no more debate \nso we can set aside his amendment and go to the regular order.\n  The Senator raises a very important point that in the last 2 years, \nStates' economies have generally deteriorated. As a consequence, there \nis more pressure on their Medicaid budgets. States are losing revenue. \nStates are moving more toward deficit positions. They are not as \nhealthy as they once were.\n  When States begin to cut spending and cut services, there is a \ntendency to cut back a bit on Medicaid programs to balance the State \nbudgets.\n  The Senator is proposing a significant percentage increase in the \nmatches the Federal Government make to States under Medicaid to make up \nthat difference.\n  That so-called difference, the drop, occurs for a second reason. We \nhave very old data. The reimbursement to States under Medicaid is based \non data up through the year 2000. States were doing pretty well in 1999 \nand 2000. So there is a tendency for the reimbursement rate to be out \nof whack, out of sync with the current fiscal situation of the States; \nnamely, tougher times, deteriorating surpluses, sometimes potential \ndeficits. The amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa attempts to \naddress that point.\n  One might question whether the amendment is too rich or not rich \nenough. It is a question of degree. He essentially wants to add 3 \npercent to all States' match and an extra 1.5 percent for States with \nparticularly high unemployment. That is an approach I also took in an \namendment I will be offering later today. Although the approach is the \nsame, the total percentage amount is not quite as high.\n  The percentages in the amendment I will be offering later hold States \nharmless. The percentages offered by the Senator from Iowa, it is my \nunderstanding, in the first year go slightly higher for well-intended \nreasons. I am not going to pass judgment on whether that is a good idea \nor not, but that is the practical effect of that amendment.\n  I do not see anybody else wanting to speak on this amendment. The \nSenator might want to speak some more. Maybe he does not want to speak \nsome more. If not, I ask unanimous consent that, whatever the \nappropriate order, the amendment be set aside and voted on at the \nappropriate time and that the pending business be the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will support the Harkin amendment, No. \n2719, in response to the numerous phone calls and letters I have \nreceived from my constituents in recent years regarding the increasing \ncost of health care. Nevertheless, I am concerned with increasing these \nkinds of mandatory expenditures that are able to bypass the \nconsideration of the Appropriations Committees.\n  While I believe that this Congress should address the rising cost of \nhealth care in the United States, we should avoid band-aid approaches \nand focus our efforts on more comprehensive solutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S204-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S204-S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOPE FOR CHILDREN ACT--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2719\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, the pending business \nbefore the floor is amendment No. 2719, offered yesterday by Senator \nReid on this Senator's behalf. I rise to speak for a few minutes on \nthat amendment.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for giving me the courtesy of going \nfirst because of the time schedule I have this afternoon.\n  Senator Baucus and Senator Daschle have provided great leadership on \nthis important issue of the stimulus. There is one part of the \namendment that is before us that is vitally important to all of our \nStates as we are facing this downturn in the economy. That part of the \namendment deals with the Federal share for Medicaid recipients in the \nStates. It is called FMAP, the Federal Match for Medicaid Program.\n  Under the provision in the underlying Daschle amendment, and under \nthe leadership of Senator Baucus, they did provide for three things. \nThey provided a 1.5-percent increase to every State in their 2002 \nFederal match for Medicaid. That would provide about $3.5 billion in \nadditional Federal Medicaid payments to the States.\n  I have a chart which shows what that would mean for every State and \nwhat my amendment would mean for every State. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this chart be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Baucus and Senator Daschle, by their amendment, \nput in a 1.5-percent increase to all States.\n  The second part was, because of unemployment measures previously \ncalculated, some States were scheduled to go down in 2002 in their \nFederal match. The amendment before us under Senator Baucus holds those \nStates harmless. That is about 29 States that would have lost money \nthis year. And under the Baucus amendment, they are held harmless.\n  The third part is that States with high unemployment would receive an \nadditional 1.5 percent in their 2002 Federal match. This would provide \nassistance to about 16 States that have very high rates of \nunemployment. This policy proposal is extremely important for the \nStates.\n  The pending amendment I have offered would only change one part of \nthat. It would take the 1.5-percent increase for all States and \nincrease it to 3 percent. In other words, it would add 1.5 percent to \nthe Federal match for all States. I believe that is important because \nwhen the committee developed this bill and the stimulus package, the \nNational Association of State Budget Officers had predicted a $15 \nbillion shortfall for the States for 2002. That was last fall. By the \nend of the year, the National Association of State Budget Officers had \nupdated their prediction for the shortfalls in our State budgets to $38 \nbillion--in other words, double. I have heard from my Governor --and I \nknow others have heard from their Governors and their legislatures--\nabout the cuts they are going to have to make in their State budgets.\n  The problem is, one of the places where they have to cut, because \nthat is the biggest pot for most States, is Medicaid. If a State cuts \n$1 out of their budget on Medicaid, they may lose $2 or $3 or $4 of \nFederal money. I don't\n\n[[Page S205]]\n\nknow what it is for the Presiding Officer's State, and I don't know \nwhat the Medicaid match is there. I do know in Iowa it is about 3 to 1. \nSo that for every dollar the State would not have in their budget for \nMedicaid, they would lose $3 of Federal money. It isn't only that the \nState cuts its Medicaid budget by $1 and hurts one Medicaid recipient. \nIf it cuts Medicaid by $1, it is hurting three or four times as many \npeople. It has that kind of a multiplier effect.\n  While I am very supportive of what Chairman Baucus and Senator \nDaschle have done, we recognize now that these new projections of the \nshortfalls in our State budgets command us to put more into the program \nof reaching these States for their Federal match.\n  On the other two aspects of the amendment, on the one that holds \nStates harmless, that is still in my amendment. And on the other one \nthat provides the 1.5-percent increase to the States with unusually \nhigh unemployment, that is there also. I wanted to make sure that every \nState received the amount of Federal matching money they need.\n  Again, another reason why this is so important is because most States \nhave a requirement in their Constitution that they have to balance \ntheir budgets. It is a constitutional requirement. They can't get \naround it. When they start cutting, if they do across-the-board cuts, \nwhich seems at first blush to be the most logical, they just do a \nstraight percentage across-the-board cut, Medicaid, being the biggest \npart of the State budget, gets whacked the most. Then they lose the \nFederal dollars that come in as a match.\n  I believe this is critically important for our States. I also believe \nState fiscal relief is one of the best ways to stimulate the economy. \nThe Federal dollars we send out for Medicaid help to avert State budget \ncuts or tax increases that could be detrimental to the States in any \neconomic recovery.\n\n  People in my State of Iowa and all across the Nation have enough \ntrouble finding affordable, quality health care. They need our help and \nsupport during this recession. When it comes to protecting the \nvulnerable in these difficult times and getting our economy back on \ntrack, putting Iowans and all Americans back to work, it is critically \nimportant that we make sure that those who are out of work--they may \nhave lost their jobs; Medicaid may be the only source of health care \nfor them and their kids during this period of time, and then looking at \nthe States and facing the budget crunches they have--it became clear \nthat we had to add a little bit more money to this effort.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for focusing on this issue as he has done \nand for the work he has done in putting in that 1.5 percent. It has \nbecome clear in the last few weeks that the States are going to need \nmore than 1.5 percent. That is why I have offered this amendment in a \nfriendly manner to ensure that we meet our obligations to the States to \nget the money out there so that these people who are the most \nvulnerable don't fall through the cracks.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I do not know if there are any Senators \nwho wish to debate the current amendment. At the appropriate time, I \nwill ask the Senator from Iowa to acknowledge there is no more debate \nso we can set aside his amendment and go to the regular order.\n  The Senator raises a very important point that in the last 2 years, \nStates' economies have generally deteriorated. As a consequence, there \nis more pressure on their Medicaid budgets. States are losing revenue. \nStates are moving more toward deficit positions. They are not as \nhealthy as they once were.\n  When States begin to cut spending and cut services, there is a \ntendency to cut back a bit on Medicaid programs to balance the State \nbudgets.\n  The Senator is proposing a significant percentage increase in the \nmatches the Federal Government make to States under Medicaid to make up \nthat difference.\n  That so-called difference, the drop, occurs for a second reason. We \nhave very old data. The reimbursement to States under Medicaid is based \non data up through the year 2000. States were doing pretty well in 1999 \nand 2000. So there is a tendency for the reimbursement rate to be out \nof whack, out of sync with the current fiscal situation of the States; \nnamely, tougher times, deteriorating surpluses, sometimes potential \ndeficits. The amendment offered by the Senator from Iowa attempts to \naddress that point.\n  One might question whether the amendment is too rich or not rich \nenough. It is a question of degree. He essentially wants to add 3 \npercent to all States' match and an extra 1.5 percent for States with \nparticularly high unemployment. That is an approach I also took in an \namendment I will be offering later today. Although the approach is the \nsame, the total percentage amount is not quite as high.\n  The percentages in the amendment I will be offering later hold States \nharmless. The percentages offered by the Senator from Iowa, it is my \nunderstanding, in the first year go slightly higher for well-intended \nreasons. I am not going to pass judgment on whether that is a good idea \nor not, but that is the practical effect of that amendment.\n  I do not see anybody else wanting to speak on this amendment. The \nSenator might want to speak some more. Maybe he does not want to speak \nsome more. If not, I ask unanimous consent that, whatever the \nappropriate order, the amendment be set aside and voted on at the \nappropriate time and that the pending business be the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will support the Harkin amendment, No. \n2719, in response to the numerous phone calls and letters I have \nreceived from my constituents in recent years regarding the increasing \ncost of health care. Nevertheless, I am concerned with increasing these \nkinds of mandatory expenditures that are able to bypass the \nconsideration of the Appropriations Committees.\n  While I believe that this Congress should address the rising cost of \nhealth care in the United States, we should avoid band-aid approaches \nand focus our efforts on more comprehensive solutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S206-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND \n                        HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, there was a vote earlier on a small \nbusiness amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. Bond. It \nwas adopted. That shows we are starting to make progress toward an \nagreement on a bill to stimulate economic recovery. That was the small \nbusiness expensing amendment which increased the ceiling amount \navailable for business as to expense.\n  We now have an opportunity to make even more progress by adopting the \nBaucus-Smith amendment. This amendment makes two important \nimprovements: First, it strikes a balance on the bonus depreciation \nissue with a 2-year compromise provision. Second, it will help States \nby increasing the Federal matching payments for Medicaid. As a bonus \ndepreciation, this assistance will be provided for 2 years.\n  Essentially, I am offering an amendment, joined by my good friend \nfrom Oregon, Mr. Smith, to provide for a 2-year bonus depreciation, as \nwell as a 2-year FMAP payment. I will speak first about bonus \ndepreciation.\n  I think we all agree that a strong stimulus bill must create tax \nincentives for business to invest in new equipment. I do not think \nthere is much doubt about that. This amendment creates jobs, lifts the \neconomy, and also increases productivity in the long run. Chairman \nGreenspan and others have talked a lot about productivity. There is not \nmuch doubt that this amendment will help us move in that direction.\n  Everyone agrees on the concept. The debate, however, has been over \nthe details. The proposal before us is a 10-percent bonus. We have \nagreed to increase that to 30 percent. The question now is how long \nshould the incentive last.\n  The Democratic proposal was 1 year; the Republican proposal was 3 \nyears. Our bipartisan compromise amendment, that is the amendment of \nSenator Smith from Oregon and myself, is 2 years. This is not simply an \neffort to split the difference. Instead, if one steps back and thinks \nabout it, a 2-year incentive makes good sense. Three years is too long. \nIt will not encourage business to invest quickly enough. As a result, \nit will not stimulate businesses to act when we most need them to act.\n  On the other hand, in the debate last week, Senator Smith and others \nmade a very good point. They said that a 1-year bonus period might not \nbe long enough because it does not give businesses enough time to make \nsound investment decisions. Let's not forget the investment to qualify \nhas to be in place, in service within the requisite period.\n  We have to assume this legislation will not be enacted before March. \nIf we were to stick to the 1-year period, companies would only have a \nfew months left at that point to make purchases and get assets in \nplace, as we are dealing with the calendar year. That is not time \nenough, especially if we think about the kinds of investments we want \nto encourage, which is airplanes, heavy machinery, equipment used in \nmanufacturing, locomotives, pipelines, and refineries. In many cases, \nthese assets may take longer to build than 1 year, or the contracts for \npurchase may take some time to negotiate. This is a legitimate concern.\n  To address it, our amendment gives companies until December 31, 2003, \nto make their purchases and get assets in place. Even after that, \ncompanies would have an extra year to put the assets in place if they \ntake more than a year to build, so long as they meet a binding contract \ntest.\n  The amendment will provide economic stimulus. It will work quickly, \nand it recognizes business realities and gives companies the time they \nneed to make sound investment decisions. That is the first part of the \namendment.\n  The second part relates to the States. The technical term is FMAP. \nWhat it is about is helping States by temporarily increasing the rate \nat which we match State payments under Medicaid. Let me explain why \nthis is important.\n  Rising Medicaid costs are already contributing to the States' fiscal \ncrisis. Health care costs are increasing rapidly, while rising \nunemployment is increasing the number of people eligible for Medicaid \nservices. Medicaid spending grew by 11 percent last year. It is likely \nto increase even faster this year if current economic and budgetary \nconditions persist.\n  Many States have already implemented or are now considering \nimplementing significant cuts in Medicaid and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, otherwise known as CHIP, in 2003.\n  These cuts would affect thousands of children, elderly, and disabled \npeople. For example, Oklahoma and New Mexico may eliminate their CHIP-\nfunded Medicaid expansions to children entirely.\n  CHIP--that is the State Children's Health Insurance Program--has been \nvery popular. It helps low-income kids get health insurance, health \ninsurance they did not previously have. I think it would be very \nunfortunate if, due to State budget constraints, they either choose to \nor believe they are forced to cut back and, in some cases, eliminate \nthose programs that provide health insurance for children.\n  Tennessee has proposed cutting Medicaid eligibility for 180,000 low-\nincome people in its TennCare Program. Other States will no longer \ncover disabled workers returning to work or low-income women with \nbreast and cervical cancer. These budget cuts and these tax increases \nare based on revenue forecasts that do not assume enactment of bonus \ndepreciation provisions. Because most States tie their own tax \ncollections to the Federal tax system, the additional loss of revenues \nin 2003 that would result from a lengthy bonus depreciation period \nwould increase the likelihood and severity of State actions to cut \nprograms and raise taxes.\n  The underlying amendment would address this problem by providing a \ntemporary 1-year increase in the Federal matching rate under Medicare. \nOur amendment goes a bit further by extending the period for 2 years to \nmatch the depreciation period.\n  By doing so, the amendment ensures the amount of aid provided both to \nStates generally and to individual States in particular, will grow if \nthe recession proves deeper than currently projected. That is the \nsecond part of the amendment.\n  All told, the amendment will help businesses, it will help workers, \nit will help States, and it will help families maintain Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have not fully read the FMAP part of the \ndistinguished Senator's amendment, but I am interested in helping the \nStates at this particular time because many of them are experiencing \nbudget crunches, and it is really causing them a lot of difficulty.\n  With regard to the CHIP program, which was a Hatch-Kennedy bill that \nwas enacted over 4 years ago, my home State of Utah has now achieved \nthe goal of insuring 27,000 children of people who work but do not have \nenough money to pay for their children's health insurance. In Utah, we \nhave covered 27,000 kids, but there are at least 3,000 more who need to \nbe covered. Due to State budget concerns, Utah has had to cap its CHIP \nprogram at 27,000.\n  Now that is not right. I cannot blame my State leaders. They have to \nbalance the budget, but it is not right that any child in our society \nshould go without basic health care. The very poor in our society are \ncovered by Medicaid. What we did with the CHIP bill was try to take \ncare of those 7 million young people in the country who are children of \nthe working poor. The parents of these children work but do not earn \nenough money to pay for health insurance but make too much money to be \neligible for the Medicaid program. CHIP has worked immensely well. It \nhas been one of the most successful health care programs in the \ncountry.\n  I have worked on a number of important issues throughout my Senate \ncareer, and I think that passage of the CHIP program was one of my top \nachievements as a United States Senator. Providing access to affordable \nand quality health coverage to the medically uninsured continues to be \na high priority for me. So while I have to read the amendment language, \nI believe it is an important amendment, and I intend to support it as \nof this juncture.\n  With regard to bonus depreciation, I was the first Senator to file a \nbonus depreciation bill. My bill provided for a 50-percent bonus \ndepreciation deduction rather than the 30 percent in this amendment. \nBut remember, some of the other bills were only at 10-percent bonus \ndepreciation, and I am pleased to see that this amendment would now \nbring it to 30 percent. I am very happy to see the work of Senator \nSmith and the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, whom I \ncall a friend, in bringing this bonus depreciation percentage to a \nreasonable level. I would prefer it to be even higher because that \nwould be even more stimulative over this 2-year period, but this is a \ngood move compared to where we were. If we had gone with the Daschle \namendment, as I understand it, it would have been effective only from \nlast September until next September. It would have barely had time to \nwork. So this amendment does bring the bonus depreciation more into the \nrealm of workability.\n  Bonus depreciation is one of the few things we are doing in this \nlegislation that literally provides for an economic stimulus. It is a \nvery good economic stimulus because a lot of companies are \nunderstandably nervous about the economic slow-down and are hesitant to \ninvest in their equipment. With a bonus depreciation incentive, they \nmay be able to pull out of some of their difficulties with this \nadditional help that will be provided.\n  With regard to the FMAP increase included in this amendment, these \nprovisions will assist those who are suffering in our society today due \nto the economic downturn. In addition, there are States that are having \ntremendously difficult times meeting the needs of their citizens. The \nFMAP increase will provide these States with valuable resources so they \ncan meet these demands more easily.\n  So I want to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for calling up this amendment. I particularly want to commend \nhim for working with Senator Smith of Oregon, who brought up the \noriginal bonus depreciation amendment but who wanted the incentive to \nlast for 3 years. We compromised on 2 years, which I believe is a \ndecent compromise. I want to pay my respects and compliment both of \nthem for the work they have done on this particular amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I direct a question to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. I have four amendments \non which I will be very brief. My intention is, if there is no \nobjection, to offer the four amendments, debate one of them at a time, \nand if someone else comes and wants to offer another amendment, they \ncan put my amendment aside.\n  What is the position of the chairman on that suggestion?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, is \norganizing the sequence of amendments. I think it is fine for the \nSenator from New Hampshire to offer his package of amendments with the \nunderstanding they come up one at a time, and if there is an amendment \non this side in the interim, that amendment would be offered and we \nwould go back to one of Senator Smith's amendments. That is fine.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the chairman.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 2732 through 2735, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send four amendments to \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent that they be called up and \ntemporarily set aside for consideration at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments, en bloc.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes \n     amendment Nos. 2732 through 2735, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 2732 through 2735), en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2732\n\n   (Purpose: To provide a waiver of the early withdrawal penalty for \ndistributions from qualified retirement plans to individuals called to \nactive duty during the national emergency declared by the President on \n              September 14, 2001, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, these amendments I have \noffered encompass a number of important issues, including property \ntaxes, commuter taxes, tip taxes for those who work as waiters and \nwaitresses for the most part, and Reservists. Those are the four \ncategories.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy in allowing \nme to offer four amendments. I will have a very brief discussion of \neach of these amendments.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2735\n\n  The amendment No. 2735 is an amendment dealing with property taxes. \nIt provides an above-the-line deduction for State and local property \ntaxes. Right now, these taxes are only deductible for those who itemize \ntheir taxes. The nonitemizers are at the lower income levels. \nTherefore, this will help stimulate the economy by encouraging home \npurchases and home ownership for those at the lower income levels that \ndo not itemize their taxes.\n  As we all know, property taxes tend to fund local education. So \nproviding this tax deduction makes it easier for a local taxpayer to \nafford the quality education. As a former teacher and a parent, I \nbelieve it is very important to our economy.\n  It is important to understand, if a citizen makes enough money to \nhave enough deductions to itemize taxes,\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\nthey can deduct property taxes. But what about the senior citizen who \nhas property that has gained in value, they don't want to sell their \nhome, and they are on a fixed income? They could be forced to sell \ntheir home to pay the property taxes--which go up every year, usually \nbecause of the schools or other costs in the community.\n  This gives immediate tax relief to every working American or senior \ncitizen or anyone else who owns property, pays property taxes, but does \nnot get a tax deduction because they do not itemize. There is a direct \nstimulus to the economy. Imagine being able to deduct $2,000 or $3,000 \nin property taxes and having that cash on hand to be used for something \nelse, whether the purchase of a refrigerator or whatever.\n  If we want to stimulate the economy and help those who need it most, \nthis is the kind of legislation that does it. I hope my colleagues will \nlook seriously at this matter and pass it as an amendment to the \nstimulus package.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2733\n\n  The second amendment I will speak to, No. 2733, involves a commuter \ntax. This prohibits the imposition of a nonresident income tax unless \ntwo States agree to a compact permitting that tax. It happens in New \nHampshire; it happens in other States. A State does not have an income \ntax and a person who lives in a State with no income tax works in \nanother State. That State taxes their income. It is taxation without \nrepresentation. It is not fair.\n  This prohibits this tax from being implemented. In the long run, it \nis fair, and it is best for all people, no matter in what State you \nlive. Even if you are in a State that collects those taxes, it is the \nissue of fairness. Is it fair for you to collect an income tax from a \nperson who works in your State who gets no benefit? It does not mean \nonly the interstate exchange of goods and services, it also means the \nexchange of labor.\n  One of the best ways to stimulate economic growth is allow people to \nwork wherever they want in whatever State they want. Why make it a \ndisincentive for the person living on the border of one State to go to \nanother State. That is what we are doing. It is especially unfair in \nStates such as New Hampshire, where there is no income tax, and there \nis no reciprocating. In the State of New Hampshire, $2 or $3 million \ngoes out of that State into several of the surrounding States.\n  We all have constituents who work in neighboring States. In most \ncases, these constituents pay income taxes to those States; they are \ncalled commuter taxes. This is called taxation without representation, \nwhere I went to school. This is one of the issues that the colonists in \nour country fought over when they began to remove themselves from the \nauthority of the King. The Declaration of Independence lists the \nreasons our country broke away from the Crown, and one of them was \nimposing taxes without our consent. That is exactly what happens in \nevery State in America where there is an income tax for a person, say, \nliving in Montana, who works in a neighboring State, and they have to \npay the tax of that neighboring State.\n  It is not fair. I understand where politically it is easier for a \nState legislator to support an income tax on citizens who cannot vote \nthem out of office. There is no way you can vote these people out of \noffice for imposing these taxes, but it goes against the very \nprinciples on which our country was founded.\n  My amendment says if the State consents to allow its citizens to be \ntaxed by a neighboring State, that is OK because now the constituents \nhave an opportunity to either support or not support the legislators \nwho imposed that. It is a very important distinction as to this \namendment. If a State consents to allow citizens to be taxed by a \nneighboring State, fine. But right now that is not the case. They could \nsign an interstate compact, which would be fine, but it should be up to \nthe States. My amendment preserves the right of citizens to be governed \nby their own States, not by the tax-hungry legislators of another \nState.\n  If you examine this issue, it is a States rights issue, and I urge \nits adoption.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2734\n\n  Mr. President, the attacks of September 11 have left a great deal of \ndevastation in their wake. Thousands perished during the attacks while \ntens of thousands of friends and family members are left to grieve for \ntheir loved ones. But the economic impact of those attacks continue to \nbe felt throughout the Nation. With more than 1.6 million working men \nand women laid off last year, we need to look for ways to provide \nassistance to working individuals and their families.\n  The business community, particularly the travel industry, are bearing \nthe brunt of the burden. With airline travel and hotel bookings down \nsharply, communities which largely depend on tourism and travel as \ntheir chief source of revenue will soon, if not already, be in the red \nand may soon be forced to cut vital services. It is, therefore, \nimperative that we pass a strong, sensible economic stimulus plan that \nwill provide immediate relief to all Americans and stimulus to local \nbusinesses to help them weather this storm and expand employment. \nHowever, we must not overlook those who need help the most. The working \npoor.\n  Many of the these hardworking Americans supplement their often, \nminimum wage incomes, with tips received for their excellent service. \nHowever, this discriminatory tax is levied against those who can least \nafford it. Therefore, I am offering an amendment to address this \nunfairness in the tax code and provide direct relief to hardworking \nAmericans. My amendment is very simple. It recognizes a tip for what it \nis: a gift. All tips, not exceeding $10,000 annually, would be tax-\nfree. Result: hundreds of dollars a month remains in the pocket of hard \nworking individuals. By exempting these monies from both income and \nFICA taxes, more money will be returned to the pockets of both \nemployees and employers.\n  Under current law, service employees who typically receive tips are \nassumed to have made at least 8 percent of their gross sales in tips. \nTaxes are applied regardless of the actual level of the tip. The end \nresult for these employees is that they may have to pay taxes on income \nthey didn't receive.\n  By passing my amendment, the Federal Government will provide direct \nrelief to at least 2.3 million low to middle income individuals who \ndepend on tips to make ends meet. Industry statistics show that most of \nthe employees that will be helped by my amendment are either students, \nsingle mothers, or employees at the beginning of their careers. My \namendment will benefit millions of Americans directly, substantially, \nand quickly, while lifting some of the heavy burden of Government off \nof thousands of small businesses. My amendment eliminates the current \ncumbersome system under which tips cannot possibly be reported \naccurately. Hard working, law-abiding citizens who are given tips as a \nresult of their extra effort do not wish to be labeled cheaters by the \nIRS which does not understand the realities of their work. It is time \nto change the tax law covering income from tips. My amendment caps the \ntax-free earnings at $10,000 for the small percentage who make a career \nof waiting on tables in high-end restaurants and resorts. For States \nthat have a tip credit rule, this bill will not impact the employee's \nand employer's obligations and contributions up to the minimum wage.\n  Congress should show the hard working men and women of America that \nthe Federal Government is not out of touch, and that it has some \ncompassion for the struggle facing the millions of citizens in the \nservice industry. By passing my amendment, we pass a common sense \nproposal that will directly help millions of hard-working Americans.\n  To reiterate, the third amendment is No. 2734, known as the tip tax. \nThis amendment would consider tips to be gifts for income tax purposes. \nThis would provide a great amount of much needed relief and stimulus to \nthe hospitality and other service sectors of our economy by eliminating \nthe tax burden imposed on these tips.\n  Think about the types of people who hold these jobs. There are many \nsingle mothers, working women, working hard. You have all been to \nrestaurants and you see how hard waiters and waitresses work. \nFrequently these are single-income mothers who have children at home. \nThey are working hard. This would exempt the first $10,000 of those \ntips from Federal income tax. That is a pretty good incentive and would \nhelp\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\nevery waitress, every waiter, every person who receives gratuities as \nthe primary source of their income. It would help them tremendously to \nexempt the first $10,000.\n  We treat the tip income the same way--the first $10,000 a year tax \nfree. It is good policy and good stimulus, and I urge its adoption.\n  In summary, again, if you work as a waitress or waiter, the first \n$10,000 of the money you earn in tips would be exempted from Federal \ntaxes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2732\n\n  After the treacherous attacks of September 11, the need to increase \nsecurity around the country was and continues to be imperative.\n  Much of the security needs were filled by National Guard and Reserve \nunits. Many were forced to leave high or higher paying jobs than the \nmilitary was able to pay. In some cases, this caused a financial burden \non the men and women who were called to duty.\n  In order to help the Guard and Reserve units who were called up as a \nresult of the terrorist attacks, my amendment would allow those units \nto access their retirement plans without paying the 10 percent penalty \nfor early withdrawal.\n  The legislation would also allow them an underpayment waiver as well \nas a catch-up contribution without caps up to the amount they withdrew \nfrom their retirement fund.\n  While we have rightfully provided tax relief to the business and \nfamilies involved in the September 11 attacks, we must also look for \nways to provide relief to those brave men and women who have been \ncalled up to protect us from further attacks.\n  I ask the Senate to support the members of our National Guard and \nReservists and agree to my amendment.\n  In conclusion--I may want to speak to these amendments a little bit \nlater--these are four opportunities for us to help people who need help \nand stimulate the economy at the same time. These are working women, \nfor the most part, single mothers, working women who have children at \nhome, to exempt that first $10,000 in tip income; to help the reservist \nwho is called up on active duty who has a tough time now making \npayments on the home; third, to help those who work in one State and \nhave to pay taxes in that State even though they do not get any vote on \nit; and finally, the property tax where with the above-the-line \ndeduction, if you don't itemize, you can deduct your property taxes.\n  That will help mostly seniors, those people who are on fixed incomes \nwho are basically property poor. They do not want to sell their house. \nThey don't want to mortgage their house. Why should they have to? They \nhave worked all their lives for it. They can't pay the taxes on it. \nThis will give them a chance to deduct it right off their income.\n  My amendment will provide tax relief to low income homeowners who do \nnot have enough in deductions to itemize.\n  Giving low income working Americans an above the line tax deduction \nfor their family home will encourage home ownership and provide a much \nneeded economic stimulus in financially challenged neighborhoods.\n  School districts depend, in large part, on property taxes. \nEncouraging home ownership will increase greater tax dollars to these \nschool districts and provide greater learning opportunities for our \nchildren.\n  As a former teacher, I believe it is very important to our children \nand our economy.\n  I ask that the Senate consider the working poor and agree to this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire is the pending business.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the pending \namendment in order that I might introduce my own amendment, along with \nSenator Allen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, what is the consent request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will repeat his request.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That we lay aside the pending amendment and I and \nSenator Allen be allowed to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I announce to Members that we are trying to \nhave a consent agreement entered into within the next few minutes to \nhave a vote on or about a quarter to 4 today on the Harkin amendment. \nWe have an agreement that was formalized last night to alternate \namendments. And that is what we have been doing. We have a formal \nagreement that during this stimulus package we are alternating \namendments. The next two that were to be in order were two Democratic \namendments. We are going to dispose of these. We are going vote on the \nHarkin amendment and vote on Senator Allen's and work our way through \nthis matter. Senator Smith offered four amendments. The manager on the \nother side can decide how to handle those. We will do what we have been \ndoing. Unless Senator Smith combines those into one amendment, we will \nspread those out, having four amendments on the other side.\n  I have no objection at this time to Senator Sessions offering the \namendment in keeping with the agreement that was entered. His amendment \nwould be offered in the normal course of the alternating amendments.\n  Does the Senator from Iowa agree with me?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if what the Senator is saying is that \nwhen it comes to a Member who offered four amendments, we would only \nvote on one of his amendments and alternate back and forth. Is that \nyour goal?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. It doesn't matter to me how the manager of the bill \nhandles that. It is strictly up to him.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Since we started the other day with an agreement to go \nback and forth with one Democratic amendment and one Republican \namendment, we will stick with that.\n  Mr. REID. We entered into that agreement yesterday.\n  I withdraw my objection to Senator Sessions' amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote at 3:45 on or in \nrelation to the Harkin amendment, there be no amendments in order prior \nto that time, and the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2736\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his \ncourtesy which he displays so often.\n  The American Family Security and Stimulus Act is a stimulus package \nthat I offered along with Senator Allen and Senator Smith. Several \nother Senators also support it. It is designed to provide a stimulus to \nthis economy and to middle-class working Americans, by emphasizing help \nto families who tend to be hurt most in an economic slowdown and by \ntrying to get money into this economy in a way that can move us out of \nhere. It is time to blast out of this recession--not ease out of it.\n  When we look at our budget numbers and our hopes for the future and \njobs in America, what we know is that the sooner we get this economy \nhumming again the better. It will even benefit the politicians because \nwe will have more money in our Government Treasury. But, most \nimportantly, it will help create jobs and income for American families \nand workers.\n  It is time for us to quit dawdling about and get moving on something \nthat can be reached. I know the great leadership on both sides of the \naisle has worked really hard. Sometimes I have been wont to call them \nmasters of the universe, as they told us they were going to work out \nsomething. Sooner or later, they were going to get an agreement. But \ntime has gone by and no agreement has been reached. So I suggest the \nplan that we would offer today--Senator Allen and I--is a bipartisan \nplan that can include much of what is in other people's plans. It also \nincludes some items that would provide stimulus to the economy that are \nnot special interest oriented but family oriented. So everybody should \nbe able to rally behind them.\n  I will make a few brief remarks and then I will allow Senator Allen \nto\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\nmake some comments. I hope I might be able to speak on it as the day \ngoes by.\n  The components of this plan include a number of items. I believe one \nof them that has not been given sufficient thought in this process is \nthe requirement that we advance payment of the earned-income tax \ncredit--a $31 billion program for low-income workers. They get that \nearned-income tax credit the year after they work as a refund on their \ntax return. If we could begin to put it on their paychecks now--it is 5 \npercent--they would receive maybe a 60-cent, 80-cent, or 90-cent-an-\nhour increase in their pay. It would advance payment maybe $10 billion \nor $15 billion in this fiscal year's economy when we need that advanced \npayment, and it would reduce next year's payment. It would be a one-\ntime infusion of cash for hard-working Americans with low income with \nno cost to the budget over a 2-year period. In fact, I think that is \nthe right approach.\n  I do not believe I sent my amendment to the desk. I send it at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] for himself, Mr. \n     Allen, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, and Mr. Hutchinson \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2736 to the language proposed \n     to be stricken by amendment No. 2698.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the cost is $15 billion this year, but \nit saves the Treasury $15 billion next year because that money would \nhave been paid out earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\n  I ask that we accelerate the 25-percent individual income tax rate \nreduction that is now set at 27 to go to 25 by the year 2002, instead \nof 2006. We would accelerate that to this year providing families a \nbreak on their tax return. For example, an individual making $27,000 to \n$67,000 would receive a 2-percent break on their tax return.\n  We would allow penalty-free IRA withdrawals for health insurance \npremiums for unemployed workers. That has the potential to help people \nwho are hurting and need health insurance. We would increase the child \ntax credit from $500, as it is today for the year 2001, to $1,000 per \nchild, allowing families to receive an additional $500 tax credit on \ntheir tax returns for this year. We would do that just for 1 year \nbecause it is my belief that we need a stimulus in the economy now. It \nis going to phase into a $1,000 tax credit for families over 10 years, \nbut for 1 year we would accelerate that in these economic times to \nprovide relief for families.\n  We would increase from $3,000 to $5,000 the capital loss deduction. A \nnumber of plans have had that--both Democrat and Republican.\n  We provide a 3-month $500 tax credit for the purchase of computers \nfor elementary and secondary students, for which Senator Allen is such \na passionate proponent, and who will explain in detail.\n  We will extend the unemployment benefit by 13 weeks and provide the \noption for States to provide unemployment, if they choose, for part-\ntime workers.\n  I think that goes beyond Senator Daschle's proposal and, I believe, \nwould be very much a compromise that would be acceptable across the \naisle.\n  We would provide $5 billion for national emergency grants to States \nfor people who are hurting and provide temporary business relief by \nallowing an additional 2-year depreciation deduction of 30 percent of \nthe adjusted basis of certain qualified properties. That is projected \nat an approximate $38 billion cost, and it would have a cost this year \nwhen the money is pumped into the economy. But by allowing people to \ntake that depreciation deduction early, it would be something not \navailable to them in the future, thereby saving Government expenditures \nor costs in income in the future.\n  That is a good package. I know Senator Allen wants to talk about it. \nI believe it is a step in the right direction. There is nothing in this \nthat is not bipartisan. There is nothing in this that is special \ninterest. Every bit of it is fair and just, which stimulates the \neconomy, over $100 billion worth, without creating a bureaucracy, \nwithout creating a welfare program, and actually doing the things we \nwant it to do.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Sessions for his \nleadership and echo all of the comments he made in support of this \nmeasure. I strongly support, as a cosponsor, this amendment which is \nentitled the American Family Economic Security and Stimulus Act.\n  This amendment, due to the great leadership of Senator Sessions, as \nwell as his ingenuity, has provided us with what I believe to be a very \ncommon sense, compassionate, pro-family package that will help \nstimulate the economy and help American families and businesses get \nthrough the current economic recession.\n  When one thinks of stimulus or stimulus policy--I know the Presiding \nOfficer remembers the discussion on the concept of stimulus--it should \nbe a change in policy which will induce or spur economic activity, \nwhether it is investment or whether it is spending, that would \notherwise not occur but for the change in policy.\n  This amendment represents a very worker-oriented, pro-family economic \naid and stimulus package that will provide immediate financial relief \nto working families. It will ensure more of their hard-earned money \nstays in their wallets, and they spend it as they see fit. There is the \nadditional $150 a month in the hands of working Americans through \nadvanced payment on the earned-income tax credit. That is really an \nimmediate 50 to 60 cents per hour pay raise for workers in the lowest \nincome levels.\n  It increases the child tax credit to $1,000 for the current fiscal \nyear, and it accelerates the rate reduction for the 28 percent tax \nbracket to 25 percent.\n  I thank Senator Sessions for including the educational opportunity \ntax credit in this important legislation. This is a concept that I ran \non in my campaign. It is one many have heard me discuss. What I am \ndoing in adapting this idea, the education opportunity tax credit, to a \nstimulus package is to create an immediate incentive for families, \nparents of children who are in kindergarten through 12th grade, to buy \ncomputers, educational software, or computer peripherals. It is a \ntechnology-related amendment.\n\n  Specifically, what this amendment, the Sessions-Allen amendment, \nwould do is provide parents who have children in kindergarten through \n12th grade with an immediate $2,500 tax credit to buy computers, \neducational software, or peripherals. It would be for only 3 months. It \nwould provide those families with the financial means necessary to \nprovide their children with greater educational choice and \nopportunities best suited to their individual needs.\n  Parents know the needs of their children better than anyone. We know \nin studies about the digital divide that youngsters who have computers \nat home do better in school. They stay in school. They don't drop out. \nThis is an important way of empowering parents to provide computers and \neducational software and peripherals to their children.\n  As far as the economic stimulus of it, if the idea of education and \nempowering parents is not sufficient to convince my colleagues, let's \nrecognize what this will do for the economy. We can look at the States \nas our laboratories for a lot of good ideas.\n  Experience shows in the States that even a small temporary reduction \nin taxes can bring about huge increases in computer sales. In South \nCarolina, they had a sales tax holiday on computers for only 3 days. \nWhat was the result? Computer sales increased more than tenfold, over \n1,000 percent, in those 3 days. In Pennsylvania, they eliminated the \nsales tax on computers for 1 week. CPU sales increased sixfold in that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time controlled by the minority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I hope the Senate will support this idea of \nempowering parents, helping with technology, and helping out our \neconomy\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\nas well. It is a good, commonsense approach. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer for giving me the additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I believe we have consent from the other \nside to let the Senator from Virginia speak longer.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would appreciate that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to give the Senator 3 \nadditional minutes, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized for an additional 3 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, as I was stating, the educational \nopportunity tax credit, empowering parents with a $500 tax credit for a \n3-month period to buy computers and educational software and \nperipherals for their children, as we see from the States, works very \nwell. It is not just the computers themselves. Again, South Carolina \nrealized about a 664 percent increase in monitor sales and a 700 \npercent increase in printer sales, with only a 5 percent tax break. \nPennsylvania had a similar experience.\n  The impact of this will be at least $5 billion of stimulus into this \nsector of the economy while also helping out the education of children \nin this country.\n  We know that this will have much more of an impact than that because \nwhoever is fabricating the chips, the semiconductor chips, whoever the \ncontractors and vendors may be, whoever the sales folks are, all of \nthem, the computer software writers, all of those people will benefit \nfrom more business investment, more sales in the tech sector. This idea \nis supported by Information Technology Industries; Global Learning \nSystem; ITIC, which is the Information Technology Industry Council; \nJohn Chambers with CISCO, who is well known for his efforts in \neducation and technology, Gateway Computers, who have seen the impact \nof this in the States, the Consumer Electronics Association, Radio \nShack, and Circuit City.\n  This is a good, balanced, pro-family, pro-taxpayer, pro-jump \nstarting, and ``stimulating this economy to create more jobs\" idea. I \nhope we will find bipartisan support for this idea that will really \nallow families to keep more of their money, help educate their \nchildren, and also provide the job placement and financial assistance \nneeded to workers during this economic downturn while also making sure \nthat businesses have the capabilities to make investments with \naccelerated depreciation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we move this country \nforward in a way of trusting free people and free enterprise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors of the Sessions-Allen amendment Senator Tim Hutchinson of \nArkansas and Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2700\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain, I call up \namendment No. 2700, and I ask unanimous consent that it be explained \nand then laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. McCain, for \n     himself, Mr. Allard, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n     Murkowski, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Burns, \n     Mr. Durbin, Mr. Sessions, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \n     Shelby, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Warner, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. Allen, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \n     Fitzgerald, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Reid, Mr. Miller, Mr. Roberts, \n     Mr. Bayh, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Nelson \n     of Nebraska, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n     Biden, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Cochran, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2700 to the language proposed to be stricken by \n     amendment No. 2698.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide a \nspecial rule for members of the uniformed services and Foreign Service \n   in determining the exclusion of gain from the sale of a principal \n                               residence)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SPECIAL RULE FOR MEMBERS OF UNIFORMED SERVICES AND \n                   FOREIGN SERVICE IN DETERMINING EXCLUSION OF \n                   GAIN ON SALE OF PRINCIPAL RESIDENCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 121(d) (relating to special rules) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(9) Members of uniformed services and foreign service.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The running of the 5-year period \n     described in subsection (a) shall be suspended with respect \n     to an individual during any time that such individual or such \n     individual's spouse is serving on qualified official extended \n     duty as a member of a uniformed service or of the Foreign \n     Service.\n       ``(B) Qualified official extended duty.--For purposes of \n     this paragraph--\n       ``(i) In general.--The term `qualified official extended \n     duty' means any period of extended duty during which the \n     member of a uniformed service or the Foreign Service is under \n     a call or order compelling such duty at a duty station which \n     is a least 50 miles from the property described in \n     subparagraph (A) or compelling residence in Government \n     furnished quarters while on such duty.\n       ``(ii) Extended duty.--The term `extended duty' means any \n     period of active duty pursuant to a call or order to such \n     duty for a period in excess of 90 days or for an indefinite \n     period.\n       ``(C) Definitions.--For purposes of this paragraph--\n       ``(i) Uniformed service.--The term `uniformed service' has \n     the meaning given such term by section 101(a)(5) of title 10, \n     United States Code.\n       ``(ii) Foreign service of the united states.--The term \n     `member of the Foreign Service' has the meaning given the \n     term `member of the Service' by paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), \n     or (5) of section 103 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to sales or exchanges on or after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I, along with 39 cosponsors, am proud to \nsponsor amendment 2700 to H.R. 622 to allow members of the Uniformed \nand Foreign Services, who are deployed or are away on extended active \nduty, to qualify for the same tax relief on the profit generated when \nthey sell their main residence as other Americans. I am pleased to \nannounce that Secretary of State Colin Powell fully supports this \nlegislation and this legislation enjoys overwhelming support by the \nsenior uniformed military leadership--the Joint Chiefs of Staff--as \nwell as the Office of Management and Budget Director Mitch Daniels, the \n31-member associations of the Military Coalition, the American Foreign \nService Association, and the American Bar Association.\n  The average American participates in our Nation's growth through home \nownership. Appreciation in the value of a home because of our country's \noverall economic growth allows everyday Americans to participate in our \ncountry's prosperity. Fortunately, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nrecognized this and provided this break to lessen the amount of tax \nmost Americans will pay on the profit they make when they sell their \nhomes.\n  The 1997 home sale provision unintentionally discourages home \nownership among members of the Uniformed and Foreign Services, which is \nbad fiscal policy. Home ownership has numerous benefits for communities \nand individual homeowners. Owning a home provides Americans with a \nsense of community and adds stability to our Nation's neighborhoods. \nHome ownership also generates valuable property taxes for our Nation's \ncommunities.\n  This amendment will not create a new tax benefit. Let me say that \nagain: this bill will not create a new tax benefit, it merely modifies \ncurrent law to suspend the time members of the Uniformed and Foreign \nServices are away from home on active duty. In short, this amendment \ntreats service members and foreign service officers fairly, by treating \nthem like all other Americans.\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 delivered sweeping tax relief to \nmillions of Americans through a wide variety of important tax changes \nthat affect individuals, families, investors, and businesses. It was \nalso one of the most complex tax laws enacted in recent history.\n  As with any complex legislation, there are winners and losers. But in \nthis instance, there are unintended losers: service members and Foreign \nService Officers.\n  The 1997 act gives taxpayers who sell their principal residence a \nmuch-needed tax break. Prior to the 1997 act, taxpayers received a one-\ntime exclusion on the profit they made when they sold their principal \nresidence, but the taxpayer had to be at least 55 years old and live in \nthe residence for 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale. This provision \nprimarily benefitted elderly taxpayers, while not providing any relief \nto younger taxpayers and their families.\n  Fortunately, the 1997 act addressed this issue. Under this law, \ntaxpayers who sell their principal residence on or after May 7, 1997, \nare not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit from the sale; joint \nfilers are not taxed on the first $500,000 of profit they make from \nselling their principal residence. The taxpayer must meet two \nrequirements to qualify for this tax relief. The taxpayer must, first, \nown the home for at least 2 of the 5 years preceding the sale; and, \nsecond, live in the home as their MAIN home for at least 2 years of the \nlast 5 years.\n  I applaud the bipartisan cooperation that resulted in this much-\nneeded form of tax relief. The home sales provision sounds great and it \nis. Unfortunately, the second part of this eligibility test \nunintentionally and unfairly prohibits many of our men and women in the \nArmed Forces and Foreign services from qualifying for this beneficial \ntax relief.\n  Constant travel across the United States and abroad is inherent in \nthe military and Foreign Services. Nonetheless, some service members \nand Foreign Service Officers choose to purchase a home in a certain \nlocale, even though they will not live there much of the time. Under \nthe new law, if a service member does not have a spouse who resides in \nthe house during his or her absence or the spouse is also in the \nmilitary and also must travel, that service member will not qualify for \nthe full benefit of the new home sales provision, because no one \n``lives'' in the home for the required period of time. The law is \nprejudiced against dual-military couples who are often away on active \nduty, because they would not qualify for the home sales exclusion \nbecause neither spouse ``lives'' in the house for enough time to \nqualify for the exclusion.\n  This amendment simply remedies an inequality in the 1997 law. It \namends the Internal Revenue Code so that the 5-year time period is \nsuspended while the service member or Foreign Service Officer is \nordered, I underscore ordered, away from their primary home of \nresidence. In short, active and reserve service members will still be \nrequired to live in their primary residence for 2 years, but the 5-year \ntime period is suspended while they are stationed to such places like \nAfghanistan, the Philippines, Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, in the ``no \nman's land,'' commonly called the DMZ between North and South Korea, or \nanywhere else on active duty orders.\n  In 1998 alone, the United States had approximately 37,000 men and \nwomen deployed to the Persian Gulf region, preparing to go into combat, \nif so ordered. There were also 8,000 American troops deployed in \nBosnia, and another 70,000 U.S. military personnel deployed in support \nof other commitments worldwide. That is a total of 108,000 men and \nwomen deployed outside of the United States, away from their primary \nhome, protecting and furthering the freedoms we Americans hold so dear. \nSince the September 11th attacks on the United States we have asked \nwell over 110,000 service members to deploy abroad to seek out and \ndestroy the terrorists and their supporting organizations responsible \nfor this barbaric deed.\n  We cannot afford to discourage military service by penalizing \nmilitary personnel with higher taxes merely because they are doing \ntheir job. Military and Foreign service entails sacrifice, such as long \nperiods of time away from friends and family and the constant threat of \nmobilization into hostile territory. We must not allow the Tax Code to \nheap additional burdens upon our men and women in uniform.\n  In my view, the way to decrease the likelihood of further inequities \nin the Tax Code, intentional or otherwise, is to adopt a fairer, \nflatter tax system that is far less complicated than our current \nsystem. But, in the meantime, we must insure that the Tax Code is as \nfair and equitable as possible.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 was designed to provide sweeping tax \nrelief to all Americans, including our men and women in uniform. It is \ntrue that there are winners and losers in any tax code, but this \ninequity was unintended. Enacting this narrowly-tailored remedy to \ngrant equal tax relief to the members of our Uniformed and Foreign \nServices restores fairness and consistently to our increasingly complex \nTax Code.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters of support from the American \nForeign Service Association, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, American Bar \nAssociation, the Military Coalition, the Office of Management and \nBudget, and the Secretary of State be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       The Secretary of State,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing in support of the \n     legislation you have introduced to provide members of the \n     Foreign Service, as well as military personnel, the same \n     relief extended to other Americans in the sale of their \n     principal residence. Your efforts on behalf of the men and \n     women of the Foreign Service are very much appreciated.\n       The Tax Relief Act of 1997 has acted to the disadvantage of \n     many members of the Foreign Service by requiring that they \n     must live in their principal residence for two of the five \n     years prior to sale. Much of a Foreign Service member's \n     career is spent serving his or her country far away from that \n     residence, thereby making it impossible for many of them to \n     utilize the capital gains tax exclusion. Not counting the \n     time on extended duty away from the principal residence as \n     part of the five-year period will give to our Foreign Service \n     personnel and their military colleagues the same tax \n     treatment enjoyed by their fellow Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Colin L. Powell.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 27, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I join the Service Chiefs and strongly \n     endorse the Military Homeowners Equity Act. This legislation \n     would correct an inequity in the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1997 and would afford Service members the same opportunity to \n     build equity in a home that most other Americans enjoy.\n       One of the most effective ways to maintain outstanding \n     combat capability in our military personnel is to allow them \n     to concentrate fully on their mission without worrying \n     excessively about the home front. This Bill would be a major \n     step in the right direction.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to review the legislation, \n     and for your efforts on behalf of our soldiers, sailors, \n     airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Richard B. Myers,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n                                                November 21, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your efforts on behalf \n     of our service members to correct the disparity created by \n     the Tax Relief Act of 1997. I would like to extend my support \n     for your legislative tax relief proposal, S. 1678 which would \n     help relieve the hardships experienced by military homeowners \n     and encourage more members to purchase homes.\n       Many military homeowners who sold their homes after the Tax \n     Relief Act of 1997 have been unable to meet the two-year \n     residency requirement. I ask that you also consider adding \n     language to your proposal to make the tax relief retroactive \n     to sales and exchanges that occurred after the 1997 act, \n     adding a specific exception to the statute of limitations \n     period for filing refund claims.\n       Please let me know if I may be of further assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Vern Clark,\n                                               Admiral, U.S. Navy.\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                 October 31, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Your efforts to improve the quality of \n     service enjoyed by our Navy-Marine Corps team are greatly \n     appreciated. I would like to extend my support for the \n     legislation that you intend to introduce to correct the tax \n     disadvantage created by The Tax Reform Act of 1997.\n       The Marine Corps has been tracking several bills intended \n     to correct this tax disadvantage. As you know, The Tax Reform \n     Act repealed certain portions of the existing law that \n     allowed military members to maintain the status quo with \n     other taxpayers for exclusion of capital gains. The Act \n     provided for an exclusion, obviously not intended to \n     disadvantage military service members or members of the \n     Foreign Service. In order to qualify, a taxpayer must ``own \n     and use'' the property for two of the five years preceding \n     the sale. Since our personnel seldom remain in one location \n     for over three years, it is difficult to qualify for the \n     exclusion.\n       Please let me know if there is any way in which I can be of \n     assistance or service.\n           Semper Fidelis,\n                                                       J.L.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I strongly support the legislation you \n     have introduced, S. 1678, to correct the inequitable tax \n     consequences suffered by many soldiers when they sell their \n     principal residence.\n       As you are aware, under the 1997 Tax Relief Act, a \n     homeowner who sells a principal residence can exclude gain of \n     $250,000 ($500,000 for joint fliers) if the taxpayer owned \n     and used the residence for two of the five years immediately \n     preceding the date of sale. Unlike the previous law, the 1997 \n     Tax Relief Act does not recognize an exception for military \n     service. Accordingly, service members making frequent \n     military moves are often unable to meet the two-year \n     residency requirement required for the home sale exclusion.\n       Your legislation would correct this inequity by permitting \n     service members to apply time served on extended active duty \n     toward the use of a principal residence to qualify for the \n     home sale exclusion. This change would allow many more \n     service members and their families to take advantage of the \n     home ownership tax incentives enjoyed by other Americans.\n       I greatly appreciate your commitment to enhance the quality \n     of life for service members and their families. Thank you for \n     your continued support.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                John M.

The Air Force fully supports your Military \n     Homeowners' Equity Act--S. 1678. This bill will correct the \n     tax disadvantaged created by the Tax Reform Act of 1997 by \n     allowing members of the Uniformed Services who are deployed \n     or are away on extended active duty to qualify for the same \n     tax relief on the profit generated when they sell their main \n     residence as other Americans. Ideally, this legislation would \n     be retroactive to the effective date of the Tax Reform Act.\n       The 1997 Tax Reform Act repealed certain portions of the \n     existing law that allowed military members to maintain the \n     status quo with other taxpayers for exclusion of capital \n     gains. The Act provided for an exclusion, obviously not \n     intended to disadvantaged military service members or members \n     of the Foreign Service. In order to qualify, a taxpayer must \n     ``own and use'' the property for two of the five years \n     preceding the sale. With the frequent moves required by \n     military service, it is often times difficult for our service \n     members to qualify for the exclusion. Your bill corrects that \n     inequity.\n       Thank you again for your continuing support and leadership.\n           Sincerely\n                                                   John P.

After careful review, there is \n     a case to be made that the current capital gains tax system \n     poses a burden on servicemen and women and foreign service \n     officers. These men and women spend much of their careers \n     being assigned overseas and moving from post to post. We \n     should not penalize these Americans in effect for serving \n     their country.\n       The Office of Management and Budget supports Senator \n     McCain's proposal which would allow military and foreign \n     service personnel equitable capital gains tax treatment. I \n     appreciate your persistence on this matter as we continue to \n     ensure that our Foreign Service Officers and Military service \n     men and women enjoy such benefits especially during these \n     difficult times.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Robin Cleveland,\n\n                                               Associate Director,\n     National Security Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The Military Coalition,\n\n                                  Alexandria VA, November 6, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Military Coalition, a consortium \n     of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans \n     organizations, representing more that 5.5 million members, \n     plus their families and survivors, is grateful to you for \n     introducing The Military Homeowners Equity Act--a bill that \n     would restore capital gains tax equity for military \n     homeowners.\n       Your legislation is essential to correct a serious \n     oversight in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which \n     inadvertently penalizes servicemembers who are assigned away \n     from their principal residence for more than three years on \n     government orders. Very often, servicemembers keep their \n     homes while reassigned overseas or elsewhere in the hopes of \n     returning to their residence. On occasions when this proves \n     impossible, and the home must be sold to permit purchase of a \n     new principal residence, servicemembers find themselves \n     subjected to substantial tax liabilities--all because \n     military orders kept them from occupying their principal \n     residence for at least two of the five years before the sale.\n       The 1999, both the House and Senate passed corrective \n     legislation (H.R. 865) as part of the Taxpayer Refund and \n     Relief Act of 1999, but the President vetoed this bill over \n     an unrelated issue. Your new bill will be important to \n     resurrect this fairness issue and allow servicemembers to \n     comply with government orders and leave home to serve their \n     country without risking a large capital gains tax liability.\n       The Military Coalition pledges to work with you to seek \n     inclusion of your bill in the pending economic stimulus \n     package so military members can once again enjoy the same \n     capital gains tax relief already provided to all other \n     Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     The Military Coalition.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                         American Foreign Service Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2001.\n     The Hon. John McCain,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 23,000 active-duty \n     and retired members of the Foreign Service which the American \n     Foreign Service Association (AFSA) represents, thank you for \n     your leadership and support with your soon-to-be introduced \n     bill extending to the Uniformed Services and Foreign Service \n     the tax treatment enjoyed by all other Americans when they \n     sell their principal residence.\n       As you know this is an important active-duty issue for the \n     Uniformed Services and the Foreign Service. Your bill, \n     amending section 121(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n     addresses an inequity faced by our members because of the \n     particular nature of our profession. As you are well aware, \n     our careers require us to live for years at a time away from \n     our homes in duty posts around the world in service to our \n     nation. In the case of the Foreign Service, our duty \n     assignments range from 2-4 years. Back-to-back assignments \n     abroad are common. It is no unusual for a member of the \n     Foreign Service to spend six or more years abroad before \n     returning to Washington for an assignment here. With the \n     current two-in-five year occupancy test, many of our members \n     in both the Uniformed Services and the Foreign Service find \n     that we do have the same flexibility in selling our homes as \n     enjoyed by our fellow Americans. After several years abroad, \n     there are many reasons why we may with to sell our homes upon \n     returning home. As with other Americans, we would like our \n     homes to reflect and be suited-to the changes in our lives--\n     the increase or decrease in the size of our families, \n     divorce, retirement, promotions and the ability to pay more \n     for a house, the schools our children would attend, etc. Yet \n     because of current law, we cannot sell our principal \n     residences without living in them again for two years or else \n     pay a serious tax penalty. Your bill, gratefully, addresses \n     these problems.\n       The members of the Uniformed Services and the Foreign \n     Service have been faced with this problem since the change in \n     the tax code in 1997. We hope that your provision can become \n     law soon. If we can be of any assistance, please do not \n     hesitate to contact me or Ken Nakamura, AFSA's Director of \n     Congressional Relations at (202) 944-5517 or by e-mail at \n     nakamura@afsa.org.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John K.

John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the American Bar \n     Association, I would like to commend you for your leadership \n     in developing a proposal on the issue of the military \n     homeowners capital gains exemption. Such legislation is \n     needed to correct an inequity that occurred as a result of \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law No. 105-34).\n       As you know, Section 121 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     permits a single taxpayer to exclude up to $250,000 of the \n     capital gains on the sale of a principal residence and \n     permits a married couple filing jointly to exclude up to \n     $500,000 on such a sale. Yet in order to qualify for such an \n     exclusion, a taxpayer must have owned and used the home as a \n     principal residence for two out of the five years prior to \n     its sale. Otherwise, a taxpayer must pay taxes on all or a \n     pro rata share of the capital gains on the sale of the home.\n       Unfortunately, this provision penalizes service members who \n     are unable to use a principal residence for two out of the \n     five years prior to its sale, because they are deployed \n     overseas or required to live in military housing. The ABA \n     urges Congress to amend Section 121 of the IRC to either: (1) \n     treat time spent away from a principal residence while away \n     from home on official active duty as counting towards the \n     ownership and use requirement, or (2) suspend the ownership \n     and use requirement for time spent away from a principal \n     residence due to official active duty. Earlier this year, the \n     ABA submitted comments to the Internal Revenue Service on \n     proposed regulations regarding Section 121. A copy of our \n     comments is enclosed for your review.\n       We want to thank you for your plans to rectify the inequity \n     created for service members by Section 121. We look forward \n     to working with you to establish a military homeowners \n     capital gains exemption.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert D.

You have my agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2702\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak to my amendment, the \nTerrorist Zone Tax Exemption Act, which I believe will be the next \nmeasure on which we will be voting.\n  Last fall the attack on our country represented the worst of mankind, \nbut at the same time it demonstrated the best of the American spirit.\n  While we as a nation are united and resolved to combat terrorism, \nunfortunately other things have changed as a result of these attacks. \nAs my colleagues know, this war on terrorism has changed our definition \nof combatants. For terrorism targets not only military personnel and \nequipment but innocent men, women, and children at work in office \nbuildings and, as we have seen, on civilian aircraft. So it is also \nwith those tasked to respond to these attacks. Under the threat of \nterrorism, not only are military personnel tasked to locate and \neradicate potential terrorist threats, but civilian fire, police, and \nrescue personnel are charged with maintaining public safety after a \nterrorist attack. We read about and heard about the heroic acts of \nfirefighters, rescue personnel, and police officers--whether at the \nPentagon or at the World Trade Center--who risked their lives with \nburning debris, toxic gases and fumes who tried and indeed did save \nhundreds if not thousands of lives. And like their military \ncounterparts, they too are subject to attack and risks themselves.\n  As my colleagues know, our tax laws recognize that the income of \nthose brave men and women in military uniforms fighting overseas and \nserving in a zone designated as a combat zone is exempt from taxation. \nRecognizing that the war on terrorism has sadly changed the way we look \nat war, and recognizing that our local and State fire police and rescue \npersonnel are now pressed into homeland defense, we ought to similarly \nchange our tax laws to reflect this new reality.\n  My Amendment would allow the income of those who are working in \ndesignated terrorist attack zones--for example, at the World Trade \nCenter or at the Pentagon, if so designated by the President--to be \nexempt from Federal taxes.\n  The fiscal implication of this is about $205 a month for the \nSeptember attack--a cost of a little over $7 million to the federal \ngovernment. And it is retroactive to September 11, although we pray we \nwill never need to use this again.\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\n  It is supported by many groups--from the International Association of \nFire Chiefs, the Fraternal Order of Police with nearly 300,000 members, \nthe National Association of Police Organizations which represents over \n220,000 police officers, the Detectives' Endowment Association which \nrepresents 7,500 City of New York Detectives, and other organizations, \nincluding the Capitol Police Labor Board.\n  These firefighters and police and rescue personnel are heroes. They \nare super heroes. Let us give them this recognition to boost their \nmorale and show our appreciation to them as they protect us here in our \nhomeland.\n  I hope in a bipartisan nature we can work and vote in favor of this \nlogical, commonsense amendment and I ask for my colleagues' support.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question \nconcerning the cleanup at the Pentagon or at the World Trade Center? \nThey are still cleaning up. Under the Senator's amendment, would that \nstill be classified as a terrorist center, and, therefore, they would \nstill be exempt? If the cleanup lasted a year, would the cleanup crews \nbe exempt from taxation for a year?\n  Mr. ALLEN. The designation of a terrorist attack zone would be made \nby the President. Once you get past the rescue mission, the immediate \nresponse, and when the zone is designated a recovery scene, the tax \nexemption ends. The intent is for this to benefit those who rush in \nwhen there is still an opportunity to save a life; those first \nresponders who themselves are endangered by the initial attack. I would \nnot imagine that would last for anymore than a month. And again, it is \nvalidated on a monthly basis, like the combat zone tax exemption.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Virginia \nrushing through with his presentation. It was very articulate. I \nappreciate his recognizing that we are trying to get this agreement \nbefore the vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until 4:45 p.m. \ntoday be equally divided with respect to the Allen amendment No. 2702 \nand the Baucus amendment No. 2718, that no second-degree amendments be \nin order to either amendment prior to the vote in relation to each \namendment; that the first vote be in relation to the Allen amendment; \nand that regardless of the outcome there be 4 minutes equally divided \nprior to the vote in relation to the Baucus amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms \nbe added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2702.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, does the Senator from Montana wish to \ndiscuss this amendment? I only have maybe 30 seconds, and I would be \nhappy to yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my good friend. I have looked at the Senator's \namendment. It is a good idea. I support it. There are a few little \nwrinkles that I want to look at to make sure the definitions coincide \nwith the definitions for income taxes excluded for combat zones and \nmake sure all those declarations are the same and equitable. That is \njust a minor matter. We will work that out.\n  I commend the Senator for offering this amendment. It is a good idea.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana, Mr. \nBaucus, for his support. I look forward to further discussion. If there \nare some amendments that need to be made in the definitions, we have \nbeen working on this for several months, but nevertheless we will \ncontinue to work together on it. I conclude by saying very strongly \nthat we need to adapt our tax policy and properly and logically provide \nsimilar tax benefits for the fire, rescue, and police personnel who are \nserving here in our homeland. This is where these terrorist attacks \nhave occurred and we all agree that these heroes have responded in the \ntrue spirit of America. Please stand with our heroes, our firefighters, \nand police and rescue workers.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have two amendments pending and at \nleast two votes at approximately 5:45. We have discussed the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Virginia, which I support.\n  I don't know whether the Senator wishes to discuss the amendment. If \nhe doesn't, that is fine. Otherwise, I was going to ask my friend from \nOregon, Senator Smith, if he wishes to say a few words before the other \nvotes that will occur following the vote on the amendment offered by \nthe Senator from Virginia. That, of course, is up to my good friends \nfrom Virginia and Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I would rather make sure there is adequate \ndiscussion on the other votes. I believe there is complete agreement on \nmy amendment.\n  I yield my time to the Senator so he may explain his amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I haven't heard anybody speak in opposition to the \nSenator's amendment. I think he is pretty close to his goal.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Ok. I had better sit down.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I see my friend from Oregon in the \nChamber.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who is yielding time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield such time as my friend from Oregon would desire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2718\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the \nchairman of the Finance Committee for yielding time.\n  I learned as a little boy from my mother that if you at first don't \nsucceed you should try and try again.\n  I come to the Chamber to try again on the issue of accelerated \ndepreciation. I am proud to be joined by Senator Baucus. This is the \nBaucus-Smith amendment now. The point is simply to try and bridge the \ndifference between the two sides on the whole idea of how best to give \na meaningful stimulus to business to take advantage of this accelerated \ndepreciation, this bonus depreciation over a period of time that on the \none hand will stimulate in a timely way the economy and in another way \nwill help the States to be able to afford this action.\n  I believe the Baucus-Smith amendment is the compromise that will \nprovide real stimulus to the underlying package that is offered by the \nmajority which, I respectfully say again, is just simply too short a \nperiod of time to be meaningful to our economy.\n  The point was made that my amendment over 3 years was too much time. \nThen surely 2 years is enough. I believe Senator Baucus and I have \nprovided a compromise that will give business people time sufficient--I \nwish it were more--to be able to buy the equipment, do the planning, do \nthe environmental studies, and make the investments that will allow \nemployers to call employees back to work.\n  In addition, we are doing something that is very much needed by the \nStates. That is, we will provide an increase in the Federal Medical \nAssistance Percentage known as FMAP. Most States, mine included, are \nstruggling with how to continue to provide the resources for Medicaid. \nI understand that very well in my own State. Our State has a budget \nshortfall that approaches $1 billion. I have been reminded by people in \nmy State that accelerated or bonus depreciation would only make that \nsituation worse. I am not unmindful of that, and Senator Baucus and I \nhave a way in this amendment to fix that, not just for my State but for \nevery State.\n  Senator Harkin's amendment was just defeated. I suggest that what \nSenator Baucus and I are proposing is in the same spirit of that but \nwithin the realm of financial responsibility. It is the moderate view \nthat I believe will find over 60 votes in the Senate. I certainly hope \nit will.\n  What this does specifically, the FMAP increase will provide immediate \nfiscal relief to States such as Oregon which are increasingly cash \nstrapped in the current recession as the demand for State social \nservices rises but State revenues drop.\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n  For example, this provision would bring an additional $97 million to \nOregon in the first year. Depending on certain factors, they may get in \nexcess of an additional $105 million in the following year, for a 2-\nyear total of more than $205 million.\n  I can imagine that my State, as well as the State of the Presiding \nOfficer, could use that assistance in this time of recession. Again, I \nremind both sides that whether it is former Treasury Secretary Robert \nRubin or Chairman Greenspan, they have both said this will be helpful \nto stimulate the economy. It doesn't go too far. It is not too long. I \nthink for business people who are on their toes and trying to make \nplans, it will be enough time to have the economic incentives to \nimprove our Nation's economy.\n  America, moreover, is hungering for a sense that the Senate can get \nsomething done. Our proposal is that middle ground that allows us to \nmake progress and to go to the State of the Union tonight well on the \nway to passing a stimulus package. There is something for both sides. \nBut more importantly, there is something for the American people that \nprovides real health care dollars to people in need in States with \nshortfalls and real business stimulus to employers so that the best \nsocial welfare we could possibly foster will be available, and that is \na private sector family wage job.\n\n  Again, I believe Senator Baucus and I have come upon the right \nformula to make better the underlying proposal and to find the \nbipartisan support which will ultimately be essential if we are to get \nbeyond 60 votes and get something to conference and then to the desk of \nthe President. The American people deserve that. We should do no less.\n  I yield back my time to the manager of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a good example of how we should \npass legislation; that is, working together. Senator Smith from Oregon \nand I have come together and crafted an amendment which directly meets \nconcerns of Senators. We have done it together. Is it perfect in the \nminds of everyone on one side of the aisle? No. Is it perfect in the \nminds of all Senators on the other side of the aisle? No. But is it \ngood? Is it basically a good idea? I believe the answer is yes.\n  Essentially, we are going to provide for bonus depreciation for \ncapital investment at 30 percent over a period of 2 years. The big \nquestion, I remind the Chair, is, should it be 1 year, 2 years, or 3 \nyears? We have agreed on 30 percent for all intents and purposes. \nDuring private conversation on the floor on both sides of the aisle, \nsomewhat presumptuously I will say that I heard, I believe, it should \nbe 2 years. That is what it should be. We debated 3 years. That did not \npass. We, in effect, debated 1 year. It did not quite reach fruition, \nbut that certainly is not going to pass.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time controlled by the majority has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. Might I ask who controls the remaining \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia or his designee.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I grant the Senator from Montana 2 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have about 4 minutes to comment on \nSenator McCain's amendment. I was giving a speech and I could not be \nhere when he brought it up. I would like to be able to use that time, \nif you don't need all the time. Otherwise, I will wait.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be fine. I just have 2 minutes. That would be \nfine with me.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to have 4 minutes whenever it works out.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, again, to remind all Senators, this is a \ncompromise. It is an effort on the part of Senator Smith of Oregon and \nmyself to find the proper number of years of bonus depreciation. It is \nan effort to find the proper amount of reimbursement to States for lost \nMedicaid dollars. All Senators agree this is not only in the ballpark, \nit is probably so close to filling up the ballpark that it really \ncannot be improved upon a heck of a lot. I think it is a good \namendment.\n  Further, I remind my colleagues, with the split in this body \nbasically 50-50, this is the only way we are going to accomplish \nanything of consequence. That is, by sitting down and not engaging in \nrhetoric and preaching to people through the cameras, making them feel \ngood, but, rather, working together to pass legislation that makes \npeople's lives better and significantly better. That is what we are \ncharged to do.\n  If you were to ask voters, do you want your Senator to make speeches \njust for the sake of making speeches or do you want your Senator to get \nsomething done that really makes sense for us in the State, it may not \nbe all we want but he has done a pretty good job, clearly the answer is \nthe latter. They want us to do something that makes sense. That is what \nthe Senator from Oregon and I are doing.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to take a good, strong look at it. It \nis a bipartisan amendment. It has bipartisan support. More than that, \nit has the support of the people of the country.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. I rise in support of this amendment, recognizing the need \nfor Congress to undertake immediate corrective measures to help those \nwho have suffered the adverse effects of the recent economic downturn. \nAnd while I do support this amendment, there are issues associated with \nit that are of serious concern, issues which I hope will be addressed \nin conference.\n  As we have heard throughout this debate, most states are experiencing \nserious budget shortfalls. In fact, in my own state of Utah, many vital \nstate programs are slated for reductions this year. I am very concerned \nabout that situation, and sympathetic to the need to work with the \nStates to alleviate these concerns where we are able.\n  But it is also true that the Federal budget is under severe pressure \nbecause of the economic slowdown, and we must be very careful when we \nmove to authorize what amounts to new spending, especially in an \nentitlement program.\n  Obviously, we must carefully examine our budget constraints and \nbalance the need to address the economy with the need to restrain the \ngrowth of spending.\n  But as I have said, I share the States' concern about the budgetary \nimpact of the economic downturn. Many important programs are being cut-\nback, a serious concern to those of us who have worked so hard to weave \na strong safety net.\n  In fact, the Utah CHIP program is no longer enrolling new children \nbecause it is running out of money. I cannot tell you how disappointed \nI am about this situation. Seeing the CHIP program become federal law \nin 1997 was probably one of my proudest accomplishments as a U.S. \nSenator.\n  And, as one of the principal authors of CHIP, it has been my hope \nthat we can expand the program, not scale it back. However, my \ndiscussions with our Governor, Mike Leavitt, have made it perfectly \nclear that the State feels it has no alternative, and I respect that \ndecision, however painful. But, perhaps if we are giving additional \nfunds to the States to assist with the health care needs of the low \nincome, those funds would be better used if they were provided to the \nCHIP program as well, or instead, since in many cases a CHIP dollar can \ngo so much further than a Medicaid dollar.\n  I would also point out that increasing the Federal matching \npercentage for Medicaid is only a short-term solution to a long-term \nproblem. Again, I heartily support efforts to provide greater \nassistance to families, especially low-income families, who are feeling \nthe ill effects of the economic downturn. That being said, I do \nquestion whether expanding this entitlement program is absolutely the \nbest way to address the health care needs of people who have been hurt \nby the economy. There are literally millions of persons who have no \naccess to health care at all, and their needs must also be factored in \nto our overall spending plans.\n  Let me take a moment to address the FMAP funding formula itself.\n  The FMAP formula is an attempt to direct Federal resources to the \nStates based on their populations in need. It is not a perfect formula, \nas many of us have widely acknowledged. These structural flaws must be \naddressed by\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nCongress, and I would not like to see action today which would lock \ninto concrete, in reality or politically, a formula which needs to be \nreexamined.\n  As a related issue, we need to look at the effect of providing a 1\\1/\n2\\-percent across the board FMAP increase to States for a program which \nis certain to have a disproportionate impact in the various States \ngiven their differing matching percentages. For example, some States \nhave a Federal matching percentage which is relatively high, as high as \n76 percent. Others have a percentage as low as 50 percent. Obviously, a \n1.5 percent increase is a substantially greater proportion of the 24 \npercent a State with the highest FMAP has to contribute, compared to \n1.5 percent of the 50 percent a ``richer'' State must contribute.\n  The GAO has produced several reports which make recommendations on \nhow this formula may be improved. Therefore, I believe that it would be \nprudent for Congress to carefully review the recommendations of the GAO \nbefore taking any final actions affecting FMAP policy.\n  In fact, I believe it might be prudent for the Finance Committee to \nhold a hearing on this important issue, and I would hope that the \nchairman might schedule one in the near future.\n  In addition, while I have not seen any figures on areas which are the \nmost hard hit by the recession, I want to make certain that the areas \nin which we are targeting the greatest assistance under this amendment \nare the areas of greatest need during the downturn. Because of the way \nthe formula is structured, these additional FMAP dollars may not be \ntargeted to those whose access to health care was affected by the \nrecession and the events of September 11.\n  Finally, it is my hope that this amendment does not follow the long \ntradition whereby Congress authorizes an extension for an entitlement \nprogram which for all intents and purposes becomes permanent. I \ncertainly support the intention of this amendment, which is to provide \ntemporary assistance to those who have suffered great hardships due to \nthe recession and the terrorist attacks of last September. However, \nmaking these FMAP increases permanent would be a terrible mistake, \nespecially since I believe that we would be, in essence, taking away \ndollars from other deserving Federal programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2700\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator John McCain \nin sponsoring amendment No. 2700, the military homeowners tax equity \namendment, to H.R. 622. This amendment will correct a serious, \ninadvertent oversight in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 and provide \nmuch needed tax equity to our members of the uniformed services and the \nForeign Service. The content of this amendment is the exact language as \nS. 1678, which Senator McCain and I introduced last year.\n  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 exempted up to $250,000-$500,000 per \ncouple in capital gains from federal income taxes for homes occupied as \na principal residence for at least 2 of the last 5 years. \nUnfortunately, Uniformed and Foreign Service members may have \ndifficulty meeting the 2 year requirement. Service members are directed \nto move to meet the needs of the U.S. Government and may be directed to \nmove prior to owning a residence for 2 full years. Many service members \nkeep their homes while reassigned overseas or elsewhere in hopes of \nreturning to their residence. On occasions when this proves impossible, \nthe members are subjected to substantial tax liabilities.\n  Prior to the 1997 law, service members who were assigned overseas or \notherwise away from their principal residence on military orders for an \nextended period of time had a special provision that allowed them to \n``rollover'' capital gains. The 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act made many \nimprovements to the tax code by replacing the capital gain ``rollover'' \nrules with the tax exclusion, but failed to provide for those on \nmilitary orders. This amendment will correct this oversight by \nproviding that absences from the principal residence due to serving on \na qualified official duty as a member of a uniformed service or the \nForeign Service be treated as using the residence in determining the \nexclusion of gain from the sale of such residence.\n  In 1999 both the House and Senate passed the Taxpayer Refund and \nRelief Act which included language to correct this oversight, but that \nact was vetoed by then-President Clinton.\n  S. 1678, which as I stated earlier mirrors our amendment, has support \nfrom all four service chiefs, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, the 31 organization members of the Military Coalition, the \nAmerican Bar Association, the American Foreign Service Association.\n  Our service men and women face enough challenges today. They should \nnot have to face additional tax liabilities in return for serving their \ncountry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2702\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I yield back whatever time remains so we \ncan proceed with the vote on amendment No. 2702.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2702. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka), the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), and the Senator from New Jersey \n(Mr. Torricelli,) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their support of \nthe amendment. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Collins, Helms, \nand John Warner be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2718\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 minutes equally divided prior \nto a vote in relation to amendment No. 2718. Who yields time? The \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could I have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. The Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I support bonus depreciation. I support \nMedicaid assistance to the States. But I do\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\nnot support 2 years of bonus depreciation. I do not support 2 years of \nadditional spending on Medicaid for the States.\n  The reason is very simple. On the question of bonus depreciation, the \nwhole purpose of this package is to encourage economic recovery, \nadditional economic activity now. A 2-year provision reduces the \nstimulus, reduces the incentive to act now. That is not only my \nopinion, that is the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office that \nexamined the various options before us and said: Don't do multiple \nyears; you reduce the incentive to act now. This is the time we need \nadditional economic activity.\n  Second, the history of fiscal stimulus is always that we have acted \ntoo late. We are on the brink of doing that again. A 2-year provision \nfalls right into that trap.\n  The cost of this provision is $45 billion this year; $37 billion next \nyear. That is digging the hole deeper when we have just been informed \nby the Congressional Budget Office that every penny of these resources \nwill come out of the Social Security trust fund. For that reason, I \nwill raise a budget point of order against this provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and also Senator Smith \nof Oregon, let me make a couple of quick points.\n  No. 1, we know our country needs a boost, a shot in the arm. It is \nnot totally clear, but it is far better to provide a little insurance \nbecause the economy might go south in the next couple of months or \nyears--more than it has now. Various companies are going bankrupt. We \nall know about Enron, Kmart, and there will be other companies down the \nroad. Many people are being laid off, particularly in the financial \nservices industry, which we are going to find out about in February \nbecause they have 2- or 3-month contracts and they will be laid off a \nlot later. This is very important.\n  Second, many States are losing revenue because their economies are \ndown. They will also lose more revenue as a consequence of the 2-year \nbonus depreciation. It is only proper with the passage of the Medicaid \nreimbursement amendment States are made whole so they do not have to \ncut Medicaid payments, so they do not have to cut payments to \nhospitals, to providers.\n  This amendment will allow States to refrain from making those cuts to \ndoctors, to hospitals, other providers, and to Medicaid beneficiaries, \nand also prevent them from having to otherwise cut their budgets.\n  At the same time, we get a 2-year shot in the arm with bonus \ndepreciation. It is a very modest provision. We all know bonus \ndepreciation should be somewhere between 1 year and 3 years. This is \nwhere we all know it makes the most sense, 2 years. It should \ndefinitely be enacted.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my friend from Oregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. If you \nwant the middle ground, we are talking about it right now. This \nactually does stimulate the economy; it is insurance.\n  The chair of the Budget Committee, my friend, clearly is concerned \nabout the budget. But if you want to help the budget get back into \nsurplus, let's get our economy going. That is the most sure way to make \nthis happen. What Senator Baucus and I have done is make sure that we \ndo not leave the States high and dry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is exhausted; 22 \nseconds remain.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield my colleague the remainder of my time, the 22 \nseconds in opposition to the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. My last point was you can make these arguments \nagainst any expenditure. The point is, we can't leave the States high \nand dry as we try to stimulate the economy.\n  This is about real people needing jobs and health care. It is a win-\nwin for Republicans and for Democrats. I urge the overwhelming passage \nof the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment my colleague for making the point of order, \nand I wish to join him in that point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Daschle has asked me to announce to \nthe Membership that this will be the last vote of the evening prior to \nthe State of the Union Message.\n  The leader has indicated there will be votes next Monday.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Smith of \nOregon, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Office Act \nof 1974, I move to waive the applicable sections of the act for the \npurposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

In fact, the temptation is for me to challenge him to an \nacademic final.\n  As far as the football final, I can tell my colleagues, I watched the \ngame and that is a monster team if I have ever seen one. It is well \ncoached and had an outstanding performance.\n  I lost the bet. The bet was if I lost, I would sing ``Up With \nMontana,'' their song. Fortunately, the rules of the Senate say no \nsinging.\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\n  In congratulating Senator Baucus, I will recite this song publicly in \nthe Chamber of the Senate. I want everybody to listen to this:\n\n       Up with Montana, boys, down with the foe,\n       Good ol' Grizzlies out for a victory;\n       We'll shoot our backs 'round the foeman's line;\n       Hot time is coming now, oh, brother mine.\n       Up with Montana, boys, down with the foe,\n       Good old Grizzlies triumph today;\n       And the squeal of the pig will float on the air;\n       From the tummy of the Grizzly Bear.\n\n  Isn't that something?

Before we knew the Furman Purple \nPaladins and the Montana Grizzlies were going to be playing in the 1 AA \nplayoff for the championship of the country, we made a little wager. \nThe wager was whoever loses reads the other team's fight song on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  I say to my good friend, I have no idea what the Purple Paladins' \nfight song is. Had the Grizzlies not won, I certainly would know their \nfight song.\n  For many days, the Senator from South Carolina has been talking about \nthis song. He said: Egads, is this your fight song? Is this what I have \nto read on the floor?\n  I cannot thank him enough. It was a great game. I watched it on \ntelevision as well.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It was an outstanding game. I think this was the second \nyear in a row they won the championship.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is an outstanding college and outstanding team.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

PERMANENT REPEAL OF ESTATE TAXES.\n\n       Section 901 of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \n     Reconciliation Act of 2001 is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``this Act'' and all that follows through \n     ``2010.'' in subsection (a) and inserting ``this Act (other \n     than title V) shall not apply to taxable, plan, or limitation \n     years beginning after December 31, 2010.'', and\n       (2) by striking ``, estates, gifts, and transfers'' in \n     subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, since the sponsor of the legislation wishes \nto get on with the conclusion of business tonight, I will simply say \nthis amendment, which I hope will be considered at the beginning of \nnext week, calls for the permanent repeal of the death tax.\n  As all of our colleagues know, we did repeal the death tax after \nphasing it down over a period of years, but the repeal only lasts for 1 \nyear before that legislation is sunsetted, and we go right back after \n10 years to the death tax as it currently exists.\n  I do not think any of us who voted for its repeal really intended \nthat effect.

Mr. President, I rise today to express \nsupport for the Daschle consensus stimulus package, and I applaud the \naction of the Senate in passing the Baucus amendment to provide for \naccelerated depreciation over 2 years and 30 percent additional \ndepreciation, as well as assisting and holding the States harmless for \nany lost revenue they might otherwise receive based on the support of \nthe Medicaid Program at the State level.\n  I think it is clear to most everyone that we need to have some \neconomic stimulus. What does not seem to be clear to everyone is of \nwhat that consists. What seems to be further unclear at times is \nwhether we need to do it a certain way for a certain period of time.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his efforts on this issue, not just for \nbringing forth the economic stimulus package but doing so in such a \nconstructive way, trying to find that which was common among most of \nthe proposals that have been offered and to bring together consensus \nwhere consensus can be achieved.\n  This legislation is, at the very least, a building block for a \npackage with which most would be hard pressed to disagree. If each of \nus were to come up with what we thought was the best economic stimulus \nfor the country and put together our own package, we would have had at \nleast 100 different bills.\n  In fact, if I had my way, I would probably do some of this \ndifferently, but I think when a package is put together and we take a \nclose look, as we are, at individual ideas that might differ with the \npackage, that might be supplemental, we are certainly seeing what the \nSenate is all about, and that is diverse opinions being fully debated \nto try to help this country out of its economic doldrums. In fact, if I \nhad my way, I would include a provision addressing the net operating \nlosses, or the NOLs, for a longer period of time because I think by \nextending the period of time it would help business shoulder the burden \nof the current economic downturn. So I think it is important we \nconsider an NOL extender as well.\n  Over the past few months, we have heard so much talk from both sides \nabout the need for an economic stimulus. Recently, we had the Chairman \nof the Fed say perhaps it was not as necessary as it might have been \nbefore, and we have heard others say we should have done it last year.\n  As anyone knows, there were a handful of us--maybe more than a \nhandful--who wanted to do it last year, but that is not a reason not to \ndo something this year in the context of where we are.\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\n  I think that is what Senator Daschle has offered us, an opportunity \nto revisit, to rethink, and to package together a stimulus package that \nwould work for the future to help us, if not come out of the deepest of \na recession, from falling further into a recession or, if we are \nalready on the way out of the recession, to expedite the return to \neconomic prosperity.\n  There will be those who will say this package is not perfect. There \nis not anyone who says that it is. Legislation is never perfect, but it \nis as close to an agreement that has presented itself.\n  I certainly hope to thank Senator Daschle for taking this action \nbecause I think it will, in fact, help us enter a threshold of \nprogress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am writing to the President of the \nUnited States today concerning what I consider to be a very important \nsubject, and that is the interrogation of the al-Qaida and Taliban war \ncaptives, where an issue has been raised as to whether they are \nprisoners of war or what is their status, with some people objecting to \nwhat is going on in the way they are being handled. There is no doubt \nthat the captives are entitled to humane treatment. There have been \ninspection tours by national observers and by congressional observers. \nThe reports are uniform that the captives are being treated humanely. \nThey are being fed and clothed. There is medical care. They are \npermitted to attend to their religious activities. All of this is \ntotally separate and apart from the basic availability of those \nindividuals to be questioned, where information which they might \nprovide could shed light on the possibility of additional terrorist \nattacks.\n  Having some experience as an investigator and a prosecutor, I know \nfirsthand the value of interrogation and intensive interrogation. We \nare facing at this moment an enormous threat from al-Qaida. We saw what \nhappened on September 11. There have been three terrorist alerts since \nthen. The fact is there are al-Qaida spread all over the face of the \nEarth. They are in Somalia, they are in the Philippines, in Malaysia, \nin the Sudan. We know their tactics are based on long-term planning \nprojects. We know they have sleeper cells. There is reason to be \nconcerned that at any moment there could be another al-Qaida attack. We \ndo not know where. We do not know when. We do not know if. But we have \nto be very vigilant.\n  Where these interrogations of the al-Qaida and Taliban captives might \nlead to some information, then that ought to be pursued, and it ought \nto be pursued vigorously.\n  As a matter of international law, there is a mistaken notion you can \nonly ask a prisoner of war his name, rank, date of birth, and serial \nnumber. The international law experts, and I have cited them in my \nletter to President Bush, are in agreement that other questions may be \nasked. Certainly there cannot be torture. Certainly there cannot be \ncoercion--physical coercion or mental coercion. But there is no reason \nwhy those captives cannot be questioned.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld deviations from \nstandard constitutional rights where there is an imminent threat of \nharm. For example, in the landmark case of Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. \n697, the issue came up on the question of prior restraint to stop the \npublication of a newspaper. And albeit dictum, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States said there could be a curtailment of that kind of a \nfundamental constitutional right if, for example, the publication of \nthe sailing date of a troop ship would place that ship in jeopardy. The \npossibility of another attack on the United States, considering what \nhappened on September 11, we know is much more serious than an attack \non a troop ship.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in a celebrated case called \nNew York v. Quarles, 467 U.S. 649, came to the conclusion that the \nconstitutional rights of a suspect under the Miranda decision could be \ncircumvented if there was an immediate threat of danger to a police \nofficer or the public. That matter involved a rape. A police officer \npursued the suspect, saw the suspect wearing a holster, and without \ngiving him ``Miranda'' warnings, asked where the gun was. The Supreme \nCourt of the United States said that where there is an imminent threat \nto public safety, constitutional rights may be abrogated, and \nstatements may be admissible into evidence.\n  But we know the very major difference between questioning for \nintelligence purposes and questioning for admissibility in court. I am \nnot proposing this interrogation be continued for the purpose of \nobtaining evidence to use against these captives, but if there is any \nchance at all that this interrogation could lead to information which \ncould thwart another terrorist attack, then it is the fundamental duty \nof the United States Government to pursue that kind of interrogation.\n  This matter is on the front pages today. It will be the subject of a \nlot of debate. I think it ought to be known generally that there is \nsolid constitutional authority, international law authority, to \nquestion prisoners of war beyond name, rank, and serial number. No \ntorture. Obviously, humane treatment. But if we can get any information \nwhich would prevent a terrorist attack, it is our duty to do so.\n  That is why I am writing to the President and want to make this brief \nstatement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S221-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S221-S222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SALUTING COLONEL EDWARD A. RICE, JR.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I want to honor the commanding \nofficer at Ellsworth Air Force Base--who has just returned home after \ndirecting Air Force operations over Afghanistan and who will become a \nbrigadier general this week.\n  This outstanding officer, Colonel Edward A. Rice, Jr., has \ndemonstrated his leadership abilities in a number of settings, and my \nfellow Senators can expect to hear more of him as he assumes new roles \nand responsibilities in our nation's service.\n  As commander of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing, Colonel Rice \ndirected the main Air Force combat group operating over Afghanistan \nfrom late September until mid-January. This force of 1,800 personnel \nand 30 planes (including B-1 bombers, B-52 bombers, and KC-10 tankers), \ndelivered most of the ordnance that was so effective in shattering the \nTaliban and al Qaeda forces.\n  All branches of the military played a role in this first victory in \nthe war against terrorism, but as an Air Force veteran and a South \nDakotan, I am particularly proud of the achievements of Colonel Rice \nand the forces under his command.\n  Our experience in Afghanistan extends a military trend that began in \nour war against Iraq--the unprecedented ability of modern air power to \nachieve strategic objectives. Clearly our planes and munitions were \nmarkedly more precise, quicker to hit emerging targets, and generally \nmore effective than the Soviet forces of the 1980s. A recent book \nlabeled this trend ``The Transformation of American Air Power,'' and I \nbelieve Afghanistan will become the most recent example, joining the \nimpressive results of the Gulf War, Kosovo, and our other Balkan \ncampaigns.\n  In addition, the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing broke new ground in \nseveral areas.\n  Its bombers were the first to deliver our near-precision munitions in \ncombat. These use navigational signals from GPS satellites to locate \ntargets. They are much cheaper than laser-guided ``precision'' \nmunitions and are not hampered by low-visibility weather conditions. \nAlso, in coordination with ground spotters, the bombers were able to \nuse advanced communications to reduce dramatically the time from target \nidentification to target strike.\n  Despite its controversial and troubled early years, I am also pleased \nthat the B-1 continues its strong combat performance that began during \nOperation Desert Fox over Iraq and extended into the war in Kosovo. Its\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\nrange and expansive bomb bays allowed it to make a round trip of nearly \n6,000 miles, and also loiter over the battlefield with a variety of \nmunitions, waiting for targets to emerge. Throughout this demanding, \nround-the-clock operation, Colonel Rice reports, B-1 made all scheduled \ntakeoffs, released all weapons successfully, and delivered ordnance \nwith excellent accuracy.\n  Colonel Rice returned home from this mission about two weeks ago, \njust in time to be promoted to brigadier general. The Senate confirmed \nhis nomination on September 26, 2001, and the pinning ceremony occurs \nFriday, February 1, at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n  Since arriving at Ellsworth in May 2000, Colonel Rice's performance \nhas been impressive, and I know that as a general, he will be a \ntremendous asset for the Air Force. During Rice's tenure, Ellsworth has \ndramatically improved its maintenance performance, chalked up \nimpressive results in its 2001 Operational Readiness Inspection, and \nmoved to the front of the pack in Air Combat Command assessments of \ncommand, control and communication; bomb removal; and response to \nnuclear-biological-chemical (NBC) hazards.\n  The men and women of Ellsworth have also benefitted from the \ndedicated service of Colonel Rice's wife, Teresa. When base personnel \ndeployed for the war against terrorism. Teresa co-hosted a series of \ntown-hall meetings with the acting base commander to update spouses and \nfamilies on the status of their loved ones and to educate them on the \nrole their family was playing to make America safe. In less stressful \ntimes, she volunteers twice a week in the base thrift shop, has been \nactive in the Officer Spouses Club, and has organized and attended \nholiday parties, retirement ceremonies, promotion celebrations and \nfarewells--too many to count.\n  In closing, Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to welcome \nColonel Rice back home to Ellsworth after the successful execution of \nhis mission in Operation enduring Freedom. His remaining time in South \nDakota grows short, but I know I speak for many South Dakotans when I \nsay it has been an honor to work with him and Teresa and to call them \nneighbors. They are a credit to their country, and we wish them all the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S222-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S222-S223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to bring to the Senate's \nattention a valuable report on the State of the Union for Americans \nwith Disabilities. As a triple amputee, having lost my right arm and \nboth legs in the Vietnam war, I believe that the Americans with \nDisabilities Act has not only helped me and others with disabilities \nbut has also enabled society to benefit from the skills and talents of \nindividuals with disabilities. The landmark legislation has also \nallowed us all to gain from their increased purchasing power and \nability to use it, and has led to fuller, more productive lives for all \nAmericans. However, there is still much to be done so I am pleased to \nhighlight the efforts of the National Organization on Disability which \ncelebrates the progress of the nation and works to increase access, \nopportunity, and inclusion for people with disabilities. I ask \nunanimous consent to print for the Record a copy of the National \nOrganization on Disability's State of the Union 2002 for Americans with \nDisabilities which provides benchmarks for the current state of \ndisability life in America, and calls for action on improvements that \nhave still to be made.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      The State of the Union 2002 for Americans With Disabilities\n\n       On January 29, President George W. Bush will deliver the \n     State of the Union Address. He surely will focus heavily on \n     the terrible attacks on the country just over four months \n     ago, and the overwhelming national and international response \n     to them. He also can be expected to address the core issues \n     of the nation and his presidency, including the economy; \n     employment; education; access to the goods and services \n     people want and need; and strengthening the social fiber and \n     community life that make people so proud to be Americans. He \n     will strive to reach out to people from diverse parts of \n     American life.\n       One group that we trust the President will mention--and \n     that surely will be affected--is the disability community. As \n     many as one in five Americans--54 million men, women and \n     children--live with disabilities, as of course do their \n     family members, friends, and service providers. Disabilities \n     run a wide gamut, including mental and physical conditions; \n     visible and non-visible ones; conditions that people are born \n     with, or develop during their lifetimes as a result of \n     illness, age, accident, or attack; and ones that have varying \n     degrees of severity. But all fall within a common definition: \n     They in some way limit people's ability to participate fully \n     in one or more major life activities. Nobody should dismiss \n     disability issues as unimportant to them, for any person can \n     join the disability community in an instant.\n       As detailed below, Americans with disabilities remain \n     pervasively disadvantaged in all aspects of American life. In \n     his second week in office, President Bush sent a strong \n     message of concern about this situation when he announced the \n     New Freedom Initiative. Coming a decade after his father \n     signed the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the New \n     Freedom Initiative lays out an ambitious agenda for assuring \n     the full participation of people with disabilities in all \n     aspects of American life. The New Freedom Initiative holds \n     much promise. We look forward to working with the government \n     and the American people to bring it to fruition.\n       The Disability Community in a Changed World September 11 \n     and its aftermath, stunned, shook and saddened the nation. \n     The terrorist attacks made all Americans, especially those \n     touched by disabilities, reevaluate our lifestyles, and \n     consider what we could change to better protect ourselves and \n     our loved ones.\n       The nation was moved to learn of wheelchair users who \n     perished while awaiting rescue when the World Trade Center \n     towers fell. We also were inspired by the stories of several \n     people who had severe disabilities and survived. One man \n     escaped after walking down dozens of flights of stairs on his \n     artificial leg, and another with the aid of his guide dog. \n     Two wheelchair users were carried to safety by their \n     colleagues.\n       These survivors, like many of the others who escaped before \n     the towers collapsed, benefited from intensive emergency \n     drills that had been conducted since the World Trade Center \n     bombing in 1993. The survival is testament to how critical \n     emergency planning and preparedness is--whether the emergency \n     is natural, man-made or terrorist-driven. This has inspired a \n     new focus in the disability community on disaster \n     preparedness\n       According to a late 2001 Harris Poll survey released by the \n     National Organization Disability (N.O.D.), 58 percent of \n     people with disabilities say they do not know whom to contact \n     about emergency plans for their community in the event of a \n     terrorist attack or other crisis. Sixty-one percent say that \n     they have not made plans to quickly and safely evacuate their \n     home. Among those who are employed full or part time, 50 \n     percent say no plans have been made to safely evacuate their \n     workplace.\n       All these percentages are higher than for those without \n     disabilities. The country as a whole has much catching up to \n     do to be prepared, but people with disabilities lag behind \n     everyone else. This is a critical discrepancy, because those \n     of us with disabilities must in fact be better prepared to \n     not be at a disadvantage in any emergency.\n       Intense national planning for emergencies is needed. This \n     requires the enthusiastic cooperation of the government, \n     business, and communities. People with disabilities should \n     not be considered only as beneficiaries of emergency \n     preparedness plans devised by others--they belong at the \n     table, contributing their unique perspectives, insights and \n     experiences, so the resultant plans will be the best for all \n     Americans. People with disabilities must be included on \n     community preparedness committees across the national and at \n     the highest levels of government planning. We are pleased \n     that Office of Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge has \n     pledged to appoint at least one person with a disability to a \n     high-level position in his organization.\n\n\n                               Employment\n\n       The slowing economy was a significant issue before \n     September 11, and this situation became more critical after \n     the terrorist attacks. This is not an easy time for anyone to \n     enter the workforce, but that is what many people with \n     disabilities are desperately trying to do.\n       Only 32 percent of Americans with disabilities of working \n     age are employed full or part time. That number is in \n     contrast to 81 percent of other Americans, according to \n     the comprehensive 2000 N.O.D./Harris Survey of Americans \n     with Disabilities. It is a national tragedy that, nearly a \n     dozen years after the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, the vast majority of Americans with \n     disabilities remain unemployed. This is not by choice; two \n     out of three who are not employed say they would prefer to \n     be working. Any efforts that lead to their becoming \n     employed are good investments that will benefit these \n     individuals, the workforce, and the economy.\n       President Bush has demonstrated a commitment to greater \n     employment for people with disabilities in the New Freedom \n     Initiative. We now call on the President and the Congress to \n     keep employment a priority and work together toward a \n     national goal of 38 percent employment for people with \n     disabilities by 2005, with continuing progress toward 50 \n     percent in the decade to follow.\n       Indeed, employment numbers should be increasing, if for no \n     other reason than that\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\n     there are new ways for people to be employed. Technology \n     offers real hope. Computers and the Internet are opening \n     doors. People who are deaf use ``instant messaging'' to have \n     real-time conversations; people who are blind use voice-\n     synthesis technology to write the read documents and website \n     information; and people with limited ability to get to an \n     office have new ways to work from home. Use of the Internet \n     by people with disabilities is growing rapidly, in fact at \n     twice the pace of other Americans.\n       Too often, even when people with disabilities find jobs, \n     they are low-level, low-paying jobs. Yet it is well \n     documented that employers find employees with disabilities \n     excel at all levels. In the healthcare and education sectors, \n     for example, there is room for many more people with \n     disabilities.\n       The disability community is troubled by two recent \n     employment-related Supreme Court decisions that undercut this \n     group's primary civil rights law, the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act. Last February's Garrett v. Alabama decision \n     threatened the implementation of the ADA. This month's \n     decision in Toyota v. Williams continues a disturbing trend \n     by the Court to narrow the ADA's protections, and caused one \n     of the 1990 law's Congressional authors to suggest revisiting \n     the statute so that it meets the goal of expansive, not \n     restrictive, coverage for workers with disabilities. People \n     with disabilities belong in the workforce, and Congress must \n     indeed make it a priority to strengthen and defend the \n     legislation that affirms employment as a natural expectation. \n     The Supreme Court will hear other cases that test the ADA. \n     The Court must recognize that when it interprets the will of \n     Congress and the Constitution, it has the opportunity to \n     strengthen rather than weaken the ADA--and strengthening it \n     reflects the will of the vast majority of Americans.\n\n\n                             income levels\n\n       It is not surprising, given the lower rate of employment \n     for people with disabilities, that a significant income gap \n     exist between those with and without disabilities. People who \n     have disabilities are roughly three times as likely to live \n     in poverty, with annual household incomes below $15,000 (29 \n     percent versus 10 percent). Conversely, people with \n     disabilities are less than half as likely to live in \n     households that earn more than $50,000 annually (16 \n     percent versus 39 percent). This income gap contributes to \n     and compounds the disadvantages that people with \n     disabilities face.\n\n\n                        Access to Transportation\n\n       People who have disabilities often have insufficient access \n     to transportation, with 30 percent citing this as a problem--\n     three times the rate of the non-disabled. This creates a \n     catch-22 situation: How can one have a job if one cannot get \n     to it? How can one afford transportation if one does not have \n     a job? There is an urgent need for more and better \n     disability-friendly transportation in the cities and towns of \n     America.\n\n\n                         Access to Health Care\n\n       Health care is also less accessible to Americans with \n     disabilities, who often are the citizens needing it most. Due \n     in large part to their limited employment and reduced \n     discretionary income, people with disabilities are more than \n     twice as likely to delay needed health care because they \n     cannot afford it (28 percent versus 12 percent of others).\n       There is a critical need for further legislation to protect \n     people with disabilities who need medical treatment, and aid \n     them in getting their needed medications. Congress and the \n     Administration must pass the patients' bill of rights; expand \n     health insurance coverage to cover all Americans, including \n     those who are not employed; and ensure that peoples' \n     opportunities to fully participate in life activities are not \n     artificially restricted by their limited access to \n     healthcare.\n\n\n                               Education\n\n       Opportunity begins, in so many ways, with education. \n     Currently, young people with disabilities are more than twice \n     as likely to drop out of high school (22 percent versus 9 \n     percent), and only half as likely to complete college (12 \n     percent versus 23 percent). Education for students with \n     disabilities is a critical priority. Students with special \n     needs must be given the chance to develop their skills and \n     their minds so they can be prepared for the workforce of the \n     future. In the first decade of the new millennium, America \n     should dramatically close these gaps in opportunities for \n     students with disabilities.\n       It bodes well that Congress has increased funding for the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 19 percent \n     this year to $7.5 billion. This investment will pay huge \n     dividends for the students and families impacted by the IDEA, \n     and for the country.\n       Tremendous progress has been made in ``mainstreaming'' \n     students with disabilities since the IDEA was first \n     introduced nearly three decades ago. Mainstreaming is a win/\n     win situation that increases opportunities for those \n     students, and also acclimates other students to peer \n     interaction. Youngsters who have friends and acquaintances \n     with disabilities learn to move beyond the disability and \n     judge the real person. They grow up expecting to interact \n     with diverse people in the workforce and in their \n     communities, dissolving prejudices and stereotypes in the \n     process.\n\n\n                             Community Life\n\n       It is in the communities of this nation that its 54 million \n     citizens with disabilities go about their daily lives, and \n     this is where these citizens need to be involved. Great \n     progress has been made; commitments from mayors and other \n     leaders have transformed many communities. Disability \n     advocates, no longer willing to be separated from the rest of \n     society, have pushed their communities into becoming more \n     accessible and welcoming places. There is much work still to \n     be done.\n       Thirty-five percent of people with disabilities say they \n     are not at all involved with their communities, compared to \n     21 percent of their non-disabled counterparts. Not \n     surprisingly then, those with disabilities are one and a half \n     times as likely to feel isolated from others or left out of \n     their community than those without disabilities.\n       The current efforts for disaster mobilization are one \n     example of an opportunity for the disability community to \n     remind civic leaders of their responsibility to plan for all \n     citizens. This work may open dialogue in many new and \n     productive directions with regard to overall community \n     efforts.\n\n\n                             Religious Life\n\n       Faith and religious life are important for many Americans. \n     Churches, synagogues and mosques need to be accessible to all \n     who wish to worship. With the theme ``Access: It begins in \n     the heart,'' thousands of houses of worship have enrolled in \n     the Accessible Congregations Campaign. Hopefully many other \n     congregations in the country also will commit to identifying \n     and removing barriers of architecture, communications and \n     attitudes that prevent people with disabilities from \n     practicing their faith.\n\n\n                         Political Involvement\n\n       Citizens with disabilities want to vote, and are doing so \n     at increasing rates. What had been a 20 percentage point \n     participation gap--31 percent versus more than 50 percent--in \n     the 1996 Presidential election was halved when 41 percent of \n     voting-aged citizens with disabilities cast ballots in 2000. \n     This followed a national get-out-the-disability-vote effort. \n     But many polling places remain inaccessible to wheelchair \n     users and others with limited mobility. Once inside the \n     building, others encounter voting machines they cannot use. \n     Persons with limited vision or hand strength are particularly \n     disadvantaged at the polls. People with disabilities want to \n     vote on election day, at the polls, just like everyone else.\n       Technological improvements now available could make voting \n     at the polls possible for nearly all people with \n     disabilities. All that is needed is the will, or a legal \n     requirement, to put such voting machines into use. The \n     contested 2000 Presidential Election showed that every \n     vote counts. The disability community is determined to \n     have full enfranchisement.\n       Late in 2001, the House of Representatives passed a bill \n     that did not adequately address the above issues. The \n     Senate's version of the bill, currently under review, is far \n     more promising. Millions of voters and potential voters will \n     be tracking this legislation in the hope that it will improve \n     the voting system for all Americans. None of the barriers \n     that have kept citizens with disabilities from voting should \n     be allowed to remain by the time of the 2004 Presidential \n     election, and the disability community calls on the \n     government at all levels to ensure these obstacles are \n     removed.\n\n\n                          the overall picture\n\n       A clear majority of people with disabilities, 63 percent, \n     say that live has improved for the disability community in \n     the past decade. But when asked about life satisfaction, only \n     33 percent say they are very satisfied with their life in \n     general--half as many as among those without disabilities. \n     There is much room for improvement, and the disability \n     community looks to the President and his Administration, the \n     Congress, and all those in a position of community leadership \n     to work proactively and productively with us to ensure that \n     no person with a disability is left behind.\n       Anyone with a disability perspective who travels abroad \n     returns impressed by the way America is, in many ways, the \n     world leader in access, opportunity, and inclusion for people \n     with disabilities. Much progress has been made, and many \n     walls of exclusion have been leveled. People with \n     disabilities celebrate the progress of this nation, and also \n     remain dedicated to the vision of a day when all people, no \n     matter how they are born or what conditions they acquire, \n     will be full and equal participants in American life. This is \n     our dream for the State of the Union.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S223-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S223-S224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence \nrecently published a report highlighting the progress made in state \nlaws to protect children from guns and gun violence. The evaluation \nfocused on a number of laws addressing juvenile possession of guns, \nsafe storage, childproof guns, background checks and carrying concealed \nweapons, among other issues. The nation as a whole received a grade of \nC+. However, 29 States received grades of D or F. The report reveals \nthe fact that our Nation's gun laws are a patchwork providing uneven \nand often ineffective protection for our Nation's children. In fact, \nthe death rate of youth in the 7 States that received an F grade was 33 \npercent higher than the average firearms death rate for the 10 States \nthat received an A or a B. This discrepancy illustrates the need for \ncommon sense gun safety laws and is a strong argument for Federal \naction.\n  Last year, I cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Durbin, the \nChildren's Firearm Prevention Act. Under this bill, adults who fail to \nlock up a loaded firearm or an unloaded firearm with ammunition would \nbe held liable if the weapon is taken by a child and used to kill or \ninjure themselves or another person. The bill also increases the \npenalties for selling a gun to a juvenile and creates a gun safety \neducation program that includes parent-teacher organizations, local law \nenforcement and community organizations. This bill is similar to a bill \nPresident Bush signed into law during his tenure as the Governor of \nTexas. I support this bill and hope the Senate will act on it during \nthis Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S224-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S224-S227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nENDING THE WORST FORMS OF CHILD LABOR AND FORCED LABOR IN THE COCOA AND \n                      CHOCOLATE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we all know that values matter to \nAmericans. It is also becoming increasingly clear that they matter \ninside the global marketplace as well as outside. That explains why, \naccording to a recent nationwide poll, 77 percent of Americans said \nthey would likely look for a label when purchasing if there was a label \non some products to indicate that they were made without the use of \nexploitive child labor.\n  Most Americans also understand that in today's complex, interwoven \nglobal economy, some of our cherished values come into conflict with \none another in new and different ways and require very difficult trade-\noffs. For example, more free trade and free enterprise, as practiced in \nthe real world versus more economic fairness, social justice and \nenvironmental sustainability. Recognizing this creative tension, 76 \npercent of Americans in a recent nationwide poll on globalization said \nthey would pay more and buy a piece of clothing for $25 that is \ncertified as not made in a sweatshop instead of buying the same article \nof clothing for $20 if they were not sure how it was made. Most \nAmericans clearly want to bring our fundamental values--a sense of fair \nplay, universal respect for human rights and worker rights, better \nstewardship of our shared environment, and more hope and equal \nopportunity for our children and grandchildren--into the conduct of \ninternational business and investment. But so far the global \nmarketplace isn't readily giving American consumers and investors that \nchoice.\n  Then what were we to do when the Knight-Ridder newspapers in June, \n2001 brought us--a nation of chocaholics--face to face with child \nslavery in the production and harvesting of cocoa beans in the Ivory \nCoast. This impoverished West African country exports more than 40 \npercent of the world's supply of this agricultural commodity.\n  To his credit, Congressman Elliott Engel from New York immediately \nsaw the contradiction and reacted with outrage. He took to the House \nfloor last summer and won passage of an amendment to the House version \nof the fiscal year 2002 Agriculture Appropriations bill on a very lop-\nsided, bipartisan vote. His amendment would have provided $250,000 for \nthe Food and Drug Administration, FDA, to come up with a label to \nattach to all chocolate products for sale and distribution in the U.S. \nwithin one year to attest that they were made without any child slave \nlabor. While both the FDA and the chocolate companies quickly protested \nthat such a goal was unrealistic and impossible to attain, I shared \nCongressman Engel's resolve that clear and decisive corrective action \nhad to be taken.\n  Accordingly, I called representatives of the major chocolate \ncompanies to a meeting early last July to underscore the seriousness of \nthe forced child labor problem that had been exposed in their chain of \nproduction and to determine what they planned to do about it. I also \nreminded them at that time that U.S. law currently prohibits the \nimporting of any products made, whole or in part, with forced or \nindentured child labor. And Senator Kohl, our Agriculture \nAppropriations Subcommittee chairman, and I gave notice of our intent \nto offer an amendment on the Senate floor, if need be, as early as last \nSeptember. This set the stage for a series of lengthy, intense \nnegotiations, set in motion by Senator Kohl, between ourselves and \nrepresentatives of the major chocolate companies and cocoa bean \nprocessors.\n  I insisted from our first meeting that to avoid Senate legislation, \nthe industry would have to meet two requirements:\n  First, they would have to commit to a set of principles and a time-\nbound action plan to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, \nincluding but not limited to forced child labor, throughout their chain \nof production and as a matter of the utmost urgency.\n  Second, if and when we might arrive at a mutually-acceptable \nframework agreement, they--the industry--would have to take that \nframework agreement to the other, non-industry stakeholders with an \ninterest and expertise in child labor problem-solving and persuade them \nto participate as full partners in hammering out and fulfilling all of \nthe requirements in this agreement on a mutually-acceptable basis and \naccording to firm, prescribed deadlines.\n  I am happy to say these fundamental requirements were met when the \nHarkin-Engel Protocol on the Worst Forms of Child Labor in the Cocoa \nand Chocolate Industry was signed and announced publicly last October \n1. This unprecedented framework agreement that will result in a \ncredible, public certification system of industry-wide global standards \nwithin 4 years to attest that cocoa beans and all of their derivative \nproducts have been produced without any of the worst forms of child \nlabor as clearly defined in ILO Convention No. 182.\n  We knew at the outset that it would not be easy to achieve this \nbreakthrough. While there were strong, initial objections raised about \nlabeling by some industry spokespersons, it also became clear in the \ncourse of our negotiations that a reliable labeling system could be \ndeveloped, given the political will and incentives to do so. Officials \nof the ILO and some company representatives themselves acknowledged it \ncould be achieved in this far-flung industry in 3-5 years. It was a \nmatter of how quickly industry-wide standards could be defined, \nimplemented, and subjected to effective, independent monitoring, and \npublic reporting by all major stakeholders.\n  Let me be clear. The Harkin-Engel Protocol on the Worst Forms of \nChild Labor is a very good agreement, but it is not perfect. It is a \nbreakthrough that sets out a specific, finite timetable during which \nsomething will be built incrementally that has never existed before--\nthe capacity to publicly and credibly certify worldwide that cocoa \nbeans and all of the products made from them have been produced and \nprocessed free of any of the worst forms of child labor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have copies of this \nunprecedented agreement and its underlying principles re-printed in \ntheir entirety in the Record following my remarks. It is to be called \nthe Protocol For The Growing And Processing Of Cocoa Beans In A Manner \nThat Complies With ILO Convention 182 Concerning The Prohibition And \nImmediate Action\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\nFor The Elimination Of The Worst Forms Of Child Labor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to briefly highlight key provisions that together \nmake this framework agreement a real breakthrough:\n\n  First, it requires the industry to publicly acknowledge the use of \nforced child labor and to assume primary responsibility, including \nfinancial responsibility, for ending these intolerable practices. This \nis only fair and right.\n  Second, it requires the industry to partner and bargain every step of \nthe way with the other major stakeholders cocoa producers, organized \nlabor, non-governmental organizations, consumer groups and governments \namong them--who have an interest and expertise in achieving the \nabolition of the worst forms of child labor in this sector. Last \nDecember 1, all of these stakeholders hammered out and signed a \nmutually-acceptable joint statement that recognizes and affirms their \nshared commitment to act together with urgency to eliminate the worst \nforms of child labor in the cocoa and chocolate business. I ask \nunanimous consent that this public statement also appear in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Furthermore, by next May, a binding, public memorandum of cooperation \nmust be agreed among all of the major stakeholders that establishes a \njoint program of research, information exchange, and action to enforce \ninternationally-recognized standards to eliminate the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor from this sector of agriculture and food \nprocessing worldwide.\n  Third, by next July, this industry will have made its initial down-\npayment of funds to establish a new international foundation to oversee \nand sustain over time the global effort to eliminate the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor in the growing and processing of cocoa \nbeans and their derivative products. This will be a private, non-profit \nfoundation governed and administered by all of the major stakeholders. \nThe support of field projects in the Ivory Coast and other cocoa-\nexporting countries along with the establishment of a clearinghouse on \nbest practices to eliminate the worst forms of child labor will be \namong its initial purposes.\n  Fourth, this framework agreement must yield within 4 years the first-\never global capacity in this sector to publicly and credibly certify \nthat the cocoa and chocolate products we eat and enjoy every day have \nbeen produced without any child slavery or use of any of the worst \nforms of child labor. This will be a giant step forward. A very diverse \nset of stakeholders has publicly committed ourselves for the first time \nin America and abroad to rooting out and ending the worst forms of \nchild labor and forced labor, wherever they exist. The resulting system \nof public certification should take us 99 percent of the way during the \nnext 4 years toward a credible and effective means of empowering \nconsumers to reliably do the right thing. It would be my hope and \nexpectation at that point in time, if not sooner, that one or many of \nthe stakeholder companies will take the final step and decide for \nitself that it is in their own interest as well as the public interest \nto give their customers what most consumers in America and around the \nworld want--products with a reliable label ensuring that none of the \nworst forms of child labor have been associated with their production.\n  Now I want to conclude my statement by recalling the life and vision \nof a great American, Milton Hershey, whose legacy from the 20th century \nis relevant to the 21st century challenge that has brought the Harkin-\nEngel Protocol into being. He grew up in family in Pennsylvania that \nwas almost always broke and constantly on the move. Neighbors \nremembered seeing him as a boy going about the streets barefoot, \nselling berries door-to-door. But as a young man, he started a small \ncompany making caramels--The Lancaster Caramel Company--and built it \ninto a thriving interstate business. At the age of 33, he was wealthier \nthan he had ever dreamed. That was even before he started the Hershey \nChocolate Company in a back corner of his caramel factory. The rest is \nhistory, as he went on to give America our first five-cent milk \nchocolate candy bar and became fabulously rich.\n  But it was Hershey's philanthropic example that stands out and is \nmost relevant. In 1909, just 6 years after breaking ground for his \nfirst chocolate factory, he and his wife set up a trust fund to found a \nschool for poor, orphaned boys. The Hershey Industrial School continues \nto flourish today, having provided a good home and a better chance in \nlife for nearly a century for countless thousands of American children \nin need. In fact, at a comparative young age, he donated his entire \nestate to the Hershey Trust Fund for the benefit of the school, \nincluding land and all of his stock valued at more than $60 million in \n1918.\n  Today, Milton Hershey's remarkable gift is worth more than $5 billion \nand the school is one of the richest private education institutions in \nour country. It continues to provide a home and quality education to \nmore than 1,000 students every year--girls and boys of all races and \nreligions who come mostly from broken families in poor inner-city \nneighborhoods.\n  If he was alive today, I think he would approve of this unprecedented \nframework agreement and the collaborative, child labor problem-solving \nprocess it has set in motion. He wouldn't see these child slaves in the \nIvory Coast as children of a lesser god. Surely, he would open his \nheart and his wallet to do no less for the impoverished and powerless \nchildren of the Ivory Coast, Brazil, Ghana, Indonesia, and all the \nother cocoa-producing countries. All of the stakeholders in this \nbreakthrough agreement should do no less. Now we have to roll up our \nsleeves, go to work building certification capacity, and meet all of \nthe deadlines to confidently eliminate the worst forms of child labor \nand forced labor from the cocoa and chocolate business worldwide once \nand for all. In so doing, we will have hopefully blazed a new trail and \nprovided a worthy model that is transferable to other industries where \nmillions of child laborers work in darkness and without prospects for a \nbrighter future.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                          Chocolate Manufacturers Association,\n\n                                                       Vienna, VA.\n\n   Protocol for the Growing and Processing of Cocoa Beans and Their \n Derivative Products In a Manner that Complies with ILO Convention 182 \nConcerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the Elimination of \n                     the Worst Form of Child Labor\n\n                          Guiding Principles:\n\n       OBJECTIVE--Cocoa beans and their derivative products should \n     be grown and processed in a manner that complies with \n     International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 182 \n     Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate Action for the \n     Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor. ILO Convention \n     182 is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.\n       RESPONSIBILITY--Achieving this objective is possible only \n     through partnership among the major stakeholders: \n     governments, global industry (comprised of major \n     manufacturers of cocoa and chocolate products as well as \n     other, major cocoa users), cocoa producers, organized labor, \n     non-governmental organizations, and consumers. Each partner \n     has important responsibilities. This protocol evidences \n     industry's commitment to carry out its responsibilities \n     through continuation and expansion of ongoing programs in \n     cocoa-producing countries and through the other steps \n     described in this document.\n       CREDIBLE, EFFECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING--In fashioning a long-\n     term solution, the problem-solving process should involve the \n     major stakeholders in order to maximize both the credibility \n     and effectiveness of the problem-solving action plan that is \n     mutually-agreed upon.\n       SUSTAINABILITY--A multi-sectoral infrastructure, including \n     but independent of the industry, should be created to develop \n     the action plan expeditiously.\n       ILO EXPERTISE--Consistent with its support for ILO \n     Convention 182, industry recognizes the ILO's unique \n     expertise and welcomes its involvement in addressing this \n     serious problem. The ILO must have a ``seat at the table'' \n     and an active role in assessing, monitoring, reporting on, \n     and remedying the worst forms of child labor in the growing \n     and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products.\n\n Key Action Plan and Steps to Eliminate the Worst Forms of Child Labor:\n\n       (1) Public Statement of Need for and Terms of an Action \n     Plan--Industry has publicly acknowledged the problem of \n     forced child labor in West Africa and will continue to commit \n     significant resources to address it. West African nations \n     also have acknowledged the problem and have taken steps under \n     their\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\n     own laws to stop the practice. More is needed because, while \n     the scope of the problem is uncertain, the occurrence of the \n     worst forms of child labor in the growing and processing of \n     cocoa beans and their derivative products is imply \n     unacceptable. Industry will reiterate its acknowledgment of \n     the problem and in a highly-public way will commit itself to \n     this protocol.\n       (2) Formation of Mutli-Sectoral Advisory Groups--By October \n     1, 2001, an advisory group will be constituted with \n     particular responsibility for the on-going investigation of \n     labor practices in West Africa. By December 1, 2001, industry \n     will constitute a broad consultative group with \n     representatives of major stakeholders to advise in the \n     formulation of appropriate remedies for the elimination of \n     the worst forms of child labor in the growing and processing \n     of cocoa beans and their derivative products.\n       (3) Signed Joint Statement on Child Labor to Be Witnessed \n     at the ILO--By December 1, 2001, a joint statement made by \n     the major stakeholders will recognize, as a matter of \n     urgency, the need to end the worst form of child labor in \n     connection with the growing and processing of West African \n     cocoa beans and their derivative products and the need to \n     identify positive developmental alternatives for the children \n     removed from the worst forms of child labor in the growing \n     and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products.\n       (4) Memorandum of Cooperation--By May 1, 2002, there will \n     be a binding memorandum of cooperation among the major \n     stakeholders that establishes a joint action program of \n     research, information exchange, and action to enforce the \n     internationally-recognized and mutually-agreed upon standard \n     to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the growing \n     and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products \n     and to establish independent means of monitoring and public \n     reporting on compliance with those standards.\n       (5) Establishment of Joint Foundation--By July 1, 2002, \n     industry will establish a joint international foundation to \n     oversee and sustain efforts to eliminate the worst forms of \n     child labor in the growing and processing of cocoa beans and \n     their derivative products. This private, not-for-profit \n     foundation will be governed by a Board comprised of industry \n     and other, non-government stakeholders. Industry will provide \n     initial and on-going, primary financial support for the \n     foundation. The foundation's purposes will include field \n     projects and a clearinghouse on best practices to eliminate \n     the worst forms of child labor.\n       (6) Building Toward Credible Standards--In conjunction with \n     governmental agencies and other parties, industry is \n     currently conducing baseline-investigative surveys of child \n     labor practices in West Africa to be completed by December \n     31, 2001. Taking into account those surveys and in accordance \n     with the other deadlines prescribed in this action plan, by \n     July 1, 2005, the industry in partnership with other major \n     stakeholders will develop and implement credible, mutually-\n     acceptable, voluntary, industry-wide standards of public \n     certification, consistent with applicable federal law, that \n     cocoa beans and their derivative products have been grown \n     and/or processed without any of the worst forms of child \n     labor.\n       We, the undersigned, as of September 19, 2001 and \n     henceforth, commit the Chocolate Manufacturers Association, \n     the World Cocoa Foundation, and all of our members \n     wholeheartedly to work with the other major stakeholders, to \n     fulfill the letter and spirit of this Protocol, and to do so \n     in accordance with the deadlines prescribed herein.\n       Mr. Larry Graham, Chocolate Manufacturers Association.\n       Mr. William Guyton, World Cocoa Foundation.\n\n\n                               witnesseth\n\n       We hereby witness the commitment of leaders of the cocoa \n     and chocolate industry evidenced on September 19, 2001 and \n     henceforth to fulfill the letter and spirit of this Protocol \n     to eliminate the worst forms of child labor from this sector \n     as a matter of urgency and in accordance with the terms and \n     deadlines prescribed herein.\n       Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Herbert Kohl, Congressman Eliot \n     Engel.\n       Ambassador Youssoufou Bamba, Embassy of the Ivory Coast.\n       Mr. Frans Roselaers, Director, International Labor \n     Organization.\n       Mr. Ron Oswald, Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' \n     Associations (IUF).\n       Mr. Kevin Bales, Free The Slaves.\n       Ms. Linda Golodner, National Consumers League.\n       Ms. Darlene Adkins, The Child Labor Coalition.\n       We personally support the protocol entered into by industry \n     Protocol for the Growing and Processing of Cocoa Beans and \n     their Derivative products In a Manner that Complies with ILO \n     Convention 182 Concerning the Prohibition and Immediate \n     Action for the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labor \n     and look forward to its successful execution which we support \n     wholeheartedly.\n       Gary Guittard, Guittard Chocolate Company.\n       Edmond Opler, Jr., World's Finest Chocolate, Inc.\n       Bradley Alford, Nestle Chocolate & Confections USA.\n       Richard H.

Members are cocoa converters, industrial chocolate \n     producers, traders or are involved in warehousing and/or in \n     related logistical aspects. Together, ECA members represent \n     close to 75% of Europe's cocoa beans grinding, 50% of \n     Europe's industrial chocolate production and 40% of world \n     production of cocoa liquor, butter and powder.\n       The issue of exploitative child labour clearly requires the \n     commitment of governments as well as co-operation across the \n     entire cocoa chain. In this context, the ECA will continue to \n     play an active role, and hence welcomes the protocol as a \n     valuable step toward the definition of an international \n     response by all concerned parties.\n       It may be expected that the European regulators and \n     industry, taking into consideration their own external \n     environment and relationship with the West African origin \n     countries, will reach similar conclusions that will comfort \n     the needed global approach. ECA, like Caobisco, will ensure \n     that there is complementarity between the above initiative \n     and parallel actions being pursued in Europe.\n                                                Robert A.

This is in line with the Resolution adopted in \n     June 2001 by the International cocoa council, on agricultural \n     working practices, and with the provisions of Article 49 of \n     the International cocoa agreement 1993, regarding fair labour \n     standards.\n       The ICCO supports the above mentioned PROTOCOL.\n       The ICCO encourages its member Governments to investigate \n     and eradicate any criminal child labour activity that might\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\n     exist in their territory in the field of agricultural working \n     practices, in close co-operation with UNICEF, ILO, FAO and \n     the private sector.\n       The ICCO has decided to include in the design of its \n     relevant projects, activities in support of member countries \n     in the eradication of unlawful practices concerning child \n     labour.\n                                                   Kouame Edouard,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Joint Statement, November 30, 2001\n\n       The Association of the Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery \n     Industries of the EU, the Chocolate Manufacturers Association \n     of the USA, the Confectionery Manufacturers Association of \n     Canada, the Cocoa Association of London and the Federation \n     for Cocoa Commerce, the Cocoa Merchants Association of \n     America, the European Cocoa Association, the International \n     Office of Cocoa, Chocolate and Confectionery, the World Cocoa \n     Foundation, the Child Labor Coalition, Free The Slaves, the \n     International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant, \n     Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers Associations, and the \n     National Consumers League (sometimes hereinafter the \n     ``Signatories'') recognize the urgent need to identify and \n     eliminate child labour in violation of International Labour \n     Organization (``ILO'') Convention 182 with respect to the \n     growing and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative \n     products. The Signatories also recognize the need to identify \n     and eliminate practices in violation of ILO Convention 29 \n     with equal urgency.\n       The Signatories affirm their support for the International \n     Labour Organization's (LIO) mission to improve working \n     conditions worldwide, as exemplified in the ILO Declaration \n     on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. We also share \n     the view that practices in violation of ILO Conventions 182 \n     (the ``worst forms of child labour'') and 29 (``forced \n     labour'') result from poverty and a complex set of social and \n     economic conditions often faced by small family farmers and \n     agricultural workers, and that effective solutions to address \n     these violations must include action by appropriate parties \n     to improve overall labour standards and access to education.\n       The Signatories support the framework provided in the \n     Protocol signed by the Chocolate Manufacturers Association \n     and the World Cocoa Foundation on September 19, 2001, which \n     provides for cooperation and for credible, problem solving in \n     West Africa, where a specific program of research, \n     information exchange, and action is immediately warranted. \n     This Joint Statement expresses the shared commitment of the \n     Signatories to work collaboratively toward the goal of \n     eliminating the worst forms of child labour and forced labour \n     in cocoa growing.\n       The strategies developed as part of this process will only \n     be credible to the public and meet the expectations of \n     consumers if there is committed engagement on the part of \n     governments, global industry (comprised of major \n     manufacturers of cocoa and chocolate products as well as \n     other, major cocoa users), cocoa producers, labour \n     representatives, non-governmental organizations, and \n     consumers that have joined this process.\n       The Signatories recognize the need to work in concert with \n     the ILO because the ILO will play an important role in \n     identifying positive strategies, including developmental \n     alternatives for children engaged in the worst forms of child \n     labour and adults engaged in forced labour in the growing and \n     processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products.\n       The strategies to be developed will be effective only if \n     they are comprehensive and part of a durable initiative. The \n     steps to be taken to sustain this initiative include: (i) \n     execution of a binding memorandum of cooperation among the \n     Signatories that establishes a joint action program of \n     research, information exchange, and action to enforce the \n     internationally-recognized and mutually-agreed upon standards \n     to eliminate the worst forms of child labour in the growing \n     and processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products; \n     (ii) incorporation of this research that will include efforts \n     to determine the most appropriate and practicable independent \n     means of monitoring and public reporting in compliance with \n     those standards; and (iii) establishment of a joint \n     foundation to oversee and sustain efforts to eliminate the \n     worst forms of child labour and forced labour in the growing \n     the processing of cocoa beans and their derivative products. \n     The Signatories welcome industry's commitment to provide \n     initial and ongoing, primary financial support for the \n     foundation.\n       We anticipate that other parties may be able to play a \n     positive role in our important work. Subject to mutual \n     consent by the Signatories, additional parties may be invited \n     to sign onto this statement in the future.\n       Witnessed by the International Labour Organization this \n     30th day of November, 2001.

The joint statement was signed by \n     representatives of non-governmental organisations, anti-\n     slavery and human rights experts, consumer groups and labour \n     representatives. The International Labor Organization (ILO) \n     witnessed signature of the statement.\n       The problems of the worst forms of child labour and forced \n     labour are complex and can only effectively be addressed with \n     the commitments of all the partners signing the statement \n     today, together with governments. The global cocoa and \n     chocolate industry is committed to playing an active part in \n     this initiative. A significant effort is under way to asses \n     the precise scope of the problem through independent \n     investigative surveys.

Mr. President, a recent article in the Far Eastern Economic \nReview on China's use of foreign technology to modernize its military \nexplains the far-reaching impact of China's purchase of foreign \ntechnology on that country's military capabilities. For example, it \ndescribes Rolls Royce's recent sale to China of 90 Spey jet engines, \nsome of which will likely be used for the Chinese military's JH-7 \nfighter bombers. The technology used in these engines is admittedly \ndated; but some are concerned that the sale may represent the beginning \nof a larger relationship between Rolls Royce and China. The article \nalso details China's growing reliance on Russian-designed aircraft, \nmissiles, and navy destroyers and submarines. A February 2001 article \nin Jane's Intelligence Review described the relationship further, \nstating:\n\n       Between 1991 and 1996 Russia sold China an estimated $1 \n     billion worth of military weapons and related technologies \n     each year. That figure doubled by 1997. In 1999 the two \n     governments increased the military assistance package for a \n     second time. There is now a five-year program (until 2004) \n     planning $20 billion worth of technology transfers.\n\n  Perhaps of even greater concern is that, according to the Wisconsin \nProject on Nuclear Arms Control, the United States approved $15 billion \nin ``strategically sensitive exports'' to China during the 1990s. These \nexports included equipment that can be used to design nuclear weapons, \nbuild nuclear\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nweapons components, improve missile designs, and build missile \ncomponents. And it is important to remember China's primary objective \nin acquiring these and other military technologies, to be able to \ndefeat our long-standing, democratic ally Taiwan in a conflict quickly \nenough to prevent American military intervention.\n  Last September, the Senate passed S. 149, the Export Administration \nAct of 2001. S. 149 was approved despite serious concerns of some, \nincluding myself, that the U.S. export control process is ineffective \nin stopping the export of militarily sensitive technologies to \ncountries, like China, that pose a potential military threat to the \nUnited States or to U.S. interests abroad. S. 149, if enacted into law, \nwould allow China to import even more sensitive technology than it has \nin the past. It would decontrol a number of dual-use technologies, \nincluding items used to make nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a moment to read the Far Eastern \nEconomic Review article, and to consider the impact on China's military \ncapabilities of foreign technology purchases and, more importantly, the \npotential long-term ramifications of further weakening the U.S. export \ncontrol process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Far Eastern Economic Review, Jan. 24, 2002]\n\n                              China--Arms\n\n                     (By David Lague in Hong Kong)\n\n       Buying Some Major Muscle: The People's Liberation Army is \n     shopping for foreign arms and the latest military technology \n     with a vengeance; Costing tens of billions of dollars a year, \n     this drive will change the face of its forces at war and is \n     unsettling some foreign governments.\n       In the field of frustration and broken dreams that for many \n     foreign firms is the China market, arms dealers and suppliers \n     of technology to boost military firepower have discovered \n     their El Dorado.\n       International arms-trade monitors estimate that China is \n     now the world's biggest arms importer as it steps up a drive \n     to re-equip the People's Liberation Army so that, if \n     necessary, it has the strength to recover Taiwan by force and \n     can deter intervention by the United States in a cross-strait \n     conflict.\n       From supersonic fighters and missiles to computer-aided-\n     design software the PLA and its associated civilian agencies \n     are filling order books across the world.\n       ``In my view, practically every area of PLA modernization \n     is affected by the acquisition, utilization, absorption or \n     development of foreign technology,'' says PLA watcher Richard \n     Fisher of the Jamestown Foundation in Washington.\n       The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute in its \n     2001 yearbook noted that China had become the world's biggest \n     importer of arms in 2000, mainly through deliveries of ships \n     and combat aircraft from Russia. These imports were valued at \n     close to $3 billion, more than twice any other buyer's tally. \n     In the secretive world of the international arms trade, the \n     true value of Chinese offshore orders is difficult to \n     uncover. Defence experts estimate up to half of Russia's $4 \n     billion in military sales last year went to China. When \n     combined with imports of so-called dual-use technology--\n     equipment and know-how with military as well as civilian \n     applications--most analysts expect the total to be much \n     higher.\n       To pay for what Fisher described as its international \n     military ``spending spree,'' Beijing announced in March last \n     year that its published defence budget was jumping more than \n     17% to $17.2 billion. Real annual spending, including \n     payments for foreign weapons and technology, is estimated by \n     many analysts at more than $60 billion. The government is \n     already signalling that it plans further defence-budget \n     increases this year.\n       The main beneficiaries of Chinese spending: Russia and \n     Israel, since the West imposed an arms embargo in retaliation \n     of the 1989 Tiananmen Massacre. U.S. and European makers of \n     nonlethal military hardware and dual-use technology are, \n     however, eager suppliers.\n       The independent U.S. Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms \n     Control calculates that Washington approved some $15 billion \n     in strategically sensitive exports to China in the decade up \n     to 1999. These included advanced computers needed to design \n     and test nuclear weapons, machine tools for making missile \n     parts and specialized equipment used for making military \n     semiconductors.\n       Some key customers for U.S. technology are the China \n     Precision Machinery Import-Export Corp., a maker of anti-ship \n     missiles, the National University of Defense Technology, \n     which designs weapons, and Huawei Technologies--accused by \n     Washington of helping Iraq improve its air-defense system.\n       In recent years, much international attention has focused \n     on sensational allegations of Chinese espionage at U.S. \n     nuclear-arms laboratories. But far from having to steal much \n     of the latest military technology, Beijing is simply buying \n     it.\n       ``Western companies want to get into this market,'' says \n     Taipei-based PLA analyst Tsai Min-yen of the Taiwan Research \n     Institute. ``The way they can build contacts with China is to \n     sell these dual-use or nonlethal technologies.''\n       Even such top Western firms as British engine-maker Rolls-\n     Royce are looking for a piece of the action. It sells defense \n     equipment as part of its broader aerospace, marine and energy \n     business in China--though it is reluctant to give details of \n     its military sales.\n       Rolls-Royce confirmed to the REVIEW that it recently \n     supplied up to 90 Spey jet engines and spares to China that \n     defence analysts believe the PLA intends to fit on to its JH-\n     7 fighter-bombers--also being modified with modern radar and \n     long-range missiles.\n       Rolls-Royce spokesman Martin Brodie says that the company \n     first supplied this engine type to China in the 1970s and \n     continues to support that original deal. ``The details of our \n     support are, as with most companies, a matter of commercial \n     confidence,'' he says.\n       The PLA needs more of the reliable Spey engines because it \n     failed to copy those it received earlier and hasn't designed \n     a local replacement. Rolls-Royce argues its Spey engines \n     incorporate 1960s technology, implying they will not \n     significantly boost PLA power. In contrast, Asia-based \n     Western defense officials say the Pentagon objected to the \n     latest deal on the grounds that it would enhance the PLA's \n     capabilities.\n       Rolls-Royce indicates more defense-related business is on \n     its mind. On a visit in October, Chief Executive John Rose \n     discussed ``current cooperation and opportunities for the \n     future'' with officials from China's Commission on Science, \n     Technology and Industry for National Defense, according to a \n     company statement.\n       Earlier British technology sales proved a boost to the PLA. \n     In 1996, Racal Corp., now part of the French Thales Group, \n     sold up to eight Skymaster long-range airborne radars to be \n     fitted on PLA Navy Y-8 aircraft. Britain at the time \n     justified the sale by saying it would help Beijing against \n     rampant smuggling. Since then, the specialist defence press \n     has reported that these aircraft are used to assist Chinese \n     missile warships locate distant targets.\n       Other British sales are aimed at civilian use but seem to \n     offer clear military advantages. Surrey Satellite Technology, \n     perhaps the world's leading micro-satellite maker, has played \n     a major role developing China's infant micro-satellite \n     industry with technology transferred to China through a joint \n     venture with Beijing's elite Qinghua University. Specialists \n     have warned that this type of technology is vitally important \n     for the Chinese military to mount combined air and sea \n     operations in the Taiwan Strait.\n       Company spokeswoman Audrey Nice rejects any link between \n     Surrey's technology and the Chinese military. ``The PLA does \n     not exist as far as Surrey is concerned,'' she says. ``There \n     are no defence applications whatsoever.'' However, she is \n     unable to rule out Chinese military access to data from \n     satellites launched as a result of the joint-venture \n     collaboration. ``The satellite is owned by Qinghua \n     University,'' says Nice, adding that any questions should be \n     directed to the university.\n       To reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers, China is \n     investing heavily in research and development to build a \n     military industrial base. In the meantime, the PLA armoury \n     resembles an overflowing shopping trolley at an international \n     arms bazaar--with imported arms and technology ordered before \n     the Tiananmen embargo being gradually introduced and combined \n     with the newer purchases.\n       Should China go to war in the near future over Taiwan, its \n     air force will rely on front-line Russian-designed strike \n     aircraft alongside locally built fighters based on an Israeli \n     design partially funded by the U.S.\n       Other Chinese-made aircraft will carry Russian and Israeli \n     missiles and find their targets with British and Israeli \n     radar and electronics. The navy will deploy a combination of \n     powerful new Russian warships and submarines alongside \n     locally built ships fitted with U.S. and Ukrainian engines \n     and Italian torpedoes. French companies have supplier air-\n     warfare missiles, tactical command-and-control systems and \n     helicopters.\n       On land, the PLA will field modern Russian tanks and \n     artillery. Many armoured vehicles will be protected with \n     advanced Israeli-designed armour cladding. Older Chinese \n     tanks have Israeli gun and gunsight systems.\n       Overhead, satellites built with British and German help \n     will keep watch on the battlefield, fix positions for ground \n     forces and feed target data to ships and aircraft. Meanwhile \n     China's nuclear deterrent will be mounted on launchers \n     improved with assistance supplied by the U.S.\n       Beijing isn't shy about its growing power. When one of the \n     PLA navy's latest class of warship, the sleek 8,000-tonne \n     guided-missile destroyer Shenzhen, berthed in Hong Kong in \n     November after visiting Europe, it was touted as an example \n     of how China was capable of building world-class warships.\n       That may be an exaggeration with most Western counterparts. \n     But by regional standards, the Shenzhen's Ukrainian gas \n     turbines,\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\n     French Crotale air-defense missiles, Russian YJ-2 anti-ship \n     missiles and two Russian Ka-28 anti-submarine-warfare \n     helicopters make it formidable vessel.\n       While the arms merchants pile in, there are clear signs of \n     unease in some foreign capitals about the scale of China's \n     arms-buying bonanza and the danger to regional security. For \n     the U.S. and regional governments, the main concern is that \n     short-term corporate greed is overpowering Western fears of \n     arming a potential enemy of the future to the teeth.\n       Reflecting such official unease, New York-based satellite-\n     maker Loral Space & Communications agreed with the U.S. \n     Justice Department this month to pay a record $14 million \n     fine to settle charges that it may have illegally given \n     satellite know-how to Beijing.\n       Hughes Electronics of California is also expected to settle \n     with Washington over its role in similar technology leaks.\n       A U.S. Congressional committee in 1999 accused both \n     companies of helping overcome serious shortcomings in Chinese \n     rocket launchers following an expensive series of failed \n     satellite launches in the mid-1990s. Since then, China \n     launched more than 30 satellites without a hitch. There are \n     strong suspicions in Washington that the PLA's nuclear \n     missiles carried on the same launchers and aimed at the U.S. \n     are now more reliable because of information from U.S. firms.\n       At the same time as the probes into Hughes and Loral, \n     Washington forced Israel to cancel a $1.25 billion sale of up \n     to five Russian-built aircraft equipped with Israeli-made \n     Phalcon early warning radar to the PLA. Such aircraft would \n     be crucial in coordinating large-scale operations over the \n     Taiwan Strait.\n       Anxious to keep its good relations as an arms supplier with \n     Beijing, Tel Aviv is now negotiating to pay compensation to \n     China for backing out of the deal. Diplomats say that \n     discussions between both sides earlier this month in Beijing \n     also covered what other hardware may be supplied by Israel.\n       But regardless of international pressure on sellers, \n     tension across the Taiwan Strait is likely to prolong the \n     feast for arms makers. As China's power grows, so does \n     Taiwan's demand for yet more weapons to ensure parity. The \n     Bush administration last year agreed to supply Taipei with \n     its biggest arms package in decades, including a group of up \n     to eight submarines that alone will cost more than $4 \n     billion.\n       Watching the arms race, some analysts are questioning the \n     wisdom of China buying hardware from such a range of \n     suppliers. For a start, the logistical and technical support \n     needed to maintain so many different weapons systems is a \n     major challenge. And it takes more than just advanced \n     hardware to be a military power. Training, military doctrine \n     and the integration of weapons and sensors are also vital. \n     There is also the danger that in trying to keep pace with \n     Western firepower, China might overextend itself \n     financially--as the Soviet Union did.\n       Nevertheless, analysts such as Tsai in Taipei believe that \n     the sheer pace of its spending is allowing China to close the \n     military gap with the U.S. and the rest of the West fast \n     enough to pose a real security threat for Taiwan. ``It is \n     unnecessary for China to catch up with the West in all \n     fields,'' he says. ``They just need enough to deter the U.S. \n     from becoming involved in the Taiwan Strait.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S229-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S229]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FORMER WISCONSIN GOVERNOR JOHN REYNOLDS\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, one of Wisconsin's great progressives \ndied a few days ago. Former Wisconsin Governor John Reynolds passed \naway on January 6. He was 80.\n  The son of an Attorney General, and the grandson of a Representative \nin the State Assembly, John Reynolds came from one of Wisconsin's most \ndistinguished political families, and he himself was the model of what \npublic service should mean.\n  Reynolds, a native of Green Bay, was one of the founding fathers of \nthe modern Democratic Party of Wisconsin, but his roots were in the \nProgressive Party of Robert and Phil La Follette. His grandfather was \nelected to the State Assembly as a Progressive Republican, and his \nfather, who served as the State's Attorney General, was chairman of the \nindependent Progressive Party.\n  John Reynolds, like his father, served as Wisconsin's Attorney \nGeneral. He was the State's Governor from 1963 to 1965, and was \nappointed by President Johnson to serve as a Federal Judge in \nWisconsin's Eastern District where he served as Chief Judge from 1971 \nuntil 1986.\n  But as impressive as it is, that resume does not do him justice. In \nmemorializing John Reynolds, the Wisconsin State Journal wrote that his \ntrue legacy was his support of the rule of law and equal rights under \nthe U.S. Constitution. Indeed, he may be remembered best as a civil \nrights advocate. His most famous decision as a judge was his 1976 order \nthat Milwaukee schools be desegregated.\n  As columnist John Nichols wrote of him, ``John Reynolds never \nsurrendered the Progressive vision that the political and economic \nrights of individuals must be protected against encroachments by \ncorporate and political elites bent on self-service.''\n  In 1963, as a sitting Governor, John Reynolds supported civil rights \ndemonstrations. In a statement he made in support of those \ndemonstrations, John Reynolds said: ``The time is long past when \nAmericans can be content with foot-dragging in civil rights. Those who \nhave urged caution forget that those who suffer the pains of \ndiscrimination suffer them every day.''\n  Those words ring true today. They are a mark of the greatness of John \nReynolds, a greatness that did not come from the offices he held, but \nfrom his principled compassion and political courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S229-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S229-S230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIVE AMERICAN TRUST FUNDS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nfor the outlook of the trust fund management system. I have requested \non numerous occasions that the Department of the Interior to consult \nwith tribes on this issue. I understand this is difficult, given the \nscope and expanse of the approximate 560 Tribes in the United States, \nbut it must be done in a far more meaningful manner than has been the \ncase up until now.\n  Tribes feel that the Department of the Interior has presented a plan, \nand are simply going through the motions of ``consultation.'' The very \nidea of consultation is not to formulate a plan and then impose it upon \nthe interested party. It is to work with the effected parties and \nformulate a plan together. This is the essence of consultation between \nthe Federal Government and Indian Country; it is at the heart of true \ngovernment-to-government relationship.\n  The present and future challenge the Department of the Interior, \nBureau of Indian Affairs and the Office of Special Trustee face are a \nhigh priority for South Dakota's Indian tribes. As a member of both the \nSenate Indian Affairs Committee, as well as, the Appropriations \nCommittee, I look forward to working on efforts to improve the quality \nof services provided by the Department, and to protect the interests of \ntribes in my state of South Dakota and across the country.\n  The issue of Trust Fund mismanagement is one of the most urgent \nproblems we are faced with in Indian Country. Of all the extraordinary \ncircumstances we find in Indian Country, and especially in South \nDakota, I do not think there is any more complex, more difficult and \nmore shocking then the circumstances we have surrounding trust fund \nmismanagement.\n  This problem has persisted literally for generations, and continues \ntoday. Administrations of both political parties have been inadequate \nin the response, and the level of direction and the resource provided \nby Congresses over past decades has also been sadly inadequate. The \nFederal Government, by law, is to be the trustee for Native American \npeople. When the Trust Fund Management Act of 1994 has passed, I was \nhopeful that this accounting situation would at last be remedied. \nUnfortunately, this has not been the case.\n  In 1996, I was appointed by Chairman Young to the Congressional Task \nForce on Indian Trust Fund Management, to review and study the \nmanagement and reconciliation of funds administered by the Department \nof the Interior's Office of Trust Fund Management. Those meetings were \ninformative but far from productive as three years and many millions of \ndollars later, this problem still persists.\n  My concern remains, where are we now, and what does the Department \nhope to accomplish from the creation of another bureau? Far too much \ntime and resources have been exhausted attempting to remedy this \ndeplorable situation, which affects far too many of South Dakota's \npoorest people.\n  This is one of the most urgent problems we face in Indian Country, \nand there are so many more problems that flow from, or the solutions \nstem from the inability to come to terms with this issue. Congress has \nreviewed his issue over 10 times in recent years. We should not have to \ncontinue to revisit this issue ten more times to get it solved.\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\n  On January 21, 2002, The Sioux Falls Argus Leader published an \neditorial entitled ``Tribes Capable of Managing Own Trust Funds.'' I \ncommend this editorial to my colleagues. It urges Secretary Norton and \nthe Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Neal McCaleb, in the \nstrongest possible terms, to consult with tribes.\n  The Federal Government is fond of saying that it will operate \n``government to government'' with Indian tribes, but then too often it \nconsults after the fact in an insulting manner. It is time to give \ntribes greater responsibility over their assets and their budgets.\n  It is imperative that we remedy this situation. More years will go by \nand more opportunities to correct this great injustice will be passed \nunless Congress and the administration at last give resolution of this \ntrust fund crisis the attention and the resources it deserves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that The Sioux Falls Argus \nLeader editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Argus Leader, Jan. 21, 2002]\n\n     Tribes Capable of Managing Own Trust Funds--Government Needs \n                              Cooperation\n\n                        (By the Editorial Staff)\n\n       At a meeting in Albuquerque, N.M., tribes vigorously \n     opposed a plan by the Department of Interior and Bureau of \n     Indian Affairs to create a new agency to manage Indian \n     trusts.\n       The same thing happened at a meeting in Minneapolis.\n       And again in Oklahoma City.\n       And most recently in Rapid City.\n       Each time, the reason was the same. Plans to create the new \n     Bureau of Indian Trust Asset Management were developed by the \n     Interior Department and BIA, without consulting a single \n     tribe.\n       ``Decisions for Indian people should be made by Indian \n     people. Let us do it,'' said Tom Ranfranz, Flandreau Santee \n     Sioux tribal chairman. ``We're good people. We know banking, \n     we know business, we know farming. Let us do it.'' Amen.\n       If there's one main problem with white-Native American \n     relations during the years we've been a nation, it's just \n     this: Whites always think they know what's best for Indians.\n       Guess what, it's not always true. Literally billions of \n     dollars are at stake in whatever is decided. The trust fund \n     is built up from money--about $500 million a year--taken from \n     grazing, agriculture, mining, oil production, logging and \n     right-of-way easements. The BIA has managed the fund and \n     doled out money to tribes and individuals.\n       We say ``managed'' in a loose sort of way. The BIA can't \n     account for at least $2.4 billion supposed to have been \n     collected and handed out since 1972. Maybe the money is there \n     and maybe it isn't. No one knows.\n       That has led to an ongoing lawsuit against the Department \n     of Interior, and each time the parties are in court, \n     revelations of mismanagement seem to get more bizarre. Most \n     recently, it was determined that the computer system used for \n     the trust fund was so horrible just about anybody could hack \n     into it--despite millions of dollars in studies and \n     recommendations on how to fix the problems.\n       A judge shut down the system entirely, delaying payments to \n     thousands of people around the country.\n       Now, the government officials who created the mess are \n     telling the tribes they have the solution. Part of it is to \n     put former BIA Director Ross Swimmer in charge of the new \n     agency.\n       This is the same Swimmer who lost millions of dollars in \n     coal revenue for the Navahos through an unfair agreement he \n     negotiated.\n       This is the same Ross Swimmer who destroyed a Cherokee \n     Nation corporation by making bad loans to corporation \n     members.\n       Tribal officials are howling about the appointment of \n     Swimmer, and for good reason.\n       They've suggested, instead, a task force of tribal \n     representatives from around the country to come up with a \n     better way of doing things. There are some disagreements \n     about how that would work, but it is clearly the right \n     solution.\n       Interior Secretary Gale Norton and BIA Director Neal \n     McCaleb seem to have good intentions. It appears they want to \n     undo this long-standing mess and replace the current \n     operation with something that works. For that, we praise \n     them.\n       But whatever they do will never work unless it's done in \n     consultation with the tribes. To even try to do otherwise is \n     ludicrous. If they think tribes will buy in to the current \n     plan, they're deluding themselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S230-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ORDERS FOR RECESS, JOINT SESSION, ADJOURNMENT, UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY \n                                4, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nDonald and Anne Pavel of Shelton, WA, in celebration of their 50th \nwedding anniversary on January 31, 2002.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Pavel are life-long residents of Shelton. Mr. Pavel \ngraduated from Shelton High School and went on to a 20-year career in \nthe U.S. Air Force, which included decorated service during the Korean \nconflict. In 1969, he retired from the Air Force as a Master Sergeant. \nFollowing his service to this country, Mr. Pavel started his own \nsuccessful dump truck business, Pavel Trucking. His company worked on \nmany major projects in Washington State, including the ``Loop'' around \nthe Olympic Peninsula. Mr. Pavel operated Pavel Trucking until his \nretirement.\n  Mrs. Pavel also graduated from Shelton High School and then received \nher nursing degree from St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma, WA. In \naddition to raising her family and pursuing her nursing career, Mrs. \nPavel, a member of the Skokomish Tribe, was active in tribal politics. \nShe was the Skokomish Tribe's first Judge and served as Chairwoman and \nGeneral Counsel President of the Tribe for a number of years. Mrs. \nPavel also served as the Tribe's first Health Director, overseeing the \nfirst dental and health clinics on the reservation.\n  Mr. and Mrs. Pavel have six children: three daughters, Victoria, \nBarbara, and Mary; and three sons, Joseph, Michael and Gregg, whom they \nlost in 1997. They are also blessed with nine grandchildren. All of the \nPavel children graduated from Shelton High School and attended college \nand/or graduate school in Washington State. Today they are engaged in \nfulfilling careers, ranging from fisheries management to education.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in sending my warmest congratulations to \nMr. and Mrs. Pavel for this very important wedding anniversary.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJames Raymond Toulouse who passed away on January 24, 2002. My \nheartfelt sympathies go out to his family and friends.\n  James was born in Albuquerque, NM, in 1919, and graduated from \nAlbuquerque High School in 1936. He also graduated from the University \nof New Mexico in 1940 and received a law degree in 1949 from Georgetown \nLaw School. Prior to entering law school, James served during WW II as \na Specialist A Second Class in the United States Navy. His education \nand dedication to his country served him well during his successful law \ncareer.\n  Since 1949, James actively practiced law often representing cases \ninvolving civil rights. His work did not go unnoticed. For his work on \nbehalf of the Albuquerque Chapter of the NAACP in 1985, James received \ntheir ``Keeping the Dream Alive Award.'' In 1986, the New Mexico Bar \nAssociation awarded him the Courageous Advocacy Award. In addition, \nRodney Barker in his 1992 book, ``The Broken Circle,'' wrote an\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\naccount of James' representation of Navajo rights.\n  New Mexico has lost an invaluable native who advocated for the rights \nof others.

KRICK\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I honor Mr. Robert K. Krick \non his recent retirement from the National Park Service and for his \ndistinguished career as a Civil War historian and preservationist. Mr. \nKrick joined the National Park Service in 1966, working both at Fort \nMcHenry National Monument and Fort Necessity National Battlefield. In \n1972, he became the Chief Historian at Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania \nNational Military Park. It is a position he held for twenty-nine years \nuntil his retirement last month.\n  During his tenure at Fredericksburg & Spotsylvania National Military \nPark--an area which comprises four battlefields--the total amount of \npark acreage grew from under 3000 to over 8000 today. Nearly half of \nall the historians at Civil War battlefield parks learned their trade \nunder Bob Krick. His contributions to the preservation of historic land \nare numerous. Bob's tireless efforts to expand and improve the National \nPark Service will continue to be appreciated by the millions of \nindividuals who visit these historic areas each year.\n  Although preservation of Civil War battlefields was a large part of \nBob's career, he found the time to become a distinguished author and \nscholar. He has written 12 books, including ``Stonewall Jackson at \nCedar Mountain,'' and ``Conquering the Valley: Stonewall Jackson at \nCross Keys and Port Republic, as well as countless articles and book \nreviews. His works will undoubtedly influence future generations.\n  More than a decade ago I began touring various battlefields with Bob \nand several other Civil War historians. We relived Jackson's battles of \nthe 1862 campaign and retraced the Union campaign of 1864. With Bob by \nmy side, I was able to visualize the 1862 battles and could feel \nJackson's presence. I came away from the trip with the strong feeling \nthat it was my responsibility as a U.S. Senator to help preserve this \npart of our national heritage. Since that time I have been dedicated to \npreserving our Nation's most cherished and sacred lands. As a first \nstep, I introduced legislation that directed the Park Service to \nundertake a study of Civil War sites. Congress responded by passing \nlegislation, in 1991, that created a national Civil War Sites Advisory \nCommission. Composed of distinguished historians, supported by a staff \nof National Park Service experts, the commission for two years studied \nthe remaining Civil War Battlefields. The 1993 report presented a plan \nof action for protecting what remained of the Civil War Battlefields. \nSince 1993, I have helped to secure $19 million in Federal funds to \npreserve these priceless links to America's past.\n  Although much work has been done in the last decade to preserve \nbattlefields, there is a lot to do as our nation's history is still \nbeing demolished and bulldozed at an alarming pace. Bob will continue \nto be a preservation leader as a Board member of the Richmond \nBattlefields Association. I look forward to working with and calling \nupon Bob for advice in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S231-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S231]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF THOMAS J.

Clear, Jr. He \nhelped to establish a better way of life for his family and the people \nof New Mexico. He was a friend to all.\n  Respected throughout the State, Thomas was known for his friendship \nand dedication to the things that he loved, his friends and family. He \nfirst came to New Mexico as a student at the University of New Mexico \nwhere Thomas dedicated his studies to education, but also where he met \nthe love of his life and future wife of 50 years, Iris. After he \ncompleted law school, Thomas and Iris again returned to New Mexico in \norder to begin what would be a long and dedicated legal career serving \nthe people of New Mexico.\n  Friends say that Thomas was able to serve New Mexicans so well \nbecause he truly cared about their best interests, and he served to \nprotect those interests. He will be remembered for more than just his \nlegal and adversarial roles by the people of New Mexico, he will be \nknown for the love and friendship he provided to all of those who he \ncame in contact with.\n  Thomas died last week surrounded by family and friends, much the same \nway as he spent his life. He was devoted to the interests of his family \nand the people of New Mexico.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated and distinguished public servant. Eleanor Towns, Regional \nForester for the United States Forest Service's Southwestern Region, is \nretiring at the end of this month. Eleanor ``Ellie'' Towns will \nconclude more than two decades of outstanding achievement with the \nForest Service.\n  For the past four years, Ellie has served as the Regional Forester in \nNew Mexico. In this position, she served as one of nine regional \nforesters in the agency and assumed leadership of 11 National Forests \nand 4 National Grasslands comprising more than 20 million acres of \nNational Forest System lands in Arizona and New Mexico. Prior to this, \nEllie was the Director of Lands for the Forest Service in Washington, \nDC and director of Lands, Soils, Water, and Minerals for the Rocky \nMountain Region, headquartered in Denver, CO. She joined the Forest \nService in 1978 and worked in a number of progressively responsible \npositions. She came to the Forest Service from the Bureau of Land \nManagement. Ellie holds a bachelor's degree from the University of \nIllinois, a master's degree from the University of New Mexico, and a \njuris doctor degree from the University of Denver's College of Law.\n  I am pleased and gratified that my work in the Senate has allowed me \nto get to know Ellie. We worked together in preserving the Valles \nCaldera National Preserve and in securing additional funding for \nhazardous fuels projects to reduce fire threats to communities adjacent \nto national forests. She also testified before the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee several times and I can honestly say that she was \none of the best witnesses the Forest Service has ever sent up here.\n  Ellie's dedication and enthusiasm have provided the Forest Service \nwith effective, professional management and direction. During her \ntenure, she has been successful in building strong relationships with \nmany Forest Service partners and customers. In so doing, Ellie has \ngarnered the respect, admiration and trust of here employees as well as \nall of those who have worked with her. She also promoted a \ncollaborative stewardship in caring for the land and serving the people \nwho own them. We will miss her, and I know that the Forest Service will \nmiss her even more.\n  The Forest Service and the nation owe Ellie Towns a great deal of \ngratitude for her fine work at the Forest Service, I wish her the best \nin all of her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S231-4", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S231-S232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HONORING THE PROMOTION OF COLONEL EDWARD RICE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \ncommander of Ellsworth Air Force Base's 28th Bomber Wing on his \npromotion to brigadier general.\n  On February 1, 2002, Colonel Edward A. Rice, Jr., will pin on his \nfirst star, and I cannot think of a member of the Air Force more \ndeserving of this promotion. I have known Colonel rice since May 2000, \nwhen he took command of the 28th Bomber Wing at Ellsworth, in my home \nstate of South Dakota. Ellsworth is home to one of the Air Force's two \nB-1B wings, with 26 aircraft and more than 3,500 military and civilian \nmembers assigned. Colonel Rice joined a distinguished line of \ncommanders of the wing, and has become the fifth consecutive commander \nto be promoted to brigadier general.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n  Colonel Rice has recently returned from Diego Garcia, where he was \nthe commander of the 28th Air Expeditionary Wing, overseeing the entire \nB-1B operation for the ongoing war against terror, Operation Enduring \nFreedom. In addition to coordinating bombing missions from the command \ncenter on the ground, Colonel Rice added to his more than 3,600 hours \nof air time in combat aircraft by flying bombing missions against \nTaliban and al-Quaida controlled strongholds in Afghanistan. I applaud \nthe efforts of Colonel Rice and all of the men and women in Operation \nEnduring Freedom. Since joining Congress in 1987 I have appreciated the \nprofessionalism, hard work, and commitment to excellence of Ellsworth's \ncommanders and personnel. Colonel Rice has added to that tradition, and \nunder his leadership the effectiveness of the B-1B, especially in \nrecent operations in Afghanistan, has proven again why that aircraft is \nthe backbone of our Nation's bomber fleet.\n  Colonel Rice graduated from the Air Force Academy in Colorado \nSprings, Colorado, in 1978, and went to flight school to become a B-52 \npilot. He also has experience flying aircraft that include the B-1 and \nthe B-2 Stealth bomber.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Colonel Rice has held a variety \nof significant operational positions including commander of the 34th \nBomb Squadron at Castle Air Force Base, CA; deputy commander of the \n509th Operations Group, at Whiteman Air Force Base in MO; and commander \nof the 552nd Operations Group, at tinker Air Force Base, OK.\n  Colonel Rice served as a White House fellow from 1990-1991. The \nprogram selects midcareer professionals for a variety of assignments, \nusually from outside of their normal field of expertise. Colonel Rice \nworked in the office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  In 1994 and 1995, Colonel Rice served on a blue-ribbon government \npanel examining the military's structure in the post-Cold War era. \nColonel Rice moved to the West Wing of the White House in 1997, when he \nwas named deputy executive secretary to the National Security Council. \nHe served in the White House until he was assigned to Ellsworth for his \nfirst command of a combat bomb wing.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Colonel Rice, \nhis wife Teresa, and their children, on this well-deserved \npromotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S232-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S232-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S232]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S232-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S232-S235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 65\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was ordered to lie on the table.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Mr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, Members of Congress, \ndistinguished guests, and fellow citizens:\n  As we gather tonight, our Nation is at war, our economy is in \nrecession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the \nstate of our Union has never been stronger.\n  We last met in an hour of shock and suffering. In four short months, \nour Nation has comforted the victims . . . begun to rebuild New York \nand the Pentagon; rallied a great coalition; captured, arrested, and \nrid the world of thousands of terrorists; destroyed Afghanistan's \nterrorist training camps; saved a people from starvation; and freed a \ncountry from brutal oppression.\n  The American flag files again over our embassy in Kabul. Terrorists \nwho once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And \nterrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are \nrunning for their own.\n  America and Afghanistan are now allies against terror . . . we will \nbe partners in rebuilding that country . . . and this evening we \nwelcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: \nChairman Hamid Karzai.\n  The last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of \nAfghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or \ngoing to school. Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan's \nnew government, and we welcome the new Minister of Women's Affairs, \nDoctor Sima Samar.\n  Our progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the \nresolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States \nmilitary. When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete \nconfidence in their courage and skill--and tonight, thanks to them, we \nare winning the war against terror. The men and women of our armed \nforces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United \nStates: Even seven thousand miles away, across oceans and continents, \non mountaintops and in caves--you will not escape the justice of this \nNation.\n\n  For many Americans, these four months have brought sorrow, and pain \nthat will never completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter \nreturns to Ground Zero, to feel closer to his two sons who died there. \nAt a memorial in new York, a little boy left his football with a note \nfor his lost father: ``Dear Daddy, Please take this to Heaven. I don't \nwant to play football until I can play with you again someday.'' Last \nmonth, at the grave of her husband, Micheal, a CIA officer and Marine \nwho died in Mazar-e Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell: \n``Semper Fi, my love.'' Shannon is with us tonight.\n  Shannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our \ncause is just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe \nMicheal and all who gave their lives for freedom.\n  Our cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan \nconfirmed our worst fears, and show us the true scope of the task \nahead. We have seen the depth of our enemies' hatred in videos where \nthey laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of their \nhatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. We \nhave found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water \nfacilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, \nsurveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of \nlandmarks in America and throughout the world.\n  What we have found in Afghanistan confirms that--far from ending \nthere--our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who \nhijacked planes on September 11th were trained in Afghanistan's camps--\nand so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous \nkillers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw \nregimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs--\nset to go off without warning.\n  Thanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition \npartners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet tens of \nthousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies view \nthe entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever \nthey are. So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor \nterrorists, freedom is at risk--and America and our allies must not, \nand will not, allow it.\n  Our Nation will continue to be steadfast, and patient, and persistent \nin the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down \nterrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to \njustice. Second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek \nchemical, biological, or nuclear weapons from threatening the United \nStates and the world.\n  Our military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of \nbusiness, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A \nterrorist underworld--including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic \nJihad, and Jaish-i-Mohammed--operates in remote jungles and deserts, \nand hides in the centers of large cities.\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\n  While the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is \nacting elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines helping to \ntrain that country's armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have \nexecuted an American, and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working \nwith the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to \nbomb our embassy. Our navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block \nthe shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in \nSomalia.\n  My hope is that all nations will heed our call, and eliminate the \nterrorist parasites who threaten their countries, and our own. Many \nnations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, \nand I admire the leadership of President Musharraf. But some \ngovernments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no mistake: \nIf they do not act, America will.\n  Our second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from \nthreatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September 11th. \nBut we know their true nature. North Korea is a regime arming with \nmissiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.\n  Iran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an \nunelected few repress the Iranian people's hope for freedom.\n  Iraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support \nterror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, \nand nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has \nalready used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens--\nleaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is \na regime that agreed to international inspections--then kicked out the \ninspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the \ncivilized world.\n  States like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of \nevil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of \nmass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They \ncould provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match \ntheir hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the \nUnited States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would \nbe catastrophic.\n  We will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their \nstate sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and \ndeliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy \neffective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from \nsudden attack. And all nations should know: America will do what is \nnecessary to ensure our Nation's security.\n  We will be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait \non events, while dangers gather. I will not stand by, as peril draws \ncloser and closer. The United States of America will not permit the \nworld's most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world's most \ndestructive weapons.\n  Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign \nmay not be finished on our watch--yet it must be and it will be waged \non our watch.\n  We cannot stop short. If we stopped now--leaving terror camps intact \nand terror states unchecked--our sense of security would be false and \ntemporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it \nis both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom's fight.\n  Our first priority must always be the security of our Nation, and \nthat will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget \nsupports three great goals for America: We will win this war, we will \nprotect our homeland, and we will revive our economy.\n  September 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in this \nCongress, and I join the American people in applauding your unity and \nresolve. Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward \naddressing problems here at home. I am a proud member of my party--yet \nas we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs in \nAmerica, we must act first and foremost not as Republicans, not as \nDemocrats, but as Americans.\n  It costs a lot to fight this war. We have spent more than a billion \ndollars a month--over 30 million dollars a day--and we must be prepared \nfor future operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision \nweapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of \nthem. We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more \nagile to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely. Our \nmen and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, \nand the best training--and they also deserve another pay raise. My \nbudget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two \ndecades, because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is \nnever too high--whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay \nit.\n  The next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to \nprotect our citizens and strengthen our Nation against the ongoing \nthreat of another attack. Time and distance from the events of \nSeptember 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons. \nAmerica is no longer protected by vast oceans. We are protected from \nattack only by vigorous action abroad, and increased vigilance at home.\n  My budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland \nsecurity, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, \nairport and border security, and improved intelligence. We will develop \nvaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases. We will increase \nfunding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic \npolice and firefighters. we will improve intelligence collection and \nsharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of air \ntravel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of \nvisitors to the United States.\n  Homeland security will make America, not only stronger, but in many \nways better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve \npublic health, stronger police and fire departments will mean safer \nneighborhoods, stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal \ndrugs.\n  And as government works to better secure our homeland, America will \ncontinue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens. A few days \nbefore Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger \nlighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who \nhad been trained by al-Qaida, and was armed with explosives. The people \non that airplane were alert, and as a result, likely saved nearly 200 \nlives--and tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis \nMoutardier and Christina Jones.\n  Once we have funded our national security and our homeland security, \nthe final great priority of my budget is economic security for the \nAmerican people. To achieve these great national objectives--to win the \nwar, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy--our budget will \nrun a deficit that will be small and short term so long as Congress \nrestrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible way. We have \nclear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and \nresolve we have shown overseas: We will prevail in the war, and we will \ndefeat this recession.\n  Americans who have lost their jobs need our help and I support \nextending unemployment benefits, and direct assistance for health care \ncoverage. Yet American workers want more than unemployment checks--they \nwant a steady paycheck. When America works, America prospers, so my \neconomic security plan can be summed up in one word: jobs.\n  Good jobs begin with good schools--and here we've made a fine start. \nRepublicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education \nreform so no child in America will be left behind. I was proud to work \nwith Members of both parties--Chairman John Boehner and Congressman \nGeorge Miller, Senator Judd Gregg--and I was so proud of our work I \neven had nice things to say about my friend Ted Kennedy. The folks at \nthe Crawford coffee shop couldn't quite believe it--but our work on \nthis bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on \nresults.\n  There is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and \nsucceed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood \ndevelopment programs. We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher \ntraining and\n\n[[Page S234]]\n\nlaunch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America: a \nquality teacher in every classroom.\n  Good jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This \nCongress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build \ninfrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home \nso America is less dependent on foreign oil.\n  Good jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates \nnew jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve Trade Promotion \nAuthority. On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of \nRepresentatives has acted to create jobs--and I urge the Senate to pass \nthis legislation.\n  Good jobs depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this hall \nthought my tax relief plan was too small--and some thought it was too \nbig. But when those checks arrived in the mail, most Americans thought \ntax relief was just about right. Congress listened to the people and \nresponded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending \nthe death tax. For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans \nplan for the future, let's make these tax cuts permanent.\n  The way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the \neconomy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment, and by \nspeeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend. For the sake \nof American workers, let's pass a stimulus package.\n  Good jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we re-authorize these \nimportant reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce \ndependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.\n  Americans know economic security can vanish in an instant without \nhealth security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, to give uninsured workers credits to help buy \nhealth coverage, to approve an historic increase in spending for \nveterans' health, and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare \nsystem that includes coverage for prescription drugs.\n  A good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to \nenact new safeguards for 401(k) and pension plans, because employees \nwho have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk \nlosing everything if their company fails. Through stricter accounting \nstandards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate America must \nbe made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the \nhighest standards of conduct.\n  Retirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of \nSocial Security--and we will. We must make Social Security financially \nstable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who \nchoose them.\n  Members, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other \nissues: productive farm policy; a cleaner environment; broader home \nownership, especially among minorities; and ways to encourage the good \nwork of charities and faith-based groups. I ask you to join me on these \nimportant domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we have \napplied to our war against terrorism.\n  During these last few months, I have been humbled and privileged to \nsee the true character of this country in a time of testing. Our \nenemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would \nsplinter in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil.\n  The American people have responded magnificently, with courage and \ncompassion, strength and resolve. As I have met the heroes, hugged the \nfamilies, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in \nawe of the American people.\n  And I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for \nthe strength, and calm, and comfort she brings to our Nation in crisis: \nour First Lady, Laura Bush.\n  None of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September 11th, \nyet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked \ninto a mirror, and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are \ncitizens, with obligations to each other, to our country, and to \nhistory. We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate, and \nmore about the good we can do.\n  For too long our culture has said, ``If it feels good, do it.'' Now \nAmerica is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: ``Let's roll.'' In \nthe sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and \nthe bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what \na new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a Nation \nthat serves goals larger than self. We have been offered a unique \nopportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.\n  My call tonight is for every American to commit at least two years--\nfour thousand hours over the rest of your lifetime--to the service of \nyour neighbors and your Nation.\n  Many are already serving and I thank you. If you aren't sure how to \nhelp, I've got a good place to start. To sustain and extend the best \nthat has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom \nCorps. The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding \nin case of crisis at home, rebuilding our communities, and extending \nAmerican compassion throughout the world.\n  One purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. \nAmerica needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major \nemergencies, volunteers to help police and fire departments, \ntransportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.\n  Our country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. \nWe need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are \nin prison, and we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA \nFreedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps \nand Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.\n  And America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to \nevery part of the world. So we will renew the promise of the Peace \nCorps, double its volunteers over the next five years, and ask it to \njoin a new effort to encourage development, and education, and \nopportunity in the Islamic world.\n  This time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity--a \nmoment we must seize to change our culture. Through the gathering \nmomentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I \nknow: We can overcome evil with greater good.\n  And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the \nworld toward the values that will bring lasting peace. All fathers and \nmothers, in all societies, want their children to be educated and live \nfree from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be \noppressed, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock \nof the secret police.\n  If anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the \nIslamic ``street'' greeted the fall of tyranny with song and \ncelebration. Let the skeptics look to Islam's own rich history--with \nits centuries of learning, and tolerance, and progress.\n  America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are \nright and true and unchanging for all people everywhere. No nation owns \nthese aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We have no \nintention of imposing our culture--but America will always stand firm \nfor the non-negotiable demands of human dignity: the rule of law, \nlimits on the power of the state, respect for women, private property, \nfree speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance.\n  America will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these \nvalues around the world--including the Islamic world--because we have a \ngreater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. \nWe seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.\n  In this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old \nrivalries. America is working with Russia, China, and India in ways we \nnever have before to achieve peace and prosperity. In every region, \nfree markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power \nto lift lives. Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, \nfrom Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of \nterror cannot stop the momentum of freedom.\n  The last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would \nreturn to normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will. Those \nof us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed \nby them. We've\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\ncome to know truths that we will never question: Evil is real, and it \nmust be opposed. Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one \ncountry, mourning together and facing danger together. Deep in the \nAmerican character, there is honor, and it is stronger than cynicism. \nMany have discovered again that even in tragedy--especially in \ntragedy--God is near.\n  In a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade \nin the history of liberty--that we have been called to a unique role in \nhuman events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or \nconsequential.\n  Our enemies send other people's children on missions of suicide and \nmurder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand \nfor a different choice--made long ago, on the day of our founding. We \naffirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.\n  Steadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom's \nprice. We have shown freedom's power. And in this great conflict, my \nfellow Americans, we will see freedom's victory.\n  Thank you, and may God bless the United States of America.\n                                                         George Bush.  \nThe White House, January 29, 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S235-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:57 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1762.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nveterans' programs and the ability of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to administer them; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am transmitting a draft bill to \n     enhance a number of veterans'\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\n     programs and our ability to manage them. Details regarding \n     the context and justification of the bill's 10 provisions are \n     provided in the enclosed section-by-section analysis. If \n     enacted, this legislation would:\n       Sec. 101--authorize VA to provide medical care for newborn \n     children of enrolled women veterans;\n       Sec. 102--authorized VA to provide outpatient dental care \n     to more former prisoners of war;\n       Sec. 103--establish pay comparability for the Director of \n     the Nursing Service with other VHA executives;\n       Sec. 201--prohibit provision of presidential memorial \n     certificates, burial flags, and headstones and markers on \n     behalf of individuals who have committed capital crimes;\n       Sec. 202--clarify procedures relating to the prohibition \n     against allowing individuals who had committed capital crimes \n     to be interred or memorialized in national veterans' \n     cemeteries;\n       Sec. 203--clarify current law regarding the date on which \n     the 120-day period for appeal of a Board of Veterans' Appeals \n     decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims \n     begins to run;\n       Sec. 301--conform the VA 5-percent limitation on non-career \n     SES members to the Government-wide 10-percent limitation;\n       Sec. 302--eliminate the requirement that at least two-\n     thirds of VA deputy assistant secretaries must have served \n     continuously for 5 years in the Federal civil service \n     immediately prior to their appointments;\n       Sec. 303--authorize the Department of Defense to purchase \n     medical items and services through VA's Revolving Supply \n     Fund; and\n       Sec. 304--conform the current-law definition of minority \n     veterans to the new Race & Ethnic Standards used in Federal \n     statistical reporting and in the 2000 U.S. Census.\n       I request that this bill be promptly considered and \n     enacted.\n       Advise has been received from the Office of Management and \n     Budget that, from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program, there is no objection to enactment of this draft \n     bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Anthony J. Principi.\n       Enclosures.\n\n             SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS and JUSTIFICATION\n\n\n   section 101--care for newborn children of enrolled women veterans\n\n       Section 101 would amend the definition of medical services \n     that VA may provide to veterans to include care provided by a \n     contract provider to newborn children of women veterans. To \n     receive this benefit, a veteran must be enrolled in the VA \n     health care system. VA would contract for this care until the \n     mother is discharged from the hospital after delivery of the \n     child or for 14 days after the birth of the child, whichever \n     period is shorter, and only if VA contracted for delivery of \n     the child. After childbirth, some veterans may need this \n     limited benefit to give them time to apply for medical \n     assistance. Offering this care would also be consistent with \n     the normal pregnancy and delivery coverage in the community.\n       The discretionary-cost estimate for enactment of this \n     proposal is as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                        Fiscal year                             Cost\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2002......................................................    $5,344,795\n2003......................................................     5,451,691\n2004......................................................     5,560,725\n2005......................................................     5,671,939\n2006......................................................     5,785,378\n2007......................................................     5,901,085\n2008......................................................     6,019,107\n2009......................................................     6,139,489\n2010......................................................     6,262,279\n2011......................................................     6,387,525\n                                                           -------------\n      Total...............................................    55,524,013\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Section 102--outpatient dental care for all former prisoners of war\n\n       Section 102 would authorize VA to provide outpatient dental \n     care to former prisoners of war (POW's) regardless of the \n     length of their detention or internment. Currently, the law \n     only permits VA to provide such care to former POW's who were \n     detained or interned for 90 days or more. This provision is \n     needed to ensure that former POW's receive all needed care \n     for conditions that may be attributable to the privations of \n     their service.\n       There would be insignificant costs resulting from enactment \n     of this proposal.\n\n\n      section 103--pay comparability for director, nursing service\n\n       This section of the draft bill would amend section \n     7306(a)(5) to exempt the position of the Director of Nursing \n     Service, VA's chief nurse executive, from the nurse-pay \n     restrictions in section 7451 and require that the Director of \n     Nursing Service be paid at a rate comparable to that of other \n     non-physician (SES) VA executives. The current pay-rate \n     disparity is unjustified.\n       There are no significant costs associated with this \n     proposal.\n\n\n        section 201--limitation on provision of certain benefits\n\n       Section 201 of the draft bill would amend sections 112, \n     2301, and 2306 of title 38, United States Code, to prohibit \n     VA, in the case of a death occurring after the date of \n     enactment, from furnishing a presidential memorial \n     certificate, a burial flag, a headstone or marker, or a \n     memorial headstone or marker on behalf of a person barred \n     from burial or memorialization in a national cemetery by \n     operation of 38 U.S.C. Sec. 2411. Section 112 currently \n     authorizes the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to conduct a \n     program for honoring the memory of deceased veterans by \n     preparing and sending to eligible recipients a certificate \n     bearing the signature of the President and expressing the \n     country's grateful recognition of the veteran's service in \n     the Armed Forces. Section 2301(a) currently requires the \n     Secretary to furnish a burial flag to drape the casket of any \n     deceased veteran who: (1) was a veteran of any war or of \n     service after January 31, 1955; (2) served at least one \n     enlistment; (3) was released from active service for a \n     disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty; or, \n     (4) was entitled to receive retirement pay at age 60 based on \n     service in the Reserves or National Guard. Section 2306(a) \n     currently requires the Secretary to furnish on request a \n     headstone or marker for the unmarked grave of: (1) any \n     individual buried in a national cemetery; (2) many \n     individuals eligible for burial in a national cemetery but \n     not buried there; (3) Civil War soldiers; (4) spouses, \n     surviving spouses, and children of certain eligible \n     individuals, when buried in a state veterans' cemetery; \n     and (5) certain reservists and retired reservists with 20 \n     years of service. Section 2306(b) currently requires the \n     Secretary to furnish on request a memorial headstone or \n     marker for the purpose of commemorating a veteran or the \n     spouse or surviving spouse of a veteran, whose remains are \n     unavailable.\n       Section 2411 of title 38, United States Code, prohibits \n     burial in a national cemetery of persons who: (1) have been \n     convicted of a Federal capital crime and sentenced to death \n     or life imprisonment; (2) have been convicted of a State \n     capital crime and sentenced to death or life imprisonment \n     without parole; or, (3) are found administratively by clear \n     and convincing evidence to have committed such a crime but \n     not been convicted due to death or flight to avoid \n     prosecution. This provision would amend sections 112, 2301, \n     and 2306 to prohibit the furnishing of presidential memorial \n     certificates, burial flags, headstones or markers, and \n     memorial headstones or markers by VA on behalf of these three \n     classes of persons. This amendment is a limited and logical \n     extension of the section 2411 prohibition that would avoid \n     placing the United States in the position of honoring at the \n     time of death a person who has committed a heinous crime.\n       There is no cost associated with this proposal.\n\n\nSection 202--Clarification of Procedures Regarding Disqualification of \n     Certain Individuals for Memorialization in Veterans Cemeteries\n\n       Section 202 of the draft bill would amend Section 2411 of \n     title 38, United States Code, to correct a technical defect \n     in the prohibition against the interment or memorialization \n     in a cemetery operated by the National Cemetery \n     Administration (or in Arlington National Cemetery) of certain \n     persons who have committed Federal or state capital crimes. \n     Under Section 2411(a), the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (or \n     the Secretary of the Army, with respect to Arlington National \n     Cemetery) may not inter the remains of or memorialize in such \n     a cemetery: (1) a person who has been convicted of a Federal \n     capital crime for which the person was sentenced to death or \n     life imprisonment; (2) a person who has been convicted of a \n     state capital crime for which the person was sentenced to \n     death or life imprisonment without parole; or (3) a person \n     who is found administratively to have committed a Federal or \n     state capital crime, but to have avoided conviction of such \n     crime by reason of unavailability for trial due to death \n     or flight to avoid prosecution. Administrative findings \n     regarding the third category of persons would be made by \n     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in the case of a VA \n     national cemetery and the Secretary of the Army in the \n     case of Arlington National Cemetery.\n       Section 2411(a)(2) provides that the prohibitions against \n     interment and memorialization do not apply unless the \n     appropriate Secretary has received from the Attorney General, \n     in the case of a Federal capital crime, or an appropriate \n     state official, in the case of a state capital crime, written \n     notice of a disqualifying conviction or administrative \n     finding before approval of an application for interment or \n     memorialization. The notification requirement appears to have \n     been included in error with respect to a case involving an \n     administrative finding that an individual had committed a \n     capital offense but was not convicted by reason of \n     unavailability for trial due to death or flight to avoid \n     prosecution. Since the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or the \n     Secretary of the Army would have made the finding in the \n     first place, there would appear to be no reason to require \n     the Attorney General or an appropriate state official provide \n     written notice to the Secretary concerned regarding that \n     Secretary's own finding. Nonetheless, persons requesting \n     interment services may argue that the interment prohibition \n     is inoperative in the absence of such notice. Accordingly, we \n     believe the reference to notification of administrative \n     findings should be removed.\n       There is no cost associated with this proposal.\n\n\n section 203--clarification of the period for appealing rulings of the \n                       board of veterans' appeals\n\n       Section 203 of the draft bill would clarify an ambiguity \n     created by past legislation.\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\n     Section 7266(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, provides \n     that, to obtain review by the United States Court of Appeals \n     for Veterans Claims (Court) of a final Board of Veterans' \n     Appeals (Board) decision, a person adversely affected by the \n     decision must file a notice of appeal with the Court within \n     120 days after the date on which notice of the decision is \n     mailed pursuant to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7104(e). Before its \n     amendment by the Veterans' Benefits Improvements Act of 1996, \n     Pub. L. No. 104-275, 110 Stat. 3322, Section 7104(e) required \n     the Board to promptly mail a copy of its decision to the \n     claimant and the claimant's authorized representative, if \n     any. The Court had construed those provisions as requiring, \n     if a claimant is represented, the accomplishment of both \n     mailings to begin the 120-day appeal period. See Paniag v. \n     Brown, 10 Vet. App. 265, 267 (1997).\n       As amended by Section 509 of Pub. L. No. 104-275, 110 Stat. \n     at 3344, Section 7104(e) now requires the Board to promptly \n     mail a copy of its written decision to the claimant and, if \n     the claimant has an authorized representative, to mail a copy \n     of its written decision to the authorized representative or \n     send a copy of its written decision to the authorized \n     representative by any means reasonably likely to provide the \n     representative with the decision as timely as if it were \n     mailed first class. Thus, under Section 7104(e) as amended, \n     the Board must still notify a claimant's representative, if \n     any, but such notice may be made by mailing or sending the \n     representative a copy of the decision. Although Section \n     7104(e) was so amended, no corresponding change was made to \n     Section 7266(a)(1)'s reference to ``mail[ing] pursuant to \n     Section 7104(e).'' See Dippel v. West, 12 Vet. App. 466, 470 \n     (1999) (noting that Congress did not change Section 7266(a) \n     and that Section 7104(e)'s plain meaning would suggest that \n     Section 7266(a)(1)'s reference to ``mail pursuant to Section \n     7104(e)'' does not cover a decision sent pursuant to Section \n     7104(e)(2)(B)).\n       The amendment to former Section 7104(e) without a \n     corresponding change to Section 7266(a)(1) has created an \n     ambiguity. It is not clear when the 120-day appeal period \n     prescribed by Section 7266(a)(1) begins if a claimant is \n     represented and the Board mails copies of its decision to the \n     claimant and the claimant's representative, but mails them on \n     different days. Section 7266(a)(1) does not specify whether \n     the appeal period in that situation begins on the date of \n     mailing to the claimant, on the date of mailing to the \n     representative, on the date of the earlier of both mailings, \n     or on the date of the later of both mailings.\n       The draft bill would clarify that matter. Section 241 of \n     the bill would amend Section 7266(a)(1) to require, for \n     initiation of Court review of a final Board decision, that a \n     notice of appeal be filed within 120 days after a copy of the \n     decision, pursuant to Section 7104(e), is mailed or sent to \n     the claimant's representative or, if the claimant is not \n     represented, mailed to the claimant. Thus, the 120-day appeal \n     period would begin when the Board mails or sends a copy of \n     its decision to the claimant's authorized representative or, \n     if the claimant is not represented, when the Board mails a \n     copy of its decision to the claimant. We have chosen the date \n     of mailing or sending to the representative, if any, because \n     generally a representative stands in the claimant's place for \n     the purpose of receiving notice of the decision. If the \n     appeal period were to begin on the date of mailing to the \n     claimant, a delay in providing notice of the decision to the \n     representative could compromise the representative's ability \n     to timely advise the claimant. Beginning the appeal period on \n     the date of mailing or sending notice to the representative \n     would maximize the time available to the representative to \n     advise the claimant as to the best course of action.\n       Section 2(b) of the draft bill would make the amendment to \n     Section 7266(a)(1) apply to any Board decision made on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       No costs or savings would result from enactment of this \n     provision.\n\n\n   Section 301--Repeal of Cap on Number of Non-Career Members of the \n                 Senior Executive Service Serving in VA\n\n       Section 301(a) of the bill would repeal the current \n     statutory limitation applicable to VA on the number of non-\n     career members of the SES that may serve in the Department. \n     Currently, that number may not exceed five-percent (5%) of \n     the average number of senior executives employed in Senior \n     Executive Service positions in the Department during the \n     preceding fiscal year. This provision would not affect the \n     Government-wide ten-percent (10%) limitation that generally \n     applies to other agencies and departments. Section 301(b) \n     would also make conforming amendments to 38 U.S.C. 709.\n       The Department would greatly benefit from being able to \n     avail itself further of the experience and expertise of \n     executive-level professionals from the private sector, as we \n     restructure fundamental Departmental processes to improve the \n     timely delivery of both health care services and benefits to \n     veterans. The proposed flexibility in staffing would better \n     position VA to increase its knowledge of successful private \n     sector business practices, identify those that have \n     application to VA, and successfully implement them. This, in \n     turn, would enable VA to better meet the expectations of the \n     beneficiaries of VA's programs. The proposal is consistent \n     with the Government's policy of partnering with the private \n     sector to improve Government performance.\n       VA would remain subject to the ten-percent (10%) \n     Government-wide limitation on non-career SES positions, which \n     OPM administers. The current five-percent (5%) cap on the \n     number of non-career members of the Senior Executive Service \n     is applicable only to VA. While mindful and appreciative of \n     Congress' intention to limit policitization of the Department \n     when it established VA as an Executive Department in 1988, we \n     nonetheless believe that the number of non-career SES members \n     appointed to VA positions should be based on the actual \n     current leadership needs of the Department, as determined by \n     the Administration, subject to the ten-percent (10%) \n     Government-wide limitation. There would be no costs \n     associated with enactment of this provision.\n\n\n  Section 302--Repeal of Preceding-Service Requirement for VA Deputy \n                         Assistant Secretaries\n\n       Section 302 of the draft bill would repeal section \n     308(d)(2), which now requires at least two-thirds of VA's \n     Deputy Assistant Secretaries (DAS's) to have served \n     continuously for five years in the Federal Civil Service in \n     the Executive Branch immediately prior to their appointments. \n     This requirement was established in 1988 to maintain the \n     institutional memory and the Department's tradition of career \n     service. However, this limitation has, in practice, proven to \n     be overly prescriptive. It prevents utilization of highly \n     competent people not meeting the criteria. Because the \n     stringent continuous five-year service requirement applies to \n     all but one-third of the DAS positions, it has required VA to \n     utilize these limited ``non-career'' DAS slots for ``career'' \n     appointees who are not political appointees but who simply \n     fail to meet the service requirement. This includes career \n     employees who have moved from the private sector, within the \n     last five years. This limits the pool of candidates from \n     which the Secretary may select his leadership team. We \n     recommend eliminating the existing service requirement. VA \n     could establish its own standards for these high-level \n     positions, addressing Congress' original concerns of \n     institutional memory and the tradition of career service \n     while still providing needed flexibility for selecting the \n     best-qualified persons.\n       No costs are associated with enactment of this provision.\n\n\n             Section 303--Revolving Supply Fund Amendments\n\n       Section 303 would expand the services of the Revolving \n     Supply Fund (38 U.S.C. Sec. 8121), to permit the Department \n     of Defense (DOD) to enter into interagency agreements with \n     the Revolving Supply Fund (Supply Fund) for the procurement \n     of certain items and services under the purchase authority of \n     the Supply Fund. Purchases would be limited to medical items \n     and services, e.g., pharmaceuticals, medical/surgical \n     supplies, equipment, and systems and consulting services. \n     Currently, only offices funded by VA appropriations may \n     purchase under that authority. DOD and other Federal agencies \n     enter into interagency agreements with the Supply Fund under \n     the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. Sec. 1535).\n       Congress traditionally has favored consolidated purchases \n     because the increased buying power provides additional \n     procurement leverage and resulting cost savings. Most \n     recently, Congress, in Sec. 210 of the Veterans Millennium \n     Health Care and Benefits Act (P.L. 106-117), required VA and \n     DOD to jointly report on the cooperation between the two \n     Departments in procuring pharmaceuticals, medical supplies \n     and equipment. It is clear that Congress holds VA and DOD \n     accountable for achieving efficiencies through the \n     consolidation of contracting and logistics responsibilities.\n       The legislation, if enacted, would provide additional \n     incentives for DOD to purchase medical items and services \n     directly or through joint procurements from the Supply Fund, \n     e.g., the ordering agencies' obligations remain payable in \n     full from the appropriation initially charged irrespective of \n     when performance occurs; and VA Supply Fund program managers \n     are better able to negotiate contracts for bona fide high \n     priority items because frantic year-end spending is \n     eliminated.\n       The enactment of this proposal would not result in any cost \n     to VA. The Supply Fund operates entirely upon fees assessed \n     for services rendered.\n\n\n  Section 304--Redefinition of ``minority group member'' in 38 U.S.C. \n                              Sec. 544(d)\n\n       Section 306 is a technical amendment to 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 544(d) to change the definition of minority veterans to \n     make it conform to the new Race & Ethic Standards used in \n     Federal statistical reporting and in the 2000 U.S. Census. \n     The amendment would not change eligibility or entitlement to \n     existing or future benefits. No costs would result from \n     enactment of this proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/29/senate-section/article/S238-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S238-S239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 95--PROVIDING FOR CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT \n OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF \n                            REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \ncurrent\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.
