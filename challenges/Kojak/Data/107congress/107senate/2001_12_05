Madam President, when our country was attacked on \nSeptember 11, countless countries came forth to express condolences, to \ncondemn those heinous attacks and to make clear that they stood with \nAmerica in our time of trouble. The statements were a welcome \nreassurance from the family of nations that we would not be standing \nalone in the campaign against terror.\n  I come to the floor today to send my condolences to the families of \nthe 26 Israelis killed in this weekend's attacks in Jerusalem and \nHaifa, to send my prayers to the scores more who were injured, to \ncondemn in the strongest terms those attacks--and the attack that \noccurred just this morning, and to reassure our friends in Israel that \njust as they stood with us, we stand with them.\n  Like people all over the world, I went to bed on Saturday deeply \nshaken by the horrifying images from Jerusalem.\n  Not only were the attacks timed to occur during busiest time of the \nweek in an area frequented by young people, but a second bomb was \nintended to maim and kill emergency response workers trying to assist \nthe victims. It is some small measure of consolation that the second \nbomb didn't kill anyone. Still, it is hard to imagine a more inhumane \nplan; hard to imagine, that is, until I woke up Sunday morning, and \nheard reports of the second attack--in Haifa. In this case, a suicide \nbomber boarded a bus full of innocent people just starting their work \nweek.\n  These coordinated bombings marked the deadliest terrorist attacks in \nthe history of the State of Israel.\n  For the past 15 months, the United States, Europe, and moderate Arab \nstates have called on Chairman Arafat to use his authority to put an \nend to this violence. At times we have heard helpful words, but we have \nnot yet seen decisive action. Even this morning, after 2 days of \ninternational pressure to stop such violence, we hear of another \nsuicide bombing in Jerusalem.\n  Terrorists have used the territories as a haven to plan and organize \ntheir murderous assaults, to build their bombs and recruit their \nsuicide bombers. Instead of cracking down on this violence, Chairman \nArafat has seemed all too willing to use it as a negotiating tool.\n  Such a strategy is more than cynical. It is dangerous, and it stands \nin stark contrast to the Oslo process that brought the region so close \nto a comprehensive peace just one year ago.\n  After Jerusalem and Haifa, Chairman Arafat's words alone are not \nenough. Symbolic actions--rounding up the usual suspects only to let \nthem go again--is not enough.\n  Concrete steps to bring the planners of this weekend's attacks to \njustice are just a starting point. The world also expects--in fact, the \nworld demands--that Chairman Arafat crack down on the organizations \nthat harbor and support these terrorists.\n  We have already begun to hear a litany of reasons why it is difficult \nfor Chairman Arafat to do what has to be done.\n  He is not responsible for the attacks, we are told.\n  He is not capable of controlling the terrorists. No one is, we are \ntold.\n  We are also told that Israel's response hinders the Palestinian \nAuthority's ability to move against the terrorists.\n  None of these excuses will stop the violence. And none is acceptable.\n  Time has run out. We are at the point where Chairman Arafat's lack of \naction against terrorists is a question not of capability, but of will. \nOnly if he chooses to act decisively can he put this perception to \nrest.\n  If not, he will confirm the worst fears of the international--\ncommunity that he is unable and unwilling to confront terror.\n  Without concrete action, Israel will be left with no choice but \ncontinue to defend itself.\n  The suicide bombings in Jerusalem in Haifa ended 26 innocent lives, \nbut they also ended something else.\n  They ended any patience the world has for excuses and inaction on the \npart of Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority.\n  It is time for them to prove that they have both the ability and the \nwill to stop the bloodshed. It is time for them to join the family of \nnations and work to end the specter of global terrorism.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12390-5", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12390-S12394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMPREHENSIVE RETIREMENT SECURITY AND PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2001--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2170\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I make a point of order that the \nDaschle amendment No. 2170 violates section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Oklahoma is recognized to raise a point of order.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Montana is recognized to \nmake a motion to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to waive the relevant section of \nthe Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I withdraw the request, Madam President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. Under the previous order, there will now be 30 minutes of \ndebate to be equally divided between the Senator from Montana and the \nSenator from Oklahoma or their designees.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, for the information of our colleagues, \nit is anticipated we will be voting at 10 o'clock. We may try to \nshorten that somewhat. It is anticipated we will have two votes, one on \na motion to waive a Budget Act point of order, as entered by Senator \nBaucus, and also on final passage of the Railroad Retirement Act. I \nnotify our colleagues that probably in the next 20 minutes or so we \nwill be voting on these two measures, for them to plan accordingly.\n  I make a budget point of order because we didn't have any funding. \nThe $15 billion in outlays we are getting ready to pass was not in the \nbudget. Granted, this bill has a lot of support. It had a lot of \nsupport when we passed the budget, but it was not included. It was not \nincluded in the House budget. It was not included in the Senate budget.\n  We had a budget. The budget we agreed upon said we were going to have \nso much in spending. This was not part of it. So we have to waive the \nbudget if we are going to pass it, or a budget point of order lies, or \nelse we are just breaking the budget.\n  The reason I raise this point is that Congress in the last several \nmonths has\n\n[[Page S12391]]\n\nbeen, in my opinion, pretty irresponsible. We have had spending grow \ndramatically, and yet many people are saying it is not enough. Some \npeople are saying, because of the disaster on September 11, we need a \nlot more money for this and for that. Some of us need to kind of total \nit up. I don't think we have totaled it up. Spending is growing \ndramatically.\n  I looked at the amount of money we spent in fiscal year 2000, last \nyear. It was $584 billion in total discretionary spending. In 2001, the \nyear we just completed, it was 640. That was a 9.6-percent increase for \ndomestic spending. For nondefense spending, that was 14-percent growth \nover the previous year.\n\n  That is a big increase. Nondefense spending last year, the year we \njust completed in September, grew at 14 percent.\n  President Bush's budget said let's have spending grow, total \ndiscretionary spending, up to $679 billion. That was a 6-percent \nincrease. After the disaster of September 11, we had a bipartisan \nagreement to get the budget agreed to of $686 billion. In addition to \nthat, President Bush agreed to the $40 billion, money for New York, for \nVirginia, for defense. That was an additional $40 billion. Add the $40 \nbillion to the $686 billion; that is $726 billion. That is a growth in \noutlays of 13.3 percent. And that is still not enough. It doesn't \ninclude the $15.3 billion we are talking about that will be required \noutlays for railroad retirement. If you add that together, that is \nanother 15.6 percent.\n  Somebody said that doesn't count because we have scorekeeping. We \nsaid we are going to put language in here: don't count it. The fact is, \nyou are going to have outstanding publicly held debt that is going to \ngrow by $15.3 billion as a result of this bill. The fact is, we will be \nborrowing that $15.3 billion; Treasury will borrow additional money. It \nis not coming out of the surplus. It is not even coming out of Social \nSecurity. It is coming out of publicly held debt. We are going to \nborrow more money, and we are paying about $1 billion per year every \nyear, maybe every year forever, to pay for this bill.\n  The 10-year cost in interest expense is going to be about $10 \nbillion. Our colleagues should know that. The amount of outstanding \npublicly held debt as a result of passage of this bill will be growing. \nI think people have not looked at that.\n  Then there are a few other items in the mill. When we take up the DOD \nappropriations bill, I understand Senator Byrd has an amendment to add \nan additional $15 billion for homeland defense and other things on top \nof it. We haven't considered that yet, but that is in the mill.\n  We have already passed airline assistance. I didn't add that. That \nhad outlays of about $5 or $6 billion, loan guarantees for up to \nanother 10. We don't know how that will score. It depends on how many \nwill default. But there is additional exposure there as well.\n  We have a stimulus package that was reported out of the Finance \nCommittee, two-thirds of which was spending, mostly outlays. Some of it \nwas for unemployment compensation, some of it for cash payments to \npeople who didn't pay taxes. But the net result of that stimulus bill \nthat passed out of the Finance Committee and that we considered on the \nfloor was about an additional $50 billion in outlays.\n  We have an agriculture bill we will be considering probably later \ntoday. It has additional outlays. And we have a victims compensation \nfund that was part of the airline bailout bill that no one knows, no \none in the genius of this body who authorized and passed that \nlegislation, how much it is going to cost. It could cost billions of \ndollars. We don't know how much the insurance companies are going to \npay. We don't know what kinds of rewards are going to be made to the \nsurvivors and to the victims of the September 11 disaster. It could \ncost billions. Congress legislated that little package. I was part of \nthe negotiations in the final hours. No one has a clue how much it is \ngoing to cost. It could be in the multibillions of dollars.\n  My point is, if you add all these numbers, we may be looking at \nspending growth in the 20- or 24-percent range. It is as if there is no \nbudget whatsoever.\n\n  I raise a budget point of order. That is why we have a budget. A \nbudget doesn't do any good if you are not going to use a point of \norder. Unfortunately, in many cases people in the Budget Committee \nhaven't felt inclined to use it. We waive budgets in cases of national \nemergency. I supported the $40 billion that was included. We believed \nthat was a national emergency. We were attacked. Let's give money for \ndefense of our country to go after those persons who attacked the \nUnited States. I am all for that. Let's assist people who need the help \nin New York and Virginia and Pennsylvania. We supported that. We waived \nthe budget to do it.\n  Maybe we will waive the budget to do railroad retirement. I expect we \nprobably will. The special interest groups have everybody on board this \nbill regardless of how much it costs, regardless if it may bankrupt the \nfund. The railroad retirees and their own accountants say the trust \nfund balance goes down to almost 1 year of payments in several years, \nalmost bankrupting the fund.\n  How does it do that? It greatly increases benefits, and it cuts \npayroll taxes. It leaves Uncle Sam as still guaranteeing the benefits. \nI would be all in favor of the railroads and the employees making \nwhatever kind of deal they want to make for their benefits. If it is \nmore generous than any other retirement plan in America, so be it, as \nlong as they don't ask for taxpayers to guarantee it and pay it.\n  Unfortunately, they are asking for both. They want one of the most \ngenerous retirement benefits in the country: 100 percent retirement at \nage 60, 100 percent survivor benefits. That is great. But they also \nwant us to pay for it if the fund goes broke, and even their own \nprojections have it almost going broke. Then to say now, yes, and we \nwant to waive the budget--the budget doesn't count?\n  If we are going to have a budget, let's use it. Let's abide by it. \nLet's have unanimous votes if we are going to waive it for cases of \nnational emergency. This is not a national emergency. That is the \nreason I made the budget point of order. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  I don't want to see our colleagues on the floor next year, or maybe \neven a month from now, saying: Where did the budget surplus go? We are \nnow in deficits. Where did it go? It must have been those Republicans. \nThey passed a tax cut. That tax cut, in the first year, was $37 \nbillion.\n  Let's see, I totaled up $40 billion for emergency spending, $15 \nbillion for airlines, $15 billion for railroads, and $15 billion that \nSenator Byrd is trying to pass. No telling how much spending will be in \nthe so-called stimulus package. When you add it up, there is going to \nbe much more of a spending problem than a tax cut problem.\n  My colleagues may say: Wait a minute, did I vote to waive the budget? \nDid I vote for that extra spending?\n  This is deficit spending. We are going to borrow an additional $15 \nbillion. We are going to have to waive the budget to do so. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to waive the budget point of \norder.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nDelaware desires.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I agree with my friend from Oklahoma on \nseveral of the comments he just made. We can ill afford, even in the \nenvironment in which we live today, to forget about fiscal restraint \nand the responsibility to manage our finances, not only in the short \nterm but in the long-term. But it is not just spending that we need to \nwatch. It is also the nature of the tax cuts that we have adopted and \nthe ones we are considering adopting as part of the economic stimulus \npackage.\n  Let me take a somewhat different approach to the legislation before \nus, for which we are now considering the step of waiving the Budget \nAct. I thank Senator Baucus for bringing the measure to the floor. I \nthank our leader for bringing this measure to the floor. I salute \nSenator Hatch and others who have introduced the legislation, which I \nhave cosponsored. I am not aware of anywhere in the Federal Government \nwhere we have a private sector type of pension plan. The railroad \nretirement\n\n[[Page S12392]]\n\nis somewhat difficult to understand. Let me take a minute and \ncontemplate what it is and what it is not.\n  The railroad retirement, which provides retirement benefits for \nhundreds of thousands of railroaders and their survivors, is a two-tier \nplan. Tier 1 deals with Social Security benefits, or reflects and \nmirrors Social Security benefits. We are not talking about addressing \nor dealing with those. Tier 2 is a pension plan that goes beyond Social \nSecurity benefits. Most people who work in the private sector in this \ncountry realize Social Security benefits. They also have a pension \nplan, in many cases, from their own employer. Those employers \ncontribute to those plans. The employees contribute to their employer's \npension plan established for them. Most employers, private sector \nemployers and, frankly, most public sector employers around the country \nwho have pension plans--the moneys that go into those plans are \ninvested, but they are not invested exclusively in securities issued by \nthe U.S. Treasury.\n\n  Tier 2 of the railroad retirement plan is different because the \nmoneys that are contributed by the employers--the railroad companies--\nand moneys contributed by employees of those railroads to the pension \nfund, the trust fund, are invested only in securities issued by the \nU.S. Treasury. Many States and local governments have changed the way \nthey invest their pension moneys. They have invested now in equities, \ncorporate stocks, and other investment options because the yield there \nis greater and they are able to provide better benefits and reduce \ntheir contribution into their pension fund.\n  The question before us in this bill is, Should we provide the same \nkind of flexibility for railroad companies and railroad retirees when \ncontributing to their tier 2 pension plans? Should we give them the \nsame flexibility that is enjoyed by other employers throughout the \ncountry? I believe we should. The question also is, In doing that, does \nthat somehow cause an outlay by the Federal Government? We still work \nin the Federal Government under a cash basis of accounting. Most \ncompanies and, in fact, almost all State and local governments use the \naccrual form of accounting. If we use an accrual form of accounting, my \nguess is we would not be debating whether or not this is actually a $15 \nbillion cash outlay. I think the point would be moot. But we still use \nthe cash basis, so that is the law under which we operate.\n  Having said that, we are not talking about the need to spend another \n$15 billion to build roads. We are not talking about another $15 \nbillion to provide better health care. We are not talking about another \n$15 billion to provide better environmental protection. We are talking \nabout a step here that says to the folks who oversee tier 2 pension \nfunds contributed to by employers--the railroad companies--and the \nrailroad employees: You don't have to just invest the money in your \ntrust fund in U.S. Treasury obligations. You can invest in other kinds \nof investments, such as securities, which would provide a greater \nyield, and then that anticipated yield, which has been proven over \nhistory, that greater yield will enable that pension fund to provide \nbetter benefits to railroad retirees and to their survivors.\n  That anticipated greater yield--again, proven historically --would \nenable the railroad companies, the employers, and the employees--\nparticularly the railroad employers--to reduce their contribution \nsomewhat. That is what this is all about. And because of an \nanachronism, we are forced to go through this procedure of waiving the \nbudget law and the extraordinary procedure yesterday of directing the \nspending.\n  This is a good measure. When we think it through and we look at the \nnumbers and the requirement for the railroad companies, the employers, \nto increase their contribution, if the tier 2 fund does run out of \nmoney, this is a measure that is responsible. I want to say to those \nwho brought it to the floor, on behalf of the hundreds of thousands of \nrailroad employees and pensioners and survivors, thank you for taking \nthis step for them and the companies for whom they work. I say to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, thank you again for bringing the \nmeasure to the floor and for yielding this time to me today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. How much time do we have on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me first congratulate the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I think what has happened basically is that we have seen \na very impressive lobbying effort where the railroads have gotten \ntogether with the unions and divided up $15 billion, which is the only \nbarrier between the taxpayer and massive injection of Federal funds \ninto the railroad retirement program. And basically this has been \nlobbied as some movement toward private investment in railroad \nretirement.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma and I both support private investment, but \nthe problem is that under the cloak of investing this $15 billion, as \nthe actuaries of railroad retirement show very clearly, under this \nbill, $15 billion plus all the interest earned on all the investments \nmade will be pillaged over the next 17 years as that money is taken out \nand miraculously divided exactly equally between the railroads and the \nrailroad retirees.\n  The railroads have lobbied hard for the bill because they say they \ncannot pay 16.1-percent payroll taxes. They can't afford it. Yet under \nthis bill, in 19 years, they are going to be moving toward paying 22-\npercent payroll taxes because they will have depleted the trust fund. \nDoes anybody believe they can or will pay 22-percent payroll taxes in \n19 years? Does anybody believe the railroads are not going to be before \nthe Congress saying they will be driven into bankruptcy, and they will \nhave to shut down every railroad in America if they are forced to pay a \n22-percent payroll tax? But that is what is required to keep this \nprogram solvent, after you pillage $15 billion.\n  I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. This has been an uphill battle. \nAmericans love bipartisanship and they love consensus. Those are \nwonderful things, but they are very dangerous things. What we have had \nis the railroads and the labor unions getting together, each having \ntheir affection attracted because they each get $7.5 billion, but what \nwe have really seen is a consensus against the taxpayers' interest. The \nSenator from Oklahoma has been courageous in standing up and pointing \nout that this emperor has no clothing. I congratulate him for that. We \nare going to have one final vote before the bill is passed, and that is \na point of order.\n\n  The telltale sign of the problem with this bill is not just that $15 \nbillion is divided up between the railroads and the railway unions. It \nis that in making the transfer this year, we are going to increase the \ndeficit by $15.3 billion. We have a budget that gives us some power in \ntrying to prevent these things from happening. If we were offsetting \nthe $15.3 billion in some other way, there would be no budget point of \norder, but there is a budget point of order because we are violating \nthe budget.\n  The final vote we are going to have is the vote on whether or not we \nare going to enforce the budget. I have to say, we have already started \nto see a partisan debate where many of our colleagues are saying we \nhave a deficit because of the tax cut. Today on this bill, we are going \nto raise the deficit by 40 percent of the impact of the entire tax cut \nfor this year. In fact, we are approaching the point where we will have \nincreased spending $100 billion above the budget this year.\n  If somebody votes to waive the budget point of order and says, we do \nnot care about the budget, the sky is the limit, we can spend anything \nwe want to spend and this is a popular thing to spend it on, then I \nhope they will not be out arguing that they are very concerned about \nthe deficit.\n  You cannot have it both ways. You cannot be for adding $15 billion to \nthe deficit and be concerned about the deficit. You cannot be for \nincreasing the deficit on one day and blaming somebody else for it on \nthe other.\n  I thank our colleague for his leadership. I intend to vote against \nwaiving the budget point of order. I hope my colleagues will as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I will be brief. We have had these \narguments\n\n[[Page S12393]]\n\nand made our points many times. It is important to put all of this in \nperspective. There is a lot of arcane budget language discussion here. \nA lot of that is very important. There is an important reason for \nhaving budgets.\n  Cutting through all the technical budget arcane language and green \neyeshade stuff, very simply the situation is this: The railroad \nretirement trust fund has built up a large balance. The question is \nwhat we should do about that.\n  We have decided in this legislation that the balance should be \nreduced by lowering the taxes the railroad companies have to pay--and \nthey are extraordinarily high taxes today--and also increasing survivor \nbenefits, for example, and the early retirement age which conforms with \ncurrent practices in other industries.\n  The charge is made that the balance will be too low, and that is \ngoing to jeopardize the budget, it is going to jeopardize the trust \nfund.\n  The fact is this legislation provides for many safeguards; there are \nactuarial reports, financial statements, and reports to the contrary. \nThe actuary himself has said at no time, even under this legislation, \nwill the balance in the trust fund be at such a level that it \njeopardizes the fund or payments to the beneficiaries or cause undue \nstrain on the railroad companies. That is the actuary's projection. He \nmakes that projection for the next 75 years.\n  Those of us in Congress have a hard time trying to predict what the \neconomic situation is going to be 10 years from now. That is pretty \nhard to predict. What we are talking about with this legislation is at \nleast 20 years from now, because that is when the trust fund is going \nto be dipping down to a lower level than is the case today. We have all \nkinds of oversight reports required by the legislation to make sure the \ntrust fund is safe.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma says we have to borrow $15 billion. That is \ntechnically true, but that is a wash because the trust fund will \nreceive $15 billion in assets. We have unified accounting in this case, \nso as a practical matter, that has virtually no effect on the budget.\n  Also, with respect to the trust fund, it is a wash, too, because some \nof those securities will be private securities as opposed to public \nsecurities.\n  Altogether, this is a bill that has been worked on for a long time. \nSeventy-four Members of the Senate cosponsored this legislation. We \nconsidered the bill last year in the Finance Committee. Over 20 \namendments were offered. The House has passed this legislation twice, \nboth times by very large margins. If this point of order is not waived, \nif this technicality is not waived, then there will be no bill passed \nand this bill is going to die.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nNevada?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this legislation is sponsored by Senators \nBaucus and Hatch. If there were ever two people who are fiscally \nconservative, it is Senators Baucus and Hatch. I do not need anything \nelse other than to know they are the ones who are pushing this \nlegislation to make me very comfortable with every vote I have taken.\n  I publicly commend and applaud Senators Baucus and Hatch for their \nleadership on this issue. We have gone a long way the last few days \nunder their leadership. Everyone should feel very good about waiving \nthe Budget Act. Remember, we are being asked to do this by two of the \nmost fiscally conservative people we have in the Senate--Senators \nBaucus and Hatch.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifty-three seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to clarify a few points. This $15 \nbillion transfer in the outstanding publicly held debt is not a wash. \nThat is $15 billion added to the deficit, added to national debt. We \nare going to have to borrow about $1 billion a year, maybe forever, to \npay for this. The Senator from Montana said this legislation makes \nbenefits conform with the norm. It is not the norm in the private \nsector pension benefits to get a 100-percent pension benefit at age 60. \nThat is not the norm. Nor is it the norm to have survivor benefits \nequal 100 percent. That is not the norm. They are very generous \nbenefits.\n  I do not begrudge them having generous benefits. I just do not want \nto have taxpayers pay for them when and if the fund goes broke, and \neven under their projections it almost goes broke. Why? Because we \nincrease benefits and cut the taxes and also we keep the Federal \nguarantee, and we have to waive the Budget Act to do it.\n  We did not put this money in the budget. We should have. I urge my \ncolleagues not to waive the budget act provisions.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am not going to use all my time. We have \nhad a very good debate on this bill. I strongly urge Members to vote to \nwaive the point of order because this is a very sound, fiscally \nresponsible bill. I know Senators will be very proud in voting for this \nlegislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields back his time.\n  All time having expired, the question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 in \nrelation to amendment No. 2170. The yeas and nays have been ordered. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

On this vote, the yeas are 80, the nays are \n19. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The point of order falls.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order the amendment No. \n2170 is agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nlegislation to reform the Railroad Retirement system. Reform \nlegislation has 75 cosponsors in the Senate and I am proud to be one of \nthem. Over the past 65 years, Railroad Retirement has provided a safe \nguarantee of benefits to railworkers and their families. In order to \nkeep these benefits secure, both management and labor have endeavored \nto come up with an agreement that would strengthen the Railroad \nRetirement system, and I believe that this legislation, The Railroad \nRetirement and Survivors' Improvement Act has done just that.\n\n[[Page S12394]]\n\n  This legislation represents a balanced benefits package that together \nwith phased-in tax cuts can provide and ensure the financial integrity \nof the Railroad Trust fund. This bill introduces sound investment \ntechniques into the effort to make better use of resources built up by \nrailway employees many who live in my home State of Oregon.\n  The legislation relies upon a number of features to ensure the fund \nwill meet its benefit obligations to retirees:\n\n       Fund Reserves. The legislation maintains four to six years \n     worth of benefits in reserve as a safety margin.\n       Automatic Tax Adjustment. Tax rates on employers and \n     employees will be adjusted automatically in an effort to \n     maintain a fund balance sufficient to pay between four and \n     six years of benefits.\n       Asset Management. Assets will be managed much like private \n     pension funds, providing the opportunity to earn higher rates \n     of return than the current 6 percent rate of return. Higher \n     returns will provide additional funds for benefit payments \n     and reduce the need for high payroll taxes.\n\n  I have been particularly worried about the plight of widows and \nwidowers of retired railroad employees. Under current law, their \nmonthly checks actually decline by two-thirds when a spouse dies. I \nbelieve this trust fund can do better by these widows and widowers and \nam happy that this legislation calls for the surviving spouse to \nreceive 100 percent of what the retired employee was entitled to. \nAlmost 50,000 retirees will be affected by this provision.\n  Further, this legislation allows the industry to reduce the \nburdensome payroll tax it now carries to provide benefits. A three \npercentage point drop in payroll taxes is phased in over three years. \nThe payroll tax was a very real disincentive to hiring employees or \nreplacing retirees and it frees up capital for other expenditures.\n  I am sure that the relatively swift passage of this reform \nlegislation is welcome by those in the Railroad industry and urge all \nmy colleagues, including the 75 cosponsors of this bill in the Senate, \nto continue to give it strong backing to ensure these needed \nimprovements are enacted and beneficiaries see these desperately-needed \nchanges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12394-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING SENATOR STROM THURMOND ON HIS BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

As far as I know, the Committee's Ranking \nMember also has no idea who has objected to the bill. This bill was \nvoted unanimously out of Committee and is completely lacking in \ncontroversy.\n  More specifically this bill makes significant enhancements to \neducational benefits for veterans and their families. The original GI \nBill allowed a generation of soldiers returning from World War II to \ncreate the booming post-war economy, and, in fact, the prosperity that \nwe enjoy today. Today's Montgomery GI Bill, MGIB, modeled after the \noriginal GI Bill, provides a valuable recruitment and retention tool \nfor the Armed Services and begins to repay veterans for the service \nthey have given to our Nation. As a transition benefit, it allows \nveterans to gain the skills they need to adjust productively to \ncivilian life.\n  I am very pleased that the legislation would increase the MGIB basic \nmonthly benefit by $50 per month this year, $100 in 2002, and $150 in \n2003. I am even more proud that this bill also takes the next \nevolutionary step to keep pace with the careers and education that \ntoday's veterans require. As our colleagues know, many servicemembers \nleave the military with skills that place them in demand for careers in \nthe technology sector. But even these veterans may require coursework \nto convert their military skills to civilian careers. The bill would \nallow veterans to use their Montgomery GI Bill educational benefits to \npay for short-term, high technology courses that would allow veterans \nto earn the credentials they need to gain entry to today's civilian-\nsector careers.\n  Currently, the MGIB provides a basic monthly benefit of $672 for 36 \nmonths of education. This payment structure is designed to assist \nveterans pursuing traditional four-year degrees at universities. \nHowever, in today's fast paced, high-tech economy, traditional degrees \nmay not always be the best option. Many veterans are pursuing forms of \nnontraditional training, such as short-term courses that lead to \ncertification in a technical field. In certain fields, these \ncertifications are a prerequisite to employment.\n  These courses often last just a few weeks or months, and can cost \nmany thousands of dollars. The way MGIB is paid out in monthly \ndisbursements is not suited to this course structure. For example, MGIB \nwould pay only $1,344 for a two-month course that could cost as much as \n$10,000.\n  The percentage of veterans who actually use the MGIB benefits they \nhave earned and paid for is startlingly low--45% of eligible veterans, \naccording to VA's Program Evaluation of the Montgomery GI Bill \npublished in April 2000--despite almost full enrollment in the program \nby servicemembers. By increasing the flexibility of the MGIB program, \nwe will permit more veterans to take advantage of these benefits. We \nshould give veterans the right to choose whatever kind of educational \nprogram will be best for them.\n  This legislation would modify the payment method to accommodate the \ncompressed schedule of the courses. Specifically, it would allow \nveterans to receive an accelerated payment equal to 60 percent of the \ncost of the program. This is comparable to VA's MGIB benefit for flight \ntraining, for which VA reimburses 60 percent of the costs. The dollar \nvalue of the accelerated payment would then be deducted from the \nveteran's remaining entitlement. This provision would also allow \ncourses offered by these providers to be covered by MGIB.\n  A provision that is extremely important right now would preserve \neducational benefits for those that must leave their studies to serve \non active duty in support of the National Emergency declared in \nresponse to the events of September 11th. This provision would restore \neducational entitlements for recipients of the Montgomery GI Bill, \nVeterans Educational Assistance Program, VEAP, and Dependent's \nEducational Allowance, DEA, for regular servicemembers and reservists \nwho are called up for active duty and who are forced to relocate or \ntake on extra work because of their participation in support of the \nNational Emergency. Their ability to complete their education should \nnot be compromised because they were called up in our fight against \nterrorism.\n  The bill would also increase the Dependent's Educational Allowance \nfor dependents and eligible spouses of veterans to $690 from $588. This \nprogram primarily provides for the children whose education would be \nimpeded because of the disability or death of a parent due to a \nservice-related condition. In addition, unremarried surviving spouses \nof veterans are generally eligible for the educational allowance in \norder to assist them in preparing to support themselves and their \nfamilies at the standard-of-living level that the veteran could have \nbeen expected to provide for his or her family but for the service-\nconnected disability or death. As we send troops into harm's way, it is \nentirely appropriate that we ensure that their families' futures are \nsecure.\n  The bill also enhances home loan programs. VA provides a guaranty to \nmortgage lenders rather than a direct home loan to servicemembers and \nveterans. A VA guaranty allows a veteran to buy a home valued at up to \nfour times the guaranty amount. The price of homes in major \nmetropolitan areas has increased significantly in the last several \nyears, yet the VA guaranty amount has not been increased since 1994.\n  This bill would increase the home loan guaranty amount to support a \nloan of up to $252,700, keeping pace with FHA loan guaranties. It would \nalso extend for 4 years the authority for housing loan guaranties for \nmembers of the Selected Reserve, currently set to expire in 2007. \nReservists must serve 6 years in order to become eligible for a VA-\nguaranteed loan. In order for the home loan to be used as a recruiting \nincentive now, the benefit must be authorized beyond 6 years.\n  Another provision of the bill would correct an unintended exclusion \nof certain Gulf War veterans from eligibility for service-connected \nbenefits. Our efforts to explain symptoms reported by many troops \nreturning from the 1991 Gulf War have been frustrated by inconclusive \nscientific data and by poor military record keeping during the \nconflict. In 1994, Congress passed the Persian Gulf War Veterans' \nBenefits Act to provide compensation to certain Gulf War veterans \ndisabled by ``undiagnosed illnesses'' for which no other causes could \nbe identified.\n  Since then, changes in medical terminology have led many Gulf War \nveterans to receive diagnoses for chronic conditions without known \ncause--such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia--which VA has \ninterpreted as precluding them from eligibility for benefits. Section \n202 of the Committee bill would correct this unintended exclusion by \nexpanding service connection to ``poorly defined chronic multisymptom \nillnesses of unknown etiology, regardless of diagnosis,'' characterized \nby the symptoms already listed in VA regulations.\n  Because scientific research has still determined neither the cause of \nveterans' symptoms nor the long-term health consequences of Gulf War-\nera exposures, and because the Department of Defense recently expanded \nits estimates of who might have been exposed to nerve agents, this \nsection also extends the presumptive period for benefits for Gulf War \nveterans for 10 more years.\n  This bill would also remove the arbitrary 30-year limit for \nmanifestation of Agent Orange-related respiratory cancers in Vietnam \nveterans. Current law only provides a presumption in Vietnam veterans \nfor respiratory cancer if the disease manifested within 30 years of \ntheir service in Vietnam. The most\n\n[[Page S12396]]\n\nrecent National Academy of Sciences report confirmed that there is no \nscientific basis for assuming that cancers linked to dioxin exposure \nwould occur with a specific window of time. This provision would \neliminate the 30-year limit and allow future claims for Vietnam \nveterans' respiratory cancers, irrespective of the date of \nmanifestation of the disease.\n  As you can tell, these are important provisions. But they are also \nnot opposed by anyone, as far as I can see. So why would someone block \ntheir passage? What further adds to my confusion is that a very similar \nscenario played out just a few weeks ago, with the very delayed passage \nof legislation to improve programs to homeless veterans. As America \nhonored its veterans on Veterans Day, a member of the Senate was \nblocking legislation to help those who have put their lives on the line \ndefending this country but who have fallen on hard times.\n  How is it, at a time when our Nation is at war and the resounding \ncall of patriotism rings in our ears a Senator or Senators is playing \npenny ante partisan politics with legislation to help veterans, \nservicemembers and their dependents? Everyone is now flying the \nAmerican flag. It is time that we act to honor those who carried it \ninto battle.\n  Again, I request that whomever has placed a hold on this bill please \ncome to speak to me I look forward to working with this colleague to \nresolve whatever impediments there are to Senate passage of this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12396-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12396-S12397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 2716\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator \nRockefeller, who is chair of the Veterans' Committee for his work. As a \nmember of the committee, I am very proud to support his request.\n  I say to the Senator from West Virginia, he has outlined, in this \nlegislation passed out of the committee, a set of benefits that are so \nimportant to veterans. Yet it is being blocked by an anonymous hold.\n  I also now ask unanimous consent--this is another piece of \nlegislation that I worked on together with Senator Rockefeller--that \nthe Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 201, \nH.R. 2716; that the Rockefeller-Specter substitute amendment be agreed \nto; the act, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related \nthereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this is legislation that didn't just \ncome up yesterday. It is something any number of us have worked on for \nthe last year and a half, 2 years--Lane Evans and Chris Smith from the \nHouse, Senators Rockefeller, Specter, myself. This is a passion for me, \nfocusing on homeless veterans. I think about a third of the adult males \nof this country who are homeless are veterans.\n  It is a scandal what we do with this legislation, which passed out of \nour committee 21 to 0 or thereabouts, a unanimous vote. It may have \nbeen a voice vote but a unanimous vote by the committee. What this \namendment does is it provides services for veterans who are struggling \nwith PTSD, addiction. Many of these veterans are Vietnam veterans. I \nused to spend a lot of time organizing the street people. This was long \nbefore I ran for the Senate. Many of them were veterans. Many of them \nwere Vietnam veterans.\n  This legislation provides job training assistance. It also enables \nveterans to try one-stop shop places where veterans can get the help \nthey need and tries to move people into affordable housing.\n  There is an anonymous hold. I went through this on this veterans \nhomeless bill four or five times before Thanksgiving. I know the \nSenator from Montana himself is not the one who objects. This is an \nanonymous hold.\n  My hold is not anonymous. I announced yesterday, I have a hold on \nevery single piece of legislation, every resolution that is \nnonemergency. We do a lot by unanimous consent in the Senate. We have \nunlimited debate. I love the Senate for that reason. We have unlimited \namendments. I love the Senate for that reason.\n  One of the ways we get a lot done is we work this through committees. \nWe massage it. We get everybody together and get consensus and we pass \nbills by unanimous consent.\n\n  Since this is an anonymous hold, my hold is not anonymous. I have a \npublic hold on every piece of legislation now from the other side until \nthis passes. I had to do that before Thanksgiving. I have to do it \nagain.\n  This did not come up just yesterday. We have been working on this \nmatter for the last couple of years. Anybody who objects can come out \nhere and object. We can debate it. I will say to my colleagues that \nthis is truly reprehensible.\n  It is not just the playing games. I use my leverage to fight for what \nI believe. In this particular case I am going to fight for veterans. I \nam proud to do so. It has been among the most meaningful work I have \never done as a Senator.\n  I am not a veteran. I was very involved in the war against the \nVietnam war. When I was elected to the Senate, I had some contact with \nveterans but not much. I was a college teacher in Northfield, MN. I \nknew some of the veterans but not well.\n  I especially didn't understand a lot of the World War II veterans. I \ndidn't know them. The best thing that has ever happened to me--I am not \nbeing melodramatic--as a Senator is that I have learned a lot. I have \ngrown as a person. I have had to be with a lot of people who don't see \nthe world the same way I do, which is good. Veterans have been my \nteachers. There are so many issues I have worked with for veterans. \nThis one I feel especially strongly about. It goes back to my community \norganizing days when a lot of poor people were homeless and many of \nthem were veterans.\n  I know a lot of these veterans. They come to our office in Minnesota. \nYou will be at a meeting with some of the veterans and guys who are \nstruggling with PTSD. They can't sit that long. They will get up every \n10 minutes. They will leave, and then they will come back. They are \nreally struggling. So are a lot of other veterans.\n  Don't you think it is a scandal that so many homeless people today in \nour country are veterans and many of them Vietnam vets? Don't you think \nit is a scandal that there is an anonymous hold on its consideration on \nthe floor of the Senate?\n  I was asked yesterday by a journalist whether or not the Senate's \nformer majority leader, Trent Lott, violated his word. Absolutely not. \nWe went through this before Thanksgiving. Everybody wanted to get this \nbill through dealing with the Internet and taxes or not taxes. The \nagreement was that the bill I had would go through and so then I took \nthe hold off other legislation.\n  Now we have something that has come back from the House, we \npreconferenced it, and Representatives Chris Smith and Lane Evans \nworked hard on that. It is a better version. I love working with other \npeople. Now we have this anonymous hold.\n  There are three issues here. No. 1, I thought we were doing some \nreform here on anonymous holds. I don't know what in the world is \nhappening. Something has broken down because, obviously, people \ncontinue to do it. That is No. 1.\n  Second is the substance. I don't really know what the objection can \nbe to this legislation. I don't know why a Senator would be opposed to \ngetting more resources and providing more help to veterans who are \nhomeless. I don't understand it, but I would like to see somebody come \nout and debate it.\n  Third, I was asked about the motivation. One more time, I have no \nidea what the motivation is. I don't know what is going on here \npolitically. But I will say this. I can promise my colleagues that no \nother legislation is going to move unless it is an emergency. My hold \nis not anonymous. No resolutions, no other legislation. Pretty soon, I \nmight even get to nominations in a day or two. That is what I will do \nuntil this passes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record at this point a column in the December 5 edition of the \nArizona Republic, the primary newspaper in my hometown, Phoenix, \nwritten by Robert Robb.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Critics of Bush Security Measures Forget We're at War\n\n       A democracy at war remains a democracy.\n       That means that the government's policies, including the \n     conduct of the war, remain appropriate subjects for \n     discussion and debate.\n       To underscore that point, and highlight the contrast with \n     the fascist enemy, Winston Churchill continued the practice \n     of the prime minister standing for questions before \n     Parliament during World War II.\n       As Churchill put it in his war memoirs: ``(A)t no time was \n     the right of criticism impaired. Nearly always the critics \n     respected the national interest.''\n       Churchill's description connotes a higher standard of \n     conduct than ordinarily pertains in a democracy for those who \n     criticize war policies, to be careful about facts and fair \n     about issues, to check the customary political hyperbole, \n     grandstanding and posturing.\n       The critics of the Bush administration's war policies are \n     beginning to fail this higher standard.\n       This is, in part, because President Bush failed to ask for \n     a formal declaration of war against al-Qaida, the Taliban and \n     other specified terrorist organizations.\n       The bombs falling in Afghanistan should have settled the \n     question. But without a formal declaration, there are still \n     those who want to treat this as a law-enforcement action, \n     rather than as a war.\n       But a war it is, and it has a domestic as well as foreign \n     front.\n       Enemies of the United States entered the country, stole \n     airplanes and killed thousands of Americans. The government \n     believes that there are other enemies still in the United \n     States who plan to commit similar acts of violence.\n       One of the war fronts is finding and incapacitating those \n     enemies living within.\n       Critics now casually and routinely depict the efforts of \n     the Bush administration to do so as an assault on civil \n     liberties.\n       There were reasons to object to certain provisions of the \n     anti-terrorism legislation, and, indeed, I so objected.\n       But the actual powers granted the government by the \n     legislation are routinely mischaracterized in the public \n     debate. More importantly, the general charge that the Bush \n     administration is trampling on civil liberties is \n     irresponsible hyperbole not justified by the record to date.\n       The administration has detained a handful of people as \n     material witnesses, as permitted by the grand jury laws. It \n     is detaining a larger number on suspected immigration law \n     violations.\n       Clearly, the administration is selectively enforcing long-\n     neglected immigration laws. But enforcing a law isn't \n     trampling on civil rights just because enforcement previously \n     has been lax.\n       The Bush administration has been roundly criticized for \n     wanting to ask questions of young men from Middle Eastern \n     countries. Given that all of the hijackers were of a similar \n     background, as are overwhelmingly the members of al-Qaida, \n     that's a perfectly sensible desire.\n       These interviews are voluntary at a time of war. The \n     adverse reaction to them is more revealing of the character \n     of the critics than of the administration.\n       Then there are the potential military tribunals for foreign \n     combatants. Under President Bush's executive order, he must \n     personally designate someone for such a trial. A military \n     tribunal would consider evidence with probative value, \n     although classified information could be reviewed in camera, \n     or in a judge's private office. Defendants would have \n     procedural rights and an attorney.\n       We are at war. Having such a mechanism in place may be \n     important to protect the security of the United States. \n     Having the option poses no threat to civil liberties. Whether \n     such tribunals adequately protect defendant rights and fairly \n     administer justice can only be ascertained in practice.\n       Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., is going to \n     bring Attorney General John Ashcroft before his committee to \n     answer inflated civil rights concerns. This is supposedly \n     part of Congress' vaunted oversight function, which receives \n     no mention in the Constitution.\n       Meanwhile, Leahy is neglecting the clear constitutional \n     duty to act on judicial nominations.\n       Leahy would better serve the nation by bringing some judges \n     before his committee for confirmation, rather than trying to \n     unfairly put Ashcroft in the dock.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to insert this column in the Record \nnot only because the author is one of the best writers from my hometown \nnewspaper, and frequently has very wise things to say, but also because \nhis column is right on point for something that has been troubling me. \nThe title is ``Critics of Bush Security Measures Forget We Are at \nWar.''\n  The point he is trying to make is that in this question of deciding \nhow we are going to make Americans more secure from terrorist attack, \nsome people are getting carried away in the expression of concerns \nabout the civil rights or due process rights of people who might be the \nsubject of military commissions or other investigations by our law \nenforcement or military people in connection with this war on \nterrorism.\n  I think he makes a good point. His essential point is that it is not \na zero sum game, that we can both provide for the security of our \ncitizens on the one hand and, on the other hand, ensure that American \ncitizens will always have their due process rights, and even for those \nwho are not American citizens, who become the equivalent of prisoners \nof war, and that the United States, through procedures developed for \nthe military commissions, will treat them fairly. I think that is a \nvery legitimate point to make.\n  The Attorney General is going to be before the Judiciary Committee, \nand he will be asked to respond to a lot of questions about how he is \nhandling his investigations and how the military commissions will work. \nI note that the President's order to the Defense Department to develop \nthe procedures for military commissions has not yet resulted in the \nrules and regulations, and rules of evidence and procedures, and so on, \nat least as far as I know. So it is premature to criticize those rules.\n  In the Judiciary Committee yesterday we heard from two eminent law \nprofessors, who I am sure would be happy to be called liberal in their \npolitical ideology: Laurence Tribe, with whom I have worked and for \nwhom I have a lot of respect; and Cass Sunstein; as well as two \nRepublican witnesses, both with significant experience in this area. \nAll four agreed this was the kind of circumstance that justified the \ncreation of military commissions and, indeed, that such commissions \nwere constitutional. The two more liberal professors said they would \nmake some changes around the margins. But nobody questioned the \nauthority of the United States of America to set up these tribunals in \norder to take care of those people who might be captured, particularly \nin the Afghanistan situation, or said it would not be appropriate to \ntry to bring them to justice under our article III court system in the \nUnited States.\n  I point that out to ask my colleagues to look at this column. I think \nit is very well written. It makes the point of what we need to be \nconsidering when we characterize the issue as a zero sum game, which it \nis not. We don't need to deprive anybody of appropriate civil liberties \nat the same time we are ensuring the security of the United States and \nits citizens from terrorist attacks.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I was speaking about the homeless \nveterans, many who struggled, I\n\n[[Page S12398]]\n\nwanted to bring colleagues up to date about the whole issue of \ndiscrimination against people who are struggling with mental illness.\n  It is difficult to believe that in the year 2001 there is a whole \nclass of citizens--probably well over 20 percent of the families in \nthis country have a loved one who struggles with mental illness--\ncertainly, all of us know someone who does--and they face \ndiscrimination. There still is a tremendous stigma attached to people \nwho struggle with mental illness. I remember testimony from a doctor \nwho said that when someone is in a hospital and they have had surgery \nfor cancer and they have had chemotherapy or radiation treatments and \nthey come home, neighbors gather around and give them support. Do you \nknow what. That is exactly the way it should be.\n  Often, if it is somebody who struggles with mental illness and they \nget out of a hospital, you don't see neighbors gathering around and \nsaying we want to support you. It is still considered by too many to be \na moral failing, even though it is a brain disease.\n  There was an editorial today--and I will not read from it because I \nthink Senator Domenici will--from the L.A. Times that is so powerful, \ncalling for parity and ending the discrimination for this brain \ndisease.\n  Unfortunately, this discrimination is reflected in the coverage. What \nwe have right now in so many health care plans around the United States \nof America, if you or your loved one--and, again, I am so sorry I don't \nhave the figures with me. Just take suicide among young people. Suicide \nkills more young people than cancer and about six, seven, or eight \nother terrible diseases we all hear about.\n  Suicide in Minnesota is the second leading cause of death in young \npeople. Nationwide it is the third. Your son or daughter is severely \ndepressed and you need help. You are told you have a few days in the \nhospital, and that is it. You can have some outpatient visits outside \nthe hospital, but just a few days, and that is it. Also, the copays and \ndeductibles are very high; in other words, what you have to pay before \nthere is any coverage or the percentage you have to pay.\n  It is completely different if your child has diabetes or a heart \ncondition or a broken ankle. We would not do that to people. We would \nnot say: OK, you struggle with this disease, diabetes; you are in the \nhospital a few days and then you are out or you can only see your \ndoctor so many times and there is no more coverage.\n  Even in our Medicare system, which I want us to change as well--by \nthe way, the highest percentage population of suicide is with the \nelderly. People do not realize that. All too often we say: Oh, well, if \nI was 80 and I was having a hard time walking, I would be depressed, \ntoo. It is incredible the way we trivialize this illness and the way we \ndiscriminate.\n  Do my colleagues know that in our Medicare program, if one goes under \npart B to see a doctor for a physical illness, it is a 20-percent \ncopay. If you struggle with depression and go to see someone for help, \nit is a 50-percent copay. That is blatant discrimination. That should \nend.\n  Senator Domenici and I--I thank him for his work; it has been an \nhonor to work with him--bring this bill to the floor. There has never \nbeen a hearing in the House of Representatives on the problem of \ndiscrimination. We offered an amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations \nbill. We had 66 Senators who signed on, and it passed out of the HELP \nCommittee 21 to 0. We passed it. Then it went to the conference \ncommittee.\n  I am speaking for myself, not for Senator Domenici or any other \nSenator. It is clear what is going on. We are in a fierce fight, but it \nis one of these fights that is not as open and public as one would \nwant. Robert Pear wrote an update about this issue in the New York \nTimes today. Thank goodness.\n  Overall it is hard to get the public's attention on this issue. There \nis a fierce fight going on. The insurance industry has gone to a couple \nof people in the House and has basically said: Kill it. Thanks to the \nwork of Patrick Kennedy, Marge Roukema, and others in the House, I \nbelieve there are around 250 House Members who have signed a letter \nsaying: Keep this in the conference committee, pass it, end the \ndiscrimination.\n  If we ended the discrimination, it would be civil rights. We would \nend the discrimination in treatment for people who struggle with this \nillness. Believe me, I say to my colleagues, it is an illness. It is \nfor real.\n  Second, if there is money in the plans, the care will follow the \nmoney, and a lot of kids will get help rather than winding up \nincarcerated. A lot of people will get help rather than winding up \nhomeless. A lot of adults will get help rather than winding up in \nprison. A lot of people will not miss as many days at work and be more \nproductive and families will be better off. There will be fewer \nproblems. This is the thing to do. It is the right thing to do.\n  The CBO says it will cost 1 percent increase in premiums. That is it. \nNot to mention the $70 billion David Satcher, our Surgeon General, said \nwe spend as a result of our failure to provide the treatment for \npeople. Mr. President, $70 billion over 5 years is $350 billion. It is \nnot only morally the right thing to do, it is economically the right \nthing to do. It is 2001. We should have done this 100 years ago.\n\n  The insurance industry marches on Washington, DC, every day, and they \nput the word out, they put the fix in: Kill it in conference.\n  I have come to the Chamber of the Senate today to ask my colleagues \nto please be strong and hang in there. Senators Harkin and Specter are \nour key leaders. Hold the line. I have come here to appeal to House \nMembers to not kill this bill, and I have come to appeal to the White \nHouse: We need your help. This is the perfect example of compassionate \nconservatism. It is a matter of ending the discrimination.\n  Kay Jameson, who has written some brilliant books and just won a \nMcArthur Foundation Genius Award--she deserves it--has written that the \ngap between what we know and what we do is lethal. The tragedy to all \nthis is that these illnesses--I mentioned depression as one example; I \ncould mention many others as well--are diagnosable and treatable, in \nfact, with a far greater success rate than many of the physical \nillnesses.\n  My wife Sheila and I started going to some gatherings with an \norganization called SAVE which was started by Al and Mary Ann Kluzner \nin Minnesota. Al Kluzner is a Republican. I hope Mary is not. I am \nteasing.\n  The point is, this illness does not know any political party \nboundaries. It does not know any economic boundaries. SAVE is an \norganization of family members who lost loved ones to suicide. One \nfeels that it is their own fault where all the evidence shows this is a \nbrain disease. It used to be it was maybe 50 people coming together, \nand sometimes now the gatherings are 300 and 400 people. This is all \nabout making sure they get the help. This is all about making sure that \nthe illness is treated. This is all about preventing suicide. This is \nall about dealing with a broad range of mental illnesses that affect \nadults and children throughout our country, and yet we have this \ndiscrimination. We do not even tell the plans they have to provide the \ncoverage. I want to. We just say if you have mental health coverage, \ntreat it the same as physical health. There should be no \ndiscrimination.\n  This insurance industry has tried to put the fix in and stop this in \nconference committee.\n  I am still hoping we can get the support from the White House. I am \nstill hoping we can pass this legislation because the consequences are \nso tragic if we fail to pass it.\n  Mr. President, I will stop, otherwise I will go on for hours. I yield \nthe floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Wellstone). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12398-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12398-S12400]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY POLICY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nmajority will be introducing a comprehensive energy bill this morning \nor perhaps\n\n[[Page S12399]]\n\nearly this afternoon. I want to make my views known on that because it \nrepresents a departure from tradition in the Senate of bipartisanship \nwithin the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  I believe we can anticipate the Democratic leader and the chairman of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources will be introducing their \nbill this afternoon. This will not have any input from the minority.\n  I am pleased, on the one hand, to see finally some acknowledgment by \nthe other side of the aisle that energy is important to our Nation's \nsecurity and it should be a priority of this Congress. I think it is \nalso important to note--and I ask unanimous consent that the recent \npoll of the Ipsos-Reid Group be printed in the Record--76 percent of \nAmericans have indicated energy should be taken up as the No. 1 \npriority of this body.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Citizens for Real Energy Solutions\n\n\n                 Energy Poll Summary--November 14, 2001\n\n       95 percent of Americans believe it is ``very'' or \n     ``somewhat important'' for the government act on energy \n     issues. Only ``security'' is a higher priority than energy \n     among voters today.\n       72 percent believe that energy issues are a higher priority \n     than before the September 11 attacks and the war on \n     terrorism, including 70% of Democrats. This means 72 percent \n     of people think energy is a higher priority than it was when \n     the House passed HR 4 by a wide, bipartisan margin. (240-189, \n     with 36 Democrats voting in favor)\n       86 percent think ``decreasing dependence on foreign oil and \n     gas is important to national security''\n       Two-thirds (67%) of those surveyed agree that opening ANWR \n     can be done in an environmentally sensitive manner. 53% of \n     Democrats believe it.\n       Of those who have ``read, seen, or heard anything about the \n     Bush Administration's National Energy Policy,'' supporters \n     outnumber opponents by an overwhelming 60 percent to 26 \n     percent.\n       And finally, 73 percent of those we polled--including a \n     majority of Democrats--find President Bush's repeated calls \n     for the Senate to pass energy legislation to be sufficient \n     reason to act.\n       [The surveys were conducted by Ipsos-Reid, an international \n     public opinion and market research firm, from Oct. 5--Nov. 10 \n     and from Nov. 9-12, 2001. These polls were based on randomly \n     selected samples of 532 and 733 adult Americans, \n     respectively. With samples of these sizes, the results are \n     considered accurate to within   4.3 percentage points and   \n     3.7 percentage points respectively.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. While there is some satisfaction in seeing that the \nmajority has agreed to prioritize energy, on the other hand I am \nabsolutely dismayed at the partisan nature in which this bill was put \ntogether and the extraordinary means taken to remove the bill from the \ncommittee's jurisdiction.\n  I am going to spend my time today talking about the process rather \nthan the substance since neither I nor most of the other members of the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources were afforded the opportunity \nto see this legislation until it was introduced. I find it rather \ndisappointing and I guess somewhat humorous that so much fanfare has \nbeen linked to this bill's introduction when in fact it is the second \ntime this year alone we have had a similar occurrence. The leadership \nhas taken over the responsibility of the committees of jurisdiction and \nbasically proposed to introduce legislation that does not reflect the \ninput of the minority. This was done first in the Finance Committee on \nthe stimulus bill.\n  I am a member of the Finance Committee, and I participated in the \neffort where the majority leader and the chairman of the committee \nbasically introduced their version of stimulus and we found we had no \ninput in it so we were at a stalemate. Now we see where we are on \nstimulus today. We are negotiating with basically the authority of the \nmajority of two over the minority of one. We are not going to have \nopportunities to amend or even hardly be heard on our views, which I \nthink is unreasonable, unhealthy, and undemocratic, but this is what \nwas done as well in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  There is no question the need for a comprehensive energy policy is a \ncritical and pressing issue for this Nation and for this institution. \nAt the beginning of this Congress, I sought out my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle and did what we could to get together to \nintroduce comprehensive energy legislation. I think we tried to reflect \ntheir interests in the bipartisan and traditional way the committee \nworked. S. 388 and S. 389, which were the Murkowski-Breaux bipartisan \nbills, while not perfect, met the requirement and remain the only \nbipartisan comprehensive energy measure introduced in the Senate. I did \nnot think and I still refuse to accept that the energy needs of this \nNation should be a partisan issue, but evidently those on the other \nside believe they have a better energy bill and can do it better \nwithout us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Under the previous \norder, the Senator from Alaska has only a few seconds remaining. Under \nthe previous order, at 11:45 a.m., other business will intervene.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed 7 minutes to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, energy should not be a partisan issue. \nFor over 3 months, our Committee on Energy and Natural Resources has \nbeen effectively dissolved. The committee was closed while this \ndocument was put together behind closed doors, with no input from the \nminority.\n  The Democratic leader has selected his deputies and their special \ninterests, whatever agreements were arrived at in deference to the \nSenate and the committee rules, blatantly bypassing the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a release from the chairman of the \ncommittee dated October 9 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: Jeff Bingaman, Chairman, Senate Committee on Energy and \n         Natural Resources.\n\n  Energy Committee Suspends Mark-Ups; Will Propose Comprehensive and \n             Balanced Energy Legislation to Majority Leader\n\n       At the request of the Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further mark-up of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress. Instead, the \n     Chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added by the Majority Leader to the \n     Senate Calendar for potential action prior to adjournment.\n       Noted Bingaman, It has become increasingly clear to the \n     Majority Leader and to me that much of what we are doing in \n     our committee is starting to encroach on the jurisdictions of \n     many other committees. Additionally, with the few weeks \n     remaining in this session, it is now obvious to all how \n     difficult it is going to be for these various committees to \n     finish their work on energy-related provisions.\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Bingaman said, the \n     Senate's leadership sincerely wants to avoid quarrelsome, \n     divisive votes in committee. At a time when Americans all \n     over the world are pulling together with a sense of oneness \n     and purpose, Congress has an obligation at the moment to \n     avoid those contentious issues that divide, rather than \n     unite, us.\n       Bingaman will continue to consult and build consensus with \n     members of his committee, with other committee chairs and \n     with other Senators as he finalizes a proposal to present to \n     the Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The letter says:\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further markup of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress.\n\n  Now that is pretty blatant, in my opinion, taking the authority away \nfrom the committee. So much for the legislative process, the value of \nthe committee process, or the interests of this Nation and our fellow \ncitizens. So much for the majority leader and the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee defending the Standing Rules of the Senate and the \nrules of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Why was this extraordinary action taken? According to a press \nrelease, as I have indicated, the Democratic leader made this decision \nbecause he wanted to avoid, ``quarrelsome, divisive votes in the \ncommittee.'' The fact is we had the votes in the committee to pass it \nout, and it was generally known. It was known by the chairman, it was \nknown by the majority leader, and it was known by the majority.\n  One of the purposes of the committee is to test various proposals to \nprovide the Senate with consideration and a recommendation. Our \ndistinguished President pro tempore, Senator Byrd,\n\n[[Page S12400]]\n\nnoted in his remarks on the history of the Senate that the use of \ncommittees in legislative bodies predated the first Congress. There are \nrecords of joint committees of the House of Lords and the House of \nCommons in the English Parliament in the 1340s. This history is \nespecially instructive when he discusses the reforms that have \noccurred, especially those that opened the committee process and \nlimited the autocratic power of committee chairs.\n  Senator Byrd's discussion of these reforms in the 1970 Legislative \nReorganization Act is particularly relevant. He quoted William White's \ndescription in the Senate committee in the mid-1990s as ``an imperious \nforce. Its chairman, unless he is weak and irresolute, is, in effect, \nan emperor.''\n  The 1970 reforms were intended to curb that power and open the \nprocess. The majority of the committee were given the power to call a \nmeeting if the chairman refused, and I obviously have not gone to that \nextent.\n  Later reforms opened our business meetings, with a few exceptions, to \nthe public. Rule 16-3: to fix regular biweekly or monthly meeting days \nfor the transaction of business before the committee. Further, the \ncommittee shall meet on the third Wednesday of each month while \nCongress is in session for the purpose of conducting business. Neither \nthe Standing Rules of the Senate nor the committee rules provide an \nexception for the Democratic leader to abolish committees or order them \nto cease activities whenever there is a likelihood that there may be a \nbipartisan action that would conflict with his particular agenda.\n  Those rules, according to the Democratic leader, now do not apply to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. I ask why. The reason is \nclear. We have the votes, so he is not going to let us vote. Apparently \nwhenever it is convenient to the Democratic leader, the rules of the \nSenate can now be suspended and the rights of members of standing \ncommittees of the Senate can be abandoned. The majority of the members \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources have been ready, \nwilling, and able to complete action on a comprehensive bill.\n  Yes, there would be votes on amendments. What is wrong with that? \nSome would pass and some would fail. I have always been prepared to \nlive with the results to bring a bill to the Senate, but at least there \nwould be debate in public and an opportunity for all Members to \nparticipate. I believe virtually all the members of the committee share \nthat view.\n  Since the Democratic leader closed the committee, there has not been \na single business meeting on energy and, in fact, there have been no \nbusiness meetings at all. It is a sad state of affairs when the \nauthorizing committee is precluded.\n  This abuse of the legislative process is outrageous. This \nconcentrated action by the leadership to deny the committee members the \nopportunity to advise the Senate is reprehensible. The majority leader \nhas abolished one of the standing committees of the Senate and crafted \npartisan legislation behind closed doors with special interests without \na whimper from the press. It is abundantly clear now this has been the \nstrategy all along and that all rhetoric about national energy security \nand bipartisanship has been empty talk, devoid of any substance. We can \nwrite the Democratic speech now as the leader pleads with colleagues \nnot to offer divisive amendments.\n\n  We hear the partisan calls: We wanted to move an energy bill, but \nsome Members insisted on offering amendments that he did not like, \namendments that should have been dealt with in committee. We can \nprobably imagine the editorials now, castigating Republicans for not \naccepting whatever may be in the proposal that it is about to be \nunveiled.\n  We need an energy policy in this country. This Nation deserves better \nthan this travesty. The American public deserves a fair, honest, and \nopen debate on this critical issue. We need conservation, we need \nefficiencies. We need additional research. We need development. We need \nto deal with our infrastructure and our domestic supply for developing \nand refining transportation and transmission. We certainly need to \nprovide for the security of our energy supplies.\n  Maybe we are now at the stage where the country will have to live \nwith a take-it-or-leave-it package, cobbled together in some back room \nby the Democratic leader. But this Nation deserves better. The Members \nof both sides of the aisle who serve on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee deserve better. We deserve the opportunity to \ndebate, discuss, and vote. This is an institution that did not fear and \nshould not fear debate.\n  I brought the nuclear waste legislation to the floor in an open and \nfully transparent process last Congress. I don't think the \ndistinguished Democratic whip, my good friend, the senator from Nevada, \nwould accuse me of being other than up front and honest with him. \nAlthough we disagreed on the subject, I was always willing to talk \nopenly. This is the way the Senate should work.\n  What has happened here is that not only have the views of the \nminority of the committee been silenced but the views of the Members, \nas well. I am certain the majority leader will take steps on the Senate \nfloor to further restrict amendments.\n  One of the interesting things about this is the elastic \nbipartisanship on this, the comity of the Senate that normally would \nhave Senators consult with their colleagues whose States are affected \nby a given measure are also falling victim to the Democratic leader's \nassault on the institution. I understand included in the legislation \nput forward by the Democratic leader are provisions dealing with the \ndevelopment and transportation of natural gas owned by the State of \nAlaska. These provisions were again developed behind closed doors \nwithout consultation to either the Senators or the Governor of our \nState.\n  Finally, make no mistake about it. While I support opening the gas \nline from Alaska, I am not here in the Chamber criticizing the \ncompanies, which is what many of our Democratic friends have done. As a \nconsequence, I will have far more to say about the majority leader's \nproposal once we are given the courtesy of seeing it. Unfortunately, \nits introduction comes with a heavy price of the Senate and the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Iowa, the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have 1 hour equally divided; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I look forward to the vote on cloture. I \nhope it will be an overwhelming vote. I hope we can move on this bill \nright away, today. Time is wasting, as they say. The clock is ticking. \nWe are here. We are in Washington. We are ready to do business. I \nbelieve we have a good bill. I believe we have a very good, well-\nbalanced farm bill. It is a 5-year farm bill. We have reported it out \nof committee. We are ready to bring it to the floor and have it open \nfor amendments that Senators might offer.\n  It is a 5-year bill. It is a comprehensive bill. I think it provides \ngreater improvements to the farm commodity\n\n[[Page S12401]]\n\nand income protection programs. We are strong on conservation, rural \neconomic development. Agricultural trade and research has a good \nprovision.\n  I will have more to say about my distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Lugar, and the great work he has done on agricultural research.\n  We have nutrition assistance programs, we have a new title dealing \nwith energy, and of course credit titles and forestry titles. It is a \ncomprehensive farm bill. I know a lot of the press tends to focus only \non commodities. Commodities, obviously, are an important part of the \nfarm bill. However, this farm bill covers other areas across the United \nStates which I will talk more about.\n  I thank the ranking Republican member of our committee, Senator \nLugar, former distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee. I very much enjoyed working with him and his staff, \ndeveloping this bill. I can say without any hesitation that we have had \na very high level of cooperation and a bipartisan working relationship \nand collaboration in writing this bill. In fact, all but one of the \ntitles of this bill represents a bipartisan agreement. All titles of \nthis bill passed in our committee with bipartisan votes.\n\n  That shows we did, in fact, work closely together. We did have a vote \non the commodity title and even there, there was a bipartisan vote. To \nbe sure, it was not the same as on the other titles, but we voted to \nuphold the committee's commodity title.\n  Again, as an indication of the broad-based support that we had in the \ncommittee for the bill, even though there were some who may have wanted \nto change the commodity title we reported the bill out on a voice vote, \nwhich is in practical effect unanimous.\n  Let me point out the legislation is within our committee's budget \nlimitations for the new farm bill. We were allowed by the Budget \nCommittee $7.35 billion for fiscal 2002, and $73.5 billion for the 10 \nyears, above the baseline. The bill has been scored within those \nlimitations.\n  I hope we can move forward and work our way through this bill. As I \nsaid, we are ready to consider amendments. I am hopeful--and I say this \nwith all due respect to Senators. I know people may want to have \namendments to this that they feel strongly about. I myself in the past \nhave felt strongly about amendments to farm bills when they have come \nto the floor. But the important point is to move the bill forward and \nnot slow down the farm bill. We should have amendments, debate them in \na timely fashion, vote on them, and move on.\n  I am hopeful we can reach meaningful time agreements on the \namendments that will be offered to this bill. Of course, I believe it \nis a good bill as it came out of the committee. But I understand there \nwill be some who may want to offer amendments.\n  Why act now? Why not wait until next year. We have heard some talk \nabout waiting until next year for a farm bill. Frankly, farmers around \nthe country need to know what the farm program is going to be, and they \nneed to know soon.\n  A lot of farmers are going to be going to the bankers right after the \nfirst of the year to get the money they need for their crops, to put in \ntheir crops. What is the banker going to say? ``What is the program \ngoing to be? What can you count on?''\n  How are the farmers going to fill out the paperwork to go into the \nbanker to get the money they need to plant crops if they have no idea \nwhat the program is going to be?\n  That is why it is so important that we finish this legislation and \ngive a clear signal to the agricultural community and the agricultural \ncredit community just what we are going to have for next year.\n  The other reason is--and I will be repeating this data over and over \nagain as we go through the debate on the farm bill--that there really \nis a crisis in rural America, since soon after the 1996 farm bill was \npassed.\n  In 1996, we had net farm income of $55 billion nationally. Since that \ntime, net farm income has fallen to an average of $46.3 billion, a \ndecline of nearly 16 percent.\n  Had it not been for the sizeable Government payments from the farm \nbill and the additional payments that we in the Congress have made in \nthat period, which includes about $30 billion in additional emergency \npayments over those years, if we had not had those payments, net farm \nincome would have fallen to less than $30 billion on average.\n\n  Thus, had it not been for the Congress coming in every year on an ad \nhoc basis, the market-generated net returns to farmers would have been \nonly 54 percent of what we had in 1996. That is why it is so critical \nwe move ahead and get this legislation passed.\n  Commodity programs are only part of the reason to move ahead. Several \nof USDA's critical conservation programs are simply out of money. The \nWetlands Reserve Program, the Farmland Protection Program, and the \nWildlife Habitat Incentives Program are all out of money. I say to \nthose who are interested in conservation and want to promote and \nprovide for conservation, we need the money now, not next year. That is \nbecause many of these programs have to be funded on a continual basis.\n  Take the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, for example. That is \nnot something that should be just stopped and then started. The \nWetlands Reserve Program is not a program that can be kept in abeyance \nfor 9 or 12 months, and then just be started again without real \nnegative consequences. These are conservation programs that need \ncontinual infusions of money for the protection of our endangered lands \nand endangered species.\n  The Environmental Quality Incentives Program--the EQIP--to defray \nconservation cost of crop and livestock producers, is far short of the \nresources needed. It is not out of money just now, but the funding is \ninadequate for the need out there. This bill substantially increases \nfunding.\n  However, if we do not pass the legislation soon, the USDA will not be \nable to carry out the conservation programs adequately during the \npresent fiscal year. Also, the bill will help provide very important \nand much needed new help in the areas of rural economic development, \nagricultural trade, research, credit, nutrition, and renewable energy. \nSo we need to move ahead without delay.\n  At some point later on I will take the time to go through the bill \nand talk about the different commodity and other programs covered in \nthe bill, all the various aspects that are in the bill, but I do not \nbelieve that is necessary right now. We are coming up to a cloture \nvote. I basically wanted to take the floor to say why it is so \nnecessary we move ahead and not delay this bill any longer. We have a \nhuge decrease in net farm income. We have to address that.\n  We have to let the bankers and the farmers know what kind of program \nthey can count on next year. But, again, if we do not move this bill \nsoon, farmers will be going to the banks and seeking credit for the \ncrops they are going to be putting in without knowing what to expect in \nthe farm program. That is why we need to move on this legislation right \nnow.\n  In addition, we need to move on the bill to make sure we keep the \nfunding stream going for our necessary conservation programs.\n  Mr. President, I want to again publicly thank my good friend and \nranking member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and \nForestry, Senator Lugar. He was chairman for more than six years. He \nwas a great steward of the committee. He did a great job guiding, \ndirecting, and leading the Agriculture Committee. I am proud to follow \nin his footsteps as chairman of the Agriculture Committee.\n  I again thank him and his staff for all the working relationships \nthat we have had in developing this farm bill and in all the other work \nwe have been doing on the Agriculture Committee. I want to thank \nSenator Lugar for that great working relationship.\n  With that, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as many minutes as are \nrequired.\n  I deeply appreciate the thoughtful comments of my colleague, the \nchairman of our committee. Let me reiterate the importance of what he \nhas said on the bipartisan cooperation on major titles. He has touched \nupon them. I shall do so again because each represents superb staff \nwork and work\n\n[[Page S12402]]\n\nby Senators to achieve virtually unanimous results: The rural \ndevelopment title, the research title, the energy title, the forestry \ntitle, the trade title, the credit title, and the conservation title.\n  With regard to research and nutrition, during the course of the \ndebate and events and the will of the Senate to continue with this \nbill, I would want to say more. I believe we can improve both of those \nareas very substantially. We can do so through substantial change in \nthe commodity section. So there will be an offset to do that.\n  But giving credit where credit is due, a substantial number of titles \nare reasonably settled and I think will meet with the favor of the vast \nmajority of Senators.\n  The debate we are having during this hour is on a motion to invoke \ncloture so that we can proceed to the Agriculture bill today. \nTherefore, that is the issue on which the Senate needs to focus. The \nquestion is, Why today? What is the compelling need to proceed to this \nlegislation?\n  First of all, most Americans who are presently watching television, \nif they are not on the C-SPAN channel watching this debate, are \nwatching developments on the war in Afghanistan. They are watching a \ngripping drama in which Americans are at risk.\n  There is, in my judgment, a compelling need for us to be discussing \nthe defense budget and issues that are involved with terrorism, whether \nthey involve a continuation of the insurance industry, for example, or \nother aspects of the war. We are in a war.\n  This has been the case really throughout this strange preoccupation \nwith the Agriculture bill. I say ``strange'' because the Agriculture \nlegislation we now have on the books does not expire until next \nSeptember 30--over 9 months from now. During that period of time, so-\ncalled AMTA payments--fixed payments--will be made to all the farmers \nwho are in the program. A seventh year of payments will occur \nautomatically. So will loan deficiency payments to farmers who have the \nrow crops that are covered by the loan deficiency program. In short, \nthe stable safety net that has been sought remains, plus very large, \nfixed payments. None of that changes during the coming months.\n  Parenthetically, there is a need, I suppose, to discuss the defense \nbudget and to do so in line with things which have occurred in our \nAmerican economy since the first thoughts about a new farm bill began.\n  For example, at the time the Senate and House Budget Committees began \nto formulate the resolution last year, I note from the chart that was \nprepared by OMB that the surplus was estimated at $313 billion for the \nfiscal year commencing October 1. As a matter of fact, I recall that \nthe President of the United States, during the State of the Union \nAddress, discussed surpluses in the future that might approximate $3 \ntrillion--if one extrapolated further, as much as $5 trillion--and \nsuggested how responsibly the Congress might allocate that money. That \nwas February. But by May, there were at least some signs of a weakening \neconomy seen by the same persons who prepared the chart.\n  I look at it here. We now know officially that a recession occurred, \nor started, in March. But this was being picked up by the budget \nofficials. They then estimated in May that the surplus would be only \n$304 billion, only incrementally down from the estimate of $313 \nbillion. But we went on recess in August. Things had changed abruptly \nby the time we returned on Labor Day. By then it was $176 billion for \nthe fiscal year commencing October 1.\n\n  Then, in the post-September 11 period, the first time the authorities \nhad another chance to take a look at this, $176 billion had evaporated, \nand it was down to $52 billion--just double digits--some distance from \n$313 billion barely 8 months before.\n  The head of OMB in an address to the Press Club last week gave the \nvery bleak news that for the next 3 years--not just for the year \nimmediately ahead of us--there will be deficits in the Federal \naccounts--not $313 billion of surplus, or the $176 billion, or even the \n$52 billion, but red figures.\n  The entire farm bill debate in Congress has proceeded almost as if we \nwere in a different world from the one in which there is war, \nrecession, and deficits.\n  Senators with a straight face have said: We were told in the Budget \nCommittee a long time ago that there was $73.5 billion above the \ncurrent baseline--$100 billion--allocated to agriculture over a 10-year \nperiod of time. By golly, we are going to claim it. You can have a war, \nyou can have a recession, and you can have deficits, but that \nadditional $73.5 billion remains inviolate above any other priorities \nof the country.\n  Post-September 11, some Senators who held that point of view became \nnervous. They said: At some point people may begin to make estimates \nthat it is gone and that there is no money. But harking back to the \nbudget resolution, there is the additional $73.5 billion, and ignoring \nreality, or whatever may transpire now, not for just the next year but \nfor 3 years down the trail, if we do not pass a farm bill--and in a \nhurry--somebody may question whether the $73.5 billion is there.\n  Indeed, most Americans question it. We have an extraordinary ``Alice \nin Wonderland'' quality about the agriculture debate in which people \nwith blinders on ignore the rest of the world, but I think at their \nperil.\n  One reason all of this has accelerated is that my distinguished \ncolleague, the majority leader, the distinguished member of our \ncommittee, Senator Daschle--seemed to want to accelerate the farm bill, \nand wanted to see a bill on the floor. He was not alone. It was \nsuggested by others that Senators who are moving into reelection phases \nin various farm States did not want to go home without not only \ndiscussing it but passing it, nailing down that additional $73.5 \nbillion whether it is there or not. Furthermore, their political \njudgment was there would be liabilities if they did not succeed in that \nquest.\n  Each Senator has to be the best judge of his reelection prospects. I \ndon't fault anybody who believes they need to proceed to a farm bill \nand spend as much money as the law will allow. And maybe that will help \nthat Senator. But I doubt it. I doubt it simply because the political \nfacts of life are that this time the American people are looking in on \nthe debate. One reason they usually don't look in on these debates is \nthey are very complex issues. Most Senators would be hard pressed to go \nthrough a glossary of agriculture terms that are a part of these bills. \nSo they do not try. They do not want to be embarrassed by indicating \nthey really do not understand what this is all about. But I think they \nwill by the time this debate and the discussion of it is concluded.\n  If I were a Senator running for reelection, I would not want to vote \nfor cloture today. I would not want to put any stamp on a bill coming \nout of the Agriculture Committee. It contains, in its commodities \nsection, bad policy, which will be harmful to agriculture, not helpful.\n\n  I think the exception, perhaps, is my distinguished friend from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley. I understand the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, \nMrs. Lincoln's family may collect some payments from these programs. \nBut I receive payments from the programs. The Lugar stock farm ranks \nNo. 22 in Marion County in terms of the payments received. How do I \nknow? Because the Environmental Working Group has a Web site. The Wall \nStreet Journal introduced the country to this just last week. If you \nare curious, you can go into that Web site and find out, down to the \ndollar, how much every farmer in your State has received during the \nperiod of 1996 to 2000. It will be a revelation.\n  Let me just discuss the politics that seems to drive the issue today. \nOne prominent farmer in my State, who was named in an article that the \nAssociated Press picked up, having taken a look at this Web site, was \nfound to have received almost $2.9 million in farm payments in the last \n5 years. That came as a shock to my constituents in Indiana who are not \nfarmers. Worse still, this farmer criticized my stand. He said: Lugar \nis way off base; he wants to limit these payments.\n  At the time, he had it wrong. He thought I wanted to limit the \npayments to $1 million, say. He said that $1 million does not go as far \nas it used to go. This was shocking. People wrote in to the papers, and \nthey had no idea that farmers were receiving subsidies, farm payments--\nthese very programs\n\n[[Page S12403]]\n\nwe are discussing--to the tune of, say, an average of $500,000 or \n$600,000 a year in our State. We do not have farms that are that large. \nThis particular farmer was identified as having only 12,000 acres, \ndwarfed by many farms farther to the west of us.\n  So this started an interesting debate. The Indianapolis Star has \nwritten very strong editorials in favor of the comprehensive bill that \nI prepared for the Agriculture Committee debate. The other papers in \nIndiana have, by and large, chimed in. This is not a lonely quest. I \nthink I have the majority behind me. I certainly do of those who favor \nconservation and who are deeply interested in the environment and those \nresources, of people who are poor and want to make certain the Food \nStamp Program works at a time of recession and unemployment, of people \nwho are interested in research, not only at Purdue University but \nanywhere else where they know the cutting edge of agriculture is not \nmore payments to farmers but research that gives us some hope of \nfeeding the world as well as ourselves.\n  In the course of all of this discussion of who is getting subsidies, \nsome unusual figures have come up. If it is the will of the Senate that \nwe must discuss this for a long time, I will have a lot of those. It \nwill be exciting, I think, for friends and neighbors to know who is \nreceiving what. But let me just give you a capsule summary.\n  Eight percent of the farmers of this country identified as having \ncommercial farms--single digit 8--receive 47 percent of all the \npayments. It is a very concentrated sort of payment schedule. There is \nanother group known as intermediate farmers. These are farmers who have \nroughly 300 to 800 acres--a harder time on that amount of acreage. \nThese folks receive about 35 percent of the payments. So you add that \nto the 47 percent, and that takes care of over four-fifths of the \npayments. We have accounted for, say, only 20 percent of the farms in \nthis country.\n  I never heard one of these debates before without many Senators \nrising to address the Chair and pointing out that farmers in their \nStates are desperate, the weather has failed again, the floods, the \nrains, a lack of any trade initiative that seems to make any \ndifference, and rock-bottom prices, about the lowest that one has ever \nseen.\n\n  In due course, if necessary, I will cite chapter and verse from \nUSDA's very fine publication in which they explain why prices are low \nand why they remain low. I will explain why the bill that Senators may \nor may not wish to debate will drive them lower still. The bill the \nSenate will have passed will stomp down prices. They will have no hope \nof ever getting up. This may not concern Senators who will say, after \nall, the bill provides for fixed payments anyway. It does not matter \nhow low the price goes. That is irrelevant, although it is useful in a \ndebate to point out that agricultural policy has failed and prices go \nlow. Of course, they go low because the very policies give incentives, \nstrong incentives, to plant and produce more every year.\n  We have very efficient farmers in this country who produce, say, an \nincremental bushel of corn for much less than the loan rate of $1.89. I \npoint this out just for the sake of the debate. Every bushel of corn I \nproduce on my farm this year--and it would be true of anybody else--is \ngoing to get at least $1.89. That is not the market price. That is \nirrelevant to the argument except in terms of the Federal payments that \nhave to be made. The taxpayers pick up the difference between that \n$1.89 and wherever the market price went.\n  Yet these policies are going to drive the market price down further. \nThe taxpayer exposure is higher, thus the need for the additional $73.5 \nbillion for 10 years--a perpetual price crisis for agriculture without \nrelief predicted by the very definition of the bill.\n  Let me just point out that if, in fact, we were in an income crisis \nsituation, that might temper my remarks. But quite to the contrary, the \nSecretary of Agriculture pointed out for our last agriculture debate in \nAugust--and this is coming to pass--that net cash income to farmers \nthis year, 2001, will be $60.8 billion. That compares to $57.5 billion \nlast year, $55.7 the year before, $54.8 billion the year before that, \nand even in the record year of 1996, that the chairman has cited, net \ncash income of $57.6 billion, about $3 billion less than this year.\n  This is the all-time high. We never had such large net cash income as \nthis year. The skeptics will say: Aha, but $20 billion of that comes \nfrom Federal payments, not the market. You bet. Given the policies we \nhave that drive down prices every year, more loan deficiency payments \nare almost bound to come, plus the fact we took action, as the \nPresiding Officer will recall, in August to send another $5.5 billion \nas an emergency tranche, as we have the previous 3 years.\n  Some farmers will say we need to have certainty with this bill \nbecause each year the Senate votes for more money. Do you believe for a \nmoment, given the political competition in this body, there will not be \nsomebody on the floor of the Senate next June, July, August, suggesting \nwe have a crisis at hand and, by golly, we ought to send more money on \ntop of the fixed payments as we have done the previous 3 years? That is \nthe nature of the debate we are having today.\n  The fact is, farm income is at a record level. We have a situation in \nwhich we are at war, and we have need for money to pay for the war. We \nhave a recession in which we have deficits around us. A prudent person, \nseeing we have a farm bill on the books that is going to pay fixed \npayments plus loan deficiencies, would say: This is not the time for \nthe debate. That is what I say.\n  I hope Senators will not move to proceed to this bill and will not \nvote for cloture on the motion to proceed. I think it would be a \nmistake.\n  Having said that, if that mistake is made, let me mention to the \ndistinguished chairman that, indeed, we will try to remedy the bill in \na big way. I have a comprehensive commodity title, a lot to say about \nenhancing nutrition, a lot to say about conservation and research. \nFurthermore, finally, we will get to reform of the sugar program and \nreform of the peanut program and big reform of the dairy program. This \nbill has an egregious dairy section, and Senators are already quoted as \nbeing dismayed to proceed. It creates in a big way a consumer problem \nthroughout America. But this time something very sensitive, the price \nof milk, goes up for everybody. That really is unacceptable.\n\n  Other Senators may also have amendments. This is a list of those we \nalready prepared on the bill I gave to the Agriculture Committee. These \nare not figments of the imagination. The amendments are drafted and the \ntalking points are ready. I hope it will be an educational experience \nSenators will enjoy and, furthermore, that they will vote with me and \nreform this bill.\n  Let me conclude by saying I do hope we will get to the defense bill \nquickly. I take the time I have on the floor to say that I noted with \nsome concern--perhaps there will be an explanation for this--in the \nrelease coming from the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, a note \nthat it provides $357 million for former Soviet Union threat reduction, \nthe Nunn-Lugar program, a cut of $46 million from the budget request.\n  I find that to be inexplicable. At a time in which our President and \nPresident Putin are talking about reduction of nuclear weapons, in \nwhich the fundamental thrust of the war is to keep weapons and \nmaterials of mass destruction from terrorist cells, I am dismayed. I \nwant to get to that debate. I think that is serious with regard to the \nworld, with regard to our security. That is a real issue.\n  In due course, we will discuss the subsidies. Senators will have \nparochial interests, I understand that. But I hope we can hold it to a \ndull roar. I hope there will be some proportion given the deficits of \nthe next 3 years, not a 10-year program but a 5-year program which the \nSenate did adopt but which we still have to work on in conference, if \nwe come to that point prematurely.\n  For all these reasons, I hope the Senate will vote no on cloture, \nthat we will get on to the serious business that really faces the \ncountry in its defense, and that other issues such as this we may be \nable to work out more amicably in the Agriculture Committee or \nelsewhere in the ensuing weeks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to congratulate the\n\n[[Page S12404]]\n\ndistinguished Senator from Indiana. It has been my privilege to serve \nwith him now going into my 18th year. I have always admired him. I have \nalways thought he was the one reasonable, sane leadership voice on \nagriculture in the Senate. I take a little bit of the time I have this \nmorning to say that.\n  I am not going to get into the merits or demerits of the American \nfarm program or this bill. I can sum up my own feelings by simply \nsaying that America's farm program would make an old commissar from the \nSoviet Union puke.\n  It is a program which is an embarrassment to logic and reason. It \nchronically encourages overproduction. It hurts the best farmers the \nmost. It has no socially redeeming value, and America would benefit \ngreatly if we could eliminate the great bulk of the farm program.\n  I would say, in sort of the ultimate insult to everything that many \nMembers of this body claim to believe in, we literally have a program \nin this bill that builds upon an idea where we drive up the price of \nmilk consumed by children, many of whom are from poor families, to pay \nmore subsidies to people in the dairy industry who on average have \nassets of over $800,000.\n  How that can be justified defies imagination. Yet we constantly are \nengaged in debating compacts which are really conspiracies against \ntrade. In this bill, we solve the problem by just giving a whole bunch \nof money to everybody.\n  I don't want to debate the demerits of the farm program or this bill. \nI want to make several points.\n  First of all, it is December. In the last 25 years, we have not often \nbeen in session on December 5. We have work to do on serious issues. We \nare at war with terrorism. We have an economy that desperately needs \nattention. We have a handful of appropriations bills that have to be \npassed. Senator Lugar raised the need to debate Defense appropriations. \nGod knows, while we are still feeling the shock of the last terrorist \nattack, knowing there may be another, that is the business of the \nSenate.\n\n  The economy is in a recession, or at least we have had a negative \nquarter of economic growth, and almost certainly we will have another \none. We ought to be debating a stimulus package. We have a very real \nproblem with terrorist acts and their impact on insurance. We ought to \nbe dealing with that issue.\n  Instead we are dealing with extraneous matters in what is a political \nagenda, sort of a political one-upmanship effort.\n  What are we doing talking about a farm bill that does not even expire \nfor a few more months? What is this about on December 5? Does anybody \nreally believe there is any possibility whatsoever, any chance that \nthis bill could be finished before we adjourn? Does anybody really \nbelieve that?\n  If we were mean spirited--and, of course, we are not--but if we were \nmean spirited, we would let you get on this bill and make you stay on \nit awhile. But nobody has any intention of staying on it.\n  This is all a political one-upmanship to try to bring up a bunch of \nextraneous issues that supposedly have some political saliency. My own \nview is we need to get on with the pressing business of the country. We \nare going to get paid every day next year. This bill doesn't expire for \na few more months. Let's set it aside, go to the Defense appropriations \nbill, finish these appropriations bills, and make a decision on if we \ncan pass a decent stimulus package. If we can, we should; if we can't, \nwe should forget about it.\n  Can we deal with terrorist threats and the insurance implications of \nthem? We ought to do those things and finish our business.\n  But why are we bringing up a farm bill which is way over budget, \nwhich I think the President will veto? There is only one reason. It is \npolitical. I don't think it makes any sense.\n  We have some people on our side of the aisle who want to bring this \nup because they want to offer amendments to it. We don't have anybody, \nas far as I know, on our side of the aisle who is for the bill as it is \nnow. The point is, we have all next year to offer amendments. I hope we \ncan deny cloture on bringing this bill up and get on with the business \nof the country.\n  I am not getting mail here--none of my colleagues are--so I have \nprobably 200,000 first class letters. And I will bet you not one of \nthem says: Stop what you are doing; stop fighting this war; stop \nworrying about the economy, and raise the price of milk. I don't think \nAmerica is concerned about the farm program right now. The current farm \nprogram is going to be in effect for a few more months. But they are \nconcerned about a lot of work we have not done.\n  This is a political stall, in my opinion. We ought to get on with the \nbusiness of the country.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, farmers would have been stunned to have \nheard the speech of the Senator from Texas, because in his world the \neconomics of what happens to farmers just doesn't matter. But to \nhundreds of thousands of farm families, the economic downturn started \nfor them 5 years ago. They have been in a constant recession. In some \ncases, they have been in a depression for 5 years.\n  The Senator from Texas says it doesn't matter, you don't need to do \nthe bill now because the farm bill does not run out for 9 months. That \nis really not the case. Effectively, this farm bill expired 4 years ago \nbecause that is when we started writing disaster assistance packages \nfor agriculture because prices were the lowest they had been in 50 \nyears. So, effectively, the farm bill that is the underlying law was \naltered 4 years ago and each and every year since because of the \ndisastrous conditions that exist for American farmers today.\n  When the Senator from Texas says this bill is over budget, that is \nfalse. This bill is not one penny over budget. If he really believes \nwhat he says, come out here and bring a budget point of order against \nthis bill and let's see the ruling that will flow from that. He won't \ndo it because the fact is that this bill is not over budget by one thin \ndime.\n  The reason we need to write a new farm bill, and do it now, is that \nAmerican agriculture is in deep crisis. This says it very well. On this \nchart is the crop farm index: Prices received and prices paid by \nfarmers from 1990 through 2002. The green line on the chart is the \nprices that farmers receive. The red line is what they pay to produce \nthose commodities. Just looking at it, one can see there was a rough \nbalance until the last farm bill was written. Then the commodity prices \nfarmers received collapsed. The prices they paid to produce those \ncommodities continued to increase--especially with the energy runup we \nexperienced earlier this year. The result is an enormous gap between \nthe prices that farmers are paid and what they pay to produce these \ncommodities.\n  Again, we have the lowest prices in real terms in 50 years. On top of \nthat, in the month of October, when the new price index came out, we \nsaw the biggest 1-month decline in the prices that farmers receive in \n91 years. The records have only been kept for 91 years. So what we have \nseen is the biggest monthly decline of the prices going to farmers in \nthe entire history of the commodity index.\n  The harsh reality is that American agriculture is in deep trouble. \nWhen I talked to the farm group leader and I asked him what would \nhappen if this farm bill did not pass with the additional resources \nthat have been provided for in the budget, he said it would be a race \nto the auctioneer. He was right because that is what we confront in \nrural America today.\n  One key reason for that is our major competitors, the Europeans, are \nsupporting their producers at levels much higher than ours. The most \nrecent numbers show this. This is the European Union and the amount of \nsupport they provide per acre to their producers: $313 an acre of \nsupport. We provide $38 an acre of support. In other words, they are \noutgunning us nearly 10 to 1 in support for their producers. It is no \nwonder American agriculture is in crisis. It is no wonder that if they \ndon't get a safety rope, if they don't get something to assist them \nthrough these difficult times, we will see literally tens of thousands \nof farm families forced off the land. That is the economic reality.\n\n  It doesn't stop there. When we look at the world agricultural export \nsubsidies, this is what we find. This bar\n\n[[Page S12405]]\n\nchart shows who accounts for world agricultural export subsidies. The \nblue part of this pie is Europe. They account for 84 percent of all the \nworld's agricultural export subsidies. This little piece of the pie, \nthis red chunk, is the United States, which is 3 percent. We are being \noutgunned here 28 to 1. The deck is stacked against our producers. The \nplaying field is not level.\n  It is no wonder, therefore, that our producers are in deep financial \ntrouble. They are saying to us: We need to know now what the rules are \ngoing to be before we plant the next crop. We need you to tell us of \nwhat the farm program is going to consist. That is why there is urgency \ntoday. It has nothing to do with political one-upsmanship, as claimed \nby the Senator from Texas. It has to do with urgent economic necessity.\n  The fact is, despite the budget increase, farm support funding is \nprojected to decline under this bill. You will hear a lot of talk on \nthe floor that there has been this big increase, there has been an \nincrease over the so-called baseline. That is the red line on this \nchart. The baseline is the funding that would flow from current farm \nlaw. You can see that this bill provides more funding than that \nbaseline. That is true. What is missing is not what Congress has been \nproviding to American farmers the last 4 years. It hasn't been the \nbaseline. No. We responded to the crisis by every year passing an \neconomic disaster package to help our producers. And this farm bill \nwill provide less assistance than farmers have been getting the last 4 \nyears. That is a fact.\n  Over the life of this bill, you can see--that is the green line--the \nsupport will be in decline. As I said, it is less support than farmers \nhave actually been getting in each of the last 4 years because of the \neconomic disaster packages Congress has passed in response to the \neconomic emergency that exists all across rural America.\n  When we look at the Senate bill versus the House bill on commodity \nprogram funding for the first 5 years of this bill, we see on this \nchart that the Senate bill is somewhat more than the House bill, about \n$2 billion more--$27.1 billion versus $25.1 billion. If we compare the \nSenate and House bill on conservation program funding, we see on this \nchart that the Senate bill is $8.4 billion versus $6.8 billion in the \nHouse bill. So there is more for conservation, which I think the \noverwhelming majority of the American people support.\n  On this chart, on nutrition programs, over the 10-year life of the \nlegislation, again, the Senate bill has somewhat more--$5.6 billion \nover 10 years versus $3.6 billion in the House bill--money for the \nbasic feeding programs of the Federal Government because we know in an \neconomic downturn more people need food assistance. America is a \ncompassionate nation and one that responds to the needs of its people.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to allow us to proceed to this bill so \nthe Senate can work its will on farm policy, so we have a chance for \npeople to vote. There will be amendments, no doubt, to improve this \nbill. We will have a chance to fix the dairy policy that the Senator \nfrom Texas criticized. I don't think any of us wants the results he \ndescribed. We are going to have a chance to fix that, and negotiations \nare underway to fix that, and it will be fixed. But it won't happen \nunless we get to the bill. It won't happen unless we have a chance to \ndebate, discuss, and amend. That is what the cloture motion is all \nabout--to give the Senate a chance to act. Rural America needs it. Our \nfarmers need it. They are in a desperate struggle for economic \nsurvival. They are up against the European Union, our major \ncompetitors, who are spending $90 billion a year to support their \nproducers--far more than the United States. It is no wonder we are in \neconomic trouble. I urge our colleagues to vote to proceed to this \nbill.\n  I recognize the chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, who has \ndone an absolutely superb job in getting this bill to the floor. There \nis no more difficult challenge than writing a farm bill. The Senator \nfrom Iowa has done a brilliant job. Let me also recognize the ranking \nmember who, while we disagree on farm policy, is one of the most \nthoughtful Members of this body and somebody we all respect.\n  My hat is off to the chairman of this committee for what is I think \none of the most productive performances of any member this year in \ngetting this bill to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes and 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota for \nhis kind words, and I respond in kind by thanking our distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee for being not only a valuable member \nof the Agriculture Committee, but for his leadership. The Budget \nCommittee allotted us $73.5 billion. I also thank him for continuing to \npoint out the dire state of agriculture today.\n  When I first spoke, I pointed out that if you discount the added \nmoney the Congress is providing every year for agriculture, our net \nincome right now to farmers is 54 percent of what it was in 1996.\n  The leader of the Budget Committee has continually brought to our \nattention that we have to make sure we get this bill done this year to \nprovide for the farm economy of this country the amount of money that \nwas allocated to us because our farmers and our rural communities need \nthat money.\n  Rural America is in trouble. Thank God we have good advocates such as \nSenator Conrad from North Dakota who fights for rural America, who \nunderstands we do not have as many people in rural America as in the \nbig cities in California, New York, and other States. The work people \ndo in rural America is what keeps this country going. We cannot afford \nany longer to have them on that downward track that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota pointed out on his chart.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for being a great leader on our \nBudget Committee and for providing these funds and making sure we meet \nour obligations. I thank him very much.\n  I yield whatever time he may need to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I need only a few minutes. I am in the \nmood for thanking all three Senators. I, too, thank Senator Conrad. \nEvery time I talk to agriculture people in northwest Minnesota, I talk \nabout Senator Conrad's work and the fact we need to pass this bill now. \nWe have the budget money. It is critically important.\n  Frankly, time is not neutral. As I have said before, I have seen more \nbroken dreams, broken lives, and broken families in rural America than \nI ever wanted to. This is for real. I thank the Senator from North \nDakota very much for his work.\n  I say to my colleague from Iowa, it is a modern miracle this bill \ncame out of committee with strong support. The Senator from Iowa had to \ndeal with a lot of different perspectives.\n  I forget the figures, but we received an announcement the other day \nthat net farm income will be a couple billion dollars a year, a little \nover $3 billion a year if we pass this bill. I saw it somewhere. That \nis what it is about: Trying to get farmers leverage to get a price but \nfocus on the environmental credits and CRP and focus on the energy \nsection.\n  People are so excited about renewable energy, economic development, \nand nutrition. I thank both Senator Lugar and Senator Harkin for their \nleadership. Senator Lugar has done a great job of being so outspoken \nand so tenacious about the importance of nutrition programs. This has \nmade a safety net for many vulnerable families in this country and many \nchildren. This bill has the right balance. We have been doing an awful \nlot of negotiation on dairy, and I believe we are getting there.\n  If part of the importance of legislating is to bring people together, \nI think the Chair of this committee, Senator Harkin, has done a \nmasterful job. I cannot say I agree with every provision in this bill.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have to say to my friend from Minnesota, I do not agree \nperhaps with every provision in this bill either. This is a balanced \nbill. We have to balance a lot of different interests in this bill.\n  I thank my friend from Minnesota for his service on the Agriculture \nCommittee. Minnesota is very lucky to\n\n[[Page S12406]]\n\nhave both Senators on the Agriculture Committee. We appreciate that.\n  I point out to my friend from Minnesota, the factory study showed \nthere would be an increased average of $3.2 billion annually.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is what I was saying. That is net.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Net farm income.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is important. I certainly hope Senators will vote \nto proceed to this bill. We need to move on and get this work done. I \nthank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I understand I have 15 seconds remaining. I \nwill be brief.\n  As Senators prepare for this vote, they must know that if they vote \nfor cloture, we are stuck; we are on agriculture and that will continue \nindefinitely unless there is unanimous consent to leave it. I ask my \ncolleagues to vote against cloture. The vote on this is no.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we should vote for cloture. Let us get on \nwith the farm bill. Let us have the amendments. Let us have time \nagreements. Let us move on. Let us send a signal to rural America that \nwe are going to be there for them in their hour of need. I ask Senators \nto vote for cloture.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the \npending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 237, S. 1731, the farm bill:\n         Tom Harkin, Tim Johnson, Bill Nelson, Harry Reid, Byron \n           Dorgan, Fritz Hollings, Richard J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that the debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 1731, an act to strengthen the safety net for \nagricultural producers, to enhance resource conservation for rural \ndevelopment, provide for farm credit, agricultural research, nutrition, \nand related programs, to ensure consumers abundant food and fiber, and \nfor other purposes, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are \nrequired under the rule. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. \nLieberman) is absent attending a funeral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 73, nays 26, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 352 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--73\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--26\n\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bunning\n     Chafee\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nickles\n     Smith (NH)\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Lieberman\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote the ayes are 73, the nays are 26. \nThree-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in the \naffirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I appreciate the overwhelming support \nthat we had from the Senate for moving to the Agriculture bill. \nHowever, with the rules that we are operating under, that was just a \nvote on cloture on the motion to proceed. Now I understand that we have \n30 hours, under the rules of the Senate, before we have a vote on the \nmotion to proceed.\n  With that overwhelming vote on cloture, I hope we might collapse that \n30 hours. There is no need for that 30 hours. We might as well have the \nvote on the motion to proceed and get to the bill and let's start \nhaving amendments and move this bill expeditiously. I see no reason we \nhave to have 30 hours of debate right now. We ought to move to the bill \nand let's have the amendments.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his quorum call \nrequest?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I withhold it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                          TERRORISM INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I would like, while we have a \nlull on the farm bill, to take this opportunity to speak on a subject \nthat is very near and dear to my heart: What we are going to be doing \nas a nation to address the fact that, as a result of terrorist acts, \nthere may be a lack of terrorism insurance on January 1. That is not \nonly for commercial lines of insurance, which would be businesses such \nas shopping centers and office buildings, but it could also affect \nhomeowners and automobile owners. Since September 11, businesses and \nconsumers have suffered great economic losses, and we are reading about \nthose repercussions every day. So I would like to address this very \nsensitive topic as we come into the closing days of this session.\n  The insurance industry is now saying the clock is running out for \nthose businesses that want terrorism insurance because 70 percent of \nreinsurance policies--that is, insurance on insurance, or, in industry \nterminology, reinsurance--70 percent of those reinsurance policies \nexpire after December 31, and many insurance companies are threatening \nto cancel policies or to exclude terrorism coverage.\n  We simply can't let that happen. Congress must act to make sure that \ninsurance is available and affordable. It is the responsible thing to \ndo. The problem is that there are so many different ideas on how to do \nit.\n  I served for six years as Florida's elected Insurance Commissioner \nand State Treasurer. During that time, we experienced a major \ncatastrophe--Hurricane Andrew. This natural disaster, with insurance \nlosses totaling $16 billion, proved to be the most costliest in the \nhistory of this country. The private market was so paralyzed from this \nevent that nurturing it back to life proved extremely daunting. \nInsurance companies were not offering new home owners policies; to the \ncontrary, they were trying to flee the State of Florida and were \ncancelling policies for those who remained in the State of Florida. \nFortunately, by establishing a private pooling mechanism, and carefully \nmonitoring rate increases, we were able to reinvigorate and stabilize \nthe market. Accordingly, in the waning days of this session, I would \nlike to offer some of my experience as guidance as we proceed.\n  Let me give you an example of what is happening just to set the stage \nas to how serious this is right now.\n  The ISO, the Insurance Services Organization, which files policy \nprovisions for many insurers, has announced that it is asking for \nterrorism exclusions in insurance policies across the nation.\n  That should be the first warning sign. But there are other warning \nsigns.\n  For example, I will read from the Chicago Tribune of October 28. \nListen to this:\n\n\n[[Page S12407]]\n\n\n       The world's leading insurers, led by Lloyd's of London, a \n     collective name of 108 insurance-writing syndicates, said \n     this month that commercial property premiums would rise by \n     more than 80 percent.\n\n  That is the Chicago Tribune.\n  Then listen to a report that was sent out by Lloyd's of London. I \nquote from the investor newsletter of Lloyd's of London,\n\n       Members of Lloyd's of London:\n       Names may now have a historic opportunity for property \n     underwriting following the sharp rise in premiums in the \n     aftermath of the American catastrophe.\n\n  That newsletter added that premiums were at ``a level where very \nlarge profits are possible.''\n  If there is any doubt about some of the shock to the system right now \nbecause of what is happening with rate increases, let me point out that \nthe Wall Street Journal reported that insurance companies are already \nraising premiums by 100 percent or more on some lines of commercial \ninsurance coverage.\n  These accounts were presented by the Consumer Federation of America's \ninsurance expert, Bob Hunter, at a press conference earlier today.\n  Bob Hunter also talked about a big reinsurance company, one of the \ngiants in Germany, named Alliance. Alliance has announced increases of \n20 to 50 percent, and in some cases increases may reach 200 percent.\n  Another example hits close to home for all of our Senators in the \nNortheast corridor:\n  It is reported that the cost of insuring Giants Stadium in New \nJersey's Meadow Lands for terrorism is now being increased from \n$700,000 to $3.5 million.\n  That is a fivefold increase. That is a 500-percent increase.\n  If that were not enough, the CEO of Zurich Financial Services, which \nis another one of the major giants from Europe which does business \nthrough subsidiaries here in the United States, told a gathering of \ninsurers, on November 27, with respect to the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11:\n\n       The industry needed it to operate efficiently. The players \n     who are strong in a responsible manner and are aggressive \n     will be the winners of the next 15 years.\n\n  What we saw in Florida with insurance rate increases after Hurricane \nAndrew seems to be occurring again this time on a national scale with \nhuge increases in commercial insurance rates.\n  That is why we must act.\n  I understand that there are all kinds barriers to progress on this \nissue--people are trying to rewrite the tort laws of this country and \nthus you have a fight that has gone on almost as long as the Republic \non this issue. If this continues, it is possible that we will not be \nable to pass anything in the next week. I am trying to understand what \nwould be the consequence. Will the market respond? But I don't think \nthat is the responsible thing. I think the responsible thing for us to \ndo is enact a piece of legislation and get it signed into law.\n  But I want to say to my colleagues that from all of my experience \nwith insurance, as we deal with terrorism insurance we must be ever-\nmindful of consumer safeguards:\n  Therefore, any bill that we would enact must have three fundamental \nprotections for the consumer.\n  I think the bill has to have three protections for consumers: No. 1, \ncommercial insurers must offer coverage for the risk of terrorism on \nall policies.\n  In other words, an insurance company could not clearly say they will \ncover your little two-story office building but not cover your 20-story \noffice building. They cannot cherry-pick. There has to be mandatory \ncoverage for all on terrorism risk. No. 2, the insurance company cannot \ncancel the terrorism insurance unless it is in the normal course of \nbusiness, such as somebody did not pay their premiums. And No. 3, \nbecause we not only have to make terrorism insurance available, we have \nto make it affordable.\n\n  Commercial consumers cannot afford these kinds of price increases. \nThey cannot afford a 500-percent increase. They cannot afford a 200-\npercent increase. They cannot afford what Lloyds of London was saying \nwas an 80-percent increase, particularly not if the legislation we pass \nhere is going to have the Federal Government picking up most of the \nterrorism risk.\n  So I clearly advise all my colleagues in the Senate, the third \nprotection is that there has to be a reasonable amount of rate \nincrease, and what it can be has to be limited. I have suggested it be \nin the range of about 3 percent, which would produce an additional $6 \nbillion of premium, and that the $6 billion of premium associated with \nthe terrorism risk not being mixed with all the other premiums like on \nfire and theft. Our legislation should require insurers to specify the \nprice for terrorism coverage as a separate line item on the policy.\n  If we do not carefully monitor proposed rate increases, the insurance \ncompanies are going to file whatever they want in an increase with 50 \nState insurance departments. Then those insurance commissioners, who \nare trying to do a good job, are going to put their actuaries to work \nto see if this is a reasonable filing.\n  How do they determine if it is reasonable and not excessive and \nnondiscriminatory, which is usually the statutory standard for \nreviewing a rate increase? They have to have data and they have to have \nexperience. We do not have any of that in our 50 State insurance \ndepartments. Thus, what will happen is, whatever the rate hike is that \nis filed, the insurance departments of the 50 States will not be able \nto say that it is excessive, and they will not be able to prevail in a \ncourt of law or in an administrative court of law. As a result, the \npractical effect will be that the insurance rate hike that is filed \nwill, in fact, be in effect. And it would be 2 or 3 years before you \ncould ever start to overturn it.\n  What is worse, there are 10 States whose law says that an insurance \ncompany cannot file a rate until it is approved by the insurance \ncommissioner. The legislation that is being contemplated to be passed \nin this body would say, this Federal legislation will supersede the \nState law, so that, in effect, the rate hike takes effect immediately \neven though the State law says, in those 10 States, that the insurance \ncommissioner has to approve it first.\n  That is a pretty high-stakes ball game. We simply cannot afford for \nthis to go on. So what I am going to continue to urge, as I have \nprivately--this is my first public statement on this, save for an \ninterview I had last week with the Washington Post and save for the \ntestimony I gave to the Banking Committee and as a member of the \nCommerce Committee when I had the opportunity to express my thoughts \nthere--but so much more is known now as to see what is starting to \nhappen in these last few days of this session. This is what we are \nconfronting.\n  Simply, if we do not watch it, we are going to allow to pass through \nthis Chamber, and be accepted by the House, a piece of legislation \nthat, in order to take care of the problem of the lack of terrorism \ninsurance, will then allow the rates to go sky-high, rates, I submit \nrespectfully to all of my colleagues, that will not be able to be \naffordable, particularly by homeowners and by automobile owners.\n\n  Even though the bills being contemplated say this is primarily for \ncommercial insurance, they also say, at the option of the insurance \ncompany, for personal lines of insurance, such as for automobiles and \nhomes, they can opt into it. What homeowners' insurance company, if it \nhas homes, for example, in the neighborhood of a nuclear power plant, \nis not going to opt in to this kind of protection?\n  So what I am saying is, you better watch out. We are about to vote \nfor something that is about to mandate huge rate hikes. The Senate and \nthe House of Representatives do not normally handle this stuff because \never since the 1940s in the McCarren-Ferguson Act, we transferred that \nability to regulate insurance to the 50 States. Thus, we are not \nfamiliar with the facts of rate-making and the experience and data as \nto what is excessive in rate increases. We had better watch it.\n  From the insurance companies' standpoint, let me tell you, I do think \nthey need protection. They cannot simply be asked to accept the \nterrorism risk. There is not an insurance company in the world that \nwants to accept that risk. So in this Senator's personal opinion, I \nbelieve there is a role for the Federal Government as a backstop for \nthe insurance industry accepting this huge potential risk.\n  If we are fortunate, if our intelligence apparatus is working, then \nwe\n\n[[Page S12408]]\n\nwill be fortunate not to have other significant terrorism losses. But \nthere is that uncertainty on the basis of what we experienced on \nSeptember the 11th, what we experienced back in the early 1990s when \nthey tried to blow up the World Trade Center, what we have seen with \nregard to the Timothy McVeighs of the world and the Oklahoma Federal \nbuilding, and so forth.\n  So there is that element of terrorist risk where I do believe \ninsurance companies need to be partnered with the Federal Government in \nhelping assume that risk.\n  We better watch out about the potential price hikes. We know the \nproperty and casualty insurers are going to be paying about $50 billion \nin claims from September 11. That is a huge payout. But let's remember \nthat the companies are going to recover a lot of those insurance losses \nthey have paid out in tax breaks where they can carry forward those \nlosses and offset them against gains.\n  Remember, this is an insurance industry. This is an industry that has \nbeen very fortunate to be financially flush with cash. In the property \nand casualty field, there is a surplus to the tune of in excess of $300 \nbillion. In the reinsurance world of just those companies that \nreinsure, there is a surplus in the range of $125 billion. Their \nproblem is not a lack of cash; it is the uncertainty of the quantifying \nand the pricing and the spreading of the risk of future terrorist \nattacks.\n  In time, I believe, just as we have seen in Florida in the aftermath \nof that catastrophic hurricane that disrupted the entire homeowners \nmarketplace, you will see the marketplace--along with the strengthened \nsecurity that we are now imposing, fortunately, in this Nation, and our \nwar against terrorism--I think in time that will solve the problem. In \nthe interim, we are going to have legislation in the next few days in \nfront of this body.\n\n  Remember the three items we ought to look for, for the protection of \nthe consumer: No. 1, that there be mandatory coverage for terrorism, \nthat they can't red-line and say, I will select your skyscraper but not \nyour skyscraper; No. 2, that they cannot willy-nilly just cancel the \nterrorism coverage; and No. 3, that there be a reasonable amount of \nrate increases proportionate to the risk the insurance industry is \npicking up, given the fact that the Federal Government will be picking \nup most of the risk, and not let this be an excuse for rate hikes that \nultimately will affect the economic engine of this country. If \ninsurance becomes unaffordable, the economic engine of this country \ncannot operate because of the need to have the protection against these \nacts of terror.\n  I am grateful for the time to speak on a subject that is very \nimportant to this country. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF EUGENE SCALIA\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to express my very strong \nsupport for the embattled nomination of Eugene Scalia to be Solicitor \nof Labor. I am extremely frustrated, as many of us are on this side, by \nthe other side's unwillingness to bring this nomination to the floor \nfor a vote.\n  Mr. Scalia has been cleared by the HELP Committee and is now \nlanguishing in limbo with the session fast drawing to a conclusion and \nthe window for acting starting to close. There are no good reasons for \nholding up this nomination, for refusing to bring it to the floor.\n  May I be permitted to state the obvious? The debate is not about \nEugene Scalia's qualifications, experience, intelligence, dedication, \ncompassion, or any other attribute we would normally consider to \ndetermine if a candidate should be confirmed. He meets everyone's \ndefinition of what this position requires. Even those who have opposed \nhis nomination are quick to admit he possesses the skills and the \nexperience that Solicitors of Labor typically have.\n  It seems to me the only basis on which Mr. Scalia is being blocked is \nthat those on the other side did not agree with the results of last \nyear's election on two levels and with some of the actions this Senate \nhas already taken. First they do not like the fact that George Bush \nemerged as the new President, and some are trying to do anything in \ntheir power to frustrate and impede his administration from pursuing \nits agenda.\n  Secondly, because Mr. Scalia's father is one of the Justices of the \nSupreme Court who was in the majority decision which found for George \nBush in Florida, they are using their disagreement with Justice Scalia \nas a reason to block the confirmation of his son.\n  Both of these reasons are shameful, and they should have no place in \nthis consideration.\n  The opponents of Mr. Scalia have raised other arguments which are \nequally without merit and specious. One of these is that Mr. Scalia is \nnot qualified for this role because the Solicitor of Labor must serve \nas the people's lawyer and take up the cause of those whom the labor \nlaws and regulations are intended to protect and, because Mr. Scalia \nhas represented employers, he is on the wrong side of the equation. \nThat argument fails on a number of grounds.\n  First, the Solicitor of Labor answers to the Secretary of Labor. The \nSolicitor's role is to advise the Secretary about the arguments \nsurrounding the Department's actions and her decisions. This is the \nrole this position has played regardless of the administration or party \nin power. While it is an important position, it is not at all the \npolicy-oriented position that Mr. Scalia's opponents make it out to be. \nThe notion that the Solicitor of Labor is the people's lawyer is a \nstraw man argument invented for the sole reason of creating a fictional \nstandard that Mr. Scalia's opponents think he fails to meet because he \nhas spent his career representing employers in labor issues.\n  The second reason this argument fails is that it does not recognize \nthe substance of Mr. Scalia's work. Even under this fictional standard, \nMr. Scalia would qualify. A large part of Mr. Scalia's career in labor \nlaw has been spent advising his clients, the employers, on how to \ncomply with the law and steering them away from mistreating their \nemployees under the law. In other words, his career has been focused on \nhelping employers treat their employees better in accordance with the \nlaws passed by this body. Thus, he has indeed taken up the cause of \nthose whom the labor laws are intended to protect.\n\n  Another unsupportable argument against Mr. Scalia has to do with his \ninvolvement in the OSHA ergonomics regulation debacle. I know something \nabout that matter. We in the Small Business Committee spent a good deal \nof time working on that issue. Mr. Scalia represented employers on this \nissue and thus was on the side that ultimately prevailed when both \nHouses of Congress, by bipartisan margins, invalidated that regulation \nlast March. May I remind fellow Senators that the vote was 56 to 44, \nwith every single Republican and 6 Democrats supporting the resolution \nof disapproval. Why should this be held against him, when he agreed \nwith the position we took by a 56-to-44 vote margin? This was a \nresounding victory, perhaps one of the biggest for those of us on this \nside of the aisle on the labor issue.\n  The fact that Mr. Scalia was right in his arguments should be to his \ncredit. It should be an indication that he understands what the limits \nof government are, what the limits on government should be, and if the \nDepartment goes too far, it should be reined in.\n  I don't need to go through the long list of reasons we won that vote. \nIt should be clear that we would not have won with such an impressive \nmargin if that rule had not been so horribly flawed. Are we willing to \nsay that because the Clinton administration OSHA put an egregiously \nflawed regulation forward, we are not going to confirm Eugene Scalia to \nbe Solicitor of Labor because he agreed with the majority in both \nHouses and the President that it should be repealed?\n  While all these arguments and discussions about Mr. Scalia's merits \nunequivocably support confirming him, they obscure one of the hidden \ntruths about him. He genuinely cares for the people whom he represents \nand will approach the position of Solicitor of Labor ever mindful of \nthose who rely on the Department of Labor for protection.\n\n[[Page S12409]]\n\n  Since his confirmation hearing and the subsequent vote approving him \nin committee, we have received a letter from a woman whose case he took \npro bono--at no charge--which illustrates this point and conclusively \ndemonstrates the caliber of person Eugene Scalia is. It is a short \nletter. I will read excerpts from it, and then ask unanimous consent \nthat the full text be printed in the Record.\n  The letter is from Ms. Cecilia Madan. It begins: I am a deaf, \nHispanic immigrant and a single mother, working full-time to support my \ndaughter. And I have information about Eugene Scalia's handling of a \nlabor employment matter involving me.\n  She describes how, in 1998, her work environment became increasingly \nhostile, abusive, and difficult for her to bear. In seeking legal \nassistance, she learned she could file an action under civil rights \nlaws, the Americans with Disabilities Act, or the DC Human Rights Act. \nBut every lawyer she consulted told her that even if they were willing \nto take the case on a contingent fee basis, she would have to pay a \nsubstantial retainer upfront. She simply did not have it. She could \nonly afford their consultation fees.\n  Then she writes:\n\n       Then a friend of mine recommended that I try the ``pro-\n     bono'' program at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, and Mr. Scalia in \n     particular. My brother called for me, to see if I could have \n     an appointment. I was so worried that Mr. Scalia might be too \n     busy and turn me away (after all, I had never heard of him \n     before)! But he agreed to an appointment immediately. At our \n     meeting, Mr. Scalia was so kind, and thoughtful, and patient; \n     he even asked to see a picture of my daughter! I fear I must \n     have rambled a great deal when I told my story, but he didn't \n     seem to mind at all. Our meeting lasted a long time, but he \n     didn't ask for a consultation fee or a retainer, and he told \n     me that he and his law firm would take my case ``pro bono.'' \n     He said that he didn't think a lawsuit (which could take a \n     long time) would be necessary, because often these matters \n     could be resolved through ``firm negotiations,'' which he was \n     fully willing to undertake for me. He made every effort to \n     reassure me, saying that he and his associate would do \n     everything they could to ``resolve this.'' He seemed to sense \n     my extreme anxiety and tried his best to calm my fears. I was \n     able to walk away with confidence and hope.\n       The negotiations went on for several weeks, but they were \n     tremendously successful--much more than I had even hoped for. \n     ``Firm negotiations'' is right: The employer agreed to just \n     about everything I had asked for, and ``my lawyers(!)'' got \n     the employer to agree to things I hadn't even thought to ask \n     for!\n       Not only did he and his associate negotiate around the \n     employment problems I was facing right then, they took great \n     care to look ahead and watch out for my future interests.\n       A few months later, when I was able to get a new job, with \n     a different employer (as a result of the settlement Mr. \n     Scalia got for me), I was impressed to receive brief word \n     from him saying that he had heard of my new job and hoped \n     that my daughter and I were well. . . .''\n\n  She concludes her letter this way:\n\n       Throughout my ordeal, Mr. Scalia went out of his way to \n     help. He seemed especially . . . concerned about not making \n     things worse for me on the job, while he was vigorously \n     defending my rights with my employer. Even though he had \n     never seen me before and even though I could never pay him, \n     simple justice is what he wanted for this employee and worked \n     hard to get, and that is what he got for me. I am so grateful \n     to him for his efforts as my lawyer. . . .\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 9, 2001.\n     [Re nomination of Mr. Eugene Scalia to be Solicitor of \n         Labor.]\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am a deaf, Hispanic immigrant and a \n     single mother, working full-time to support my young \n     daughter, and I have information (which I hope will be \n     helpful in considering Mr. Eugene Scalia's nomination to be \n     Solicitor of Labor) about his handling of a labor/employment \n     matter involving me.\n       I began full-time work in 1991 for a local employer. By \n     1998, the work environment there had become increasingly \n     hostile towards me, abusive, and difficult for me to bear, \n     and I was terrified that I would lose my job. In desperation \n     (I was heavily in debt and living from paycheck to paycheck, \n     just to make ends meet), I went to several labor-lawyers in \n     the area, who advised that me I could file lawsuits under the \n     1964 Civil Rights Act, the D.C. Human Rights Act, and the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act, based on the facts of my \n     employment situation, on the grounds of my ethnicity/race, my \n     sex, my hearing disability, a medically-diagnosed chronic \n     condition I was suffering from and under treatment for at the \n     time, and my marital/family status. Unfortunately, all of \n     these lawyers--even those who said that they could take the \n     case on a contingency-fee basis-- insisted on my paying them \n     a substantial retainer up front, and I had no money to pay \n     them any more than their consultation fees.\n       Then a friend of mine recommended that I try the ``pro-\n     bono'' program at Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, and Mr. Scalia in \n     particular. My brother called for me, to see if I could have \n     an appointment. I was so worried that Mr. Scalia might be too \n     busy and turn me away (after all, I had never heard of him \n     before)!

Not only did he and his associate negotiate around the \n     employment problems that I was facing right then, they took \n     great care to look ahead and watch out for my future \n     interests.\n       A few months later, when I was able to get a new job, with \n     a different employer (as a result of the settlement Mr. \n     Scalia got for me), I was impressed to receive brief word \n     from him saying that he had heard of my new job and hoped \n     that my daughter and I were well. We sure are . . . thanks in \n     such great part to him!\n       Throughout my ordeal, Mr. Scalia went out of his way to \n     help. He seemed especially to be concerned about not making \n     things worse for me on the job, while he was vigorously \n     defending my rights with my employer.

And I \n     hope you soon will give other people in the workforce the \n     opportunity to have him as their lawyer, as Solicitor of \n     Labor.\n       Please let me know if you need more information or if I may \n     help Mr. Scalia's nomination in any way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Cecilia Madan.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I think this simple letter speaks volumes about Mr. Scalia \nand the type of person and the type of lawyer he is. It is a clear \nstatement of the values he upholds and the positive impact he believes \nhe can have as a lawyer. This is the person President Bush has chosen \nto be his Solicitor of Labor. I truly and honestly believe the \nPresident could not have found a better candidate, or one who is better \nqualified, better trained, and better motivated. I am thrilled that Mr. \nScalia is willing to accept the responsibilities of public service, and \nI implore the majority leader to bring this nomination to the floor for \na vote before we adjourn.\n  Every shameful day he remains unconfirmed is another day the \nSecretary of Labor and America's employees do not benefit from his \nabilities and compassion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, as we are in preparation for a debate on \nfarm legislation, I want to call to the attention of the Senate a very \nuseful and, in fact, remarkable publication called ``Food and \nAgricultural Policy, Taking Stock for the New Century,'' published by \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture this summer to state the views of \nthe Department, and to offer data for Senators and members of the \npublic as we began the farm debate.\n  I want to quote extensively from chapter 3, entitled ``Farm Sector \nPolicy'' because I believe it gives a very\n\n[[Page S12410]]\n\ngood outline of USDA's opinions on farm policy as it has progressed in \nour country, and as we hope it may progress through constructive debate \non this bill.\n  Mr. President, the chapter begins by saying that:\n\n       If farmers and farm families all across the country share \n     the same goals and face the same challenges and \n     opportunities, fashioning farm policy today would be \n     straightforward. And, indeed, that is the way it must have \n     seemed in the 1930s, when farm families depended mainly on \n     farm earnings and grew crops and livestock on much the same \n     acreage as their neighbors. Then, policy had a more focused \n     objective--helping to reduce the wide income disparity \n     between farm families and their urban counterparts--and a \n     ``one-size-fits-all'' approach was more appropriate. \n     Supporting field crop prices provided widespread assistance, \n     since most farmers grew some field crops, and helped \n     stabilize the entire sector. The farm sector and all of \n     agriculture are vastly different today, as is much of rural \n     America. Yet our farm policy retains vestiges of the New Deal \n     programs and reflects a time of greater homogeneity across \n     American farms and farm households.\n\n  Today, the farm sector is diverse beyond the imagination of those who \nframed the New Deal legislation. On average, farm family incomes no \nlonger lag, but rather surpass those of other U.S. households.\n  That, I found, Mr. President, to be a remarkable statement, \ncounterintui- tive to much of the debate we have on the subject. I will \nmention again:\n\n       On average, farm family incomes no longer lag, but rather \n     surpass those of U.S. households. Most farms are run by \n     people whose principal occupation is not farming. Markets \n     have changed, too. Domestic demand alone is no longer \n     sufficient to absorb what American farmers can produce. \n     Demand by well-fed Americans grows slowly, with population \n     growth. The promise of new, much-faster growing markets lies \n     overseas, in countries where economic prosperity is emerging \n     for larger numbers of people.\n       As a result, the United States must consider its farm \n     policy in an international setting, helping farmers stay \n     competitive while pressing for unfettered access to global \n     markets. At the same time, Americans' expectations with \n     respect to food have moved well beyond assurance of adequate \n     quantities to include quality, safety, convenience, and many \n     more attributes. And expectations now extend to environmental \n     preservation and enhancement.\n       More than seven decades of farm policy have provided a \n     rich, full experience upon which to draw as we contemplate \n     appropriate 21st century policies for our industry. The view \n     of policies and programs across their history has proved very \n     instructive, providing invaluable lessons which, at very \n     minimum, can help us avoid the obvious mistakes of the past. \n     History shows us that growth in farm household income was \n     largely due to rapid improvements in productivity, supported \n     by a strong research base, along with better opportunities to \n     market products, including export markets and off-farm \n     employment opportunities.\n       Many of the program approaches since the 1930s proved not \n     to work well, or not at all, produced unexpected and unwanted \n     consequences, became far costlier than expected, and have \n     been continually modified over time in the long succession of \n     farm laws. Some major and still highly relevant lessons \n     learned include: History has shown that supporting prices is \n     self-defeating. Supporting prices is self defeating. \n     Government attempts to hold prices above those determined by \n     commercial markets have simply made matters worse time after \n     time. Artificially higher prices encourage even more unneeded \n     output from the most efficient producers. At the same time, \n     they discourage utilization, consequently pushing surpluses \n     higher and prices lower. Costs to taxpayers grew until the \n     point was reached where something had to be done. All too \n     often, that turned out to be finding ways to restrict output.\n\n  The second lesson, Mr. President, of the USDA book is supply controls \nproved unworkable, too.\n\n       These usually involved restricting the amount of land \n     farmed in attempts to reduce output. But the remaining land \n     was farmed more intensively, and supply rarely was cut enough \n     to boost prices to politically satisfactory levels. The \n     programs were costly to taxpayers and consumers and the \n     unused resources were a drag on overall economic performance. \n     But, perhaps the most important of all, limiting our acreage \n     was a signal to our competitors in other countries to expand \n     theirs, and we lost market share that is always difficult to \n     recapture.\n\n  The third lesson of the farm bill is stock holding and reserve plans \ndistort markets enormously.\n\n       Isolating commodity stocks from the market when supplies \n     are abundant is attractive for its short-term price stimulus. \n     But, because such stocks eventually must be returned to the \n     market, they limit the recovery of prices in the future. \n     Moreover, time after time, stocks have proved costly to \n     maintain, distorted normal marketing patterns, ceded \n     advantage to competitors, and prove tempting targets for \n     political tampering.\n\n  The fourth lesson is:\n\n       Program benefits invariably prove to be disparate, \n     providing unintended (and unwanted) consequences. The rapidly \n     changing farm sector structure produced a wide array of farm \n     sizes and efficiencies. Many farms were low cost and the \n     programs were of enormous benefit, enabling them to expand \n     their operations. Others did not receive enough benefits to \n     remain viable and thus were absorbed along the way. That \n     situation still maintains to some extent today, even though \n     we now have fewer farms.\n       The clarity of these lessons provided several emphatic \n     turning points in national policy. The 1985 farm law proved \n     to be one such point when, after long debate on fundamental \n     philosophy, a more market-oriented approach was adopted. That \n     market orientation was extended in the 1990 farm law, making \n     a less intrusive and expensive role for government in farmer \n     decisionmaking and in the operation of the markets.\n       The Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act of \n     1996--\n\n  A law that currently we have in place--\n\n     proved to be historic in that it removed much of the decades-\n     old program structure, provided unparalleled farmer \n     decisionmaking, flexibility through ``decoupled'' benefits, \n     and set a new example throughout the world for providing \n     domestic farm sector support.\n       While that approach is arguably still the least distorting \n     of markets and resource use, its direct payments--\n\n  These are the so-called AMTA payments, Mr. President--\n\n     do share some unintended effects with price support programs, \n     namely the artificial inflation of farmland prices. The \n     effect clearly has been exacerbated by the size of payments \n     in recent years, some $28 billion in the last 4 years above \n     the amount provided in the 1996 law.\n       While the rise in land prices creates wealth for some, it \n     works to the disadvantage of others. Direct government \n     transfers distort real estate markets, keeping land prices \n     artificially high when commodity prices are low, as we are \n     seeing today. Higher land prices for consecutive years of \n     large program support make it more difficult for beginning \n     farmers by increasing capital requirements. This inflation \n     also makes it more costly for existing farms to expand to \n     achieve size economies, either by purchasing or renting \n     additional acres (since land rents move in tandem with \n     prices). Higher land values do benefit local tax authorities \n     and the collateral base of farm lenders, but add directly to \n     production expenses through higher interest and rental costs. \n     Since the land charge is such an important component of a \n     farmers' total cost, sustained increases in land prices and \n     rents have a decidedly adverse effect on the competitiveness \n     of our farmers in the marketplace compared with those in \n     other exporting countries, a cause of growing concern in \n     recent years.\n\n  To come to the nub of the problem, the farm sector chapter says:\n\n       Squaring Today's Realities With Policies. Because of their \n     historical evolution, current program benefits still are \n     largely directed to specific commodity producers, resulting \n     in only 40 percent of farms being recipients.\n\n  That is a remarkable figure. After all is said and done and the \npayments are made, only 40 percent of farmers receive anything; 60 \npercent receive nothing, a fairly large majority.\n\n       And, there still is no direct relationship between \n     receiving benefits and the financial status of the farm. The \n     most financially disadvantaged segment of farmers today is \n     the low-income, low-wealth group.\n\n  And this is defined in appendix 1 of this book. Essentially, the book \npoints out that there are commercial farms, intermediate farms, rural \nresidence farms, and then they are distributed by size and income.\n  In any event, the most low-income, low-wealth group comprises 6 \npercent of farms, had an average household income of $9,500, and \nreceived less than 1 percent of the direct payments in 1999.\n\n       In contrast, 47 percent of payments went to large \n     commercial farms, which contributed nearly half of program \n     commodity production and had household incomes of $135,000.\n\n  These are families, obviously, that are middle class, upper middle \nclass, and they received half of the payments.\n\n       Our current broad-scale, commodity-oriented approach to \n     farm support does not recognize existing wide differences in \n     production costs, marketing approaches, or overall management \n     capabilities that delineate competitive and noncompetitive \n     operations. It thus is impossible to provide enough income \n     support for intermediate farms without overly stimulating \n     production by the lower cost, large-scale commercial \n     producers. Even though many intermediate farms and rural \n     residence farms receive some program benefits, only one in \n     four generated enough revenue to cover economic costs. Even \n     more problematic is the inability of these farms to improve \n     their cost efficiency at the same\n\n[[Page S12411]]\n\n     pace as larger commercial operations, whose investment in new \n     technologies and ability to expand are aided by program \n     benefits.\n       Another unintended consequence of current programs stems \n     from the increasing disconnect between land ownership and \n     farm operation. While program benefits were intended to help \n     farm operators, most support eventually accrues mainly to \n     landowners in the shortrun through rising rental rates and, \n     in the longer term, through capitalization and to land \n     values.\n       Land prices in recent years have been relatively robust, \n     especially in areas producing program commodities, despite \n     concerns about low commodity prices and the future direction \n     of farm programs.\n       For many farm operators, renting land is a key strategy to \n     expand the size of business in order to capture the size \n     economics, as evidenced by the fact that 42 percent of \n     farmers rented land in 1999.\n       Clearly, operators farming mostly rented acreage may \n     receive little benefit from the program. The impact of income \n     from any source, including program benefits on land values, \n     depends on whether that income is viewed as permanent or \n     transitory. The degree of certainty that the income will \n     continue in the future and even though production flexibility \n     contract payments were intended as transitory when authorized \n     by the 1996 farm bill, subsequent emergency assistance and a \n     70-year history of Government involvement in agriculture have \n     reaffirmed expectation that support will continue in the \n     future.\n\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in both the bills offered by the House of \nRepresentatives and by the Agriculture Committee of the Senate, the so-\ncalled AMTA payments continue throughout the entirety of the bills.\n  There was no expectation that they would be phased out as in the 1996 \nfarm bill, no anticipation that they would be transitory. As a matter \nof fact, in both bills they are larger, and therefore the impact, which \nhas been found in the chapter I am reading, the difficulty for farming, \nis likely to be exacerbated. The 1996 FAIR Act also continued the \nmarketing loan program, another evolution of the old price support \nidea, but importantly modified to avoid government stockholding which \nproved so burdensome in times past.\n  Marketing loan payments effectively provide a large countercyclical \ncomponent to farm income but distort markets by limiting the production \nresponse to falling market prices. The program guarantees a price for \ntraditional program commodities: Food grains, feed grains, cotton, and \noil seeds. As market prices have fallen below this guaranteed price, \ntotal marketing loan benefits have risen less than $200 million in the \n1997 crop to $8 billion for the 1999 and $7.3 billion to date for the \n2000 year crops.\n  Since 1996, countercyclical marketing loan benefits have totaled \nabout $20 billion. While the current policy made large strides toward \ngreater market orientation, a careful evaluation in the context of \ntoday's diverse farm structure and increasingly consumer-driven \nmarketplace still reveals several misalignments among policy goals, \nprogram mechanisms, and outcome. Improvement could support more \nsustainable prosperity for farmers, agriculture, and rural communities \nwithout engendering long-term dependence on direct government support.\n  I will translate that in many ways to the debate we are now having. \nEssentially, the bill that is before the Senate as reported by the \nAgriculture Committee attempts not only to continue fixed payments for \n10 years without accuracy, thus implying a perpetual agricultural \ncrisis the last farm bill in 1996 had in mind, that essentially we \nwould move toward more of a market economy and transition payments \nwould go to certain farmers who have been in the business.\n  This has led to substantial debate in the last 5 years because \nessentially, as many have said, there are landowners receiving payments \nwho are no longer farming at all. They literally are not in the \nbusiness. The contract we made with farmers in the 1996 farm bill was \nthat if one had a history of planting corn or wheat or cotton or rice--\nand eventually soybeans have entered in through a marketing loan \nsituation--they receive money on the basis of that history. Thus a part \nof the distortion that the USDA now points out: The payments are \nheavily loaded toward people who own land, but 42 percent of those who \nare actually in the fields this year rent land. They do not own it. \nTheir rents are higher. As a result, their net income is lower.\n  The policy we have adopted essentially of the fixed payments plus the \nother aspects, the marketing loans, the other countercyclical \nsituation, increase essentially the land values. If someone is a \nlandholder, that is helpful. As the USDA publication points out, if one \nis a mortgage banker holding a note, the value of that land increasing \nis useful. But for young farmers coming into the business, this is \npotentially disastrous. There is very little entry. For those renting, \n42 percent, certainly they have higher costs year by year.\n  Furthermore, as the USDA publication points out, all of this is \noccurring to the benefit of only 40 percent of farmers to begin with. \nThe other three-fifths are out of the picture.\n  One of the interesting facets of farm debates is many farmers must \nsurely believe they are benefiting from this. It is apparent that, \nreally, for time immemorial, a minority of farmers have received any \nbenefit. A substantial majority are not touched by this, certainly in \nterms of their income.\n\n  In addition, the farm policies, whatever their intent, have \nstimulated overproduction. As USDA points out, essentially the most \nefficient farmers, using the very best of research, using the best of \nmachinery and equipment and seed, are able to produce a bushel of corn \nor a bushel of wheat for substantially less than their domestic \ncompetitors, fortunately for much less than almost all of their foreign \ncompetitors. Therein lies the advantage of the United States in terms \nof exports.\n  The problem comes, to take a very specific example of corn, as I \nmentioned earlier in the afternoon, the loan deficiency payment for a \nbushel of corn in Indiana and in many other locations is $1.89. That \nfigure was meant to be a floor. It was anticipated the price of corn \nwould be more than $1.89 and seldom would it reach $1.89, but in the \nevent that it did, a farmer could be certain of receiving $1.89 \nregardless of what the market price might be. The taxpayers generally \npicked up the difference between the market price and the loan \ndeficiency payment level, the loan rate at $1.89.\n  But what if corn farmers who were very efficient find that they can \nproduce additional bushels for much less than $1.89 per bushel? The \nincentive obviously is to produce as much as possible because $1.89 is \nguaranteed for every bushel, and if one is producing for less than \nthat, it is a profit on every single additional bushel. That does not \nescape the attention of many of our most efficient farmers, and they \nhave increased their production. By and large, they have grown. Other \ncompetitors have not grown and, as the USDA points out, in many cases \nhave either sold their properties or rented them to others who are able \nto obtain better results, I suspect.\n  This has led to a certain amount of decline in the number of farmers \nin the country. But as many farm statisticians have pointed out, in \nrecent years the numbers of farms have grown in various sectors of our \nsociety, in large part because many Americans who are professionals in \nthe city, or who simply wanted a rural life-style, purchased small \nfarms or at least some acreage. They qualify under USDA standards as a \nfarm situation if they have $1,000 of sales. That is the cutoff point. \nMany do have $1,000, and many maybe have $10,000 worth of sales, but \nincreasingly large numbers, hundreds of thousands of persons, have \nqualified as operating farms on that basis.\n  Seventy years ago, no one would have considered attempting to think \nthrough a farm bill that would be of assistance to all of these \nadditional farmers. But as USDA points out, a majority of persons now \nobtain more of their income from something other than farming, even as \nthey are classified as one of the 2.1 million farm situations in our \ncountry.\n  I mention that simply because in rhetoric in this debate, or at other \ntimes, about farm bills, a great deal is said about the plight of the \nsmall family farmer and saving that person. In fact, I would contend \nmost of our farm bills have done a pretty good job of that. There \nliterally is a pretty broad safety net but only if you are in certain \ntypes of farming; namely, the row crops--corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, \nand rice. For instance, if you are a livestock farmer--hogs, cattle, \nsheep--these programs do not pertain to you at all.\n\n  Increasingly in our farm debates, we have been hearing Senators \ndescribe\n\n[[Page S12412]]\n\nstrawberries, cherries, peaches, nuts, and cranberries. These are \nsometimes known as niche crops, specialty crops, but clearly are not \ncrops contemplated by farm bills. No money in these farm bills goes for \nthese crops. That has not been very satisfying to most Senators who \ncome from States with these constituents.\n  The situation now with the specialty crops is, Senators come to the \nfloor and ask quite candidly: What is in this farm bill for us? We \nunderstand from the New Deal days onward, people in cotton, rice, corn, \nand wheat were taken care of; a safety net was there for them. But no \none thought about us in those days. We are thinking about ``us'' now.\n  As a result, the Senate fields annually a large number of disaster \nbills. Somewhere in the United States of America, the weather is not \ngood for whoever is doing whatever they are doing. They point out that \nalthough corn growers or cotton growers are having their problems, the \nstrawberry growers and others are also having a very tough time in \nother areas. Or the cranberry situation is a disaster.\n  As a result, the plea comes for disaster assistance payments to these \nfarmers. The USDA, as a rule, has not been geared up to make these \npayments because there is no particular crop history or there is not a \ntradition of making the payments. As a result, the payments don't occur \nfor a while because USDA must establish regulations as to who is \neligible, how to verify this, and how to audit these situations. \nNevertheless, as we have had the disaster bills or supplemental bills, \neach summer more and more Senators are finding the focus of these \ndisaster bills is not very wide. This is also the case with the farm \nbill. The 40 percent who get the money are not 100 percent; the \nSenators who represent the other 60 percent say: What about us?\n  We have had hearings before the Agriculture Committee, and there are \ndebates among people in the so-called specialty crops--fruits and \nvegetable and so forth. Some say: Leave us alone. You have pretty well \nmangled other markets. Supply and demand still pertains in what we are \ndoing without government supports, without subsidies. As a result, \nthere is risk but there is also reward. The market works for us. Don't \ngum it up.\n  On the other hand, many well-meaning Senators trying to help \nconstituents are not prepared to take that for an answer. They visit \nwith many farmers who have had genuine disasters caused by the weather \nor other problems, and they want relief for these constituents. Again \nand again, the disaster bills try to address all of these localized \nproblems.\n  The so-called stimulus package offered to the Senate--which we are \nnot considering for a variety of reasons, and which I gather is now \ngrist for the mill, with the overall group discussing this in a \nbicameral way--had about $6 billion worth of agricultural provisions in \nit. Many of them duplicate items in the farm bill we are now \nconsidering. Perhaps Senators were nervous that the farm bill would \nnever get to them, and the urgency, at least as they saw it, was that \nthe money in the stimulus package might be spent sooner. Perhaps so.\n  We found these same ideas popping up in the debate we had in August, \nwhen the Senate sent $5.5 billion to farmers in the country, mostly to \nrow crop producers, but with a debate on specialty crops and other \nthings that ought to be covered to address their particular problems.\n  This simply reinforces what USDA has started in chapter 3 of its \nrecent policy book; namely, one size doesn't fit all. As a matter of \nfact, the number of farming operations in terms of size, scope, \naltogether the things they are doing, is so diverse, it is very \ndifficult for any farm bill to encompass a majority, or even a small \nminority of operations, for that matter.\n  This is why, as we have this debate on the farm bill, I look forward \nto the opportunity to offer an amendment to the commodity section. I \ntried to look realistically as to what is occurring on American farms \ntoday. I am saying that in Federal policy, strawberries and cattle \nshould be treated no differently than wheat.\n  In essence, we should take a look at the whole farm income. Each \nfarmer must file with the Internal Revenue Service the proper returns \nthat indicate all income generated on the farm. For many farms that are \nfairly diversified, that have income from cattle, from hogs, perhaps \nsome from timber, perhaps some corn and soybeans, sometimes some wheat. \nIn the South, more likely it is from cotton or rice, along with the \nlivestock. In essence, we are saying, income earned from all \nagricultural production should be treated equally in federal farm \npolicy.\n  Take the example of a farmer who receives $100,000 a year in \nagricultural sales from all sources. Under the bill I presented to the \nAgriculture Committee, that farmer would declare that income, and he \nwould receive a $6,000 credit from the Federal Government (or 6 percent \nof that $100,000) to be utilized in one of three ways. The $6,000 could \nbe used to purchase whole farm revenue insurance, guaranteeing 80 \npercent of the 5-year income to that farm; in other words, a genuine \nsafety net created on the basis of the history of that operation. If \nthe farmer has had $100,000 of income 5 years in a row, obviously, the \naverage is $100,000, and the farmer would receive a $6,000 government \ncredit. This would buy an 80 percent whole farm revenue insurance \npolicy, which means that in a case of a disaster or a downturn of \nincome, that farmer is guaranteed at least $80,000 of income. That \npremium would be paid for by the $6,000.\n  Say the farmer has some money left over. He could utilize that then \nfor a so-called farm savings account. A farmer puts the money from the \nFederal Government into this account and he matches it with an \nequivalent amount. At that point, that account remains for a rainy day \npurpose--once again, to stabilize farm income and to offer a genuine \nsafety net. Or the farmer may use more sophisticated means of risk \nmanagement. He also has the option to use the $6,000 to purchase other \nrisk management or marketing tools that are of equivalent value.\n  In essence, we recognize all of agriculture, all of America, all the \ndiverse ways in which people make money. We offer a genuine market-\noriented program through a variety of risk management options \n(including whole farm revenue insurance) so that essentially no farmer \ncould do worse than 80 percent of his annual income in any kind of \ndisastrous year. We encourage savings accounts with a matching \nGovernment contribution, to increase the farmer's financial reserves \nand enhance the financial viability of the family farm. This has the \nvirtue of being relatively inexpensive. That particular virtue has \nescaped the debate thus far altogether, in large part because Senators \nhave competed with each other to provide more subsidies for more \nconstituents. I understand that urge. But I have also suggested that \nthis debate is occurring at a time in which it is prophesied by the \nOffice of Management and Budget that we will have 3 years of Federal \ndeficits.\n\n  One can say, after all, if we are doing deficit spending into \ndeficits for all sorts of other things, the farmers ought to have their \nshare of the deficit spending, too. But that is not the way this debate \nbegan. It began with the thought that we were going to have a $300 \ntrillion surplus for the coming year and, for that matter, for most of \nthe years in the coming decade. I have argued earlier on that the \noutlays, in my judgment, lead to overproduction and lower prices, \ndistorted land values, and make it tougher for young farmers, tenent \nfarmers, and farmers that rent land.\n  But leaving aside that argument, I make the argument now that we do \nnot have the money. We have not had the money for some time. It is \nobvious to everybody who has common sense outside the agricultural \ndebate. But sometime it will dawn upon most Americans, and they will \nwonder what we are doing here.\n  Senators who rush back to their constituents and say, ``I got $173.5 \nbillion in farm subsidies for you,'' may find some skeptics who will \nsay, ``Where was the money? Where did you find the money?''\n  The Senator may say, after all, the farmers deserve the same benefits \nas everybody else. There was not any money, but there will be someday. \nSurely, this thing will turn around. Maybe so, maybe not. My \nconstituents in Indiana are wondering about this.\n\n[[Page S12413]]\n\n  Two percent of us, and I include myself among this group in Indiana, \nactually are in the farming business. That is a declining number. But \n98 percent are not. Maybe those of us who are in the 2 percent count \nupon the 98 percent never looking into this picture and wondering how \nin the world it is all formulated and why we are receiving money. But \nmore and more of the 98 percent are looking into it.\n  What is occurring is not a mystery to editorial writers in Indiana. \nThey write about it all the time. So do people in the Associated Press. \nSo do people who are local reporters. They are reporting how much money \nfarmers are receiving in Indiana, county by county, by dollar.\n  This comes as a revolutionary surprise. Many farmers are able to \nexplain--I try to do so, too--that these payments come because we have \na farm program which was supposed to be a transition program. We were \ngoing to move from heavy subsidies to the market in a 7-year period of \ntime in the last farm bill. These were transition payments. Other \npayments come, likewise, because of the loan deficiency payment \nbusiness that I just explained. There is a floor price, really, for \nevery bushel of corn, every bushel of soybeans.\n  Some payments come because of conservation and cooperation by farmers \nto do things that are very helpful as stewards of land and water. So \nthere are good reasons for some of these payments. Most constituents \nunderstand that.\n  But they do find it difficult to understand why persons on Indiana \nfarms that appear to be very prosperous receive hundreds of thousands \nof dollars from the Federal Government. They are wondering, have we \nmissed something here? Was it the argument about the devastation of \nrural America, the loss of income of people, the loss of farms, young \nfarmers coming in, and so on? And they wonder how are any of these \npersons helped in the process?\n  I am saying that these folks whom we intend to make beneficiaries are \nnot in fact helped and have not been for some time.\n  Let me conclude this explanation with some principle that I found to \nbe useful in an USDA publication, and I commend it to the attention of \nSenators because I think it offers a fairly good foundation for this \ndebate on farm policy. As the debate continues, I want to return to \nother aspects that I found especially illuminating in the same \npublication, but I offer this, at least as some basis for an amendment \nI intend to offer in due course in the commodity section, which I \nbelieve will be constructive, which will be more fair, and which will \nclearly be less expensive, and which has at least some semblance of \nreality, considering the times we are in, fighting a war and recession \nand attempting to do common sense things as Senators.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, be recognized immediately upon the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the farm bill as \nit is presented to this Senate, and specifically the dairy part of that \nbill. I rise with the knowledge that some negotiations are going on to \nsee if that particular dairy program cannot be improved, at least \nimproved from the position of California. The present bill, as drafted, \nbefore this body, is one, frankly, I cannot support. I cannot support \nit largely because of the dairy provisions.\n  I thought it might be helpful if I related my experiences. The \nproblem is that some States have many small farms, 60 to 80 cows, and \nother States have larger farms. That is where the subsidies intermesh \nto really create a very difficult playing field for California. \nEssentially the provisions in the agriculture bill that is on the floor \nnow would force consumers across the United States to pay $1.8 billion \nmore for milk each year. It would drive down essential income to dairy \nfarmers who produce the milk contained in most of our Nation's dairy \nproducts.\n  California is the largest dairy State in the Nation. Last year, dairy \nfarmers produced 32.2 billion pounds of milk. Over 19 percent plus of \nthe Nation's supply comes from California. The industry is a $4.3 \nbillion industry in the State, and dairy is the largest part--most \npeople do not know that--of what is a $30 billion agricultural \nindustry. We have 2,000 dairy farms in the State--2,100 to be exact. We \nlead the Nation in the total number of milk cows at 1.5 million. I \noften joke I wish they could vote. The California industry produces \n122,000 jobs and contributes $17.5 billion overall in the economy each \nyear.\n  These are full-time, year-round jobs in agricultural counties that \nmake up the heart of the great California central valley. Dairies \nprovide jobs for farmers who grow and ship feed, for farmhands who milk \nthe cows, for workers in the processing plants who make our famous \nCalifornia cheeses, and for packers, marketers, and many others. In \nfact, in the great San Joachin Valley, one in every five jobs is \ndependent on the dairy industry. If California were a separate nation--\nI think most people do not know this--it would rank eighth in the world \nin milk production, fifth in the world in cheese production, and ninth \nin the world in butter production.\n  I want to make it clear that we are talking about California more \nthan any other State when you talk dairy. So it is simply not possible \nto leave California out of any dairy equation.\n  I am aware that the dairy industry, particularly in the Northeast, \nneeds government help. I want to make it clear that I can't support \nthat help if it greatly disadvantages the dairy farmers in California.\n  I think the California Secretary of Agriculture put it best. I would \nlike to quote from a letter dated December 3:\n\n       Consumers will see higher prices for fluid milk. In the \n     Senate bill, it is 40 cents more a gallon for milk.\n       State law and economics dictate that California's dairy \n     prices must bear a reasonable relationship to milk prices in \n     neighboring regions.\n\n  California law, like it or not, ties us into any pooling agreement \nthat might be made.\n       As fluid milk prices in surrounding states rise, California \n     fluid milk prices would be increased in a corresponding \n     manner. Unfortunately, the higher milk prices will force some \n     consumers to switch to less expensive--and less nutritious--\n     non-dairy alternatives. Dairy processors would be negatively \n     impacted by this loss of fluid milk sales.\n       At the same time, California's dairy farmers will also lose \n     under the Senate plan. Increases in fluid milk prices will \n     undoubtedly lead to increased milk production. Once an area \n     covers its needs for fluid milk, the additional milk goes for \n     manufactured product such as cheese, milk powder, and butter. \n     California is the leading producer of both milk powder and \n     butter. California is the second largest producer of cheese, \n     and in fact only 19 percent of California's milk production \n     goes for fluid milk. By simultaneously stimulating production \n     while dampening demand, the Senate plan strikes at the heart \n     of California's dairy economy by severely depressing prices \n     for manufactured dairy products.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     California Department of Food\n\n\n                                                & Agriculture,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, December 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I recently wrote to you expressing \n     concern about the proposed changes to the federal dairy \n     system and its impact on California. While this proposal has \n     changed since that letter, its impact remains negative for \n     California's consumers and dairy producers.\n       The new plan, contained in S. 1731 as of this writing, \n     would apply to only the federal order program. However, it \n     would have enormous consequences to this state.\n       Consumers will see higher prices for fluid (drinking) milk. \n     State law and economics dictate, that California's dairy \n     prices must bear a reasonable relationship to milk prices in \n     neighboring regions. As fluid milk prices in surrounding \n     states rise, California fluid milk prices would be increased \n     in a corresponding manner. Unfortunately, the higher milk \n     prices will force some consumers to switch to less \n     expensive--and less nutritious--non-dairy alternatives. Dairy \n     processors would be negatively impacted by this loss of fluid \n     milk sales.\n       At the same time, California's dairy farmers will also lose \n     under the Senate plan. Increases in fluid milk prices will \n     undoubtedly lead to increased milk production. Once an area \n     covers its needs for fluid milk, the additional milk goes for \n     manufactured product such as cheese, milk powder, and butter. \n     California is the leading producer of both milk powder and \n     butter. California is the\n\n[[Page S12414]]\n\n     second largest producer of cheese, and in fact only 19 \n     percent of California's milk production goes for fluid milk. \n     By simultaneously stimulating production while dampening \n     demand, the Senate plan strikes at the heart of California's \n     dairy economy by severely depressing prices for manufactured \n     dairy products.\n       This is the case even though the Senate plan will primarily \n     increase production in other parts of the country. \n     Manufactured dairy products may be easily stored and \n     transported. Accordingly, the markets for these products are \n     nationwide so that even if increased production were limited \n     to other regions, California's prices for its manufactured \n     products will drop significantly.\n       The Alliance of Western Milk Producers estimate that over 9 \n     years the bill would have the impact of reducing California \n     dairy farmer's revenue by approximately $1.5 billion. At the \n     same time, California consumers would pay an additional $1.5 \n     billion in higher retail milk prices. The Alliance estimate \n     seems reasonable using the analysis completed earlier by the \n     University of Missouri's Food and Policy Research Institute. \n     Our economists concur with these estimates.\n       Without question, dairy policy offers some of the most \n     contentious issues in agriculture. The sole positive \n     attribute of the Senate plan is that it has united \n     California's dairy consumers, producers, and processors in \n     opposition to the proposal. Whatever it does for the rest of \n     the country, it is bad for our state.\n       I thank you and your staff for all of your efforts on \n     behalf of Californians. If I may be of any assistance to you \n     on this or any other matter, please do not hesitate to \n     contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                     William (Bill) J. Lyons, Jr.,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I said that California families under \nthe Senate bill will pay 40 cents more per gallon of milk. That is \naccording to the California Department of Food and Agriculture. That \nrepresents a net cost to the industry of $1.5 billion over the 9 years \nof this bill.\n  Do we really want to make it more expensive for parents to provide \ncalcium to their children? Do we want to deprive the elderly of \nnutrition that strengthens bones, fights cancers, stops osteoporosis? \nDo we want to make families cross milk off their grocery list because \nit costs too much? I don't think so.\n  For Californians, the legislation is a double-edged sword. Not only \nwill a mother in Los Angeles be paying more every week at the grocery \nstore, but a father who runs a dairy farm in Modesto will see his \nincome slashed, if this bill becomes law. For one co-op, this \nrepresents a loss of $71,000 per dairy farm.\n  The payment formula may be complicated and crafty, but the winners \nand losers are clear. California is targeted by this bill to be a \nloser.\n  Like other goods, a higher price established for fluid milk by law--\nnot the market--will cause families to buy less, as I said, and cause \nsuppliers to get an improper price signal to produce more. If there is \ntoo much drinking milk in the marketplace, it spills over to compete \nagainst milk used to produce cheese, butter, milk powder, and other \ndairy products.\n  Prices for milk are based on how the milk is used, which is referred \nto as ``ultimate utilization.'' Since over 80 percent of the milk in \nCalifornia is used to produce these dairy products, any excess milk \nwill drive down the prices received by California dairy producers. \nOther States with small dairies can take advantage of government \nsubsidies no matter what the milk goes for. But States such as \nCalifornia are excluded under their proposal because dairy farms have \nlarge herds. The average size of the 2,100 herds in California is 656 \ncows.\n  Again, this is an attempt to take money from California to give it to \nother States.\n  Dairy producers estimate they are going to lose $1.5 billion over the \nnext 9 years if the provisions in the Senate farm bill are enacted into \nlaw.\n  Let me read a couple of letters from California's dairyland.\n       Jim Tillison, Chief Operating Officer of The Alliance of \n     Western Milk Producers, writes that the dairy program in the \n     Farm Bill ``is bad for California's consumers and it is bad \n     for California's dairy farm families.'' He estimates, ``the \n     net loss of revenue from manufactured milk will decrease \n     California dairy farm family income by $1.5 billion over the \n     next 9 years.'' The Alliance of Western Milk Producers is a \n     trade association that represents California dairy \n     cooperatives. Together, Alliance member cooperatives market \n     approximately 50 percent of the milk produced in California \n     both as raw milk and as processed dairy products.\n\n  Rachel Kaldor, Executive Director of the Dairy Institute of \nCalifornia, a state trade association representing the manufacturers of \nover 70 percent of the fluid, frozen, and cultured dairy products in \nCalifornia, writes, ``any legislation which creates federal price \nfloors, production limits and income redistribution--national pooling--\nis bad news for California.''\n  In another letter, Gary Korsmeier, Chief Executive Officer of \nCalifornia Dairies Incorporated reports, ``the milk prices for \nCalifornia farm milk used in cheese, butter, nonfat milk powder and \nother dairy products, would drop by $2.9 billion dollars.'' Korsmeier \npredicts the average dairy farmer in the cooperative would lose $71,000 \nper year. California Dairies Incorporated is a member of the Alliance \nof Western Milk Producers. Formed from the merger last year of three \nCalifornia dairy cooperatives, California Dairies' 700 members account \nfor about 40 percent of California's milk production.\n  I could go on and on. I can talk about lower milk consumption, \nincreased milk production, and dramatically increased government \nexpenditures on the dairy program. I can talk about another layer of \nbureaucracy and exacerbation of regional disparities. I can talk about \nproviding another chance to pit big producers against small producers \nand reduction in the percentage of producer income that is derived from \nthe market. I can talk about contradicting congressional intent for the \ncurrent program, setting up regional supply management boards, and \nincreases in assessments on dairy producers.\n  The dairy program is a bad part of this farm bill.\n  I would like to read into the Record the agricultural groups that \noppose the dairy provisions currently in this bill: California Farm \nBureau Federation, Alliance of Western Milk Producers, Western United \nDairymen, California Dairies Incorporated, Milk Producers Council of \nCalifornia, Montana Dairy Association, Dairy Producers of New Mexico, \nIdaho Dairymen's Association, Oregon Dairy Farmers Association, Texas \nAssociation of Dairymen, Utah Dairymen's Association, and the \nWashington State Dairy Federation.\n  It is not only California, it is a number of Western States that \nwould be seriously impacted by the dairy provisions of this bill.\n  Let me say in conclusion that a national dairy policy that strikes at \nthe heart of California's dairy industry and other Western State dairy \nfarmers is not an option. I cannot support a farm bill that harms \nCalifornia. I hope the negotiations going on to try to come up with \nanother formula to meet this concern are successful.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the unanimous consent agreement to \nrecognize the Senator from North Dakota. But I also notice that he is \nnot present at this time. I ask that the unanimous consent agreement be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport for the consideration of the passage of a farm bill this year. \nWe have been discussing and debating and moving forward with a number \nof pieces of legislation, but, in my home State of Arkansas, there is \nno piece of legislation more important than the pending farm bill.\n  Two major issues that have been discussed are biosecurity and \neconomic stimulus. For my State, the farm bill addresses both of these \nissues. I urge my colleagues to move forward with this legislation \nexpeditiously.\n  I commend Chairman Harkin for holding a markup this year and not \nbowing to those voices that said we should delay this.\n  While I do not claim that the Harkin bill is my preference on a \nnumber of issues, I am pleased that the Agriculture Committee worked so \nhard and so diligently in getting a bill out of committee this year. I \nhope the full Senate will now act expeditiously.\n  For rural America and for most of Arkansas, an economic stimulus \npackage must be tied to agriculture. To talk about passing an economic \nstimulus package and not doing a farm bill, for the State of Arkansas \nsimply does not make sense. For Arkansas, the two complement one \nanother and are intricately related.\n\n[[Page S12415]]\n\n  The agriculture industry in Arkansas has been in distress over the \nlast few years due to a combination of high energy prices, low \ncommodity prices and difficulties in opening up foreign markets to \nAmerican goods.\n  Agriculture and agriculture-related activities account for a full 25 \npercent of my State's economy and provide $5 billion in farm income. It \nis Arkansas's single largest industry. Farming is, in many ways, the \nlifeblood of my State. It is imperative that a new farm bill be passed \nthis year, which is why many of us have worked so hard to push for the \ncompletion and passage of a farm bill while we are still in session \nthis year.\n  Fewer and fewer farmers in my State are able to continue farming due \nto, not a recession, but a depression that the agricultural sector has \nexperienced over the last few years. While the rest of the economy grew \nand benefitted during the late 1990s, agriculture was one of the very \nfew industries that actually suffered during this time.\n  Let me share with my colleagues just a few of the statistical facts \nregarding the farm economy in my State over the last few years. These \nare Arkansas-specific numbers from the USDA.\n  In 1996, the price for rice was $10.20 per hundredweight. For the \nyear 2000, that price was $5.70 per hundredweight. In 1996, for the \nentire rice crop production in Arkansas, the value was $733 million. In \nthe year 2000, the value of production had dropped to $490 million.\n  Next, let me share the statistics on cotton. In 1996, the price was \n71 cents a pound. In the year 2000, the price had dropped to 56 cents \nper pound. In 1996, the cotton crop value of production was $555 \nmillion. By the year 2000, that had dropped to $388 million.\n  In 1996, for wheat, the price was $4.38 per bushel, but, in the year \n2000, the price had dropped to $2.40 per bushel. In terms of the value \nof production, in 1996, the wheat crop was valued at $293 million; by \nthe year 2000, it had dropped by more than half to $142 million.\n  For soybeans, a major commodity crop in Arkansas, the price was $7.34 \nper bushel in 1996; in the year 2000, the price had dropped to $4.90 \nper bushel. In 1996, the value of production was $824 million; in the \nyear 2000, the value of production dropped to $407 million.\n\n  Overall, the net farm income for agricultural production in my State \nhas gone from about $2 billion in 1996 to just over $1.5 billion in the \nyear 2000. That is a decline of nearly half a billion dollars. In a \nsmall rural State such as Arkansas, that impact is devastating.\n  It is my sincere hope that we can get a farm bill into conference, \nget it passed, and signed by the President this year.\n  There are few issues that are followed as closely or scrutinized as \ncompletely as agriculture policy. The Agriculture Committee was given \nthe very great responsibility of creating a farm bill that will \ndetermine the direction of agriculture policy and the assistance \navailable for farmers and rural communities over the next 5 years.\n  In committee, there were a lot of compromises that were reached. In a \nbill of this scope, with the impact it will have on rural America, it \nis never possible to please everyone. The goal of this farm bill, from \nthe beginning, was to re-craft a failing policy and provide the \nassistance and certainty that our producers must have.\n  This policy is extremely important. In many cases, it will determine \nwhether or not farmers in the State of Arkansas will be able to plant \nnext year, and, in an even broader sense, it will determine if many of \nthe hard-working farm families in Arkansas will be able to continue to \nwork their land and make a living.\n  Over the past 4 years, rescuing the farm economy has cost over $30 \nbillion in emergency Federal farm aid. It is quite clear that our \ncurrent farm policy is not working. It has been an ad hoc policy. We \nhave been forced to address short-comings annually. The current policy \nhas been devoid of certainty--creating instability in the farm economy \nacross this country. It has resulted in farmers never really being sure \nof what Congress is going to do, and it has resulted in Congress having \nmake ad hoc emergency assistance as needed from year to year.\n  It is imperative that we end the annual struggle where Congress must \nfind money and make available large numbers of emergency funds to \nsupport our nation's farmers due to insufficient agricultural policies. \nWe must recognize the needs of our farmers and address them.\n  My views, and the views of a few other Members, were made quite clear \nwith the introduction of S. 1673. I still believe that the bipartisan \ncompromises we came to in that bill would provide the type of \nassistance our farmers need while providing a healthy framework for \nagriculture policy in the future.\n  This is indeed a unique time in our Nation's history. Now, more than \never, our country is looking to its leaders for guidance and support. \nOur national security has been tested, and our economy is in need of a \nstimulus. Throughout all of this is the need for strong, comprehensive \npolicies that reflect the needs and priorities of our country.\n  I do not need to tell this body that agriculture is one of these \npriorities and that a strong, responsible, and well-crafted farm bill \nwill ensure the assistance our farmers and rural communities need while \nproviding the stability and certainty they must have to continue over \nthe next 5 to 10 years.\n  While I have been pleased with the steady progress we have made with \nthe farm bill over the last few weeks, I urge my colleagues to push \nhard to complete the consideration of the bill so we can provide for \nthe needs of our nation's farmers.\n\n  Over the last few weeks there have been reports criticizing farm \npolicy and criticizing the various farm bills. Despite these reports, I \nwould argue that strong farm policies are absolutely essential to \nassure the safe, abundant, and affordable food supply we enjoy in this \ncountry. The farm policy of the past may not have been perfect, but it \nis that which has given the American people the safest, most abundant, \nand most affordable food supply in the world. Our farmers are, in fact, \nthe best in the world. This is a testament to their hard work and their \ncommitment to advancing agriculture. But their hard work must be joined \nby sound agriculture policy.\n  I realize the diversity of agriculture in different parts of this \ncountry. However, I also realize a farm bill is just that, it is a farm \nbill meant to reflect and address the needs of our agricultural \ncommunities. Numerous titles of this bill address key issues of rural \nAmerica, but if farmers are not farming, what will happen to those \ncommunities then? What will happen to the seed dealers, the bankers, \nthe car dealers, and a whole host of industries directly reliant upon \nthe farm economy?\n  As you are all aware, there are numerous proposals out there to \naddress the farm sector's needs. While I worry that the best possible \npolicy might not emerge, I do believe we will make improvements to our \ncurrent policy. I am firmly behind moving forward and completing a farm \nbill this year. It is a must for our farmers. I believe that, in the \nend, we will work to provide for the needs of our nation's producers.\n  In terms of trade, I agree with the Secretary of Agriculture, in her \ntestimony before the Agriculture Committee, that expanding trade is an \nessential part of agriculture policy. I believe that aggressive action \non this front will greatly benefit our producers and allow the United \nStates to fully participate in the proliferation of trade agreements \nthat are now emerging out of Latin America, Asia, and with our allies \nin the Middle East.\n  Agriculture trade can open up whole new markets and provide our \ncountry with new friends abroad who will be able to share in our wealth \nduring prosperous times and come to our aid in times of need or \ntragedy.\n  However, trade also requires compliance with international \nagreements. While I have been critical of some of the provisions in \npast trade agreements, and will likely have misgivings about some \nfuture agreements, I understand the importance of the United States \nkeeping its word.\n  As Senator Conrad has pointed out in committee and on the floor with \nnumerous charts, we don't support our producers at nearly as high a \nlevel as our European competitors. Our farmers are at a strategic and \ncompetitive disadvantage. The way to fix this problem is with green box \npayments. Senator Cochran and Senator Roberts are to be commended. They \nhave crafted a proposal in committee--and I assume will be offering it \non the floor as well--\n\n[[Page S12416]]\n\nproviding the support our farmers need while remaining true to our \nobligations abroad. While there may be other proposals that are WTO \ncompliant, few would provide the level and assurance of support that \nthe Cochran-Roberts proposal would.\n  The greatest fear of many farmers and their lenders in my State is \nreplicating a system where a farmer is not certain of the level of \nsupport they will receive from year to year. This has been the fatal \nflaw with our current policy. The rapid phase-out of the fixed, AMTA-\nstyle payments in the Senate version of the farm bill that came out of \ncommittee is very troubling. That style payment is one of the only true \ngreen box payments in the bill. If the WTO calls for lowering allowable \namber box payments, these payments may be the only money allowable for \nsafety net purposes.\n  While I support moving forward, I believe the assured levels of \nassistance in S. 1673, the House bill, and the Cochran-Roberts approach \nare, by far, more favorable than some of the other proposals \ncirculating that would diminish these payments.\n  In addition to trade, conservation is a key component of the farm \nbill, as it should be. Our farmers and ranchers are stewards of our \nnation's natural resources. It is important that incentives be \navailable that encourage and reward environmental stewardship. It is my \nbelief that this is an important component of farm policy, but it is a \ncomponent that must be balanced with other titles in the bill.\n  I strongly support the increased acreage for WRP in all of the \nproposals we have seen. CRP has also been an important program for \nArkansas. In addition, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program has also \nbeen successful in promoting the health of wildlife in Arkansas. These \nare all good programs.\n  While I support these programs, I believe a balance must be struck. I \nagree with many of my colleagues that this is done by strengthening \nprograms we know are successful, where we know our funding can be \nmaximized to the benefit of the environment and the agricultural \nsector.\n  As we have learned from the last few years, a farm bill must provide \na safety net for producers through a good commodity title. A sufficient \ncommodity title is absolutely essential in providing the support needed \nby our country's farmers. Without these programs, our farmers would be \nat an incredible competitive disadvantage with our European \ncounterparts. Many of our farmers would simply be put out of business.\n  The farm bill must reflect the needs of our country's producers. It \nmust also allow the Congress to avoid the costly ad hoc emergency \nspending that has characterized farm policy for a number of years.\n  Proper funding and allocation of these funds is essential in allowing \nour farmers to remain on their farms. Without farmers working the land, \nwithout the type of technical expertise present in our country's \nagricultural sector, we would not have the abundance of nutritious food \nwe enjoy in this land.\n  Our farmers are indeed the best in the world. They are early adopters \nof new technology and enhanced growing techniques that allow them to \nincrease production while reducing the environmental impact of \nagricultural activities. Much of these great strides forward have been \nthe direct result of this nation's commitment to its farmers.\n  This Nation has its roots in its fertile soil. It is important that \nwe remember that agriculture has been, and will continue to be, a \nsource of great strength and security for our country.\n  I conclude by emphasizing to my colleagues just how important the \nfarm bill this year is. It is an absolute must-have for our nation's \nfarmers and rural communities. I hope we will move forward quickly and \nresponsibly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, are we in the postcloture period for \ndebate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are now, as I understand it, in a 30-\nhour postcloture period following the cloture vote on whether we should \nproceed to consider the farm bill.\n  I don't quite understand this, frankly. We ought not to have had a \nvote on whether we should proceed to the farm bill. Of course, we \nshould proceed to the farm bill. Who on Earth thinks we should not \nproceed to write a farm bill.\n  The current farm bill is a miserable failure. Not many people in the \nSenate have farmed under that farm bill, as a matter of fact. Those who \nhave had to try to raise a family and operate a family farm under this \ncurrent farm bill, Freedom to Farm, understand it is a miserable \nfailure. The whole premise of the current farm bill was a failure.\n  The premise was, whatever happens in the marketplace, that is all \nfine and that is all farmers need to know. And if the marketplace \ncollapses and farmers don't have support for their products and they go \nbroke, God bless them; the country doesn't care. America will be farmed \nfrom California to Maine, and we will have giant agrifactories. We will \nstill get food on the grocery store counters. Under the philosophy of \nFreedom to Farm, family farmers are kind of like the little old diner \nleft behind when the interstate highway comes through--kind of nice to \ntalk about, nice to think about, nice to remember, but they are not \npart of today.\n  People who think that way couldn't be more wrong. The seed bed of \nfamily values in America has always come from family farms. It is the \nroad to small towns and big cities and has nurtured and refreshed this \ncountry in many ways. Family farming ought not be out of fashion. It \nought not be yesterday's policies. It ought to be what we aspire for \ntomorrow's food supply. Family farming ought to be an important part of \nthis country.\n  Why do we need some special help for farmers? Why do we have a farm \nbill? That is a good question. In fact, the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture was created in the 1860s by Abraham Lincoln with nine \nemployees. My feeling is we don't need a Department of Agriculture if \nthe sole purpose is not to foster a network of families that farm this \ncountry. If our goal is not to foster a network of family producers for \nAmerica's food supply, then I say put a padlock on USDA, turn the key, \nand get rid of it. We don't need it.\n  If the goal, however, is to foster a network of family food producers \nbecause we believe, both for social and economic purposes, it \nstrengthens and enhances this country, then let's write a farm bill \nthat does that. Let's write a farm bill that supports that. The current \none does not. We haven't had one that supports that for a long while.\n  It is interesting, I come from western North Dakota, a very sparsely \npopulated part of the country. We had a little dispute recently in \nwestern North Dakota with prairie dogs. I got right in the middle of \nthe dispute. I can't stay out of a dispute like that, I guess, much to \nmy detriment.\n  Here is the situation. It relates to what is happening in western \nNorth Dakota. We are in western North Dakota becoming a wilderness \narea. There is no Federal designation. We don't need one. We are fast \nlosing people. My home county was 5,000 people when I left it. It is \nnow 3,000 people. I left a small county in southwestern North Dakota. \nIt is actually pretty big in geographic size. I left to go off to \ncollege. It was 5,000 people; now it is 3,000 people.\n  The adjoining county just south of the badlands in western North \nDakota is Slope County, about the same size. Actually, it is almost as \nbig as one of the small eastern States. It has 900 people; seven babies \nwere born in that county last year. So I come from a part of the \ncountry that is losing population hand over fist. People are moving \nout, not in.\n  Family farmers and ranchers are not able to make a living so they \nleave. Their dreams are broken. All that they aspired to do to live on \nthe land and make a living with their family, all those dreams are \ngone.\n  Then this past spring, the U.S. Park Service, which is also in \nwestern North Dakota, had a problem. Out in the badlands of North \nDakota we had a little picnic area, and it belonged to the taxpayers \nand the Federal Government. It was our picnic area. The prairie dogs, \nfury little creatures, took over this picnic area. Prairie dogs are \nvery much like rats except they have a button nose and furry on the \ntail, and they multiply quickly.\n\n[[Page S12417]]\n\n  So the prairie dogs took over the picnic area. Our Federal Government \nsprang into action. They just sprang into action and did an \nenvironmental assessment--an ``EA,'' they called it. They did a finding \nof no significant impact--some sort of SNIFF; there are acronyms for \nthese major things they do. They jumped right into action. You know \nwhat the conclusion was? If the prairie dogs have taken over the picnic \narea, then move the picnic area. It is a quarter of a million dollars \nto move the picnic area.\n  That doesn't make much sense to me. I said: Why don't you move the \nprairie dogs? We are not short of prairie dogs, we are short of people \nin western North Dakota. We are not short of prairie dogs; move them.\n  They said: We can't do that.\n  I said: When I was a kid, 14 years old, the rats took over our barn \nand my dad asked if we could have a program to get rid of the rats. And \nmyself and two other 14-year-old boys very quickly pointed out to the \nrats that the dumping grounds for our town was about a mile away, and \nlo and behold we got rid of the rats.\n  I said: Hire three 14-year-old boys from western North Dakota to get \nrid of the prairie dogs, and it won't cost you very much. We will \nreclaim our picnic grounds.\n  I said: The point is, I am really interested that you are going \nthrough this machination with respect to prairie dogs and picnic areas, \nwhen I can't get anybody interested in the fact that our State in the \nwestern part and in most rural counties is systematically being \ndepopulated. Family farmers are going broke, ranchers are going broke, \npeople are moving out. We can't get anybody interested in what all that \nmeans and the consequences of it, but you have a few prairie dogs move \ninto a picnic area and, by God, the whole Government has studies going \non and they are going to spend money to move picnic grounds.\n  I said that is a strange set of priorities, in my judgment. I have \ngone off a bit, but in fact it is hard to get people interested in the \nreal issues. The real issues in western North Dakota are that family \nfarms are losing their shirts. Ranchers have had a big struggle there \nand people are moving and nobody seems to care much. But they care \nabout a few prairie dogs.\n  As an aside, I lost the issue. They moved the picnic grounds. Then, \nabout a month later, after all this big controversy, I read in the \nnewspaper that a guy from Oklahoma had invented a truck--he created a \ntruck with a hose on the truck that had a vacuum attached to the hose, \nand he would stick the hose in prairie dog holes and suck them out of \nthe holes. And it threw them into the back of this truck, which he had \npadded with mattresses so they didn't get hurt.\n  I said: That is an interesting approach--to suck the prairie dogs out \nof the holes and then throw them into this truck with mattresses and \nthey don't get hurt.\n  Then 2 weeks later, on the national news I saw that in Japan they \nwere selling prairie dogs for $250 apiece as pets. I am thinking to \nmyself that here is a solution to a problem. Hire that guy from \nOklahoma, suck those prairie dogs out of the holes, ship them to Japan, \nreduce our Federal trade deficit, save the taxpayers a quarter million \ndollars, and reclaim our picnic grounds. Of course, that was way too \nsimple for the Park Service.\n  I digress a bit only to say this: When you get a prairie dog problem, \nyou have the whole darn Government running to see what they can do \nabout it. But when you have a problem with family farmers making a \nliving, who invest all they have in the spring to plant a seed and get \non the tractor to plant that seed, and then they hope beyond hope that \nthe insects won't come, that it will rain enough--but not too much--so \nthey won't have crop disease, that they won't have hail, and that if \nthey are lucky, in the fall they will be able to get out there with a \ncombine and harvest the grain and put it in a 2-ton truck, only to find \nout when they drive that truck with a load of wheat to the elevator, \nthe elevator and grain trade will tell them: This food you produced \ndoesn't have any value. This food you produced on your farm doesn't \nhave value.\n\n  That family farmer on that farm scratches his head and says: What is \nthis about? Our food has no value?\n  We have a world in which a half billion people go to bed every night \nwith an ache in their belly because it hurts to be hungry, and we are \ntold the food we produce in abundance has no value. Are we not \nconnecting the dots somehow? Is something missing here? The farmer who \nis told his food has no value goes to the grocery store on the way home \nand picks up a box of puffed wheat, or puffed rice, or Rice Crispies, \nor shredded wheat. What they discover is that someone discovered that \ngrain had value. It wasn't the person who produced it, who risked their \nmoney to produce it. It was the person that puffed it, crisped it, \ncrackled it, popped it, put it in the box, and sells it for 100 times \nwhat family farmers are getting who took all the risks to produce it. \nThere is something fundamentally wrong there.\n  My point is this: We have struggled to write a farm policy that \nrecognizes the value and the worth of family farmers to this country. \nSome say: Why are farmers different? Why don't you recognize the value \nand the worth of the person on Main Street who runs the hardware store, \nor the barber shop, for that matter? Well, the family farm is the only \nenterprise in our country that has the risks I have just described--\nplanting a seed, borrowing all the money they can to plant the seed, \nand hope beyond hope that all the other circumstances that could \ncompletely wipe them out financially do not do that between when they \nplant the seed and when they harvest it; and then they go to the grain \nelevator with no understanding that their product is going to have any \nvalue at all. They are the only small enterprise that has all of those \nconcurrent risks at the same time.\n  The question for this country about its security and about the nature \nof its economy is: Do we want to maintain a network of family producers \nproducing our food or not? It is very simple. Europe has made that \ndecision. Long ago, Europe decided it wants family producers to be \nproducing food for Europe. Why? Because Europe has been hungry in its \npast and doesn't want to be hungry again. It believes food production \nby family units is a matter of national security for Europe. We ought \nto believe the same for the United States.\n  I grew up in a town of 300 people. When I was a boy, in my hometown, \nI would go on Saturday night to my hometown and it was full of cars. \nThe barber shop was open until midnight. The barber was cutting hair \nthere at all hours of the night on Saturday night. It was like a \nfestival on Saturday evening in my hometown. That is not the case \nanymore. Family after family after family have gone broke--forced to \nleave the family farm because they could not make a living raising \ntheir grain and the livestock and selling them at prices that the grain \ntrade and the exchanges provided.\n  Now, one might say that is just the way things are and there is \nreally nothing you can do about that. Europe didn't decide that. They \nsaid: We want to maintain a network of family producers for our \nnational security. We believe food security is critically important, \nand we want to maintain a network of family farm producers for that \npurpose. Go to Europe and to a small town in rural Europe on a Saturday \nnight and see what you find. You will find that those small towns are \nalive, as I described my small town was many decades ago. They are \nalive and thriving. Why? Because the blood vessels that create the \neconomy of a small town come from family farms to these small \ncommunities and nourish those small communities.\n\n  In many ways, this debate is about values. What kind of an economy do \nwe want? What do we cherish? What do we think is valuable about this \ncountry? It is always interesting to me that if you are big enough, \nstrong enough, powerful enough, have enough resources, and you come to \nthis Congress, I am telling you, people stand at attention and say, \nyes, sir; no, sir; what do you want, sir. I could give a lot of \nexamples of that.\n  Tom Paxton wrote a song a long time ago, many decades ago when the \nCongress gave Chrysler Motors a bailout. Mr. Paxton, a great folk \nartist, wrote, ``I Am Changing My Name to Chrysler.'' It is \ninteresting, even as we now are struggling to get through a motion to \nproceed on a postcloture, 30-hour\n\n[[Page S12418]]\n\ndiscussion, just to get to the farm bill to try to help those families \nout there, even as we do that, we have a package to try to stimulate \nthe economy that comes over from the House of Representatives that \nsays: Do you know how we do that? We give Ford a $1 billion rebate \ncheck for the alternative minimum taxes they paid in the last 13 years. \nWe give IBM a $1.4 billion tax rebate check for the last 13 years. \nMaybe Mr. Paxton should write a new song called ``I Am Changing My Name \nto Ford.''\n  The point is this: The individual family farmers around this country \ndon't have the kind of clout and power and opportunity to access their \nGovernment that some of the largest enterprises in this country do.\n  Family farms play an important role in our economy and in our \nculture. For social and economic reasons, I believe this country ought \nto want to foster and nurture a network of family farmers across this \ncountry producing America's food.\n  We can do it another way, and in some areas we do. In California, \nthey have areas where one company milks 3,500 cows every day three \ntimes a day. God bless them, in my judgment. They have every right to \ndo that.\n  I suggest we have a price support under the milk produced from about \n100 cows and say: If you want to milk 120 or 3,020 cows, God bless you, \nbut that is at your risk, not ours. We will provide a price support of \nthe milk on the first 100 cows you milk. That is what we ought to do \nwith respect to providing a safety net for family farmers.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the farm bill that was written in the \nSenate Agriculture Committee. Certainly it is not perfect. It is not \nexactly the bill I would write. I would prefer more targeting in the \nbill to be more helpful to family-size farms.\n  This bill is sure a whole lot better than the underlying farm law. I \nwas here when we debated Freedom to Farm, which I thought was a \ncatastrophe and I voted against it, and I am pleased I did. I want to \nsee somebody stand up in this Chamber and say how well Freedom to Farm \nhas worked. It almost bankrupted a lot of family farmers except for the \nfact every single year we had to pass emergency legislation to fill the \ngaps between Freedom to Farm which was such a miserable Swiss cheese \npiece of legislation that really did not help family farmers at all.\n  When the Freedom to Farm bill was passed, we had high grain prices, \nand we had people around here thinking that it was going to last \nforever; we are always going to have high grain prices, so we will just \ngive these farmers declining payments over 7 years, not with respect to \nwhat the current market prices are; we will just pay them, and things \nwill be great.\n  It was an absurd proposition. The fact is, prices collapsed almost \nimmediately, and they stayed down and they are down today.\n  The current, underlying farm law does not work at all. It is a \nmiserable piece of public policy that should never have been enacted \nbut was, and we have had to make the best of it by the end of each year \npassing some emergency legislation to respond to the needs that were \nunmet in Freedom to Farm.\n  The Senate Agriculture Committee has passed legislation that does a \npolicy U-turn, and that policy U-turn says: Let us go back to at least \nsome form of countercyclical help, getting help only when you need it. \nThat makes good sense to me. That countercyclical help is the help that \nI hope will give family farmers a message from the U.S. Congress that \nsays: You matter; you count; we want you as part of America's future.\n  Those Senators who come from farm country have had the same kind of \ncalls I have had and the same experience as I have had. Some say: Those \nare anecdotes that are emotional but do not mean very much. They mean \neverything.\n  Arlo Schmidt was doing an auction sale in North Dakota. He was \nauctioning a farm that had gone broke. A little boy came up to Arlo at \nthe end of the auction sale. He was about 8 or 9 years old, Arlo told \nme. The little boy was angry. He had tears in his eyes. He grabbed Arlo \nSchmidt around the leg, looked up at him and said accusingly: You sold \nmy dad's tractor.\n  Arlo patted him on the shoulder to comfort him some, and the kid \nwould have none of it. He said: I wanted to drive that tractor when I \ngot big.\n\n  The point is, that little boy felt that he, too, wanted a chance to \nfarm, but his family lost their dream, and the result was an auction \nsale. Those auction sales all around the country, those poster sales of \nthose broken farms reflect a failure of farm policy.\n  This is a hungry world. It is an enormously hungry world, and we \nproduce food in such great abundance. The economic all-stars of food \nproduction are family farmers. There is something fundamentally wrong \nwhen we cannot make the connections between what we produce in great \nabundance and what the world needs.\n  As I speak today, there are tens of thousands of children who will \ndie from hunger and hunger-related causes every hour, and nobody thinks \nmuch about that. I had a friend who was a singer many years ago who \ndied in 1981. His name was Harry Chapin. He was a wonderful singer. He \ndevoted one-half of the proceeds of his concerts every year to fight \nworld hunger.\n  Harry Chapin used to say if every day 45,000 children die of hunger \nand hunger-related causes, it is not even in the newspaper; there is \nnot even a news story about it. But if in New Jersey, 45,000 people \ndied in one day, it would be headlines. The winds of hunger blow every \nminute, every hour, and every day, and it is not even newsworthy. We \nhave family farmers with hopes and dreams to produce America's food and \nto produce food for the world only to be told that which they produce \nhas no value. There is something dramatically wrong with that.\n  I will finish by saying this: I regret we are here today dealing with \nthis bill. We should have been on this bill long ago. I especially \nregret we had to have a vote on a motion to proceed. We are having a \ndebate on whether we are going to proceed to the agriculture bill.\n  I have the deepest respect for Senator Lugar of Indiana. I listened \nto his speech. I could not disagree with him more. He knows I have \nspoken many times about the Nunn-Lugar program, for which I will have \nadmiration forever for Senator Lugar. What he has done in some areas is \nso wonderful and so important to this world. But in agriculture policy, \nI could not disagree with him more.\n  It is important for us to have aggressive debate about this so that \nthe country gets the best of what all of us have to offer. I am hopeful \nat the end of the day that we will get past this postcloture debate, \nget on the bill, offer amendments, and get this bill done.\n  Today is Wednesday. We ought to finish this bill this week. We ought \nto have a final passage vote on Friday, go to conference next week, \nfinish the conference report, and put it on President Bush's desk for \nsignature at the end of next week. That is what we ought to do. I \ncommit myself to doing that. I hope others will as well.\n  Today, let us make that commitment to America's families who are \ndesperately trying to make a living and hold on to that dream of making \nthe family farm work.\n  In this hungry world, especially at this time when we talk about \nsecurity, food security, and contributing to the world's food supply by \nour country's economic all-stars, the family farmers, it is something \nthat merits the attention and merits the writing of a good farm bill by \nthe Congress, and it merits us doing that now, this week, and next \nweek, and finishing that product so we can have the President sign it \nbefore the end of this year.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, are we on the farm bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed to the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk about the farm bill for a \nmoment. I have been listening to my\n\n[[Page S12419]]\n\nfriend from North Dakota talk in general terms of where we ought to be \nand what we want to do for the world, but we have not talked about how \nwe get there.\n  There ought to be some target, instead of talking about having food. \nThat is great. The fact is, we are talking about a policy. Look at this \nbill. It was brought up to the Chamber this morning. There is a lot of \ndetail in this legislation. What we need to be talking about and have \nbeen talking about but have not completed is a vision of where we want \nto go, what do we want agriculture and our food system to be in 10 or \n15 years.\n  My colleagues talk about the politics of it, of course, and that is \ngreat. They can talk about distributing funds to everyone, and that is \ngreat. All of us want some safety net in agriculture, and we will work \nto do that, but we have to go beyond that and take a look at how we get \nthere and what is the best way to do that.\n  Quite frankly, I have been involved in agriculture. My friend was \ntalking about coming from a town of 300. I come from Wapiti, WY. That \nis not even a town; it is a post office.\n  I know a little about agriculture. That has been my life as well, a \ndifferent kind of agriculture to be sure, and that is one of the \nissues. There are all kinds of agriculture with which we have to deal. \nThe Bush administration took a look at it and they had a statement I \nthought was good. They believe farm policy should ensure compatibility \nbetween domestic and trade objectives.\n  Have we talked about that? No, we have not. Support open markets. Did \nwe talk about markets? No, we did not. Provide market-oriented farm \nsafety net? I think all of us want to do that, not create undue \nuncertainty. These are the principles we ought to have as we move \nforward.\n  I am a member of the Agriculture Committee. I am a new member of the \nAgriculture Committee this year, as a matter of fact. The idea of \nfinishing on Friday bothers me a little bit because this bill was \njammed through the committee in time that most of us did not even have \na chance to take a look at what was being proposed. It was brought up \nwhen we, quite frankly, ought to have been dealing with our economic \nstimulus package.\n  We ought to be dealing with doing the appropriations and those \nmatters that really have impact. The farm bill does not expire until \nnext August. I am one who thinks, yes, we ought to go for it after we \nget back in January so farmers will have some idea, before planting \ntime, as to what they look forward to in the future. But the idea that \nwe take something like this that hardly anyone in this whole place has \nlooked at and pass it in 2 days is criminal, and I hope that does not \nhappen.\n  I objected as we went through this bill a time or two simply because \nwe have not had an opportunity to look at various complicated titles, \nand they are complicated. We were asked to deal with titles such as \nconservation, for example, in a markup in the morning when we did not \neven get the language until some of the staff got it at midnight the \nnight before. I do not think that is a very responsible way to deal \nwith a bill that is as important as this Agriculture bill. It is my \nopinion the committee moved much too quickly. We did not have an \nopportunity to find out what was in the particular title, whether it be \nmarketing titles, competition titles, conservation titles, or commodity \ntitles.\n  Did we have a chance to talk a little bit about the projected ideas \nand the proposals with people at home in the business? No, we did not. \nWe did not even receive the language until midnight the night before \nthe markup.\n  So I think we need to take a little time and look at all the aspects. \nAgriculture is a complicated industry everywhere. In every State, it is \na little different. I am from Wyoming. Our largest activity, of course, \nis livestock, mostly cattle, some sheep, but we also have crops. \nInterestingly enough, our largest cash crop in Wyoming is sugar beets. \nSo each of us is different. As we went through this in the committee, \npeople were talking about cranberries, about cherries, about apples. \nThat is okay, but it takes a little time to put together a responsible \nkind of policy to deal with those issues.\n  During the time the committee was working on the bill, we never did \nget overall scoring. We never did get a real look at what it was going \nto cost. Indeed, after the committee was directly forced to deal with \nit before it was brought to the Senate, changes had to be made which we \ndid not even have anything to do with. That is not the system I believe \nought to be used in this place, especially when we are talking about \nsomething as complicated and far-reaching that impacts as many people \nas does a policy for farming.\n\n  As we went through the bill, the chairman would talk about a \nreconciliation process, that after we have waded through the first part \nof it we could come back and do it. We did not even get a chance to \nlook at the reconciliation until it is now being considered. So I have \nto say that as interested as I am--and as I said, my own background is \nin agriculture. I have always been involved with agriculture, so I am \nvery much interested in it, not only because of whom I represent in \nWyoming but because I am personally very interested in a successful \nagriculture that has some opportunity to be market-oriented so we are \nproducing those commodities that the market requests, so that we can \nbuild new markets overseas, which we have to do in order to have a \nprogram of that kind. So it is a complicated matter, and we really need \nto move on with that.\n  As I have said repeatedly, I asked for a little more time in the \ncommittee, but we did not get it so we will deal with it as we are, and \nthere will be amendments we can take a look at. Quite frankly, we may \nbe dealing with Defense appropriations before this is completed. We may \nbe dealing with economic stimulus. In any event, we ought to be taking \na look at where we want to be over time. We ought to promote the idea \nof family farms instead of the big corporate farms, of course, so that \nfamilies can afford to stay on those farms and be effective. We need to \nfind additional markets.\n  We produce more than we are going to consume. So in order to be an \neffective industry, we have to find markets and move there. I think we \nhave to be very careful, as we are in this trade business, that the \nthings we do will fit into trade, the so-called green box, the WTO, or \nthe amber box. If we find we do not have these payments that fit into \nthe WTO rules, then we have some difficulties in being able to do that.\n  I happen to think one of the most important issues we ought to look \nat is conservation. In my part of the world--and I think it may be even \nmore important other places--people would like to see open space \nremain. One of the best ways to do that is to have successful \nagriculture, of course. We need to do that.\n  There are a great many things we must do and I think we can do. I \nthink there is more emphasis on conservation, whether it is grasslands \nor whether it is timber or whether it is crop lands itself. These are \nthe kinds of things we need to think about. We need to have a \nthoughtful bill which we have time to discuss and not jam through \nbecause of the political expediency of getting it done before this year \nis over. I do not think that is the best reason to come up with \nsomething that has not had the kind of consideration and thought we \nlook forward to having.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under cloture, each Senator may speak up to 1 \nhour.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Very well. I am not going to take up the 1 hour. I \nyield to my friend from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. May I respond to the distinguish Senator? In the event the \nSenator does not use his hour, if he were to yield the balance of that \ntime to me, that would be helpful in the expedition of the debate. But \nthe Senator should be prepared to utilize his full hour.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. No, I am not going to utilize the full hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has yielded time to \nthe Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the forum we are attempting to adopt is one \nin which a Senator yields time to me as manager of the bill as sort of \na time bank. I will explain for all Members I am allotted only 1 hour \nunder the rule. I can accumulate as much as 2 more hours by such \nallocation from Senators, which I seek to do simply to\n\n[[Page S12420]]\n\nexpedite the debate during those times when there are no other Senators \npresent to speak.\n  In that event, will the Senator yield whatever time he has remaining \nwhen he completes his speech?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nIndiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the committee-passed \nfarm bill and to express my hope that we can complete action on it \nquickly.\n  First, let me commend Chairman Harkin and the majority leader for \ntheir fine work in meeting the needs of the Senators from different \nregions of this great and diverse country. We all have unique needs. It \nis not easy to address all of them and to bring them together. I thank \nthe chairman, again, for his efforts to do so.\n  I think we have come up with a good farm bill, worthy of passage. \nThis legislation provides a critical income safety net for American \nfarmers. It includes an unprecedented $20 billion increase in \nconservation spending. It substantially increases allocations for \nnutrition, for rural development, and forestry programs. This bill \nmeets the needs of our rural communities while remaining within the \nbudget authority.\n  I am also pleased that the chairman has included an energy title in \nthe legislation that provides incentives for alternative fuel \ntechnologies. The energy debate over the past few days only solidifies \nthe need for further advancements in alternative fuels.\n  Let me take a moment to focus on a major reform that is in this bill, \na major reform of the peanut program. In a place such as Washington, \nwhere talk of eliminating a program is as rare as spotting a whooping \ncrane, we are now ready to eliminate the Depression-era peanut quota \nprogram from our Nation's $4 billion peanut industry. That is worth \nrepeating. Some may think they heard me incorrectly.\n  There is a provision in this bill to eliminate the old peanut quota \nsystem. For decades this system served the South well. For decades it \nprovided economic security to some of our country's poorest areas and \nit guaranteed the domestic market a safe, high-quality source of \npeanuts.\n  But all of that changed when NAFTA and GATT were passed. These \nagreements effectively ended the peanut program as we know it. Trade \nprotections for peanuts were ratcheted down. Imports gradually \nincreased and farmers' quotas were reduced. In the 1996 farm bill, \nCongress had decided to require farmers to cover peanut program losses, \nmaking it a no-net-cost to the Government. That sounded good \npolitically, but it failed to make peanuts more competitive on the \nworld market and it certainly did not quell imports.\n  Peanut producers have faced up to this competitive reality. The vast \nmajority are willing to finally give up a program that has served them \nwell for more than 60 years. Yes, it is going to cost some money to \ncompensate quota holders for their losses, but it would be unthinkable \nfor the Government not to compensate farm families for their property. \nThere has to be a bridge between the old system and the new system, and \nthis bill gives us one. It makes that necessary transition and it does \nit in a fair way.\n  At a time when we are searching for the best ways to stimulate our \neconomy, this farm bill is the greatest stimulus we can provide to \nrural America. It will give that economy an instant boost.\n  If we do not act, I can tell you what the scenario will be in Georgia \nand in other parts of this country. If we do not pass a farm bill now, \nlocal banks will make a fraction of their traditional farm loans. \nFarmers without financing will either get out of farming or declare \nbankruptcy. Who will suffer then? I will tell you who. Those farmers, \nthose families in fragile rural areas where the economy is driven by \nthe feedstore and the family restaurant and the local car dealership.\n\n  With many textile plants and other industries leaving the rural \nSouth, these farmers have fewer and fewer places to turn. In rural \nGeorgia, the challenge today is just to stay afloat. It is becoming \ntougher by the day. Our Nation's great prosperity over the past decade, \nunfortunately, has not always filtered down to these rural areas. We \nhave failed to bring many of these communities along economically, and \nit shows.\n  We have spent a lot of time looking out for Wall Street, and well we \nshould. Now it is time we look out for Main Street. We need to help \nplaces such as Moultrie, GA, and Driver, AR, and Seagraves, TX. Our \nNation is focused on the September 11 attacks, and rightly so. But let \nus not forget that agriculture has been mired in a 5-year disaster, \ndevastated by bad weather and bad prices. Almost every year in this \nbody we have had to provide supplemental appropriations. We need this \nnew farm bill to stop the cycle.\n  The time is now for a new farm bill. We must act before adjourning \nfor the year. We cannot go home for Christmas with generous, bountiful \ngifts for certain segments of our economy but only ashes and switches \nfor our farmers.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield for 1 minute?\n  Mr. MILLER. Yes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I just want to say to the Senator from Georgia, I \ncongratulate you and commend you. For many years we have had battles in \nthe peanut program between those who are peanut consumers in large \nconsumption States and those who are producers, but you have stepped in \nand provided great leadership for your growers through this transition \nprocess. I am very privileged and pleased to join you in a truly unique \nsituation. I think it has not been seen here since the peanut program \nwas instituted. Those who are the consumers of peanuts and those who \nare the growers of peanuts have found common ground to work on a piece \nof legislation that will transition us into a whole new era in peanut \nproduction.\n  I commend the Senator for his great leadership from a great peanut-\nproducing State, to help shepherd his growers into a much more market-\noriented approach to growing peanuts. I commend the Senator for his \ngreat effort.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank the Senator for his remarks. He is one who has \nstudied this program closely in the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my concerns over the \naction of the Senate in proceeding to the Farm Bill, notwithstanding \nthe nice dialog between the Senator from Pennsylvania and my good \nfriend from a fellow peanut-growing State, the Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Miller.\n  I understand the desire to make improvements in the existing farm \nbill. There should be improvements made. From what I can tell, the \nHouse-passed bill and the Senate-Agriculture-Committee-reported bill \nhave several very worthy provisions.\n  No one can argue against the need for a strong farm bill. Indeed, it \nis a high priority, and I certainly will not disagree with that. In my \nhome State, the Commonwealth of Virginia, agriculture accounts for a \nsignificant part of our diverse economy. Agriculture creates \napproximately 388,000 jobs in Virginia, which is about 10 percent of \nthe total jobs statewide.\n  Virginia agriculture contributes about $19.5 billion to Virginia's \ngross State product, or 11.2 percent of the total GSP.\n  Farms cover 8.8 million acres, or 34 percent of Virginia's total land \narea. There are 49,000 farms in Virginia. Most farms in Virginia are \nsmaller farms, but there are 49,000 of them. Again, a strong farm bill \nis very important to Virginia.\n  I do applaud the work of the committee in drafting this bill. \nHowever, I have several concerns and I cannot agree with moving forward \non this bill right now. Let me elaborate on these several concerns.\n  Number one, this is not the right time to deal with this bill. The \ncurrent farm bill, with whatever flaws it may have and whatever \nimprovements need to be made to that bill, does not expire until the \nend of fiscal year 2002, which is September 30 of next year. We are \nalready several months into the fiscal year 2002. It is simply unfair \nto our hard-working men and women to make any changes to this \nlegislation that may harm their income in the middle of the current \nyear. They just finished the fall harvest and are now involved in \nplanning, buying, and leasing for the\n\n[[Page S12421]]\n\nnext planting. It would be like lining up to kick a field goal and \nhaving the goalpost moved after you kick the ball. After you kick it, \nnobody is allowed to move the goalpost back. That simply would not be \nfair. It is a terrible way to make changes, whether it is in the peanut \nprogram in particular in Virginia or any other sort of program when \nfarmers are making these decisions.\n\n  The second problem I have with this measure being brought up now is \nthat Americans have much more pressing problems to deal with rather \nthan changing a law that doesn't expire for another 10 or 11 months. We \nare at war. Financing this war is important, and making sure that the \nmen and women in uniform have adequate compensation is important. It is \nimportant that they have the armaments and the most technologically \nadvanced equipment for protecting our interests at home and abroad. We \nneed to be worrying about that and dealing with the crisis of \nterrorism. That must be dealt with now.\n  The Defense appropriations bill: We need to be dealing with proper \nfunding for our Defense Department.\n  Overall appropriations: The Senate and the House have not completed \nwork on all the fiscal year 2002 appropriations bills, yet we are \nconsidering a bill and a law that has not expired and will not expire \nuntil the end of fiscal year 2002.\n  Sometimes I may have a hard time getting used to the logic of the \nFederal Government--trying to change a bill that has 10 months of \nvalidity to it while not even taking care of bills that should have \nbeen financing our military or schools since the first of October. \nThese are supposed to be 5-year farm bills. There is a logic to making \nthis a four-year bill. There is a predictability that allows farmers to \nplan ahead and make investments so that they will grow the best crop \npossible to provide for their families. That bill doesn't expire until \nlate next year, and here we are arguing that issue.\n  Meanwhile, we are in a war, and we are not dealing with the Defense \nAppropriations bill or the Labor-HHS Appropriations Bill. As far as I \nam concerned, these appropriations bills are some of the primary \nfunctions we serve as Members of Congress. The one thing we have to do \neach and every year is fund the government. We haven't completed that \ntask yet. Those bills should have been completed before October of this \nyear. Here we are fiddling around and debating a very important measure \nwith important implications, but again not taking care of the things \nthat are most timely.\n  We have emergency appropriations, and $20 billion in appropriations \nstill has to be finalized by Congress concerning response to the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks. Congress has yet to spend the $20 \nbillion appropriated portion of the war on terrorism for emergency \nsecurity, response, and recovery efforts This issue should be on our \nplate right now for action rather than the farm bill.\n  Economic stimulus: We realize our economy has a great deal of \nconsternation. Consumer confidence is low. Businesses are not \ninvesting. Jobs are being lost. An economic stimulus package, something \nthat will help spur consumer spending and business investment and \nthereby the creation of more jobs rather than the loss of jobs--that \nshould be a priority. That is a clear and pressing need for the people \nof America right now, not a law that expires in October of next year.\n  Getting hard-working Americans back to work is a priority. Our \neconomy has lost thousands and thousands of jobs and these job losses \nare not unique to the airline or tourism industry, or even to New York \nor Virginia. They are felt in every corner of the country and in every \nindustry. As the Senator from Georgia mentioned, we have lost a lot of \ntextile jobs in the South. In Southside, VA, 2,300 jobs were just lost \nat VF Imagewear in the Henry County area--in the heart of Virginia.\n\n  The President's back-to-work package is a way to help those folks who \nare out of work--hopefully temporarily--with their health care as well \nas with their unemployment benefits. We need to help these people \nthrough tough times and most importantly, strengthen the economy to \nenable them to get back to work. That is a part of the stimulus package \nthat I wish we were arguing, debating, and acting upon at this moment. \nBut we are fiddling with this bill that doesn't expire until next year.\n  Nominees: The President ought to have his team in place. I know the \nSenator from Georgia at one time was an executive. They need their own \nteam in place to respond and to effectuate their philosophy, to act \nupon the principles, promises and policies that they enunciated to the \nAmerican people. Yet the President has not gotten the deserved \nattention to have his nominees for key administration positions--\nwhether it is in the State Department, judicial arena, or in other \nareas.\n  I think the Government needs to have capable people to do the work of \nthe Government. Senator Bond spoke on this matter earlier and I agree \nwith his remarks.\n  Energy legislation: I very much agree on the need to pass \ncomprehensive energy legislation that deals with both supply and demand \nissues. That is a positive aspect of this farm bill that the Senator \nfrom Georgia, Mr. Miller, brought up. Fuel cells and new technologies \nare very important. We can't keep doing things the same old way. We \nneed to have a diversity of fuels and not be so dependent on foreign \noil. I would like to see us become more energy independent in this \ncountry so that we are not jerked around by monarchs or others in the \nMiddle East for our reliance on oil, which matters a great deal for our \neconomy, and clearly it matters to farmers. When diesel prices or gas \nprices are skyrocketing, they are put in quite a bind.\n  An energy bill, which has consisted been advocated by Senator \nMurkowski of Alaska, is something we have been trying to deal with for \nthis entire year. It is an important issue that has been dealt with in \nthe House and deserves the Senates attention.\n  We are at war in Afghanistan. We also have a war on the homefront as \nwell. We have become the target of domestic terrorism that is \naccurately described as war. We need to make sure that in our homeland \nwe have the right safety and security--not just abroad but here at home \nas well.\n  The farm bill, in my view, is not a piece of legislation that should \nbe rushed into. I believe Senator Conrad accurately portrayed why we \nmay be pushing this legislation forward. He explained that issue very \nwell. He said: ``The money is in the budget now. If we do not use the \nmoney, it will very likely not be available next year.'' While what the \nSenate Budget Committee says may be true, it is not a good reason to \nrush through floor consideration on a piece of legislation as important \nas this one. The farm bill is an important matter. It merits time, \nconsideration, and full debate on the floor. With all of the other \npriorities that the Senate really must consider prior to recess, it \ndoesn't make sense to hold them up for the farm bill.\n  I am not a member of the Agriculture Committee and was therefore not \nable to offer amendments in the committee. I look forward to the \nopportunity to work with committee members and potentially offer \namendments on the floor.\n\n  I also understand that the committee markup was not very open to \namendments. While I am sure there was a significant amount of wonderful \nwork done by the chairman on the bill, I know there are significant \ndifferences even within the Agriculture Committee. These differences \nare obvious even to someone who is not on the committee. Especially \nwhen you look at the number of competing bills introduced by committee \nmembers themselves. First there is the Harkin bill which was passed by \nthe committee. There is a Lugar substitute, and the Cochran-Roberts \nsubstitute is a third measure. There is a fourth measure being \nconsidered, the House-passed bill, and the fifth is the Lincoln-\nHutchinson bill.\n  I heard from people all across Virginia about many of the positive \nchanges that several of these bills would make. However, I also heard \nfrom Virginia peanut farmers who have a different view than peanut \nfarmers maybe in Oklahoma, or New Mexico, or Texas, or even the Empire \nState of the South, Georgia. That is my third concern. The peanut \nfarmers in Virginia may very well go out of business with\n\n[[Page S12422]]\n\nthis measure as written. This new peanut program will hurt the income \nof hard-working Virginia peanut farmers.\n  In 1996, when the Federal Government last debated the farm bill, the \ntarget price was lowered from $670 per ton down to the current level of \n$610 per ton. This $610-per-ton level is not due to expire until the \nend of fiscal year 2002--September 30, 2002.\n  These peanut-growing farmers in Virginia have sense and practicality. \nThey have already entered into agreements for land. They have entered \ninto agreements for equipment leases as well as renting quota for the \nupcoming growing season. They will be planting in Virginia only about 5 \nto 6 months from now. That is simply the planting, and these farmers \nare certainly in the midst of preparation prior to planting right now.\n  This farm bill will change their revenue stream after they have \nalready entered into contracts based upon the provisions in the current \nfarm bill. People in the real world think that law doesn't expire until \nSeptember 30 of 2002. They think that law is going to be there. They \nmake decisions based on that law. Here we are debating changing the \nrules on them.\n  The bottom line is that it is simply not fair. It is not fair to our \nhard-working farmers who have to be dealing with a moving target.\n  I have been working on these issues with members of the committee and \nother concerned Senators and look forward to the opportunity to make \nsome changes that will benefit the hard-working family of peanut \ngrowers in Virginia and, indeed, every farmer, regardless of crop \nthroughout our country.\n  Virginia's peanut farms cannot withstand another 10-percent reduction \nin the price of peanuts as we saw back in 1996. This current farm bill, \nas proposed, will do just that and then some. Virginia has about 76,000 \nacres of peanuts and 4,000 peanut growing farmers. The crop brought in \n$60 million to the State's economy last year. While these numbers may \nnot look large to some Senators who have large corporate farms in their \nStates, these peanut farms are the basis of many local rural \ncommunities, particularly in southeastern Virginia. And there are \ndifferent types of peanuts. I am not going to name every one, but in \nVirginia we grow the jumbo--the nice, big peanuts. You may see the \nbrands Whitley's or the Virginia Diner peanuts, the Hancock peanuts, \nthe blanched peanuts. Those are Virginia-style or sometimes called \nVirginia-Carolina style peanuts--the jumbos, the big peanuts, not the \nsmall, little redskin peanuts or the Spanish peanuts, goobers, or \nrunters. Those are all fine peanuts as well. You just have to eat two \nof them for every one of a Virginia peanut. They are probably just as \ngreat for peanut butter and candies.\n  Most of the States are different. Virginia grows this different type \nof peanut. While it is larger, it does get a lower yield per acre than \nyou would with the smaller peanuts, and they also have a higher cost \nper acre. Our peanut farmers in Virginia risk having their revenue cut \nto a point where they will lose money on each pound that is produced. \nAgain, it is a different peanut than is grown in other regions of the \ncountry. And while that raises our costs, it unfortunately does not \noften equally raise the price that the farmer receives. So a tough \nsituation now would just become disastrous if this measure became law \nin the middle of this year, or, for that matter, even after 2002.\n  The situation here is one where our economy would be affected. The \nfarmers, in particular, who have purchased equipment, who have made \nleases on equipment, on implements, on fertilizer--I know the Presiding \nOfficer understands because in his State they have a lot of good rural \ncommunities--if there is a good crop that brings in a good yield, sure, \nthat helps the farmer, the implement dealer, those who sell feed or \nseed or fertilizer, but it also has an impact on the entire community \nwith the money that comes into the businesses there, such as grocery \nstores and restaurants. It has a big impact on that economy through \nboth direct and indirect means.\n  Having met this summer with a great deal of peanut growers in \nsoutheastern Virginia, it reminded me of when I saw the tobacco farmers \njust a few years ago, where they were trying to get the best yield per \nacre they could get and they were under attack by officious nannies \nfrom Washington, who are looking to reform somebody else's habit, and \nhere are these communities wondering how they are going to survive. \nThey are simply hard-working law abiding men and women trying to \nprovide for their families. And these proposed changes don't only \naffect them--it affects their whole community. It is not a matter of \nhumor nor to be taken lightly. Their livelihoods are at stake.\n  So I say, number one, this is not the right time to change the law \nbefore it expires. Let the law expire before you change these laws \naffecting these peanut farmers. Number two, we have much more pressing \nissues on which to be focusing our current attention and our \nbrainpower, whether it is supporting our war effort, addressing our \neconomy, getting people back to work or gaining energy independence. \nAnd number three, I think this would have a terrible impact on \nVirginia's peanut farmers and their communities.\n\n  I find it completely wrong for the Federal Government to change, at \nthis time, a law that many good, decent, hard-working, law-abiding \ncitizens have relied on. To do that would put a lot of people out of \nbusiness. And any new law should take effect after the end of the \ncurrent farm bill.\n  So with that, Mr. President, I thank you for your attention. I thank \nmy colleagues for their attention. And I hope to be able to work with \nall of you in the months ahead to come up with a peanut program that is \ngood for the taxpayers, and also one that allows Americans to enjoy the \nbenefits of good, wholesome, nutritious peanuts as well, and takes into \naccount fair practices as far as legislating up here. And we should not \nchange laws before they expire, especially when so many people have \nrelied on those laws. I especially hope that Virginia peanuts will \nalways be around for all of us to enjoy.\n  With that, under the provisions of rule XXII, I yield my remaining \ntime to the ranking member of the committee, Senator Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under cloture, there is no control of time. \nEach Senator has a maximum of 1 hour.\n  Mr. ALLARD. One hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank you for recognizing me and giving \nme an opportunity to rise today to talk about the farm bill which the \nSenate is debating. I would also like to thank and commend the Ranking \nMember of the Agriculture Committee Senator Lugar for his leadership \nduring this debate. As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I \nparticipated in the drafting of the bill which we are now about to \nconsider. Also, when I was in the House of Representatives, some 5 \nyears back, with the passage of the freedom to farm bill, I was on the \nAgriculture Committee on the House side.\n  I think this is a great opportunity for us to do some good things to \nhelp agriculture in this country. However, it is an opportunity to do \nthe wrong thing. I do think we have to be careful about moving forward \ntoo quickly on some of this legislation without giving our farmers and \nour ranchers and the agricultural interests in our various States an \nopportunity to study what is in the bill to give us a full assessment \nof how it is going to impact businesses in their various States.\n  In the State of Colorado, agriculture is very important. We have \nalways worked on trying to have a broad, diversified economy. So we \nhave other industries and other sources that broaden out our economic \nbase in the State.\n  For example, in Weld County, this is a county frequently recognized \nas one of the largest agricultural producing counties in the country, \nusually rated in the top 5, based on gross agricultural dollars that \nare brought in.\n\n  I have another county in northeastern Colorado that produces a lot of \ncorn. It is one of the largest corn-producing counties in the country. \nAgain, this varies a little bit depending on\n\n[[Page S12423]]\n\nweather and how yields come out year to year. So certainly agriculture \nis important to the State of Colorado.\n  As a member of the State senate--I also served on the agriculture \ncommittee in that body--we continually worked to have a broad base.\n  In the State of Colorado, not only do we have some counties that \ncontribute considerably to agriculture in the country, but they also \nadd a lot of opportunity for other businesses in the State of Colorado \nto develop added value to those agricultural products.\n  We all want to do the right thing and help the agricultural economy. \nBut everyone needs to have the opportunity to review the legislation to \nunderstand how it effects them. This is not the bill that was reported \nout of committee, however, nor the one which was introduced on November \n27. So it has been a little difficult to determine what is exactly \ncontained in this particular bill. Farmers in Colorado, as best I can \nfigure out, would probably do best under the Cochran-Roberts proposal. \nBut, again, we need more time, more opportunity to talk with farmers in \nthe State of Colorado.\n  We certainly have different types of operations. Some of them that we \nhave in Colorado are strictly ranching operations. We have a lot of \nwheat operations, irrigated agriculture--vegetables. We need time in \nour office to begin to assess how these various agricultural operations \nare going to be impacted by a bill as complicated as the farm bill that \nwe are about to consider on the floor of the Senate.\n  This has been an interesting process to go through this past couple \nof months as we have attempted to draft a bill. I have been somewhat \nskeptical, as we drew to a conclusion to get a bill here to the floor. \nThe current farm bill, the Freedom to Farm bill, does not expire until \nSeptember 2002. Again, I do not fully understand why it is so important \nwe push forward so quickly because I think input from our agricultural \ninterests in our respective States is very important. If this goes \nthrough too quickly, they will be divorced of that opportunity to have \ntheir input to their Representatives so they can have an impact on the \nagricultural legislation.\n  I was a member of the House Agriculture Committee and supported the \nprovisions contained within Freedom to Farm. I did not think it was \nnecessary to rewrite the bill a year earlier. But here we are, ready to \nrewrite the farm bill.\n  It is complicated. As I stated, I have some problems and concerns \nabout the legislation and how this bill moved forward. This has been a \ntrying time for the Senate, for example, with the anthrax problems we \nhave had in the Hart Building which has impacted some 50 of our \ncolleagues. It has been difficult for them to get in touch with their \nrecords that are embargoed within the building. It has made it \ndifficult for colleagues who have been on the Agriculture Committee--\nand I suspect it would have an impact on Members here on the floor--to \nevaluate what their positions are, as far as a major piece of \nlegislation such as the agriculture bill, without full access to their \noffice resources and files.\n  So as we move forward in an expeditious manner, we put certain \nMembers of this body at a disadvantage. We have to be sensitive to \ntheir needs and their desire to do the best job and represent their \nconstituents.\n  In my office, we have been hosting several staffers of Senator Craig \nThomas. I am sure it has been difficult to continue to operate \nthroughout this process. It is an unfortunate situation, and I am sure \nit has not helped the drafting of sound legislation.\n  As for the process with which the farm bill moved through the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, we were not receiving legislative language until \nabout 1 to 2 a.m. in the morning on the same day of the bill markup. It \nwas hardly sufficient time to fully analyze and assess its impacts.\n  Generally speaking, most of the titles were agreed to on a bipartisan \nbasis. As the Chair knows, so many of these issues break out on a \ncommodity basis and not on a partisan basis.\n  During the committee markup, I did support an alternative commodity \ntitle offered by my colleagues, Senators Roberts and Cochran. The \nfundamental component was the establishment of farm savings accounts.\n  Rather than continue to rely on Federal subsidies during bad times \nfor farmers, many in Congress believe farmers and ranchers should have \nthe opportunity to set up accounts to set aside income during the years \nin which their income is high so that they could then withdraw funds in \nyears when their incomes are low. Unfortunately, this alternative was \ndefeated in committee.\n  I see this provision becoming more important as we see the price of \nimplements used in farming, for example, get more expensive. If you \nhave a large farm operation, it is not unusual to see somebody spend \n$100,000 for a tractor. I remember when I was a young lad working in \nthe hay field, we had a large tractor. We spent $4,000 or $5,000 on it. \nWhen you have high costs on your implements, that means you have to \naccumulate savings over the years in order to be able to afford that \ntractor.\n  If you have a year when you have a good return on your commodity \nprices and the farm does well, you may end up with a considerable \namount of income. But you find yourself as a farmer getting kicked into \nhigher income tax brackets. So instead of being able to set that aside \nfor investments that will help you be a better farmer and produce \nbetter in future years, you find you have to hand the dollars over to \nthe Federal Government. So the idea of the farm savings accounts is, \nduring those years when you have a lot of revenues coming in, you \ncan set that aside for future years.\n\n  Then when you get into years when you don't have as much return on \nyour crops, then you can carry those profits forward and distribute \nthem out over the years. That has profound impact on farm operations \ntoday and is something that should be implemented.\n  I indicate my strong support for an upcoming amendment to be offered \nby Senators Roberts and Cochran. When putting a farm bill together, my \nphilosophy is to let farmers do what they do best, and get the \nGovernment out of the farm. Unfortunately, the farm bill that came out \nof committee and which is now being considered does not do that. It \nmoves us back towards more Government intervention and less towards \nfree markets and free enterprise.\n  Senators Roberts and Cochran are to be commended for developing a \nsound alternative to that which came through the committee. This is a \nsolid proposal they are going to introduce. It needs serious \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  An important component of the farm bill is the research title. As a \nveterinarian, this is an area in which I believe strongly. If we are \ngoing to continue to have an abundant and safe food supply, we need to \ncontinue to fund our Nation's research priorities. I was able to \ninclude two provisions which I believe are extremely important.\n  The first allows for research on infectious animal disease research \nand extension to allow grants for developing programs for prevention \nand control methodologies for animal infectious diseases that impact \ntrade, including vesicular stomatitis, bovine tuberculosis, \ntransmissible spongiform encephalopathy, brucellosis and E. coli \n0157:H7 infection, which is the pathogenic form of E. coli infections.\n  It also set aside laboratory tests for quicker detection of infected \nanimals and the presence of diseases among herds, and prevention \nstrategies, including vaccination programs.\n  This is becoming a smaller world. Not only do we need to be concerned \nabout diseases that are naturally occurring, but we need to be aware \nand cognizant of the potential impact of diseases that don't occur. For \nexample, we saw the profound impact of hoof and mouth disease in \ncountries such as England and the devastating impact on the livestock \nindustry in that country. We need to make sure that we have the \nresearch in place in this country where we can develop modern \ntechnologies and that will help protect the livestock industry.\n  The second provision I had put in the bill establishes research and \nextension grants for beef cattle genetics evaluation research. It \nprovides that the USDA shall give priority to proposals to establish \nand coordinate priorities for genetic evaluation of domestic beef \ncattle.\n\n[[Page S12424]]\n\n  It consolidates research efforts to reduce duplication of effort and \nmaximize the return to the beef industry and also to streamline the \nprocess between the development and adoption of new genetic evaluation \nmethodologies by the industry; and then to identify new traits and \ntechnologies for inclusion in genetic programs in order to reduce the \ncost of beef production to provide consumers with a high nutritional \nvalue, healthy and affordable protein source.\n  Research, in my view, is fundamental. It is extremely important that \nwe have the research base there to continue to improve production in \norder to deal with infectious diseases that affect plants and animals \nand to help assure a high quality food supply.\n  I do think the people of this country have a great deal. They have \nthe best quality food at the most reasonable price of any place in the \nworld. That is something to be proud of. We need to do everything we \npossibly can to make sure that we maintain our position in the world.\n  A couple other provisions are in the bill. There are some attempts \nwithin the bill to deal with alternative fuels. It is something I have \nworked on. I established the renewable energy caucus. I believe that \nrenewable fuels is certainly something we need to look at for energy \nindependence instead of war dependence on energy sources particularly \nout of the Middle East. We need to look to agriculture to help us meet \nsome of those energy needs.\n  I also have a provision in there to deal with cockfighting. It is an \nattempt to try and protect States rights. The State of Colorado, along \nwith 46 other States, have all passed laws against cockfighting. We \nhave three States that have not.\n  However, Mr. President, those states that have chosen to outlaw \ncockfighting have difficulty enforcing their own laws. As a result of a \nloophole in the Animal Welfare Act, which specifically excludes live \nbirds from the interstate transport ban, individuals who are caught \nwith fighting birds can avoid being detained by law enforcement by \nclaiming that they are transporting the birds to a state in which \ncockfighting is legal. Game birds are the only animal for which this \nloophole exists and this is unfair to the states that have chosen not \nto allow cockfighting.\n  My attempt is just to make sure that we don't preempt the States in a \nway through this Federal loophole that they can't enforce the law they \npassed. This is an important provision--something I have worked on for \nalmost 3 years. It was passed by a strong majority in the House Farm \nBill and has been passed previously by the Senate. It is my hope that \nwe are able to retain this language in the final version of the Farm \nBill.\n  Mr. President, agriculture is important to this country. It is \nimportant to States such as mine and certainly important to the Senator \nwho is presiding over the Senate at this particular time. I think we \nall have a common interest. We want to see our farmers and ranchers be \nable to stay in business, and we want them to be able to compete in a \nworld market. We need to work to expand not only our international \nmarkets, but also our domestic markets. Sometimes that requires \nthinking beyond the box. It is a challenge for those of us who are \nlooking at establishing the proper public policy that would allow our \nagricultural sector to continue to grow and prosper.\n  This is an important piece of legislation. I hope we don't rush it \nthrough to the point where we haven't given the various agricultural \ninterests an opportunity to have their input as to what the final \noutcome of this bill will be.\n  I hope that we allow enough time for them to participate in the \nprocess. It is important that we do the right thing. We can do that if \nwe allow plenty of opportunity for everybody to participate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remaining time to the ranking member of \nthe committee and look forward to working with him on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nColorado for yielding that time. I thank him even more for his message. \nIt has been a genuine pleasure to work with him on the Agriculture \nCommittee in trying to formulate good legislation. I look forward to \nsupporting the ideas he has presented this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, as a part of the background for our debate, we ought \nto consider carefully the status of the farm economy presently. Many \nviews have been given, and they are earnest views of Senators and their \nStates' particular agricultural interests.\n  Let me review a summary of where we stand at this particular point in \nthe year 2001. Current USDA forecasts suggest that the underlying farm \neconomy, exclusive of Government payments, is stronger this year than \nlast. While U.S. agriculture continues to face the prospects of \nsomewhat reduced income and outgoing structural change, many indicators \nremain favorable. The indicators that remain favorable are: Exports are \nup; asset values for agriculture throughout the country are up in the \naggregate; debt levels are down; the rate of inflation for the overall \neconomy, of course, has been down; interest rates are down; \nproductivity and prices appear to be strengthening.\n  Clearly, in the soybean and corn markets, which I know the occupant \nof the chair watches, as I do, we have seen mercifully an upturn, after \nbottoming out. In any event, the price levels across the board for all \ncrops appear to be slightly stronger than last year. World markets are \nextremely important to us, and this is why we are all encouraged that \nexport sales apparently will finally come in somewhere close to $53.5 \nbillion in 2001, as compared to $49 billion a year ago, an increase of \n$4.5 billion. They could grow to as much as $54.5 billion in 2002, \naccording to USDA's best projections. These levels are still below the \nrecord levels of 1996, often cited primarily in response to continuing \nproblems in Asia, and production increases by competing exporters--many \nof them in Latin America.\n\n  Nevertheless, the sales appear to be increasing significantly. Year \nover year, forecasts of grain, poultry, and horticultural exports in \n2002 will exceed 2001, largely due to increased volume. Exports to \nmajor U.S. markets in Asia and the Western Hemisphere are projected \nabove 2001, even in spite of slowing economic growth or, in some cases, \nrecession in those areas.\n  Overall farm income has this projection: The intermediate term \neconomic outlook for agriculture is uncertain, as always. It is clear \nthat many underlying farm economic conditions are stronger this year \nthan last. Farm cash receipts could be near high record levels for \n2001, and, indeed, earlier this morning I discussed this subject. We \nfound figures from USDA that showed roughly $60 billion of net cash \nincome. This would be, in fact, a new all-time record for any year, \nincluding 1996.\n  Farm cash receipts have been driven largely by a 9-percent increase \nin livestock sales. Overall crop sales appear to be up about 3.1 \npercent. Gross cash income is up 4 percent and net cash income is up \n5.7 percent over last year. The $20 billion in payments from the \nFederal Government, including the AMTA payments, which we voted on in \nthe summertime, come to $20 billion less, in fact, than the $23 billion \nthat the Congress allocated last year. That is significant because the \nnet cash income record was received, even though Government payments \nhave come down this year by, apparently, something close to $3 billion.\n  The projected increase in sales in 2001 will more than offset the \nmodest decline in the Government payments and could boost cash income \nto $239.3 billion, up significantly by $9.2 billion from last year.\n  I mention all of this, Mr. President, not that these are figures that \nare likely to lead anyone to a false impression about agricultural \nprosperity but it seems to me important because this debate thus far \nhas been about a necessity of having the farm bill passed during this \ncalendar year. One of the reasons offered by some Members has been the \ngravity of the situation for many farmers. Each one of us has many such \nfarms in our States that are not working well. But the overall picture \nis important. The overall picture is one of higher net cash income.\n  I found it to be extremely important to study the USDA tables on farm \nbalance sheets. One of the factors of obvious debate that always seems \ncounterintuitive to many who listen to them is that, each year, I and \nothers have made the point that the total\n\n[[Page S12425]]\n\nvalue of farms in America has been growing. By that I mean the \nestimates of the total value of farms, the equity, after all \nliabilities, real estate debt, or any other farm debt have been \nsubtracted, is $1.36 trillion. That is up from $1.4 trillion last year.\n  In other words, the equity in farms in this country--the bottom line \nis there has been an increase of 3.2 percent. That is not unusual. \nSimply tracing back over the course of time, USDA points out that in \n1995, the net equity in farms in America was $815 billion.\n  In 1996, often cited as the high water mark in terms of farm prices \nand prosperity, farm values were $848 billion, but in 1997, this went \nto $887 billion, in 1998, to $912 billion, and in 1999, to $964 \nbillion. Last year, it went to $1.4 trillion, and this year it went to \n$1.36 trillion.\n  Throughout this time, however--Senators wish to argue the ups and \ndowns of agricultural prosperity or difficulty--the value of their \nfarms went up every single year without exception. Many have asked: How \ncan this be? I have tried to answer that question in earlier \nstatements.\n  The programs we have adopted, for better or for worse, finally add up \nto more land value. They go essentially to landowners. That is \ncapitalized in the land. They are able to borrow more on it, and they \nbecome more prosperous. The market value is higher because a stream of \npayments guaranteed by the Federal Government appears to be behind \nthose values.\n  Some, without being spoiled sports, have raised the question of \nwhether these land values have a reality to them that is solid for the \nfuture. They have not suggested a so-called bubble effect that land \nvalues, much like communication or telecommunications firms in our \neconomy in the last 2 years, simply exceeded the potential for income \nstreams that might come from them.\n  Nevertheless, it is difficult to argue that these land values, \nincreasing each year, do not have built into them certain expectations \nof Federal policies that are very generous.\n  Perhaps over the course of the next 5 years, or in the case of the \nHouse bill the next 10 years, the general public in the United States; \nthat is, taxpayers, everyone who is not a farmer, are prepared to make \nvery large transfer payments of their moneys to those who are farmers \nand to do so in such a predictable way that anyone who owns land can \nanticipate that kind of flow. It would have no relationship to whether \nor not there was an emergency. It simply is a guaranteed transfer of \npayment with the same certainty as a pension right or some other \nproperty right involved.\n  That is a judgment for Senators, Members of the House, and the \nPresident to make, and we all have our different views on this issue.\n  I have always wondered whether those who are not farmers understood \nthe transfer that was occurring and the seeming permanence of that, as \nopposed to payments that came in emergencies.\n  Senators have risen throughout this debate and condemned the farm \nbill of 1996 as a terrible failure, pointing out that it is so bad that \nwe are compelled as Senators to meet almost every summer and vote to \nsend more money to farmers.\n  With some degree of political realism, I would say the compulsion for \nus to meet every summer to do this is probably being propelled much \nmore by our own desires. To a certain degree, I have noted an amount of \npolitical competition in this--some persons purporting to be stronger \nfriends of farmers than others, all believing we ought to be able to \nhelp out by sending more money in that direction. There has been no \nreticence on the part of Senators on both sides of the aisle to vote \nthis money.\n  I predict, I think without being too far off the mark, that whatever \nkind of a farm bill we finally enact this time, there may be those \namong our number who will ask us each summer to come to the Chamber to \nvote more money, to supplement whatever it is we have done. In other \nwords, I have never found in my experience in the Senate that the issue \nis ever settled. The emergencies occur every year and in many parts of \nthe country and sometimes vary widely. Let me offer a reason why that \nis so. This is not a cynical reason. This is a reason rooted in the \nreality of my own experience.\n\n  One of the questions I frequently ask witnesses before the \nAgriculture Committee when we are having debates on programs or incomes \nis to give me an estimate of the return on invested capital that they \nobtained from their farm operation.\n  Most witnesses, even those who are fairly sophisticated, do not know. \nThey really have not thought that problem through. They say that is \nalmost irrelevant: My problem is keeping the farm alive, keeping the \ndairy operation alive. I do not know what the return on investment is; \nthe problem is paying the banker and having enough capital to buy new \nequipment to be competitive.\n  I understand that, but it illustrates part of the problem. When I \nhave had discussions with very prosperous farmers in Indiana, whom I \nrespect for their abilities and have learned a lot from them, their \nanswer to that question is usually a 3 to 5-percent return on invested \ncapital over several years. Some years it is much better, but some \nyears it is close to a wash.\n  Some suggest, of course, that depends on how leveraged the farm is. \nIf, in fact, a very valuable property has an almost equally valuable \nmortgage on it, the amount of equity that the farmer has in play is \nfairly small; therefore, any income fluctuation makes the return on \nincome either go up or down very rapidly.\n  Let us say for the sake of argument that the farm has no debt. That \nhas been essentially my case for many years, and my own experience has \nbeen roughly 4 percent on invested capital. When that figure arises in \na forum that is not a farm meeting, many people raise the question: \nThat is pretty low for a large enterprise over a long period of time. \nFor example, many people who are skeptics about this would say you \ncould have gotten a 6-percent return just by investing in U.S. Treasury \nbonds for 30 years during many recent periods. For that matter, prior \nto this lower interest rate period we are in now, you probably could \nhave bought the bonds maybe even for 7, 8, or 9 percent at different \ntimes during this decade, with absolutely no risk economically, no risk \nfrom markets drying up abroad, no risk from the weather.\n  This raises the question: Why is $1 trillion of American capital tied \nup in farms--which, indeed, it is--2 million such entities, at least \nwith the definition of $1,000 in sales?\n  The reason ultimately, in my case, as well with most people, is that \nwe like what we are doing. Frequently, it is a family tradition. That \nis my case. My dad bought the farm 70 years ago. It is something very \nimportant to me as a person. It is more than simply a business \nenterprise. But I have to recognize there are alternative things I \ncould do with the capital and probably do better than 4 percent. This 4 \npercent is anecdotal in a sense but not entirely.\n  If, in fact, as the distinguished chairman of the committee pointed \nout this morning, net farm income in this country for 2001 is 49.4 \npercent, and you factor that with a divisor of $1.36 trillion for the \nvalue of real estate and so forth, you come to something like 4.8 \npercent. Taking a look at all of American agriculture, that net was \nearned on this amount.\n\n  So my experience is not too far away from the mainstream, which is \ncomforting to know, but not for farmers generally because there is not \nmuch leeway.\n  I suggest the reason we have debates almost every year is a good \nnumber of farmers do not have any leeway. If farms that are fairly \nlarge and well managed do no better than 4 percent on average, and in \nsome years 3 percent or 2 percent, situations that are not so well \nmanaged, do not have modern equipment, the research into seeds or \nplanting processes, or have not done conservation work that has proper \ndrainage, they are going to have problems meeting it at all every year; \nthere is so little leeway.\n  Intuitively, we have known it even if we could not quantify it, and \nour policy has generally been, regardless of which farm bill I have \nbeen involved in, to save every family farmer. We have tried, in fact, \nto think through how there could be a safety net and ad hoc emergency \npayments and whatever was required. We have not succeeded, although, as \nI mentioned in an earlier debate today, we have stimulated a lot of\n\n[[Page S12426]]\n\npeople to come into farming, many of them in a small way. It is not a \nmajor income. So the numbers of farmers do not trail off as rapidly as \nthey did at the turn of the century, 100 years ago, or all the way \nthrough the 1930s. Nevertheless, the concentration into about 170,000 \nlarge farms in this country is pronounced. These farms are doing the \nmajority of the business, and about 600,000 farms in America plus or \nminus a few do about four-fifths of all we do.\n  Trying to fashion a farm policy, therefore, that fits these \nsituations, these diverse situations, is virtually impossible. At the \nsame time, we have tried--all of us have tried. The bottom line has \nbeen we have succeeded in good part, but the debate continues because \nfarms that do not make very much on invested capital are in trouble \nevery year.\n  I do not know the answer to that question. My guess is, in part, it \nis being answered by age. The average age of people who are farming \nincreases. The people who come to the distinguished occupant of the \nchair and to me, who have, say, a 30-, 40-, 50-herd dairy situation, \nsay: What are we going to do? I am 65, one farmer will say. I would \nlike to retire. I would like to get a pension or my money out of this. \nThe son who is about 40, it is very doubtful whether he wants to \ncontinue, whether there is enough for a livelihood at a middle-class \nlevel in our society, and they come to us and ask for counsel as to \nwhat to do. There is no good answer. It finally has to be a gut feeling \non the part of that farmer.\n  The farm bill on which we are about to embark, if we adopt the bill \npassed by the Senate Agriculture Committee, in my judgment, makes the \nsituation substantially worse. I do not paint this in disastrous hues. \nMy own judgment is, regardless of what we do, this will not be an \nirrevocable disaster for the country, but I think some people will get \nhurt. Among those who will get hurt are probably the small, simply \nbecause most of the payments will go to the large. The payments will be \nmuch larger than they were before, so the large will be even more \nconsolidated and confirmed in their situations. Land values will \ncontinue to increase, maybe not to a bubble situation but clearly \nrising on the basis of not much behind them.\n  The return on capital is still pretty sketchy. If one were to take a \nlook at this, such as the people at the stock market, it would be seen \nas a pretty precarious kind of investment, and based largely upon the \ngeneral mood of the public as a whole. Since this prosperity would not \nhave been based on the market necessarily but really on the basis of \nour political debate and public policy, that which is given can be \ntaken away.\n  I have no idea what the mood of the Congress will be 2 or 3 years \nfrom now, if in fact we have sustained deficits for 3 years as the \nDirector of OMB has prophesied we will. There is no farm program that \nis engraved forever. We can pass a bill that has 5 years' duration or \n10, but each Congress can amend that very substantially and change it \nmaterially and must have the right to do so on the basis of whatever \nthe crisis the country faces or its priorities then.\n  That is why I fear the idea of 5 or 10 years of very large fixed \npayments to 40 percent of farmers who are in the program as opposed to \n60 percent who are not, based on nothing more than the fact that one \nhas been a farmer in the past, whether they are farming now or not. It \nhas some problems to it. They are not being glossed over. I think \nSenators must understand what they are doing.\n  Having heard a lot of criticism about fixed payments in the past, \nthese so-called AMTA payments, I am astonished so many Senators are \nfully prepared to do more of it now really without any limitation. The \nbill I presented does have limitations. The 6 percent credit that one \nreceives on the basis of all the total whole farm income is finally \nlimited to only $30,000 a farmer. The Senate Agriculture bill we are \nnow considering could pay as much as $500,000 to a single farm entity. \nIn fairness to my chairman, Senator Harkin, who has long believed there \nwere problems in having such distortions, he readily admits in order to \nobtain a majority support in the committee, he acquiesced to those who \nwanted more. For all I know, those limits are still being raised, even \nas we speak, to accommodate the situations of particular crops.\n  This does not bode very well for the small family farm situation, or \nthe saving of everyone, or the general ethic of the bill that is often \npresented that way, or even those particular cases of distress in the \nmidst of the overall increasing prosperity I described in the overall \nreport.\n  These are concerns that have led me and others to suggest \nalternatives. In the event the debate proceeds, we will have that \nopportunity. I utilize this time of deliberate and thoughtful debate on \nthe farm bill to bring forward some of these facts and some of this \ninformation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to use up to the hour of time postcloture that I am entitled to \nand that I be allowed to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Energy Policy Act of 2002\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I joined Senator Daschle in \nintroducing the Energy Policy Act of 2002. This bill is a culmination \nof a great deal of work involving several committees in the Senate. In \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources alone, we had over 50 \nhearings in the 106th and 107th Congresses that relate to this bill.\n  The staff of the committee, particularly the majority staff, who have \nworked on drafting the legislation we introduced today, did yeoman's \nwork. I will mention the individuals who worked so hard on this: Of \ncourse, Bob Simon, who is our staff director. This list is in no \nparticular order except perhaps alphabetical, although I am not sure \nthat is exactly right. Patty Beneke worked hard on various provisions; \nJonathan Black; Shelley Brown helped us with the bill; Mike Connor; \nDeborah Estes; Sam Fowler, who was the principal draftsman on the bill; \nJennifer Michael; Leon Lowery; Shirley Neff made tremendous \ncontributions. Malini Sekhar, Vicki Thorne, John Watts, Bill Wicker, \nand Mary Katherine Ishee also made great contributions.\n  So I want to publicly state my appreciation to them for the good work \nthey did.\n  Although the bill that we introduced today is the culmination of a \ngreat deal of work, it is also in many ways just a beginning. It is a \nstarting point for the next phase of the Senate's consideration of \nenergy policy. Senator Daschle has indicated he desires for us to bring \nit up and debate this legislation and the entire subject area during \nthe first period of the next session.\n  One obvious question is why we invested so much time on this topic of \nenergy in developing this bill. There are two basic answers to that \nquestion. First, energy is central to our present and future economic \nprosperity. Any of us who lived in the last few decades of this country \nknow we depend upon foreign sources for much of our energy. Our economy \nis vitally dependent upon reasonable prices for energy.\n  Second, there has been significant changes in energy markets since \nthe last time Congress considered comprehensive energy legislation. The \nlast major energy bill we passed was the Energy Policy Act of 1992. \nSince that time, as a nation we have moved further away from command \nand control regulation of energy toward a system that relies much more \non market forces to set the price of energy. In the process, our energy \nmarkets have become more competitive, more dynamic, and there have been \nsome significant bumps in the road which we have all observed.\n  Consumers are now more vulnerable to the vagaries of energy markets \nand the volatile prices for energy. The structures to regulate these \nemerging market forces are not fully developed, as we could see very \nclearly in the last few weeks with regard to the circumstances of Enron \nCorporation.\n  Gasoline supplies nationwide have become increasingly subject to \nlocal crises and to price spikes due to the proliferation of inflexible \nlocal fuel specifications and tight capacity in refining and in \npipelines.\n  Of course, the events of September 11 have caused many of us to \nreflect on the inherent vulnerabilities of our energy transmission \nsystem. The time\n\n[[Page S12427]]\n\nmay be right for us to rethink how we site energy infrastructure, the \nbalance between central and distributed generation of power in our \nelectricity system.\n  So Congress needs to respond to these changes and challenges and \nopportunities. If we do so in a balanced and comprehensive and forward-\nlooking way, then we can develop an energy policy that will lead to a \nnew economic prosperity for the country and for the world. But we will \nnot get there simply by perpetuating the energy policy approaches of \nthe past. New ideas and approaches are needed as well as greater \ninvestment to move into the future.\n  That is what this bill we have introduced today tries to do. The bill \nhas three overarching goals. This chart specifies what those are.\n  First, we try to ensure adequate and affordable supplies of energy \nfrom a variety of sources--from renewable sources as well as from oil \nand gas and coal and nuclear. I emphasize renewables because, as I will \nindicate in a few moments, that is an area to which we have given too \nlittle attention.\n  Second, the bill improves the efficiency and productivity of our \nenergy use, including energy reliability and the productivity of our \nelectric transmission system and energy use in industry, in vehicles \nand appliances, and in buildings.\n  The third overarching goal of this legislation is to keep other \nimportant policy goals in addition to our energy policies, goals such \nas protection of the environment and global-climate-change-related \nissues--keep those goals in mind as we sort through our energy policy \nchoices.\n\n  I think we can achieve these three goals if we accelerate the \nintroduction of new technologies and if we create flexible market \nconditions that empower energy consumers so they can make choices that \nwill benefit both them and our society more generally.\n  This combination of new technology and policy innovation in pursuit \nof a diverse and robust national energy system can be seen in the \nprovisions of this bill as they relate to the first major goal. This is \nobtaining an adequate and affordable supply of energy. So let me start \nthe discussion by speaking first about this important subject of \nrenewable energy that I referred to a minute ago.\n  Our Senate bill contains numerous provisions enhancing the \ncontribution of renewable forms of energy to our future energy mix. \nUnder the ``business as usual'' approach of the House energy bill, H.R. \n4, which has been proposed at various times on the Senate floor, the \ncontribution to our energy mix from renewables will not substantially \nincrease over the next 20 years. The result will be an energy system, \nparticularly for the production of electricity, that will go from being \nabout 68 percent based on coal and natural gas to being about 80 \npercent based on those two fuels. That overdependence would leave our \ncountry very vulnerable to shortfalls in the delivery of either of \nthose commodities. Consumers would be exposed to severe risks of price \nspikes.\n  We clearly need more diversity in the ways that we produce \nelectricity in this country, not less diversity. Our overdependence \ndoes not make sense in light of the commitments to renewable energy \nthat have been made in other countries, particularly in Europe. This \nchart demonstrates that very graphically. This chart is entitled \n``Commitment to Renewable Generation.'' This is generation of \nelectricity. The percentage increase in nonhydro renewable generation \nduring the 5 years 1990-1995--a 6-year period, I guess--here you can \nsee the percentage increase. In the case of Spain, it was a little over \n300 percent. In the case of Germany, it was something over 150 \npercent--175 percent. In the case of Denmark, it was nearly 150 \npercent. Then it goes on down until you get to the United States, which \nis way down in the single digits.\n  There are countries that did less during that 5- or 6-year period \nthan we did but not many. Even France, which is often held up as a \nmodel for its commitment to nuclear power, has outpaced the United \nStates in recent years in its investment in renewable sources of \nelectricity other than nuclear power. The United States needs to lead \nthe world in renewable technologies.\n  We have abundant domestic renewable resources. The world market for \nsuch technologies is capable of strong growth in the future. Renewable \ntechnology leadership would help U.S. firms achieve a strong position \nin winning those markets and thus creating new jobs in our own country.\n  If our country is to lead the world in renewable energy technologies, \nwe need to do a better job of getting those technologies into the \nmarketplace in this country.\n  Our bill that we have introduced today would boost future use of \nrenewables in five major ways. Let me summarize those five ways.\n  First, the bill contains market incentives that would triple the \namount of electricity produced from renewable energy over the next 20 \nyears. Here is another chart that tries to show graphically where we \nare today, slightly after the year 2000, at less than 5 quadrillion \nBtus annually. This green wedge shows what we would anticipate as the \ngrowth in the production or generation of electricity from renewable \nsources between now and the year 2020 under this legislation that we \nhave introduced.\n\n  These incentives include a renewable portfolio standard that creates \na market for new renewable sources of electricity, whether they are \nwind or solar or biomass or incremental hydroelectric generation from \nexisting dams.\n  A second market incentive is the Federal purchase requirement for \nrenewables that would grow to 7.5 percent of all Federal electricity \npurchases by the year 2010. The renewable energy production incentive, \nwhich is an existing program to help rural electric co-ops and \nmunicipal utilities generate renewable energy, is also reauthorized in \nthis bill and extended to include Indian lands which contain some prime \nrenewable resources. So that is the first way in which this bill would \nmake an effort to boost our future use of renewables.\n  The second is that the bill being introduced today greatly expands \nthe contribution of renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel-\npowered vehicles and transportation. By 2005, 75 percent of the Federal \nGovernment's vehicles that can burn alternative fuels would be required \nto do so, creating more market certainty for renewable fuels and their \nassociated infrastructure.\n  By 2012, 5 billion gallons a year of renewable fuels would be blended \ninto our gasoline, decreasing our import dependence on foreign oil.\n  The third way in which the bill helps renewables contribute more to \nour energy mix is by removing existing regulatory barriers that affect \nrenewable energy. For example, wind and solar power can be effectively \ntapped by small distributed generation systems, but current practices \nand rules in the marketplace often discriminate against distributed \ngeneration. Our bill tries to deal with this problem by requiring \nelectric utilities to offer their customers net metering, in which a \ncustomer can offset his electric bill by the amount of electricity that \nhe generates and sells to that local utility.\n  The bill also requires fair transmission rules for intermittent \ngeneration such as wind and solar.\n  Finally, the bill mandates easier interconnection for distributed \nenergy production into the interstate transmission grid and requires \nStates to examine ways to facilitate that interconnection of \ndistributed energy into local electric distribution systems as well.\n  A fourth major way in which our bill promotes renewables is by \ndisseminating information about and facilitating access to areas of \nhigh resource potential, particularly on our public lands. There are \nmany places in this Nation and my State that have untapped renewable \nenergy potential. The bill creates a pilot program at the Department of \nEnergy and in the Forest Service for development of wind and solar \nenergy projects on Federal lands.\n  A fifth and final area in which the bill helps make renewable energy \na bigger part of our energy picture in the future is through enhanced \nresearch and development programs. These research and development \nprograms in our bill at the Department of Energy will grow from an \nauthorized level of $500 million in fiscal year 2003 to $733 million by \nfiscal year 2006.\n\n[[Page S12428]]\n\n  I would like to briefly talk about some of the other more traditional \nenergy supply sources in addition to renewables that we try to promote \nand encourage in this legislation.\n  Natural gas is one of those in our Nation at a crossroads major \npolicy decision with regard to energy security. U.S. natural gas demand \nis expected to increase from 23 trillion cubic feet per year. Demand is \nexpected to be about 35 trillion cubic feet per year by 2020. Much of \nthat demand is going to be driven by the use of natural gas for \nelectricity generation because, as we build more powerplants to produce \nmore electricity, virtually all of those new powerplants that are \ncoming on line--not all, but many of those new powerplants that are \ncoming on line--are expected to use natural gas.\n  As you can see from this chart, which goes from the period of 1970 \nthrough 2020, today there is more consumption of natural gas than there \nis production in the country. But it is not a very major gap. As we \nmove forward for the next 20 years, that gap grows. Our consumption of \nnatural gas is going to increase more quickly than the production of \nnatural gas is expected to increase.\n  We tried to follow the developments in this field internationally to \nunderstand what is occurring. We have a very disturbing development of \nwhich I think the Senate needs to be aware and of which our entire \ncountry needs to be aware.\n  As a result of this gap that I have pointed out on this chart, as a \nnation we are at the risk of becoming dependent upon imported natural \ngas brought to our shores in tankers for a substantial portion of the \ngas that we consume.\n  The countries on which we would rely for much of that gas are prone \nto political instability. They are in the early stages of forming an \nOPEC-like organization for natural gas exporters.\n  There is a cover story in the June 2001 issue of OPEC's Bulletin that \ndiscusses Iran hosting an inaugural meeting of the Gas Exporting \nCounties Forum.\n  As a nation, we do not want to be in the position of having to deal \nwith a cartel in natural gas in addition to the cartel we already deal \nwith related to oil.\n  Our bill takes several steps to come up with a different policy for \nnatural gas.\n\n  We increase funding for research to develop domestic natural gas \ndeposits in deepwater areas in the Gulf of Mexico and in harder to tap \ngeologic formulations on shore.\n  We provide research funds to explore the potential of methane \nhydrates that are trapped on the ocean floor at great depths.\n  The bill authorizes more funds to facilitate the permitting and \nleasing of Federal lands for natural gas production in places where \nthat is environmentally acceptable.\n  The bill addresses a number of developing problems in natural gas \nproduction, such as conflicts over coal bed methane and hydraulic \nfractures and to bring these conflicts to resolution before they reach \ncrisis proportions.\n  But even these steps, which I believe will be useful and important, \nwill not be enough to close the gap that is reflected on this chart. \nThe most significant step the bill tries to take for future natural gas \nsupply is to provide enough financial incentives so that we see the \nconstruction of a pipeline to bring down from Alaska the vast reserves \nof natural gas that have been discovered and have already been \ndeveloped in the Prudhoe Bay region.\n  The Presiding Officer and I had the opportunity to visit there \nearlier this year. The existing reserves are estimated to be over 30 \ntrillion cubic feet of gas. It is estimated that the total natural gas \nresources on the North Slope of Alaska could be in the order of 100 \ntrillion cubic feet. A natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 \nStates would provide at least 4 billion to 6 billion cubic feet of \nnatural gas per day before the end of this decade.\n  Once the pipeline is constructed, it would provide gas to American \nconsumers for at least 30 years. It would be a stabilizing force in \nnatural gas prices as well.\n  The project makes a great deal of sense. But it has not happened \nbecause there is a lack of certainty about the investment risk of \nbuilding such a major pipeline.\n  We are talking about an enormous undertaking. The pipeline would be \none of the largest construction projects ever undertaken. It would \ncreate a massive number of jobs in Alaska, in Canada, and in the lower \n48. The project would require the construction of the largest gas \ntreatment plant in the world, and the laying of about 3,600 miles of \npipe requiring 5 million to 6 million tons of steel.\n  The preliminary estimates are the cost would be in the range of $40 \nbillion. But since natural gas prices vary from $2 to $10--which we \nhave seen that just in the last 12 months--per mcf it is hard for the \nmarket to take on this challenge by itself. So we are proposing \nlegislation that would expedite the process for permitting, for \nproviding rights-of-way, and certifications that are needed for the \nU.S. segment of the pipeline.\n  The Government would step up and offer to underwrite loans for 80 \npercent of the cost of the line that is constructed within the United \nStates.\n  There are various other provisions which we think would improve the \nlikelihood that this pipeline would be built in the near future.\n  I believe it is important for the Senate to be proactive on this \nproject--not simply to sit back, cross our fingers and hope that the \nvarious companies that are looking at this decide to go ahead.\n  If we do not act while there is substantial private sector interest \nin building this pipeline, we will lose an important opportunity to \nbolster our national energy security in natural gas.\n  As a consequence, we might well be hearing speeches 10 to 20 years \nfrom now about our dependence on foreign natural gas which would sound \na lot like the speeches we have been hearing about our dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  Since I mentioned oil, let me say a few things about what we have in \nthis bill related to oil, and the ways we are trying to increase \ndomestic production of oil.\n  (Mr. DAYTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. When you hear all the rhetoric about drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge--and we have heard various speeches \nabout that in this Chamber--one would think it is the only place in the \nUnited States where we could find more oil. That is far from true. \nThere are 32 million acres of the outer continental shelf off the coast \nof Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi that have already been leased by \nthe Government to oil companies for exploration and production. They \nare shown on this map I show you by these yellow blocks.\n  There is no requirement that any legislation be passed in order for \ndrilling to occur in these areas. These are areas that have been \nleased. They can be drilled. We need to do what we can to encourage the \nactual development of those leases.\n  In addition to the production off the Gulf of Mexico, there are \noutstanding prospects for increased production from the National \nPetroleum Reserve--Alaska.\n  Again, the Presiding Officer and I had the opportunity to see the \npromise that some of the oil companies obviously felt about the \npotential production there.\n  Under the Clinton administration, the previous administration, \nleasing was expanded in this area. Industry made some major finds. \nThere is no law that needs to be passed in order for additional leasing \nto occur in that area. I, for one at least, believe that is an \nappropriate place for us to be pursuing additional oil production.\n  If the problem really is not finding areas to lease under current \nlaw, then why is there not more domestic production going on in the \nareas that are already leased for exploration and production? We need \nto look at that question. That is not a simple question to answer.\n  We need to look at the differences between our Federal and State \nroyalty and tax policies and those of other countries with oil and gas \nresources. We have provisions in this bill to try to have that analysis \ndone.\n  A second proposal to boost domestic production in the near future is \nto provide adequate funding for the Federal programs that actually \nissue new leases and new permits for oil and gas production. For all \nthe rhetoric from the administration about the need to\n\n[[Page S12429]]\n\nboost domestic production, in its last budget request, the \nadministration did not ask for adequate funding to do this work \nproperly. The result of inadequate funding for U.S. land management \nagencies is delay and frustration on the part of U.S. oil and gas \nproducers. This bill calls for increased budget levels for those \nfunctions. The Federal Government can then take the necessary steps to \nmake oil and gas leasing faster and more predictable where it is \nalready permitted.\n  The bill also contains increased research and development funding to \nsupport domestic oil and gas production by smaller companies and \nindependent producers. These entities account for the majority of on-\nshore U.S. production of oil. They do not have the resources to do \ntheir own exploration and production research and development.\n  Let me say a few words about coal. This is an important contributor \nto our current energy supply picture.\n  Fifty-nine percent of our electricity generation nationwide is based \non coal. This chart I show you is a good background chart for anyone \ninterested in how we produce electricity in this country. You can see \nthis top line is coal. That represents the 59 percent to which I just \nreferred. Fifty-nine percent of our electricity generation is based on \ncoal. We have tremendous coal resources. We have been called the \n``Saudi Arabia of coal'' by some.\n\n  But coal's place in our energy future needs to be clean and needs to \nbe emission-free. Coal-based generation, as we all know, produces more \ngreenhouse gas emissions per Btu of energy output than does natural \ngas-fired generation that I was talking about a few minutes ago. Other \npollutants from coal-fired plants have been the source of regional \ntensions between States where coal-fired plants are located and States \nthat are downwind from those plants.\n  Coal is too important a resource to write off. Technology holds a \npromise for dramatically lowering, even to zero, the emissions from \ncoal-based plants. This bill takes a very forward-looking approach to \nthe issue by authorizing a $200 million per year research and \ndevelopment demonstration program based on coal gasification, carbon \nsequestration, and related ultraclean technologies for burning coal.\n  The proposal was a result of a strong bipartisan push in our \ncommittee by Senator Evan Bayh and Senator Craig Thomas and is one more \nexample of the crucial role that research and development is going to \nplay--and needs to play--in shaping our energy future.\n  Research and development are also keys to the future of nuclear power \nin this country. Nuclear reactors emit no greenhouse gases, so on that \nbasis one would think they are an option that we should be looking at \nfor the future. But nuclear plants have other characteristics that are \nnot as attractive. They have very high up-front capital costs compared \nto other generating options. That puts them at a disadvantage in the \nmarketplace. The nuclear waste problem is not yet solved. Nuclear \nsafety is a continuing concern for many in the public. Our cadre of \nnuclear scientists and engineers is growing older and dwindling, and we \nare not seeing a large supply of students being trained to help us deal \nwith nuclear issues in the future.\n  This bill takes on these problems by focusing on research and \ndevelopment on new nuclear plant designs that might address these \nproblems and on a program to strengthen university departments of \nnuclear science and technology.\n  The bill also contains a partial reauthorization of the basic nuclear \nliability statute; that is, the Price-Anderson Act. The part that is in \nthe bill deals with liability of Department of Energy nuclear \ncontractors, including the National Laboratories that are a significant \nsource of our national nuclear expertise. The other main part of the \nPrice-Anderson Act, dealing with the commercial nuclear power industry, \nis being developed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works and \nis expected to be offered by them as an amendment when we get to the \nfloor consideration of the bill.\n  Hydropower is another source of energy supply that this bill \naddresses related to electricity generation. Many hydroelectric \nfacilities are reaching the age at which their original licenses under \nthe Federal Power Act are about to expire. The process of relicensing \nthese facilities needs to be protective of the environment, predictable \nfor licensees, and efficient in the way it is administered.\n  We have been working for months with both the hydropower industry and \nthe environmental groups to develop a consensus on how to achieve these \ngoals. There is strong bipartisan interest in moving in that direction. \nWe are committed to working toward this end. We have worked with \nSenator Craig extensively on this issue. We look forward to continuing \nthat communication and hope that by the time this bill comes to debate \non the floor we have a consensus on that issue.\n\n  A final way in which the bill focuses on increasing the supply of \ndomestic energy is through a series of provisions facilitating the \ndevelopment of energy resources on Indian lands. Let me say that is an \nimportant new area we are trying to put some emphasis on in the bill.\n  The second of the major overarching goals that I mentioned at the \nbeginning of my comments was this need to use energy supplies more \nefficiently and productively. So far, we have talked about how to \nincrease supplies of energy through renewables, through oil, gas, coal, \nhydroelectric, and nuclear.\n  Let me refer now to parts of the bill that deal with this second \noverarching goal: how to use energy supplies more productively and \nefficiently.\n  As I have mentioned consistently throughout the past year, you cannot \nhave a sound energy policy based only on production or only on \nconservation. We need to focus on both. Our energy policy needs to \ncombine programs that boost supplies with programs that use those \nsupplies more efficiently.\n  The first major way in which we can use our energy supply more \nefficiently is by having an electricity transmission system that is \nready for the challenges of the next century. Electricity is essential \nto our modern way of life, yet our electric system largely operates on \na design that is nearly a century old.\n  We have vulnerabilities in our current system. We just excerpted some \nof the headlines from national newspapers, and I have put those up here \non a chart to remind people of what we were hearing in the news and on \ntelevision earlier this year.\n  Let me just read a few of these: ``Electricity crisis: The Grinch \nthat stole Christmas.'' That was last Christmas.\n  ``Happy holidays. Now turn off that Christmas tree.'' That was last \nChristmas.\n  ``California declares power emergency.'' ``Blackout threat remains as \nCalifornia scrambles.'' ``California power woes affect entire west \ncoast.'' ``Energy chief moves to avert California blackouts.'' \n``Utilities seek immediate rate hike to avoid bankruptcy.'' Those are \nthe types of headlines we were seeing at the end of last year and early \nthis year.\n\n  We need to address the issue of electricity generation and \ntransmission. The central challenge we face with electricity is to have \ntwo elements: First, to have market institutions that ensure reliable \nand affordable supplies of electricity and, second, to have policies \nthat favor future investments in new technologies that give consumers \nreal choices over their energy use. We have provisions in this bill to \ndo just that.\n  I could go through those provisions in detail. Since I notice there \nare others wishing to speak, I will skip over some of these and move on \nto the highlights of the rest of the bill.\n  A second way in which we need to increase efficiency in the various \nuses of energy is in the fuel efficiency of vehicles. The bill contains \ntwo provisions in that regard: One that mandates higher fuel efficiency \nin the vehicles purchased by the Federal Government for civilian use, \nand a second that provides a framework for the Department of Energy to \nassist States in expanding scrappage programs to get old fuel \ninefficient vehicles off the roads. This is cash for clunkers, as it \nhas been referred to by some.\n  I know Alan Binder has spoken eloquently about how important he \nthinks it is that we pursue that course both for our energy future and \nas a way to get cash into the hands of people to stimulate the economy \nat this point.\n  Let me move to one other chart to make the point that we do need to \ndeal\n\n[[Page S12430]]\n\nwith this issue of transportation, if we are going to begin to deal \nwith total oil demand in the country. This is a chart that shows U.S. \noil consumption in millions of barrels per day. It goes from the year \n1950 to the year 2020. This line, which is here at 2000, sort of shows \nwhere we are today. You can see that the total oil demand has been \nincreasing and is expected to keep increasing. Total transportation \ndemand has been increasing and is expected to keep increasing.\n  Domestic oil production has been declining since about 1970. That is \nnot going to change. Domestic oil production is going to continue to \ndecline.\n  We can affect it. Domestic oil production, if ANWR is opened, will be \naffected. It will increase it somewhat. That is reflected with this \nlittle red line. But when you look at what are the steps that can be \ntaken that will have a major impact on this total oil demand, this top \nnumber, you can see that doing something about transportation demand is \nby far the largest action that we can take.\n  The Commerce Committee is having a hearing tomorrow on this very \nissue. They are intending to develop a proposal to bring to the Senate \nas an amendment to this bill to indicate a change in the requirements, \nthe corporate average fuel efficiency requirements, the CAFE standards, \nfuel efficiency standards, and I look forward to seeing what they \npropose. I do believe it is important we take serious steps in this \nregard. The House-passed bill did not do that.\n  We as a Nation have to come to grips with this issue. The technology \nis there. This is not something we have to go out and speculate on as \nto whether the technology could be developed that will get us better \nfuel efficiency. We all know Senator Bennett, our good friend from \nUtah, has a hybrid electric vehicle he parks right out here at the \nSenate steps. I complimented him on it. I asked him yesterday: What \nkind of fuel efficiency do you get on that car? He said: 53 miles per \ngallon in town. Now, that is a clear signal to me that the technology \nis there. We can produce more efficient vehicles. We should do that. We \nshould provide incentives for people to use those.\n\n  There are other steps. The Federal Government can do a much better \njob of increasing efficiency in the energy it uses. We have included \nvarious provisions to encourage that. Industrial energy efficiency can \nbe dramatically improved. We have various provisions to encourage that. \nCommercial and consumer products can be much more efficient than they \nare, and we have provisions in the bill to encourage that.\n  There is a new generation lighting initiative in this bill which I \nbelieve is a major step in the right direction. We are still using \nincandescent light bulbs, just as Thomas Edison taught us. There is no \nreason why we can't be using much more advanced technology which is \nmuch more efficient. About 25 percent of the power that goes into most \nlighting fixtures actually winds up being translated into light. The \nrest goes off in heat. We can do much better than that. This next \ngeneration lighting initiative we believe will help U.S. industry to \nmeet that challenge and help our country to benefit from the \ndevelopment of those new technologies.\n  We also have a provision for substantially increasing the effort for \nenergy efficiency assistance programs. This is the LIHEAP program, the \nLow-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Many people depend upon that \nas we get into the winter months. You do not know it today by the \ntemperature outside, but there are cold days coming. In the winter, \nthis is an extremely important program. And also in the summer, when \nair conditioning is needed, this is an extremely important program for \nmany of our citizens. We propose increases there.\n  A third and final overarching goal of the bill is to balance energy \npolicy with other important societal considerations. Energy production \nand use comes associated with a host of consequences for the \nenvironment. We need to strike the right balance among energy, the \nenvironment, and the economy. That balance is what we are sent to \nWashington to try to find. This bill addresses the issues in a number \nof ways. Several provisions of the bill deal with the legacy of past \nproblems posed by energy production and use for the environment.\n  We have major provisions to focus the attention of the country and \nthe Government on dealing with the issue of global climate change, a \nproposal Senators Byrd and Stevens made earlier this year that has been \nconsidered in the Governmental Affairs Committee, setting up an office \nto look at global climate change to come up with a policy and \ncoordinate our governmental response to that issue. That is a proposal \nthe bulk of which we have included in this legislation.\n  That is a very important part of the bill. I have said from the \nbeginning of the discussion about an energy bill that we needed to have \none that integrated energy policy with climate change policy, and we \nhave tried very hard to do that.\n  We also have provisions in the bill to reconcile energy policy with \nthe needs we have for security of our energy infrastructure. The events \nof September 11 have caused us to think about potential security \nvulnerabilities of the energy infrastructure. This is an area where \nthere is a considerable amount of work that has been done, but more \nneeds to be done. We have provisions to focus on the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, to direct the administration to fill the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. We also have provisions related to security of other \nparts of our energy infrastructure.\n  Let me say a couple of words about why we have not included a \nprovision in this bill to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to \ndrilling. If you take all of the discussion about energy policy that \nhas occurred in the Chamber over the last 10 or 11 months, you would \nthink that this was the centerpiece, this is the main thing the country \nneeds to be doing to solve its energy problems. I dissent from that \nview. I do not believe this is the centerpiece of our energy policy. \nThis is a case of the tail wagging the dog.\n  I do believe that opening the wildlife refuge for drilling is not an \nessential or substantial part of solving our national energy needs in \nthe future. As you can see from this chart, it does increase production \ndomestically. It does not increase it to such an extent that our \nproblems of growing dependence on foreign sources of oil are solved.\n  That debate is one that I am sure we will have, and we have had it \nalready many times in the Senate Chamber. We will have an opportunity \nto have it again when this bill comes up, and each Senator has a \nstrongly held view on the subject.\n  Let me put up one final chart and then I will conclude. Earlier this \nyear, President Bush appointed a task force and asked Vice President \nCheney to head the task force and work up a so-called energy plan for \nthe country, look at our long-term energy needs. Although that plan was \nseverely criticized by some, I thought there were some constructive \nsuggestions in it. I didn't agree with everything in it, but I thought \nthere were constructive sections in it.\n  The administration recommended that the Congress act in 10 different \npolicy areas. We have those on this chart. They range from electricity, \nto energy tax incentives, expedited Alaska gas pipeline construction, \nand on down through the list. The House-passed legislation, H.R. 4, \nwhich has been proposed here at various times on the Senate floor, \naddresses 5 of the 10 key areas that the administration proposed that \nwe address.\n  The legislation we are introducing today addresses 9 of the 10 key \nissue areas. I am not saying the administration embraces every aspect \nof what we proposed in each of these nine areas, but in many respects \nwe do believe we are making recommendations that are consistent with \nthat energy plan that was earlier issued by the administration. We \nbelieve these issues should not be partisan. We believe there is a \ngreat deal of common ground that we can find on energy issues. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues on the Democratic side and the \nRepublican side in identifying ways this bill can be improved, if there \nare suggestions out there. The bill is there for anyone to study and to \nsuggest improvements. I think, in many ways, having it available for \nthat kind of scrutiny over the next weeks, until we get into the new \nsession after the first of the year, will be very good and will help us \nproduce a better product for the American people.\n\n[[Page S12431]]\n\n  I see this as a project that, hopefully, will set the course for our \nenergy policy in this country perhaps for another decade, for some \nperiod. It was 1992 when we passed the last major energy bill in the \nCongress and had it signed into law. There is no reason to believe we \nare likely to try comprehensive energy legislation in the near term \nagain. I hope very much that we can seriously consider this legislation \nin the new session of the Congress in February, as Senator Daschle has \nindicated, and that we can pass a bill on a bipartisan basis and go to \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a couple \nquestions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield to my colleague from North Dakota. I \ncompliment him on the very major contributions he made in the \ndevelopment of this bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. As a member of the Energy Committee, I am pleased to work \nwith Senator Bingaman. He has done an extraordinary job. We have had \nmany Members of the Senate come to the floor of the Senate talking \nabout the urgency of having a new energy policy. I agree with that \nurgency and that the policy should be new, and I agree it ought to be a \nbalanced, comprehensive policy. The other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, wrote an energy bill that I classified as kind of a \ndig-and-drill bill that is not changing anything very much. It is just \ntrying to produce more of that which we have been using. This \nlegislation enhances production of oil, natural gas, and coal in an \nenvironmentally acceptable way. We agree with that proposition. But it \nis also the case that we believe much more needs to be done.\n\n  I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico would describe again the \ncomponents, other than enhanced production, which we have in this \ncomprehensive plan--the components of conservation, efficiency, and \nrenewable energy, which I think are so important to a balanced energy \nplan. I wonder if the Senator from New Mexico would especially talk \nabout conservation because I think that is a significant portion of any \nenergy policy that would work in the long term for this country.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Well, I am glad to briefly describe again the main \nthings we are trying to do in the conservation area and increased \nefficiency area. We are trying to increase efficiency in all aspects of \nhow we use energy--in appliances, residential construction, commercial \nconstruction, and increased efficiency with the Federal Government and \nState governments and schools, school buses, automobiles, and SUVs, and \nthe whole range of places where we use energy in our society, in our \neconomy. We are trying to say we can be much more efficient in the use \nof energy we produce. There is a great opportunity there.\n  When the President came out with his energy plan, and the Vice \nPresident came out with his plan, it had one statistic that was \nreferred to repeatedly, and that is that we are going to have to build \n1,300 new power generation plants in the next 20 years. Well, that is \nnot our analysis. We don't believe that is the case. We think if we \ntake some prudent steps to improve efficiency in conservation, we \nclearly will need new generation in the next 20 years, but not anything \nlike the new generation to which the Vice President has referred.\n  So I think there is a great opportunity here. As the Senator from \nNorth Dakota says, we have tried very hard to balance the two--balance \nincreased production with increased efficiency, and move us down the \nroad in a way that is acceptable to the environment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New Mexico, the chairman, will remember \nthat at a hearing we held with the Department of Energy, I asked the \nDeputy Secretary what our goals and aspirations were for the next 25 \nand 50 years, and what kind of energy plan do we have for 50 years from \nnow? What do we aspire to do? What kind of national objectives do we \nhave with respect to supply, and what kind of energy? The answer was, \nwe are going to have to get back to you on that, because they don't \nhave plans 25 and 50 years from now.\n  The reason I asked the questions, the Senator will recall, is when we \ndebate, for example, Social Security, everybody talks about what will \nthe balance be in the account 30 years from now or 50 years from now. \nWhen we talk about energy, nobody is thinking ahead.\n  That is the point of the bill that has been introduced today. I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of it. This bill says you have to have balance \nhere and, yes, you have to produce more. But if that is all you do, is \nproduce more natural gas, oil, and coal, then you are consigned to a \npolicy that I call yesterday-forever. Yesterday-forever as an energy \npolicy for this country is shortsighted and foolish. The legislation \nbeing introduced today under the leadership of the chairman of the \ncommittee is balanced. It includes production, yes, but significant \nconservation. Conserving a barrel of oil is the same as producing a \nbarrel of oil, along with significant efficiencies and significant new \nemphasis on limitless energy and renewable energy.\n\n  I drove a car on the grounds of this Capitol Building that was run by \na fuel cell. There are new technologies, new approaches, new kinds of \nfuel that are limitless and renewable year after year that we also \nought to embrace. Federal policy ought to be the lead in embracing that \nas a matter of public interest in this country.\n  So let me again say to the Senator from New Mexico, it has been more \nthan a decade since we have had a comprehensive policy change in energy \nin this country, one that is thoughtful and balanced and really \nprovides initiative to move us in the direction that would be \nproductive for this country. I think the Senator has provided \nleadership on a draft of something that is very comprehensive and \nremarkably refreshing, as compared to what the other body did. I think \nthe other body is saying what we did yesterday, let's do more of \ntomorrow. That is not a very thoughtful policy. Let's do a lot of good \nthings that work to move us in a new direction to meet our energy \nneeds.\n  Again, I asked if he would yield for a question, and I guess I could \nask a question, but I did want to say to him that this is good policy. \nIt is not the case that the long-term energy needs of this country will \nbe served in a very comprehensive way if we are able to pass this bill \nas-is tonight. We won't do that. But does the Senator not believe that \nthis will really advance this country's energy policy in a significant \nway?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Obviously, I believe it would advance the interests of \nthe country in a very substantial way. I appreciate very much the \ncomments of the Senator from North Dakota. Again, I want to just \nacknowledge and compliment him on the great contributions he made to \nthe development of this legislation. We have many of his ideas that are \ncentral to this legislation.\n  We look forward to the scrutiny by the rest of our colleagues in the \nSenate, and I hope very much when this bill comes up for consideration \nthat we will have a good bipartisan vote in favor of it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see there are other Senators \nwishing to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, before the Senator from New Mexico \nleaves the floor, I wish to thank him for his leadership on the issue \nof energy policy for this Nation and thank him for the way he has \nworked with me and Senator Breaux representing Louisiana, which is a \nproducing State but also a State that is very interested in alternative \nenergy sources, particularly from agricultural products, which we think \nholds a lot of promise.\n  Many of our universities are engaged in alternative fuel \ndevelopments, as well as environmental cleanup. I thank the Senator \nparticularly for his willingness to put in this bill significant \nauthorization for the first time for $450 million for the seven \nproducing States, much of that production being off our coastline. \nBecause of current law, which has been in place for many years, as the \nSenator knows, Louisiana and other coastal States have been \nshortchanged because of the impacts that affect our States.\n  We will be able to use this money to help restore our wetlands which \nwe are losing at an alarming rate. It will help\n\n[[Page S12432]]\n\nus to provide the critical investments to protect our infrastructure--\nour pipelines and other facilities--that not only helps Louisiana but \nsupports the whole Nation, which the Senator from New Mexico mentioned.\n  I thank the Senator on behalf of all the people of Louisiana and many \npeople in the coastal parts of our Nation for his insight and \nleadership in including that provisions.\n  I wanted to go on record this afternoon about this bill and to thank \nthe Senator from New Mexico. There are a number of other good \nprovisions in this bill.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, may I respond briefly to the comments? \nThe Senator from Louisiana has been a tireless and very effective \nadvocate for her State and for coastal regions generally in this \nregard.\n  There are substantial impacts that oil and gas development in \nparticular have had on those regions. We have tried in this legislation \nto include a provision at her urging that will help provide resources \nto deal with those impacts. I think it is good legislation. It will be \ngood public policy.\n  I thank her for her many other contributions to this legislation as \nwell. She is a very valued member of our committee and has made great \ncontributions to various provisions in the bill since the beginning of \nconsideration of it. I thank her very much.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                        National Adoption Month\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I want to speak to the Senate for a \nfew minutes on a different subject, but one that is equally important \nand deserves our attention and focus.\n  I had hoped to get to the Chamber last week when it was actually \nNovember to speak about this subject because November is National \nAdoption Month. I want to spend a few minutes talking about what that \nmeans to us as a nation and what adoption has meant and continues to \nmean and will mean in the future to so many of our families in the \nUnited States and around the world.\n  I also want to talk about all the great successes and celebrations \nfor us to be proud in a bipartisan way. This truly has been one of the \nissues on which there is unanimous consent and a truly deep commitment \non the part of both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party.\n  I want to spend a few minutes, even though it is December 5, because \nthe schedule was so hectic in the last week, talking about what \nNational Adoption Month means.\n  Since 1993--so it has been almost 10 years--by Presidential \nproclamation, the 30 days in November have been declared to be a \nspecial recognition of National Adoption Month. During this month, \ncommunities, States, and local governments, not-for-profit \norganizations and adoptive families come together from the east coast, \nthe west coast, the north, and the south to sponsor activities and \nevents to help raise the awareness of the joys of adoption.\n  My husband and I do not have to attend any of these events \nnecessarily because we live with this joy every day. Our two children \nare adopted. They are now 4 and 9 years old. It has been the greatest \njoy of our life. I know the specific stories of hundreds of families. I \nhave held these children in my arms. I have read to them. I have played \nwith them. I have seen them in so many different settings and at so \nmany different ages and in many different physical, emotional, and \nmental health states; some very healthy, other children with great \nchallenges that God has given them who now have loving parents and the \ngreat opportunities these children now have in homes where they can be \nprovided and cared for.\n  We do not have to go far to these events, but I never tire speaking \nabout it with our colleagues and sharing the importance of it and how \nproud we are of our success. We recommit our efforts in the month of \nNovember to make the way easier, to reduce the barriers that still \nexist, to recommit our energies to the fact that it should be a God-\ngiven right, I believe, and one that we should support for every child \nto have a family.\n  God did not create human beings to raise themselves. It just is not \npossible to do that. Every human being needs to be raised by another \nhuman being in a very loving and nurturing way.\n  For many years, unfortunately, we have had this idea that governments \ncan raise children. Governments cannot raise children; families raise \nchildren. Or that some children are damaged goods and they can just \nraise themselves. No child is damaged goods. Or that children in some \nway can wake themselves up in the morning even at 3, 4, 5 years old, \nget themselves dressed, get themselves off to school, feed themselves, \ncare for themselves, protect themselves. It does not happen without a \nnurturing adult.\n  Our idea is to talk about the fact that every child deserves a family \non which they can count, a family with at least one loving adult, if \nnot two, who will love them, nurture them, protect them, raise them, \nand give them the opportunities to which they are entitled. We \nrecognize that while we have a lot of successes, we have a long way to \ngo.\n\n  Let me share just a few successes. Last year, in 2000, nearly 50,000 \nchildren were adopted out of foster care, a record number. That success \nis built squarely on the shoulders of what President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore, and now what President Bush and Vice President Cheney, \nhave committed, which is to help invest resources and help write \npolicies and laws that promote adoption in this Nation.\n  This represents a 78-percent increase over 1996. There are not many \nprograms run by the Federal Government, the State governments, or, for \nthat matter, private-sector initiatives or enterprises that can boast \nof a 78-percent increase. We are proud of our work at the Federal level \nworking with our State governments and, in many instances, faith-based \norganizations and nonprofits promoting adoption.\n  Second, because of the work this Senate did, we passed the first \ninternational treaty on adoption last year called the Hague Treaty, \nwhich is now being ratified and signed by many nations in the world. I \nspecifically thank Senators Helms and Biden for their extraordinary \nleadership.\n  While many of the children who are adopted in the United States are \nborn in the United States and then come to families through a domestic \nsystem, a growing number of children are coming into this country from \nother countries, such as China, Russia, countries in South America, and \ncountries in the Mideast.\n  As this treaty is adopted and embraced by many countries, we are \nhoping the world--some developed nations, some underdeveloped nations, \nsome nations that are Christian in their outlook, some that have other \nreligious leanings--say with one voice: We believe the world community \nhas a responsibility to see that every child in this world has a home. \nWe wish that every child could stay with the parent to which they were \nborn. That is our greatest hope. We wish we could fix every problem \nthat a family has so those children can be raised in that home into \nwhich they were born.\n  There are terrible circumstances. There is alcoholism, drug \naddiction. There is abuse and neglect and mental illness and war and \nfamine that separate children from their birth parents. So we cannot \nleave those children. We cannot say to them: Raise yourself. We have to \nhave international laws in place and policies in place that help to \nheal that, to give those children, if they cannot stay with their own \nparent, to be able to have some kind of family to call their own.\n  I cannot imagine living without having a mother or a father, someone \nto pick up the phone, even at my age, at any age, to be able to not \nhave someone you can rely on to give you a reference point and \nstability in your life.\n  Without this Hague treaty we passed, there are millions and millions \nof children who will never find a home. Our great hope is this treaty \nwill be implemented with all haste. The State Department is, \nunfortunately, quite busy with the war effort now, but as soon as it \ncan give its attention, Secretary Powell has assured me he is going to \nprovide the resources necessary to the State Department to get this new \nsystem set up. I think it would be welcomed around the world.\n  The third success we have had, and on which we continue to work, is \nan adoption tax credit. If we can give tax credits to some major \ncorporations in this world worth millions and hundreds of millions of \ndollars, we can most certainly provide tax credits to families\n\n[[Page S12433]]\n\nwho are not wealthy, who live paycheck to paycheck, whose paychecks \nmight be small but their hearts are large, who have loving homes and \nthey want to take a child in.\n  It is very expensive to raise a child. So the $10,000 tax credit we \ncan give by doubling the current tax credit and making it permanent \nwill say the Government believes if a private citizen or a family takes \na child in through adoption, they are entitled to have some of those \nexpenses written off and we thank them for the contribution they are \nmaking to that child's life and we thank them as taxpayers because the \ntaxpayers have to pick up the tab for the raising of that child at \nhigher rates of reimbursement, sometimes as much as $100 a day for \nemergency placement or extraordinary fees paid through government \nagencies. So we are saving ourselves money.\n  The Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, was wonderful when he spoke about \nthis. When I said the scoring mechanism made us say this tax credit \nwould cost the taxpayers money, he and I entered into a colloquy and we \nrejected that notion, although technically we were not successful in \nthat, by saying for every dollar we give out in a tax credit, it \nprobably saves $10 to the taxpayer because these children come off the \npublic roll, come into the loving arms of a family willing to spend the \ntime and basically put sweat equity into the raising of this child, and \nwe are forever grateful. Our tax credit is passed and we now need to \nmake it work for foster care children.\n  Additionally, the Presidential candidates in this last election, I \nthink for the first time--in my lifetime for pretty certain, and maybe \nin the history of the country--made adoption a central component of \ntheir Presidential platform. So this issue is gaining in strength and \nis becoming part of the American psyche and conscience, and we are very \ngrateful for that success.\n  Secondly, while we are very excited and passionate about these \nsuccesses, we also have a great challenge ahead of us. There are still \ntoday 570,000 children in foster care in the Nation, more than half a \nmillion children. These are children who have been taken away from \ntheir birth parents for many good reasons. Hopefully, many of them will \nreturn to their birth parents in an atmosphere of safety and security, \nbut the parental rights of some of these children must be terminated \nbecause they are at risk, their life is at risk, unfortunately. There \nare about 130,000 of these children of all ages and shapes and sizes \nand colors who are waiting to be adopted today.\n\n  I want to share in a couple of weeks from now that we are going to \nhost a major national event in New Orleans. We are pleased to host this \nevent. We are excited about hosting it. I am going to be there, along \nwith my senior Senator from Louisiana, at the Super Bowl. We are going \nto be in a stadium. It is called the Dome Stadium. We are proud of it. \nIt is one of the finest stadiums in America. Eighty-five thousand \npeople can fit into this stadium, and there is going to be a record \ncrowd for that event. There will probably even be a few people standing \nin the aisles.\n  The only thing that would make it better is if the Saints were \nplaying in the playoffs and the championship. Maybe that will happen. \nAnyway, this event is going to take place. When it does, I want people \nto hear this message and my colleagues to think about the fact there \nare more children waiting to be adopted in the United States than could \nfit in every seat in the Dome Stadium, in the aisles, and crowding \naround the concessions.\n  So when my colleagues see that panoramic, beautiful view of the Dome \nStadium, I want them to think about the fact that in every seat there \ncould be a child saying: All I want is a mother or a father or a family \nto call my own. I am alone in the world. I need someone to help me.\n  I want to show some pictures and tell some stories of two of these \n130,000 children. This is Joshua and Tiffany. They are twins. They are \nfraternal twins. They are 5 years old. They are beautiful children. \nThey were born premature, as many millions of children are born \npremature, some extremely so. They have some developmental delays, but \nthey are generally healthy children. Their favorite cartoons are Barney \nand Teletubbies. I understand 5-year-olds. I have Mary Shannon who \nwatches not too much television but enough to know who Barney and \nTeletubbies are.\n  They say in their bio their favorite snacks are cookies and they love \nice cream, but what they really want is a mother and a father to adopt \nthem. They are available for adoption. They would love a family. These \nchildren are born healthy and they would be two of the children sitting \nin those seats in the Dome Stadium. I hope somebody will want to take \nthem in. The government has to do a better job of connecting these \nchildren to the waiting families who are out there, and I think we are \non the track to do that.\n  Let me show another picture. This is a precious little girl, as are \nthese two. Her name is Cheyenne. She is from Louisiana. Cheyenne is 6 \nyears old. She was born in 1995. She is bright and charming. She wants \nto be part of a family. She has beautiful blue eyes. They say in her \nbio she is a little shy, but if I did not have parents, I might be a \nlittle shy, too, because it is your mother and your father who help you \nto learn how to communicate, learn how to talk to people.\n  She enjoys active sports. She does not have a family. So if we could \nbe a little more enthusiastic and committed to helping in terms of all \nthe things we are doing, we can help Cheyenne find a family perhaps in \nLouisiana.\n  I see my colleague from Arkansas who has done some beautiful work in \nthis area, as well as my colleague from Virginia.\n  If we can find a family for Cheyenne so she has somebody to count on \nand depend on, that is what this is all about.\n  One of the things we are working on--and, again, there are 160 \nmembers of our coalition on adoption; that number is growing--one of \nthe projects we hope to have funded this year is an extension of what \nwe call Faces of Adoption. It is an Internet site. Anyone can log on \nthe Internet at www.adopt.org. This site is funded by the Government in \npartnership with all of our State agencies, with a nonprofit \norganization out of Philadelphia, the National Adoption Foundation, \nwhich has been sort of the lead nonprofit. I thank the President for \nputting money in his budget so by the year 2005, if we fund it, we will \nhave pictures and information about every child waiting, like Cheyenne, \nlike the twins, like the other children, some of whom are perfectly \nhealthy, some of whom have challenges. There is not one who would not \nbe wanted by some family in this country.\n  I am very excited about new technologies that can help connect these \nchildren to families. We say there are no unwanted children, there are \njust unfound families. We should thank the Lord for the new \ntechnologies that enable us to tell these children's stories to \nfamilies and to say that while everybody thinks they want to adopt an \ninfant, and it is wonderful to adopt infants--and we did that in our \nsituation--there are children of every age, every race, every \nbackground who could fit beautifully into a family.\n  I want to share one of the other great successes with my colleagues. \nIt is called Angels in Adoption. So many in the Senate, and I think so \nmany of the people in my State and around the Nation, are angels \nbecause they do help to find homes for children and take children into \ntheir homes. We call them angels. I don't know if the camera can show \nmy angel pin was designed by an artist in Louisiana, Mignon Faget. We \ngive this pin to the Members of Congress and to our award winners in \nour States. I will talk about Angels in Adoption.\n  We were scheduled to do this event on September 11. It was planned a \nyear ahead of time. We had thousands of people in Washington that night \nfor this event. We were going to present these awards to these people. \nI see my colleague from Idaho; he was going to be cohosting the event \non September 11 with me. Of course, we know what happened on September \n11. I spend just a moment to say what would have been said that day, \nbut events prevented going forward with the event.\n  For the record, let me cite some of the people who would have \nreceived the angels award. The idea is for every Member of Congress to \nfind one person in their district--it could be a parent who adopted a \nchild; it could be a judge\n\n[[Page S12434]]\n\nwho works overtime and gets into the office early or stays late or \ntakes a couple of cases extra to help make sure that child gets the \nhome they deserve; it could be a local attorney who does it pro bono \nbut really believes in adoption so he or she gives their time; it could \nbe a church that has taken this as a special mission in their \ncommunity. The Members of Congress give out these awards I cite for the \nrecord.\n  My award would have been given to Volunteers of America in north \nLouisiana, a nonprofit that has placed 2,500 children in homes in \nLouisiana and actually some in Arkansas and in our surrounding region. \nThe reason I decided to give my award to the volunteers was that their \nboard created a video which I saw. I was very moved. It was a story of \na birth mother and father, a young couple who just were not quite \nready, didn't have the resources or the maturity to raise a child. They \nmade a courageous, selfless, and loving decision to give their child to \na family who was desperately wanting a child, to provide a home. That \nvideo was so moving and would be such a good example for so many young \npeople to see, I thought they should be given an award so we could \ndistribute that video to communities around the country.\n\n  Second, Representative Jim McCrery from Louisiana would have given \nhis award to Lillie Gallagher who is an angel in the outfield in Baton \nRouge, LA. She is director of St. Elizabeth's, a foundation that was \ncreated because an individual--a man--went on a retreat. He believes in \nprayer. God gave him a vision to create an agency. He did it with his \nown money and his friends. That agency, without government support, has \nhelped place hundreds of children. Lillie contributes tremendously as \nthe original founder and director of that agency. So she was presented \nan award. This is just an example.\n  Senator John Breaux would have presented his award to Linda Woods, a \nbirth mother and an adoption advocate in Louisiana. She has been active \non many boards and commissions. Linda is an Angel in Adoption.\n  And finally, one of my favorites, although it wasn't my award, was \nthe award given by the Congressman from my State, Chris John from \nLafayette, to Kaaren Hebert. I want to talk a minute about Kaaren \nbecause she is an angel whom I hope others emulate. Kaaren is a young \nwoman. She works for the State of Louisiana. She is a government \nemployee. She is fabulous. She worked in a small parish in Louisiana \nand was so recognized for her work that she was awarded and given a \npromotion to be a regional director. So she moved up to be the regional \ndirector in Lafayette, which is in south Louisiana. It is a beautiful \ncity. About 250,000 to 350,000 people live in the region. Kaaren, under \nher leadership, had in 1997 35 adoptions in that region. In 1998, there \nwere 43 completed adoptions. In 1999, there were 66 completed. Under \nher leadership, she has placed over 459 children out of the Louisiana \nfoster care system into homes in Louisiana. Some of them were placed \nout of State.\n  If every government worker did the job that Kaaren did--just 85 \npercent of her work, not 100 percent--I would estimate there wouldn't \nbe any children waiting in this country, if everyone were as \nconscientious and as gung ho and as wonderful as Kaaren. She most \ncertainly deserved an award, and she got it, although not publicly \nbecause of what happened that day.\n  I wanted to share a few of the angel stories. But there are \nremarkable stories from every place in the Nation. We hope the press \nwill write about the stories so it will encourage other people to join \nin and help.\n  Finally, several Saturdays ago was National Adoption Day. On that \nday, 1,000 adoptions were finalized in capitals all across the Nation \nbecause the judges and family courts have decided to come together and \ntry to promote adoption on one day.\n  Finally, I end by thanking my colleagues for their work, \nacknowledging my wonderful partner, Larry Craig, a Senator from Idaho, \nas we cochair the adoption caucus in the Senate, and I thank the \nSenator from Arkansas, the Senator from Virginia, and the Senator from \nIndiana for their good work and say as we celebrated Thanksgiving last \nweek and as we celebrate Christmas, let us recommit ourselves to the \nidea that these celebrations aren't really worth having, if you think \nabout it, if you don't have a family with whom to celebrate. Nothing, \nto me, would be sadder than to have no place to go on Thanksgiving or \nChristmas. I guess because I come from such a large and loving family, \nthe thought of it is so alien to me, I cannot quite grasp it. But I \nknow there are in this world millions of children who not only have no \nplace to go on Thanksgiving and Christmas, but they have no place to go \nany day. They put themselves to bed and sleep at night by themselves. I \nhope we will remember them. Think about their pictures, like Cheyenne. \nThink about so many of them who just need our people and every \ngovernment official in this Nation, at the Federal, State, and local \nlevel, to do more than we do, including myself. I recommit myself to do \nthis work even harder during this next year.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work in this area and I yield the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I wish to commend my distinguished \ncolleague from Louisiana. I have been privileged to serve here many \nyears in the Senate. In the 23 years I have been here I do not know of \na single Senator who has ever taken the depth of interest and time and \ncommitment to this ever growing, important subject in our land.\n  This is not politics. This is not partisanship. This is plainly, \nsimply trying to help those who, for many reasons, are less fortunate \nthan ourselves. I commend the distinguished colleague from Louisiana.\n  Madam President, I would like to address the Senate briefly on the \nquestion of the agriculture bill. The distinguished Senator from \nIndiana is managing this bill from our side. He and I have been \ndiscussing an issue with regard to the peanut section of the bill.\n  Throughout my career here in the Senate, I have worked with those \nSenators from the areas in which peanuts have been grown and hopefully \nwill grow in the years to come. We have always been able to reach a \nmeeting of the minds to try to provide, not a tremendous profit, but a \nreasonable profit for the arduous work of growing peanuts.\n  In my lifetime I had the opportunity to own and operate several \nfarms. In many years we had a small peanut patch. It is not easy to \ngrow those peanuts. It requires a lot of manual labor. There is a \nconstant battle with disease. Now we see a bill before the Senate, \nindeed one was before the House, which fractures the coalition of \nStates that for so many years have joined together to ensure that our \nrespective peanut growers have a fair share, an opportunity to have the \nbenefits provided by law for those who toil in the most respected \nprofession of agriculture.\n  Somehow that fracture, in my judgment, seems to hurt Virginia very \nseverely. Virginia prides itself in growing a specialty peanut. Small \nfamily farms in rural areas. I have always enjoyed traveling through \nthose areas. You see the old silos, the old barns, in many parts of the \nState the old farm machinery. But they are very proud of their \noperations, whether it is a half acre or 500 acres--whatever it may be. \nOftentimes, generations pass down to future generations the various \nplots of ground on which these peanuts have been grown through the \nyears.\n  We recognize that as things have changed in this country, more and \nmore we try to establish agriculture on its own two feet, independent \nfrom subsidization. We have done our best to preserve the ability of \nthese families to continue to raise peanuts.\n  Virginia, again, grows a specialty peanut. There is not a Member of \nthis Chamber who has not at sometime enjoyed that rather large peanut. \nIt is anywhere from about three-eights an inch up to a little bigger \nthan a half-inch. It is quite white after it is finally processed for \nconsumption.\n  By and large, the specialty peanut is served in dishes and bowls \nwhere it can be seen. It is such an excellent peanut. But it is costly \nto grow this peanut. It has such extraordinary quality it really is not \neconomical, in many ways, for them to break it up and put it into candy \nand cover it with chocolate. Very little goes into peanut butter. \nBecause of the quality and flavor, and indeed the visual aspects of \nthis peanut are so wonderful that it is served on\n\n[[Page S12435]]\n\nthe family table, particularly at festive times of the year. At \nChristmas, I would bet half the tables in America will have the \nquality-type peanut grown in this segment of our country, primarily \nVirginia, some in North Carolina, some in the other States.\n  Farmers in Virginia are the ones who are, in terms of the numbers of \nfarmers in it, perhaps the most concentrated in this specialty peanut. \nThis legislation, unfortunately, leaves them behind--and I think \nunfairly. That is the principal thrust of my comments--fairness. I want \nto see that our farmers are treated as fair as the other peanut \nfarmers, and that they get a fair return for this particular peanut.\n  These rural areas are suffering from a loss of jobs. Young people are \nmoving on to other areas of our State and elsewhere seeking jobs. If we \ndo not correct this inequity with regard to the production of these \nspecialty peanuts in Virginia, these rural areas are going to suffer an \neconomic loss, one that on the horizon we do not see a recovery to \nprovide the jobs that will be lost in this peanut industry if this bill \nis passed as it now stands goes through.\n  The particular farm bill on which farmers all across our country are \noperating today does not expire until next September. Yet, for some \nreason, those who drew up this peanut provision said once the \nPresidential signature is affixed to this piece of legislation and it \nbecomes the law of the land, the programs under which our peanut \nfarmers have operated since the 1930s are gone. And such support as \nthey receive, really what we call the no-net-cost-to-the-Federal-\ntaxpayer-program, is gone.\n  At a minimum, it would seem you would allow the peanut farmers in \nVirginia and elsewhere to finish out this growing cycle, a cycle that \nstarted first with the decision of the various farmers not to go for \nanother crop, go to their bank, make their commitments for financial \nresources, and begin to till the ground and put the necessary \nfertilizer and other nutrients in that soil to raise next year's crop. \nNow all of a sudden, bang--the program stops. That is not the type of \nfairness our Congress wants to inflict on this very small number of \nfarmers.\n  I will urge and continue to work with the managers of this bill in \nhopes that, at a minimum, we can have such effective date of the \nlegislation to enable the farmers to continue this growing cycle under \nthe existing farm bill until it expires next September.\n  I thank my colleague, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nAllen, who spoke on this earlier.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      COMMENDING SENATOR LANDRIEU\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, before I begin my remarks I would, as \nthe distinguished Senator from Virginia did, compliment my colleague \nfrom Louisiana who has tirelessly involved herself with the issue of \nadoption, making it more acceptable, more reasonable, and easier to \nwork through in this Nation. She has done a fabulous job. She has \nprovided leadership and compassion in this area, and I have been \ndelighted to work with her, to learn from her, and to share in the \nexperiences that she can bring back to us in this body to help us, in \nthis great Nation, improve the laws of the land that can reach out to \nthe smallest of our constituents to make their quality of life just \nthat much better, providing a loving home and the support they need.\n  I wanted to compliment her on her work and encourage her as she has \nrededicated herself today. I, too, rededicate myself to the issue of \nadoption and working with our States and families across this Nation \nand other legislators to improve the approach this government takes on \nadoption, and to making it a much easier, simpler and encouraging \nprocess.\n  Madam President, I rise today to add my voice to those in support of \nthis year's farm bill, and to encourage my colleagues to join me in \nbringing this bill to the floor as quickly as we can.\n  For the last 5 years, our farmers have worked to make ends meet under \nincredibly difficult circumstances. As prices for equipment, \nfertilizer, energy costs, and other inputs have skyrocketed, the \nreturns have plummeted. Every year they have harvested their crops \nwithout knowing if they will be able to afford to plant another crop in \nthe next growing season.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, I opposed the 1996 \nFreedom to Farm bill because it did not provide adequate support for \nour farmers. It provided flexibility, and it provided policy--but \npolicy that was dependent on other areas of government for which we did \nnot have the wherewithal to provide the support.\n  Since that bill passed, farmers in Arkansas and around the country \nhave been in limbo every year waiting for Congress to pass emergency \nspending bills because the existing farm policy was absolutely \ninadequate. The United States has the safest, most abundant and \naffordable food supply in the entire world. But if we are going to \nensure that safety and abundance, we must invest in our farmers and \nrural communities, and we must do it immediately.\n  We desperately need a farm bill to provide a dependable safety net \nthat ensures not only the financial viability of our farmers but also \nthe viability of local bankers, merchants, and other rural and small \ntown institutions that depend on a safe farm economy.\n  We need a farm bill that will improve and stabilize farm income by \ncontinuing fixed income payments and creating a countercyclical income \nprotection system.\n\n  We need a farm bill that creates new conservation incentives and \nincreases acreage for existing programs, such as the CRP, our \nConservation Reserve Program; the WRP, the Wetlands Reserve Program; \nthe Equip Program; and many other proven programs that allow us to take \nmarginal lands out of production to use our own resources in our \nfarming operations to be better stewards of the land, and to be more \nproductive in our production.\n  Rural communities across the Nation will see the benefits of a new \nfarm bill.\n  As we move forward, we need a farm bill that will spur rural \ndevelopment and expand broad-band access to our rural communities so \nthey, too, can compete in this global economy, and so our producers can \naccess the very Government programs that we want to provide them.\n  As we have tried to minimize Government in bringing it down and \nmaking it more efficient, we are dependent on technology. Yet many of \nour rural communities can't access the very technologies we are \nexpecting them to use for the programs that the Government provides \ntheir producers.\n  We need to increase funding to land-grant colleges. And we \ndesperately need to improve nutrition and food aid programs, energy \nconservation programs, and forestry initiatives.\n  We need a comprehensive package for our farm economy and for rural \nAmerica. We have produced a good, solid, comprehensive package out of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  This past year, I begged my Senate colleagues to focus on our \ndesperate need for new agriculture policy in this country.\n  This past year, I have also urged my colleagues on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee to work hard together to deliver a new farm bill \nthis year--something on which producers can depend, something with \nwhich they can go to the financial institution to ask them for the \nability to put next year's crop in the ground.\n  It is time for us to make that happen, and we can. In these few short \ndays that we have left, we can bring about good, comprehensive, \nconstructive agriculture policy that will help the producers of this \ncountry and that will allow them to continue to be the producers of the \nsafest, most affordable and abundant food supply in the world.\n  But it is going to take us coming together, working hard, and \nfocusing on what we need to complete before we break for the holiday.\n  I am proud to stand up today for American farmers. I am proud to \nstand up before my colleagues and beg them to come together and bring \nabout a comprehensive policy that will allow the agricultural producers \nof my State and other States across this country once again to go back \nto doing what they do best; that is, producing that safe and abundant \nfood supply in a way that they can be assured their Government is \nproviding them the safety net they need to be competitive with other \nfarmers, and particularly other governments across the globe.\n\n[[Page S12436]]\n\n  As we look at the export assistance numbers across the globe, we can \nsee that the European Union is consuming about 80-plus percent of the \nexport subsidies worldwide. Our farmers are not competing with other \nfarmers. They are competing with other governments, and it is now time \nfor our Government to stand and say we are going to provide the safety \nnet, and we are going to provide the Government assistance in working \nwith our agricultural producers so they, too, can be competitive.\n  Today, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a farm policy \nthat works for working farmers--a farm policy that we can conference \nwith the House and get a good, solid, comprehensive bill to the desk of \nthe President so we can once again have good, solid, agricultural \npolicy on behalf of the many hard working men and women on family farms \ntoday and across this Nation.\n\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                           Expiration of ATPA\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I am here this evening with a tinge of \nsadness. At midnight last night, one of the most important and \nsuccessful efforts in the United States to build better relations with \nour neighbors in Latin America expired. After 10 years of successful \nservice to the United States and the four countries of the Andean \nregion--Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia--the Andean Trade \nPreference Act expired of its own accord last night, and the Congress \nhas not allocated the time necessary for its extension.\n  This landmark trade agreement, which was passed in 1991, has helped \nthe United States and these four countries to develop legitimate, \nstrong, expanding commercial ties, and it has contributed substantially \nto the goal of stabilizing the economies and political systems of these \nfour countries by encouraging a diversification of their economies.\n  To look backwards, in the last full year before the Andean Trade \nPreference Act was passed, the United States imported $12.7 billion \nfrom these four Andean countries, primarily in traditional agricultural \ncommodities such as coffee and bananas.\n  In the year 2000, the United States imported $28.5 billion from these \ncountries--a 125-percent increase. Much of this increase was in new and \nfrequently nontraditional areas of economic activity for these four \ncountries.\n  To mention one example, the cut-flower industry hardly existed in \nterms of its imports into the United States prior to the Andean Trade \nPreference Act. In 1991, the year before ATPA took effect, the United \nStates imported $220 million in flowers from the four Andean countries. \nIn the year 2000, the United States had more than doubled that amount \nto over $440 million worth in flowers.\n  The flower industry is particularly important because it is a very \nstrong job generator. I have been told that, on average, for every \nhectare of land that is committed to flower production in the Andean \nregion, there are between 5 and 10 persons employed to work those \nflowers and to bring them into full blossom and ready to be exported \nnot only to the United States but increasingly to the world.\n  The United States has also been a significant direct beneficiary in \nthat we have substantially increased our exports to the Andean region. \nOver the last 8 years, those exports have grown by 65 percent, to a \ntotal of $6.3 billion in 1999.\n  As one visits the Andean region, they are struck by the prevalence of \nU.S. products--everything from the yellow diesel equipment, \nCaterpillar, to telecommunications equipment made in the United States.\n  Given the clear value this program has had for the United States and \nour four neighbors in the Andean region, it is a sad commentary that \nafter 10 years of success we have allowed this program to expire. It \nalso ought to be a strong motivation for us to say we shall not \nconclude this session of Congress without extending this program and \nexpanding the program so that it will yield even greater benefits to \nthe United States and to our Andean neighbors.\n  I filed legislation in the last Congress and again in this one which \nhas that objective. I am pleased to report that the Senate Finance \nCommittee, last week, reported favorably the legislation which will \nextend and expand the Andean Trade Preference Act. The House of \nRepresentatives has already adopted a similar piece of legislation. I \nhope in the next few days the Senate will do likewise, and we can move \nquickly to resolve differences between the two Houses and send this \nlegislation on to the President to be signed.\n  I also am very hopeful we will make this legislation retroactive to \nmidnight of last night so there will not be a hiatus in the benefits \nwhich have been available for a decade.\n  Why is all of this important to the United States beyond the amount \nof direct economic benefit? It is important to the United States \nbecause the United States has a stake in what happens in this region of \nthe world--a region that is so close to us.\n  If we are serious about halting the flow of illegal drugs into the \nUnited States, we must be concerned about the Andean region because \nover 80 percent of the cocaine that comes into the United States, and \nan increasing proportion of the heroin that comes into the United \nStates, comes from this region. If we are interested in building strong \ndemocratic capitalist institutions, we should be concerned about this \nregion.\n  Colombia has had one of the longest democracies in South America. It \nhas been a role model to other countries in the hemisphere. But \nColombia, as well as its neighbors, has faced unusually stressful and \nchallenging situations over the last decade. The Andean Trade \nPreference Act has been a source of stability in a region which has \nfrequently been in turmoil. If we are steadfast in our war against \nterrorism, then we must be concerned with what is happening in the \nAndean region.\n\n  Some of the most violent terrorists in the world are in our own \nhemisphere. The guerrillas and drug traffickers who are waging war on \ncivil society in Colombia are some of the most vicious in the world. \nWhat many Americans fail to recognize is that the largest single source \nof terrorist attacks against Americans in the world is in the country \nof Colombia.\n  In the year 2000, over 40 percent of the incidents of terrorist \nattacks against U.S. citizens and U.S. interests were in the country of \nColombia. Unfortunately, that violence in Colombia is spilling over to \nits neighbors, especially Ecuador.\n  I am concerned that we have already taken a step back from our \ncommitment which the Congress made just a year ago through Plan \nColombia, a commitment that was to galvanize the international \ncommunity with Colombia in a major effort at rolling back drug \ntrafficking, guerrillas, and terrorism. One year later, we in the \nSenate, by a 22-percent margin, have cut the funding for the Andean \nRegional Initiative.\n  I hope before we vote on the foreign operations conference report the \nnegotiations between the Senate and the House will result in a \nsignificant restoration of those funds not only because the dollars are \nneeded in order to accomplish their important objectives but also \nbecause of the symbol that those dollars represent in terms of our \ncommitment to a long-term war against terrorism.\n  The Senate must act rapidly on this legislation so the people of this \nregion will have confidence in our reliability as a neighbor and \npartner and that they will have incentives to develop legitimate \neconomic alternatives to the production of drugs and other illicit \nactivity.\n  It has been estimated that in Colombia alone, if we were to be fully \nsuccessful in our efforts to rid that country of the scourge of drug \nproduction and trafficking, some 400,000 Colombians would be without a \nlivelihood. It is important that we be a partner not only in the \neradication of drugs but also in the provision of legitimate, lawful \nemployment to replace those 400,000 illicit jobs.\n  I would point to the fact that the legislation I hope we will soon be \nconsidering is not just a replication of that which passed in 1991. \nThere have been significant changes in the political and economic \nlandscape of the Andean region since that initial enactment.\n  To mention one of the most significant of those changes was last \nyear's\n\n[[Page S12437]]\n\npassage by the Congress of the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act of \n2000. This was important to the Andean region because it changed the \ncompetitive playing field between the Andean region and the Caribbean \nBasin.\n  The 2000 legislation--the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act--gave \nto the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, which \nparticipate in the Caribbean Basin Initiative, parity with the benefits \nthat had earlier been offered to Mexico under the North American Free \nTrade Act. The effect of this has been to change the competitive \nposition between the Caribbean Basin and the Andean Trade Pact.\n  In one of the most critical areas, which is apparel assembly, today \nmost apparel in the Caribbean Basin will come into the United States \nduty-free, while the Andean region will still be paying, on average, a \n14-percent duty for the same assembled items. There have been fears \nthat that differential--zero from the Caribbean; 14 percent from the \nAndean region--could result in as much as 100,000 jobs lost in Colombia \nalone, lesser amounts in the other three Andean trade countries.\n  That would go in exactly the opposite direction of what we should be \ndoing in terms of encouraging more legitimate jobs in the region as an \nalternative to the licit jobs in the drug trade. We are seeing the \neffects of that 14-percent differential. In May and August of this \nyear, imports of apparel from Andean trade countries declined 6 percent \nover the same period just a year ago. Through that same period, imports \nfrom the CBI countries have increased over $47 million. We are already \nbeginning to see some relocation of industrial activity out of the \nAndean region into the Caribbean.\n  I was the sponsor of the Caribbean Basin legislation in 2000 and have \nlong been a supporter of our relations with that region of the world. \nWe must not continue to help one region at the expense of the other. We \nmust have a trade, economic, and foreign policy perspective that treats \nall of our neighbors with respect and equality.\n  I would like to point out that there is not only a past and a future \nin the United States relationship with the Andean trade region, but \nthere is also going to be a past, a present, and a future. That future \nis that it is critical that we prepare for the year 2005.\n  What is the significance of the year 2005? The significance is that \nin the major area of job creation and promotion that we can influence \nin this region, which is primarily in the apparel assembly area, we are \ngoing to lose the protections we have had over the recent past.\n  A little background: For much of the past several decades, there has \nbeen an international agreement called the multifiber agreement. That \nagreement has restricted the number of specific apparel items which any \nindividual country can ship into the United States. Under that \nagreement, for instance, the country of China is limited as to the \nnumber of shirts and blouses and other items it can import. Those \nnumbers are substantially below what its capacity to produce is.\n  Because of that, the differential in the cost of production between \nMexico and the Caribbean and the Andean region and the Far East has \nbeen kept within tolerable limits. The concern is that as soon as that \nmultifiber agreement lapses, which will occur in the year 2005, there \nwill be the potential that the United States will be swamped with \napparel products from Asia with which our neighbors in Mexico and the \nCaribbean and the Andean region cannot compete.\n  Therefore, the next few years are critical in our urgency of \ndeveloping a more efficient and productive industry and a partnership \nbetween the U.S. textile capability, because virtually all of those \nassembled items are assembled from U.S.-grown fiber and U.S.-spun \ntextiles, which are then assembled in either Mexico or the Caribbean or \nthe Andean region. We must make that partnership of American textiles \nand near-neighbor assembly sufficiently efficient that it can survive \nin a post-2005 economic environment.\n  We need to start that process as rapidly as possible in all areas. We \nhave already done it with Mexico and the Caribbean. Now we must turn \nour attention to the Andean region.\n  One final point: Our office is receiving calls from a wide variety of \nbusinesses, both in the United States and in Latin America, complaining \nthat they will be subject to increased duties starting today, December \n5. Many of these companies deal with perishable goods, including cut \nflowers and vegetables, that cannot be held for days or weeks while \nCongress deliberates.\n  I would like to make it clear again that it is my intention and hope \nto work to assure that the current ATPA benefits will be retroactive \nfrom the date of enactment of any legislation to midnight of last \nnight. That would mean that any duties collected in the coming days by \nthe Customs Service would be refundable.\n\n  We recognize that the confusion and inconvenience this situation will \ncreate will result in some dislocations and some abrasions between our \ncountry and these four good neighbors. I wish it could have been \navoided. What we can do today is commit that we will make this period \nas short as possible and we will make it as painless as possible to all \ninvolved.\n  The old cliche is ``trade, not aid.'' That is not a cliche but a \ntruth that has worked in the Andean region to our benefit and to the \nbenefit of our four neighboring countries. The United States has been a \npowerful beacon for open markets and strong free trade and a capitalist \neconomic system as a fundamental foundation under democracies. Now it \nis our challenge to rebuild that foundation in a deeper and expanded \nform for our relationship with these four neighbors in the Andean \nregion. I hope we will get about that business of foundation building \nas soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I appreciate very much the words of the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida. I share his feelings completely. We \nhad the privilege in the Foreign Relations Committee of having a \nmeeting with the President of Bolivia just this morning. President \nRamirez is in Washington to meet with President Bush tomorrow.\n  Obviously, the President of Bolivia, an extraordinarily talented \nperson, a great leader in South America, expressed very considerable \nanxiety over the end of the Andean free trade situation. Bolivia has \ntaken extraordinary steps against the drug trade at great cost but with \ngreat effectiveness. Our foreign policy really depends upon the support \nof extraordinary leaders such as the President of Bolivia.\n  The words of the Senator from Florida are timely, and his leadership \non this issue really has been exemplary. I congratulate him and look \nforward to working with him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Health Care and New York Disaster Needs\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity and thank \nthe distinguished ranking member on the Agriculture Committee for the \nchance to come to the floor and speak about a matter of great concern \nand urgency to my State. I also commend the Senator from Indiana and \nthe chairman of the Agriculture Committee for their very hard and \ndiligent work on the bill we are considering.\n  I turn our attention, as I have on numerous occasions over the past \nweeks, to the situation in the State of New York following the attacks \non September 11 and the extraordinary damage inflicted on the \ninfrastructure, on the economy, and most especially on the lives of New \nYorkers.\n  I commend Senator Byrd and the Appropriations Committee for the \nextraordinary job they have done in marking up the fiscal year 2002 \nDefense appropriations bill which addresses not only the pressing \nnational security and defense needs of our Nation but also marks a \nsignificant step forward in addressing our homeland defense needs, as \nwell as the specific needs related to the cleanup, rebuilding, and \nrevitalization of the city of New York.\n  Just days after the horrific attack on September 11, just over 12 \nweeks ago, President Bush told a joint session of Congress: We will \nrebuild New York\n\n[[Page S12438]]\n\nCity. The President's Budget Director weeks later said: The President's \npledge of $20 billion is an absolute guarantee, and it is likely to be \nmore.\n  We have collected quotations from other leaders. It is very \ngratifying to me that Senator Byrd and the Appropriations Committee \nhave moved forward to fulfill the promises and commitments made to the \npeople of New York. I personally thank and commend Senator Byrd for \nbalancing the needs of our country with the need to be prepared in the \nface of terrorism, to rebuild the financial capital of the world, New \nYork City, and to be fiscally responsible--understanding if we don't \nget our economy going, if we don't proceed, it will cost more later. I \nalso thank the Appropriations Committee staff, especially Terry Sauvain \nand Chuck Kieffer and Paul Carliner on Senator Mikulski's staff who \nhave given my staff and myself so much assistance in the weeks since \nSeptember 11.\n  The bill reported out of committee is just the first step. As we go \nto the floor, which could be as early as tomorrow, I hope my colleagues \nunderstand and appreciate we are fighting a war on two fronts. We have \nto fully fund the important defense needs of our Nation, and we have to \nfully fund, beginning with the Appropriations recommendations, the \nhomeland security needs and New York City's needs.\n  I will speak today particularly about the health care needs of New \nYorkers and Americans in the aftermath of this disaster. The essential \nservices that hospitals and health care workers provided throughout the \nWorld Trade Center disaster demonstrate how much we depend upon our \nhealth care system all the time, but particularly in a time of need. \nNew York's hospitals and hospital workers pitched in heroically during \nthe emergency, not only on the day of September 11 but on the days and \nweeks following. They worked around the clock. They operated on backup \npower systems, without phones and other utilities. Health care workers \njeopardized their own lives to be at their stations. Hospital personnel \nprovided supportive services to community members and hospitals that \nwere right there at ground zero. St. Vincent's and NYU Downtown not \nonly cared for the injured but provided meals for rescue workers, took \nmeals to elderly residents who were trapped in their apartments. They \nserved as the backbone of the care and support system we relied on \nduring this crisis while suffering their own structural damage. NYU, \nfor example, lost its data center, and therefore its billing capacity. \nIn effect, that was a fitting metaphor for how these hospitals \noperated: According to their mission, not their bottom line. They did \nnot begrudge the costs of clearing hospital beds. They did not count \nthe costs of bringing staff in on highest alert on overtime pay. They \ndid not stand at the door of the emergency room asking to see people's \ninsurance cards and sending them to a line to get their applications \nfilled out.\n\n  They incurred security expenses. They depleted stockpiles of \nemergency supplies, pharmaceuticals, and blood. They provided disaster \ncounseling services as well as emergency food, housing, and \ntransportation. They also incurred expenses on emergency \ntelecommunications and backup generators. When they ran out, they had \nto purchase and rent equipment. They had to set up an emergency morgue. \nThey incurred so many extraordinary costs, and it is in part to \nalleviate some of those costs that we have a special provision in the \nappropriations for hospital costs that were incurred during this \ndisaster.\n  But the disaster has had a devastating impact, not only on providers \nbut on health coverage as well. One of the most unfortunate \nconsequences of the disaster, combined with the economic downturn, has \nbeen the impact on workers. Many workers in New York City saw their \njobs just vanish in the rubble of the collapsed towers. Thousands more \nthroughout the city and State lost their jobs because of the \naftershocks of the disaster. Then it spread out around our country.\n  The unemployment rate nationally has gone up half of 1 percent--\nfaster in 1 month than at any point in the last 20 years. In New York \nCity, of course, the problem is exacerbated. In the span of 1 month, \nunemployment rose 1.3 percent, more than twice the national rate.\n  This is a picture of a recent job fair. Here you see people \nscrambling for their livelihoods, for their families' economic \nsurvival, but with limited opportunities in a recessionary economy.\n  The headline from the San Antonio Express News, October 18:\n\n       New York job fair sends thousands away; Arena isn't big \n     enough for crowd.\n\n  The New York Department of Labor has estimated that 250,000 New \nYorkers will be out of work by year's end. Based on what we know about \nthe rates of health insurance among the jobless, the majority will lose \ntheir health insurance.\n  While some may be able to rely on Medicaid, estimates show that \n100,000 of these displaced workers will end up uninsured. This is true \nacross the country. We know that more than two out of five Americans \nwho lose their jobs lose health care as well. That inflicts a double \nblow. It is my hope that in the coming days we can address some of \nthese pressing economic and health care needs, not only for New Yorkers \nbut for all Americans, first through supplemental appropriations, then \nthrough the stimulus package.\n  The proposed Senate economic stimulus package reported to the Senate \nfloor would provide additional help for displaced workers who are \neligible for COBRA continuation but cannot afford to use up over half \nof their unemployment check each month just for health insurance. The \nproposal would cover 75 percent of the cost of COBRA, making it \naffordable for far more unemployed families. This would mean we would \nsee that approximately 457,000 temporary unemployed workers and their \nfamilies would be covered. Currently the COBRA premiums, which average \nover $7,700 for families in New York, are unaffordable without some \nadditional help.\n  But we also know that many workers in small businesses are not COBRA \neligible. In New York, 25 percent of workers are employed by small \nbusinesses not covered by COBRA. The stimulus proposal addresses that \ngap by offering health coverage through a temporary State Medicaid \noption with an enhanced match to encourage States to provide the \ncoverage.\n\n  We will see not only an effect on individuals and their families but \nalso on State budgets. States expect to see an additional 4 million \nindividuals added to their Medicaid rolls. The number of children on \nMedicaid could rise as much as 11.3 percent.\n  Here you see on this chart the steady growth in Medicaid enrollments \nas unemployment rates grow. At a time when States are already reeling \nfrom reduced revenues, many of our States will not have the resources \nto meet this increased need. We already have heard troubling stories \nfrom our States. Tennessee is proposing to eliminate coverage for \n180,000 Medicaid beneficiaries. Washington is considering cuts of 10 \npercent to 15 percent. California is talking about budget cuts of up to \n$1 billion in Medicaid. Florida may eliminate coverage of adults with \ncatastrophic health care costs. And Indiana has appropriated $140 \nmillion less than is projected will be needed for Medicaid in that \nState alone.\n  So just when we have unemployment going up, revenues going down, many \nmore people being thrown into the ranks of the unemployed, unable to \nkeep their insurance, when we have 2.6 million more children having to \nrely on this safety net program, the States are in an impossible \nposition, and it is a vicious circle because if they cannot provide at \nleast some Medicaid funding, many hospitals will be forced to provide \nservices the best they can, increasing their costs which will not be \nreimbursed. And we are into that vicious cycle where uncompensated \ncosts create downward pressures on institutions such as hospitals that \nhave to cut services even for the insured and have to turn away the \nuninsured.\n  Many States are going to be in that difficult position. I hope we are \ngoing to provide at least some temporary support through increased \nmatching funds to help Governors be able to deal with the increasing \nhealth care costs.\n  I know in the State of New York we came up with a quite creative \napproach by creating something called the Disaster Relief Medicaid \nProgram. It cut through all the bureaucratic redtape, cut the \napplication process which\n\n[[Page S12439]]\n\nmany of us have been complaining about for years--cut it down to one \npage, allowed many needy people to skip over all those bureaucratic \nhurdles to be able to be eligible for Medicaid. It has been a lifesaver \nfor a lot of our New York families.\n  We will not be able to continue that without some additional help. I \nthink, actually, this program is a very good model we ought to look at \nin the future when we try to think of some permanent ways to provide \nmore Medicaid assistance. But certainly this streamlined post-crisis \nprocess really did a tremendous job filling a breach that would have \notherwise caused a tremendous amount of backlog and uninsured people \nnot being given the health care they deserve to have.\n  Yesterday, Congressman Peter King from New York, along with some \nHouse colleagues, introduced legislation on the House side to hold \nStates harmless if they were slated for what is called an FMAP \ndecrease--in other words, the match they get from the Federal \nGovernment--and provide an additional two point increase to all States, \nwith an additional 2.5 percent available to States with unemployment \nrates higher than the average across States nationwide.\n  I think this is a good short-term solution. It is also a good \nstimulus, if you can get money into the hands of people who need to \nspend it, as people who have health care needs have to spend it. But it \nis the right thing to do as well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the kind of cobbled together approach \nthat would give COBRA premium subsidies, would provide an increase in \nthe FMAP, at least temporarily, to help out our States that are facing \nsuch revenue shortfalls, provide a Medicaid option for non-COBRA-\neligible workers which will be not only important for our States and \nfor our economy and our health care system but absolutely essential to \nso many of the workers who, since September 11, have been not only out \nof work but out of health insurance as well.\n  I thank my colleague, the ranking member of the Agriculture \nCommittee, for his indulgence, in being able to address this critical \nissue that will come before us sometime in the next few days. I \nappreciate greatly the attention that can be paid to making sure we \nprovide the kind of health care support that is needed at this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12 noon, \nThursday, December 6, the motion to proceed to S. 1731, the farm bill, \nbe agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; that \nthe Senate then proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 254, H.R. \n3338, the Department of Defense appropriations bill, provided, further \nthat no amendments be in order to S. 1731 prior to Tuesday, December \n11.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of the bill, Senators \nHarkin and Lugar, are two of the prizes we have in the Senate. The \ndebate has been very civil, and they really look forward to going back \nto this bill. Debate on the bill should be one of the better debates we \nhave had this year. I hope everyone who has concerns will get their \namendments ready so we can finish this bill before the end of the year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the \nSenator for working out this agreement and for getting us to cloture on \nthis bill so we can proceed to the farm bill.\n  As my good friend from Nevada knows, people in rural America need \nthis bill. They need it now.\n  The Presiding Officer also knows that his farmers in Georgia, and \nespecially farmers around the South, are going to have to go to their \nbanks pretty soon after the first of the year to get loans ready for \nplanting their crops. Their bank is going to say: What are you looking \nat? What are you going to have next year? They will not know. Many \nfarmers will be right behind them in about February and March. They \nwill be going to their banks.\n\n  That is why it is so important to get this farm bill finished. As I \nsaid earlier today, and I say to my good friend from Nevada, right now \nwe are facing over 54 percent less net farm income today than we had in \n1995. We can't afford to wait any longer. We have a good bill. It is a \nbalanced bill. We have worked out all of our agreements.\n  This is a good bill for all Americans. It is a good bill for farmers \nall over this country. It is a good bill for people who live in our \nsmall towns and communities.\n  I want to personally thank my good friend from Nevada, the assistant \nmajority leader, for all of his help in getting this bill to the floor \nand for making sure we get this bill finished before we go home for \nChristmas. We are going to do that. We are going to finish this bill. \nWe are going to have it out of here, and we are going to let the \nfarmers of America know what they can count on for next year.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader asked me to also \nannounce that when we go to the Defense appropriations bill, we are \ngoing to complete it this week. He will certainly have more to say \nabout this tomorrow. But this is something we have to do. People who \nserve in the Senate want to be out of here by a week from Friday, and \nwe have to finish this bill so it can be taken to conference over the \nweekend and the conference report brought back prior to next Friday. I \nhope everyone will understand that.\n  As he said--I am speaking for the majority leader--we may have to \nwork through the weekend. But if people have any hope of getting out of \nhere by next Friday, they are going to have to really work with us and \nmove this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12439-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12439-S12443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination: \nCalendar No. 532; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, any statements thereon be printed in \nthe Record, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination was considered and confirmed as follows:\n\n\n                   executive office of the president\n\n       John P. Walters, of Michigan, to be Director of National \n     Drug Control Policy.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, all of us have a strong desire to confront \nand conquer the scourge of drug abuse and the ways it ravages American \nlives, especially young American lives. The debate on how best to \nprevail in this struggle is well under way in communities and at \nkitchen tables across the nation. The President's nomination of John \nWalters to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy has been the \nmost recent catalyst for this debate.\n  I voted against Mr. Walters' nomination in committee. In light of \nthat, I would like to share some of my concerns about Mr. Walters in \nthe hope that he will take them to heart, and that he will greatly \nexceed my expectations and the expectations of the other Senators who \nvoted against him in committee.\n  I believe Mr. Walters was the wrong choice for this job, and that his \nsharply partisan approach to drug policy issues provides an imperfect \nfit for an era of growing bipartisan consensus about drugs. Indeed, his \nideological bent is a hindrance when our efforts to prevent drug abuse \ncall for cooperation and pragmatism. Until his confirmation hearings, \nmost of the little he had said and written about drug treatment was \ndeeply skeptical. He has focused primarily on the need to reduce the \nsupply of drugs, too rarely focusing on the neglected demand side of \nthe drug equation. He has also dismissed concerns about the racial \nimpact of our\n\n[[Page S12440]]\n\ncurrent drug policies and the utility of mandatory minimum sentences. \nIn short, Mr. Walters' public record does not inspire confidence in \nthose of us who think Congress has occasionally made the wrong \ndecisions in our attempts to prevent drug abuse.\n  I do not doubt Mr. Walters' intellect or the depth of his concern \nabout our nation's drug problems. I simply believe that he is not the \nbest person to coordinate our anti-drug efforts. We all agree that the \nfight against drug abuse is vitally important. We disagree only in the \nmethods we choose to achieve our shared goal of a drug-free America.\n  We have worked hard on the Judiciary Committee to ensure a speedy and \nfair hearing for the Bush administration's executive branch nominees. \nWithin days of the Senate's reorganization this summer and my becoming \nchairman, I noticed a hearing on Asa Hutchinson's nomination to head \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration. After we had the hearing, I \nexpedited the process to provide a quick committee vote, and then \nworked to secure a vote on the floor so that Mr. Hutchinson's \nnomination could be approved before the August recess. I similarly \nexpedited the process for the nominations of Robert Mueller to head the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation and of James Ziglar to head the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, among others.\n  I scheduled John Walters' nomination hearing for the first full week \nfollowing our August recess. That hearing was set for the morning of \nSeptember 11, and was, of course, postponed as a result of the \nterrorist attacks in New York and near Washington. I made every effort \nto reschedule the hearing as soon as possible, consistent with our \nobligations to consider the anti-terrorism legislation that the \nAdministration proposed shortly after the attacks. I believed strongly \nthat drug abuse was still a vital problem for this nation and that we \nneeded to continue to pay attention to our domestic priorities even as \nwe engaged in our necessary response to terrorism. The committee \nconsidered the nomination on October 10.\n  After that hearing, the work of the Judiciary Committee was made more \ndifficult by the anthrax concerns that led to the closing of the Senate \noffice buildings and the displacement of Members and their staffs. \nConsidering these delays, and the controversy that Mr. Walters \nengendered, I think it is a tribute to the committee that we voted on \nhis nomination as quickly as we did, within a month of his confirmation \nhearing.\n  Law enforcements is and will remain indispensable in reducing drug \nabuse. Indeed, we all agree that we must severely punish those who \ntraffic in and sell drugs. More than anyone, however, law enforcement \nofficers know that improving drug treatment and taking other measures \nto reduce the demand for drugs will greatly assist their efforts. The \nWhite House also understands this. President Bush has said that ``[t]he \nmost effective way to reduce the supply of drugs in America is to \nreduce the demand for drugs in America,'' and has promised that his \nadministration will concentrate ``unprecedented attention'' on the \ndemand for drugs. In the Senate, I have joined with Senator Hatch, \nSenator Biden, and others in introducing S. 304, the Drug Abuse \nEducation, Prevention, and Treatment Act. That legislation would \nincrease the federal focus on treatment programs, with targeted \nprograms to increase the availability and effectiveness of drug \ntreatment programs in rural areas, provide additional treatment \nopportunities for mothers who are addicted to drugs, and more.\n  Although Mr. Walters testified at his confirmation hearing and wrote \nin his responses to written questions that he supports drug treatment \nefforts, his previous record casts doubt on the strength of this \nsupport. Mr. Walters has criticized the concept that addiction is a \ndisease, referring to that concept as an ``ideology;'' even though it \nis held widely, if not universally, by government and private experts. \nHe has written that ``the culture of victimhood lies at the core of the \ntherapeutic worldview.'' He has said that he supports ``good'' \ntreatment but sharply criticized existing treatment providers, aside \nfrom faith-based providers. These and other statements by Mr. Walters \nhave caused great concern among many of these who care about treating \ndrug addiction. For example, the president of the Betty Ford Center \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee on October 9 that: ``Mrs. Ford and I \nare convinced that Mr. Walters may not have the confidence in the \ntreatment and prevention strategies that we believe are necessary for \nthe creation and implementation of a balanced and thoughtful approach \nto U.S. drug policy.''\n  As I have said repeatedly, we cannot reduce drug abuse without \npunishing drug offenders, and in particular without ensuring that those \nwho traffic in and sell drugs are incarcerated for substantial periods \nof time. At the same time, many of us--Democrats and Republicans--have \ncome to question our reliance on mandatory minimum sentences for a wide \nvariety of drug offenses, as well as the 100:1 disparity under current \nlaw between sentences for crack and powder cocaine. In his writings and \nstatements, Mr. Walters has been hostile to reconsideration of these \npolicy choices Congress made during the 1980s. For example, he wrote as \nrecently as March that the arguments that we are imprisoning too many \npeople for merely possessing illegal drugs and that criminal sentences \nare too long or harsh were ``among the great urban myths of our time.'' \nThis statement flies in the face of the widespread dissatisfaction with \nmandatory minimum sentences among policymakers and federal judges. \nIndeed, Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Judicial Conferences composed \nof representatives from all 12 U.S. circuits have called for the repeal \nof federal mandatory minimum sentences. Mr. Walters has said he would \nconduct a review of the current sentencing structure, but given his \npast views, I do not believe that he is the best person to undertake \nthat task.\n\n  Between 1983 and 1998, drug admissions to State and Federal prisons \nincreased almost 16-fold, from over 10,000 drug admissions in 1983 to \nalmost 167,000 new prison entries for drug offenses in 1998. During \nthis time, white drug admissions increased more than 7-fold, Hispanic \ndrug admissions increased 18-fold, and black drug admissions increased \nmore than 26-fold. The disparity in sentences for crack and powder \ncocaine has contributed significantly to this disproportionate \nimprisonment of African Americans. Under current law, it takes only 1 \npercent as much crack cocaine to trigger equal mandatory minimum \npenalties with powder cocaine. This disparity has a severe racial \nimpact, as African Americans are much more likely than white Americans \nto be sentenced for crack offenses. For example, in FY 1999, blacks \naccounted for 84.7 percent of those sentenced for crack offenses and \nwhites accounted for just 5.4 percent. There is also reason to doubt \nthe logic of the crack-powder distinction on law enforcement grounds. \nSince cocaine is imported and distributed in powder form, and only \nmanufactured into crack at the retail level, those persons at the \nhighest end of the drug distribution chain are rarely affected by the \nincreased crack penalties. In other words, the harshest sentences are \nreserved for less-culpable offenders.\n  Despite these troubling facts, Mr. Walters has referred to the racial \nimpact of the sentencing disparity as a ``perceived racial injustice'' \nand urged Congress in 1996 testimony to ``[b]lock lower crack \nsentences'' and to strip the U.S. Sentencing Commission of authority \neven to propose changes in criminal penalties where Congress has \nadopted mandatory minimums. His position on this issue undoubtedly has \nplayed a role in the decision by 21 members of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, including the ranking Democratic member of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, Mr. John Conyers, to oppose this nomination. Considering \nthat Mr. Conyers was such a strong supporter of Asa Hutchinson's \nnomination to head the Drug Enforcement Administration that he took the \ntime to write me about it, I take his strong opposition to this \nnomination seriously.\n  Mr. Walters' reaction to popular and legislative judgments by various \nStates to allow limited use of marijuana for medical purposes also \nconcerns me. Numerous states have considered and passed medical \nmarijuana initiatives, some by substantial majorities. Mr. Walters has \nresponded to this trend by advocating that the federal government use \nthe Controlled Substances\n\n[[Page S12441]]\n\nAct to take away the federal licenses from any physician who prescribes \nmarijuana to a patient in states that permit the practice. Such a step \nwould prevent these doctors from prescribing or possessing any \nmedication that is federally controlled, basically making the practice \nof medicine impossible. In addition to running roughshod over any \nfederalism concerns whatsoever, Mr. Walters' draconian response raises \nquestions about his sense of proportion. Although shutting down the \nprocess as he has suggested may be effective in rendering these State-\npassed initiatives meaningless, his proposal is a very blunt \ninstrument, to say the least.\n\n  Mr. Walters' response to written questions on this issue did not \nalleviate my concerns. I asked him whether the Federal government \nshould make it a priority to prosecute people who distribute marijuana \nto ill people in States that have approved medical marijuana \ninitiatives. He answered that he supports ``enforcing the law,'' and \nthen briefly discussed the relatively small size of the DEA, without \naddressing whether medical marijuana cases should be a priority. I am \nall the more disappointed by the insufficiency of this answer in light \nof last month's DEA raid on a California center that provided marijuana \nto the ill in accordance with California law. It is absurd that such a \nmatter has become a government priority, given our growing problems \nwith heroin, metham- phetamines, and other far more powerful and \ndangerous drugs. I asked Mr. Walters recently about this raid, but he \nsaid he believed it would be inappropriate to make any substantive \ncomment prior to his confirmation.\n  Mr. Walters has been a prominent spokesman for active interdiction \nefforts in Latin America, and I fear he would seek to have the United \nStates overextend its anti-drug role in Latin America. Prior to the \ndevelopment of Plan Colombia, he said that ``we need to do more in \nLatin America'' in ``[f]ighting drugs at the source.'' He has also been \na consistent supporter of increasing the U.S. military's role in \npreventing drugs from entering the United States. I agree that reducing \nthe supply of drugs would have tremendous benefits for our nation. At \nthe same time, I agree with President Bush that the reason that so many \ndrugs find their way to our shores is because there is substantial \ndemand for them. The costs--both financial and political--of our \ninvolvement in the internal affairs of Latin American nations require \nclose scrutiny. I have been skeptical about many elements of the ill-\nconsidered Plan Colombia, and we should be extremely cautious of \nadditional proposals of that nature.\n  In addition, Mr. Walters has been sharply critical of Mexico, calling \nit a ``narco state'' and a ``safe haven'' for the illegal drug \nindustry. Although these comments were made about predecessor \ngovernments to the Fox administration, they cannot help Mr. Walters' \nefforts to implement the Bush administration's appropriate policy of \nstrengthening our ties with Mexico.\n  Mr. Walters has forcefully expressed his positions on drug-related \nand other issues for the better part of two decades, both in and out of \ngovernment. He is a staunch advocate for interdiction and punishment, \nbut his record has not demonstrated a commitment to a comprehensive \napproach to our drug problems. When the Judiciary Committee held its \nconfirmation hearing for this nominee, I said that I feared that Mr. \nWalters had a hard-line law enforcement answer to every question about \ndrug policy, at the expense of the balanced approach that we need to \nsucceed in the struggle against drug abuse. I still hold those fears, \nbut I hope that Mr. Walters exceeds my expectations in office.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of all parents and grandparents, \nteachers, clergy, mentors, agents of law enforcement, treatment and \nprevention professionals, and all the others who work every day to \nprevent illegal drug use from destroying the lives of our young people, \nI rise to support the nomination of John Walters, the President's \nnominee to be our nation's next Drug Czar. The confirmation of this \nimportant nominee is long overdue. Mr. Walters' nomination has \nlanguished in the Senate for almost six months, but with his \nconfirmation, the President's cabinet will finally be complete.\n  Mr. Walters will begin his tenure as Drug Czar at a very precarious \ntime, but I know he is the right person for this challenge. He will \nneed to work closely with law enforcement, intelligence, and military \nauthorities to prevent drugs from being trafficked into America from \nabroad and to prevent the manufacturing and sale of drugs for the \npurpose of funding terrorist activities. Mr. Walters is eminently \nqualified to carry out this task, and, as I have previously stated, I \nam confident that he will be a first-rate Director. After all, having \nserved at the Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department \nof Education with Bill Bennett, he learned from the person widely \nregarded--by Republicans and Democrats alike--as the most talented and \neffective drug czar we have had in this country.\n  I want to highlight once more how John Walters' career in public \nservice has prepared him well for this office. He has worked tirelessly \nover the last two decades helping to formulate and improve \ncomprehensive policies designed to keep drugs away from our children. \nBy virtue of this experience, he truly has unparalleled knowledge and \nexperience in all facets of drug control policy. Lest there be any \ndoubt that Mr. Walters' past efforts were successful, let me point out \nthat during his tenure at the Department of Education and ONDCP, drug \nuse in America fell to its lowest level at any time in the past 25 \nyears, and drug use by teens plunged over 50 percent. Even after \nleaving ONDCP in 1993, Mr. Walters has remained a vocal advocate for \ncurbing illegal drug use. Tragically, as illegal drug use edged upward \nunder the previous administration, his voice went unheeded.\n  John Walters enjoys widespread support from distinguished members of \nthe law enforcement community, including the Fraternal Order of Police \nand the National Troopers Coalition. His nomination is also supported \nby some of the most prominent members of the prevention and treatment \ncommunities, including the National Association of Drug Court \nProfessionals, the American Methadone Treatment Association, the \nPartnership for Drug Free America, National Families in Action, and the \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. All of these organizations \nagree that if we are to win the war on drugs in America, we need a \ncomprehensive policy aimed at reducing both the demand for and supply \nof drugs. Mr. Walters' accomplished record demonstrates that he, too, \nhas always believed in such a comprehensive approach. As he stated \nbefore Congress in 1993, an effective anti-drug strategy must \n``integrate efforts to reduce the supply of as well as the demand for \nillegal drugs.''\n  Despite this groundswell of support, ever since Mr. Walters was first \nmentioned almost seven months ago to be the next Drug Czar, several \ninterested individuals and groups have attacked his nomination with a \nbarrage of unfounded criticisms. Because these untruths helped delay \nhis confirmation until today, I feel compelled to respond once more to \nsome of these gross distortions.\n  Some have charged that John Walters is hostile to drug treatment. \nOnce again, I want to state for the record that this criticism is \ncategorically false. He has a long, documented history of supporting \ndrug treatment as an integral component of a balanced national drug \ncontrol policy. You do not have to take my word on this. You need only \nlook at the numbers.\n  During Mr. Walters' tenure at ONDCP, treatment funding increased 74 \npercent. This compares with an increase over eight years for the \nClinton Administration of a mere 17 percent. This commitment to \nexpanding treatment explains why John Walters has such broad support \nfrom the treatment community. It is simply inconceivable that the \nprominent groups supporting Mr. Walters would do so if they believed he \nwas hostile to treatment.\n  Another recurring criticism is that Mr. Walters doesn't support a \nbalanced drug control policy that incorporates both supply and demand \nreduction programs. This criticism, too, is flat wrong and again belied \nby his record. For example, in testimony given before this Committee in \n1991, Mr. Walters, then acting Director of ONDCP, laid out a national \ndrug control strategy\n\n[[Page S12442]]\n\nthat included the following guiding principles: educating our citizens \nabout the dangers of drug use; placing more addicts in effective \ntreatment programs; expanding the number and quality of treatment \nprograms; reducing the supply and availability of drugs on our streets; \nand dismantling trafficking organizations through tough law enforcement \nand interdiction measures.\n  Mr. Walters' firm support of prevention programs is equally evident. \nHis commitment to prevention became clear during his tenure at the \nDepartment of Education during the Reagan Administration. He drafted \nthe Department's first drug prevention guide for parents and teachers--\ntitled ``Schools Without Drugs,'' created the Department's first \nprevention advertising campaign, and implemented the Drug-Free Schools \ngrant program.\n  These are not the words or actions of an ideologue who is hostile to \nprevention and treatment, but rather, represent the firmly held beliefs \nof a man of conviction who has fought hard to include effective \nprevention and treatment programs in the fight against drug abuse.\n  Some have also criticized Mr. Walters because he doesn't buy into the \noft-repeated liberal shibboleth that too many low-level, ``non-\nviolent'' drug offenders are being arrested, prosecuted, and jailed. I, \ntoo, plead guilty to this charge, but the facts prove we are right. \nData from the Bureau of Justice Statistics reveals that 67.4 percent of \nfederal defendants convicted of simple possession had prior arrest \nrecords, and 54 percent had prior convictions. Moreover, prison \nsentences handed down for possession offenses amount to just 1 percent \nof Federal prison sentences. Thus, it is patently false that a \nsignificant proportion of our federal prison population consists of \nindividuals who have done nothing other than possess illegal drugs for \ntheir personal consumption.\n  The drug legalization camp exaggerates the rate at which defendants \nare jailed solely for simple possession. This camp also wants us to \nview those who sell drugs as ``nonviolent offenders.'' Mr. Walters, to \nhis credit, has had the courage to publicly refute these misleading \nstatistics and claims. I want to join him in making one point perfectly \nclear. Those who sell drugs, whatever type and whatever quantity, are \nnot, to this father and grandfather, ``nonviolent offenders.'' Not when \neach pill, each joint, each line, and each needle can and often does \ndestroy a young person's life.\n  I am committed 100 percent to expanding and improving drug abuse \neducation, prevention, and treatment programs, and I know that John \nWalters is my ally in this effort. Last week, the Judiciary Committee \nvoted out S. 304, the ``Drug Abuse Education, Prevention, and Treatment \nAct of 2001,'' a bipartisan bill I drafted with Senators Leahy, Biden, \nDeWine, Thurmond, Feinstein, and Grassley. This legislation will \ndramatically increase prevention and treatment efforts, and I remain \nconfident that it will become law this Congress. As I have stated many \ntimes, I solicited Mr. Walters' expert advice in drafting S. 304. I \nknow, and his record clearly reflects, that he agrees with me and my \ncolleagues that prevention and treatment must remain integral \ncomponents of our national drug control strategy.\n  We need to shore up our support for demand reduction programs if we \nare to reduce illegal drug use in America. This commitment is \nbipartisan. Our President believes in it. Our Attorney General believes \nin it. Our Democratic leader in the Senate believes in it. My \nRepublican colleagues believe in it. And most importantly, John Walters \nbelieves in it.\n  Finally, Mr. President, now that Mr. Walters is about to be \nconfirmed, I want to urge the Senate not to let this session end \nwithout holding hearings for and acting on the deputy positions at \nONDCP. Mr. Walters needs his team in place. I look forward to working \nwith my Senate Republican and Democratic colleagues and the \nAdministration to carry forward our fight against drug trafficking and \nterrorism.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this nomination. We have a real \nopportunity to strengthen the nation's efforts against substance abuse, \nand we ought to take advantage of it. We rely heavily today on police, \nprosecutors, and prisons to handle this problem. There's too little \nemphasis on prevention and treatment. Spending for prevention and \ntreatment has never exceeded one-third of the federal drug-control \nbudget.\n  This unacceptable situation continues, in spite of overwhelming \nevidence that drug treatment works.\n  In 1994, a landmark study, the California Drug and Alcohol Treatment \nAssessment, found that every dollar spent on treatment saves taxpayers \n$7 in future costs for crime and health care.\n  A 1997 study by the Rand Corporation found that treatment for heavy \ncocaine users is three times more effective at reducing cocaine \nconsumption than mandatory minimum sentences, and 11 times more \neffective than interdiction.\n  A study by the Institute of Medicine showed that treatment was \neffective in reducing criminal activity and emergency-room visits, and \nin increasing rates of employment.\n  In 1997, the Department of Justice reported that offenders who \ncomplete drug-court programs are only one-third as likely to be \narrested for new drug offenses or felonies compared to other offenders, \nand only one-fourth as likely to violate probation or parole.\n  Now more than ever, Americans support prevention and treatment. They \nunderstand that we cannot stop substance abuse without reducing the \ndemand for drugs. In the nation's efforts against substance abuse, \nprevention and treatment must become equal partners with incarceration \nand interdiction.\n  To his credit, President Bush has called for closing the treatment \ngap. He has stated that ``the most effective way to reduce the supply \nof drugs in America is to reduce the demand for drugs in America.''\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senator Leahy, Senator Hatch, and Senator \nBiden, the Judiciary Committee passed a bill last week to increase \nfederal funding for drug education, prevention, and treatment. there is \nmuch more, however, that we must do to see that all Americans \nunderstand that drug use is harmful, and that effective treatment is \navailable to every addict who wants it.\n  The nomination of John Walters sends exactly the opposite signal. As \na longtime critic of drug treatment, he's the wrong man for the job. In \n1996, he ridiculed President Clinton's proposal to provide drug \ntreatment to chronic users as ``the latest manifestation of the \nliberals' commitment to a `therapeutic state' in which government \nserves as the agent of personal rehabilitation.'' Last March, Mr. \nWalters described the view that addiction is a disease of the brain as \nan ``ideology'' promulgated by the ``therapy-only lobby.''\n  Mr. Walters has emphasized punishment and prisons as the primary \nsolution to the problem of drugs. He has criticized attempts to reform \nmandatory-minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenses. The United \nStates now has the highest per capita incarceration rate in the world. \nYet Mr. Walters recently declared that ``[t]he war on crime and drugs \nis rapidly losing ground to the war on punishment and prisons.''\n  In his response to the Judiciary Committee's questionnaire, Mr. \nWalters said that during the first Bush administration, he was ``a \nprincipal author of a new drug strategy and federal spending plan that \ntargeted more resources for treatment than any administration before or \nafter.'' But as Mr. Walters has admitted, the Clinton administration \nspent substantially more--not less--on drug treatment. As for the \nincreases that did occur during the Bush administration, Mr. Walters \nfought them all the way.\n  At his nomination hearing on October 10, I pressed Mr. Walters on \nwhether he would try to balance federal spending for demand-reduction \nand supply-control efforts. Saying only that he was not ``notionally'' \nopposed to equal spending, he refused to give an answer.\n  Before the hearing, the president of the Betty Ford Center wrote that \nhe and Mrs. Ford questioned whether Mr. Walters has ``the confidence in \nthe treatment and prevention strategies that . . . are necessary for \nthe creation and implementation of a balanced and thoughtful approach \nto U.S. drug policy.''\n  Mr. Walters' comments on race are also troubling. In 1997, he \ncriticized\n\n[[Page S12443]]\n\nGeneral Barry McCaffrey for sending ``the wrong message'' when he \nexpressed concern about the high percentage of African-Americans being \nimprisoned for drug offenses. Earlier this year, he categorically \ndismissed the view that the criminal justice system unjustly punishes \nAfrican-American men as one of ``the great urban myths of our time.''\n  Racial discrimination is offensive and unacceptable in all its \naspects. The need to eliminate it continues to be one of the nation's \nimportant challenges. It is undisputed that even though blacks and \nwhites use illegal drugs at the same rate, blacks are incarcerated for \ndrug offenses at a much higher rate. Mr. Walters was asked to justify \nhis ``urban myth'' statement, but he only cited unrelated statistics on \nmurder rates. We need a Drug Czar who has, at the very least, an open \nmind about the possibility of racial bias in drug sentencing.\n  Mr. Walters' supporters contend that despite his longstanding \nopposition to increased treatment funding, and his very recent \ncriticism of drug therapy, he is the right choice to revitalize our \ndrug-control efforts and close the country's treatment gap. I hope that \nthey are right, and that those of us who oppose him are wrong. I am \nconcerned, however, that by approving this nomination today, we are \nlosing our best opportunity to develop a more balanced and more \neffective national strategy on drug abuse.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join with several of my colleagues in \nopposing the nomination of John P. Walters to be Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy--the Nation's Drug Czar.\n  As much as anyone here, I am mindful of the need to unify behind the \nPresident during these times. Let me emphasize that I share the \nPresident's goals in combating the problem of drug abuse, and I applaud \nhis commitment of greater resources to drug treatment and prevention \nefforts. My fear, however, is that Mr. Walters is not the person to \nmeet these goals.\n  John Walters is a seasoned veteran of the Drug War, someone with a \nlong and established track record on many controversial issues. Too \noften in the past, he has adopted divisive stances on these issues. His \nviews, and his certitude in advocating them, send a fair warning to \nthis body as it debates his nomination. His controversial and often \nincendiary writings on drug-related issues have been red meat for the \nright-wing of the Republican Party.\n  Let me focus on a couple topics. Like many of my colleagues, I am \nvery troubled by the considerable evidence that our prosecution of the \ndrug war disproportionally targets racial and ethnic minorities. \nAfrican-Americans represent 12 percent of the U.S. population, 11 \npercent of current drug users, but 35 percent of those arrested for \ndrug violations, 53 percent of those convicted in state courts, and 58 \npercent of those currently incarcerated in state prisons. In my home \nState of Illinois, African-American men end up in State prisons on drug \ncharges at a rate 57 times greater than white men. These disparities, \nwhatever their cause, demand the attention of the Nation's Drug Czar. \nAside from the injustice of this situation, there is stark evidence \nthat drug offenders who are not minorities escape the same scrutiny and \nenforcement as those who are. Our war on drugs must be fair and \nbalanced.\n  With the exception of the last few weeks, Mr. Walters has spent most \nof his career being dismissive of the subject of racial disparities in \ndrug enforcement. As recently as this April, he characterized as \n``urban myth'' the sincere concern of many, including myself, that \nyoung black men receive excessive prison terms under the current \nsentencing regime. He has accused the nonpartisan federal Sentencing \nCommission of being ``irresponsible'' for proposing adjustments to the \n100-1 disparity between federal prison terms for crack cocaine and \npowder cocaine offenses, offenses which divide starkly along color \nlines.\n  It has become a cliche for public officials to lament racial \nprofiling in law enforcement. What matters is action, not words. But \neven now, when Mr. Walters has experienced a ``change of heart'' on \nmany issues, he will only concede that there is a ``perception'' of \ndisparate treatment in the criminal justice system. As someone \ncommitted to using the Drug Czar's office to promote criminal law \ninitiatives, he has exhibited little sensitivity for the role that race \nplays in the criminal justice system. Given the important law \nenforcement role filled by the Drug Czar, I cannot overlook this \nweakness.\n  Another source of real concern is the nominee's record on drug \ntreatment and prevention. Early in my congressional career, I worked to \npass legislation to improve substance abuse treatment programs for \npregnant and postpartum women. We know that treatment programs can \nwork. A study by the RAND Corporation a few years ago found that for \nevery dollar that we invest in substance abuse treatment, the American \ntaxpayers save $7.46 in miscellaneous societal costs.\n  The Nation's drug crisis demands that we supplement law enforcement \nefforts with effective treatment and prevention programs. While Mr. \nWalters has voiced his support for a balanced and coordinated approach, \nhis long paper trail belies his real intentions. He has a long record \nof hostility towards, as he put it, the ``notoriously under-performing \ndrug treatment system,'' and towards those who implement it. He has \ncriticized those who approach drug addiction as a disease as \n``ideologues.'' He has condemned the Drug-Free Schools Act, which \ncreated many of the same types of prevention programs he takes credit \nfor now.\n  Let me say a few brief words about the John Walters who came to visit \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. Judging by his answers to the \nCommittee's questions, he has been doing a lot of reflection lately. He \nnow believes that ``the consideration of addiction as a disease has \nwide application.'' A man who once defended harsh mandatory minimum \nsentences today professes support for ``second and third chances'' and \ntempering justice with mercy. A harsh partisan critic of President \nClinton now wishes to ``transcend traditional political and party \nboundaries.'' The same person who wrote ``[t]here is no question that \nsupply fosters demand'' stands beside President Bush's pledge that \n``[t]he most effective way to reduce the supply of drugs in America is \nto reduce the demand for drugs in America.''\n  Mr. Walters assured the Committee that he has not undergone what we \nrefer to as a ``confirmation conversion.'' That is precisely what \nconcerns me--that he has not moderated his views at all, but has merely \nrethought his public relations strategy. Over the course of his career, \nMr. Walters has made a conscious choice to polarize rather than advance \nthe public debate. Accordingly, I cannot provide my support for his \nnomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12443-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12443-S12444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          LIFE AS AN AMERICAN\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to share with you and \nthe rest of my colleagues the thoughts of one of my younger \nconstituents, for I think they are noteworthy for their insight, their \nhonesty and their prescience.\n  Stephanie Kaplan, who lives in Highland Park, IL, is a junior at \nHighland Park High School. Stephanie recently submitted her writing to \nthe Jewish Press in Omaha, NE, in response to their request for essays \nabout patriotism. Out of all the responses that arrived at the \nnewspaper, the editors deemed Stephanie's the best among them.\n  Perhaps most remarkable is that this essay, in which Stephanie \nexplains what life as an American means to her, was written in August, \nbefore Osama bin Laden became a household name and when the top news \nstories did not mention Afghanistan.\n  Our enemies have attacked us for who we are and what we believe. The \nvery freedoms we love inspire their hatred. As our freedoms are the \nsource of this conflict, we cannot allow them to become its casualties.\n  Stephanie's writing is a timely reminder of what it is we value and \nwhat it is we are defending.\n  Her essay follows:\n\n                   What Being an American Means to Me\n\n                         (by Stephanie Kaplan)\n\n       Ice cream for dinner. Sitting on the bleachers through a \n     muggy afternoon, cheering heartily for a favored team or \n     player. An early-morning walk, as the trees that line the \n     street wave their green leaves in the\n\n[[Page S12444]]\n\n     wind, scintillating drops of dew falling down to join their \n     brethren on the glistening grass. Air conditioning with the \n     twist of a knob.\n       This is America!\n       But luxuries, the majority of which can be purchased by \n     money, do not define what being an American means to me.\n       Freedom. Yes, there are rules and regulations, a moral \n     code, and systems of punishment for those who infringe and \n     sever them. They are in place to protect the people, however, \n     and are not oppressing as some governments, which implement \n     so many restrictions that the citizens are suffocated by the \n     layers upon layers of laws.\n       I can keep my lights on through the night, if I so wish. No \n     policies prohibit me from befriending a Jew, a Muslim, or a \n     person of color. And only my own predilections will rule my \n     summer afternoon activities, be it in-line pick-up hockey on \n     the basketball court down the street, or a lazy afternoon \n     perched before my computer, like a dog passing away the hours \n     chewing on rawhide.\n       Being a United States resident, to me, translates into the \n     simple joy that I can ride my bike to the places that defined \n     my carefree youth, mainly the elementary school's playground. \n     And if I so wish, I'll stray from the paved trail and take \n     the long route, or cut across the grass.\n       Most importantly, I possess no fear when being out alone. \n     For I feel safe, in this country, that I will not be a victim \n     of hostility based on any outward appearance. And I'd never \n     really noticed how wonderful and rare that is until I spent \n     three weeks on a teen tour with students from 21 different \n     countries.\n       My best friend became a girl from Hong Kong, and, as we \n     were walking along one overcast afternoon, she stated, ``I \n     hate the Beijing government.'' Then, she added, ``If I said \n     that in Hong Kong, in a casual conversation, I might be okay. \n     But if I was in Beijing, I could get shot. That's why I like \n     America, it's free for opinions.''\n       Never experiencing any sort of political oppression, it's \n     difficult for me to grasp what she must feel, or the fear of \n     a simple slip translating into death.\n       And this country is not perfect.\n       But as the anthem states, this is ``. . . the land of the \n     free.'' Sovereignty is a daily part of life. What may have \n     seemed like a burden--all the decisions one must make, and \n     the consequences that can only be blamed on an individual--\n     now seems liberating.\n       Existing in America means much to me, but the most poignant \n     example is that I can pray, out loud, in Hebrew, with the \n     shades drawn up and the door gaping, invitingly open.\n       On the trip, while occupying a dorm room, I prayed every \n     morning, just as I do at home. The glaring difference was \n     that the people who passed by my open doorway were not all \n     Jewish. Openly, I expressed my faith and reinforced my \n     beliefs to myself, my dedication to the Hashem.\n       How far we've traveled, in place, time, and pure \n     progression, since my grandmother hid below ground in \n     Germany, with but one dress, and could not even talk, let \n     alone pray aloud, for fear of SS men. And the advances since \n     my grandfather fought for survival in the same foreign \n     country, with outlandish limitations, are miraculous.\n       Could, I wonder, either of them imagined a time in which \n     their granddaughter--yes, a family!--could be so audacious as \n     to flaunt her prayer?\n       It's not the passing of years, though, but the changing of \n     countries that made it possible.\n       America may never be able to be defined, as being American \n     means so many different things to millions of unique people. \n     For the country, when drawn, should not be its traditional \n     shape, as seen on a map, but as a 3-D shape, with as many \n     angles as it has citizens, for the people shape America as \n     much as the land.\n       Being an American means choices, luxuries, decisions, \n     freedoms, and a feeling of not importance, but \n     responsibility, in illustrating the greatness of my country, \n     and endeavoring to uphold the lofty ideals of the founders of \n     this Nation, inhabitants who, like my grandparents, escaped \n     tyranny and a role of inferiority to pull freedom to their \n     chests and keep it there, chained 'til a death that does not \n     come prematurely due to discrimination.\n       Being an American means I am an individual and have the \n     independence to be just that--an American, because I believe \n     in the country and the opportunity. While it may take a \n     little digging, opportunity is available; even if found, one \n     must clean off the dirt before pursuing it.\n       I am a living, breathing, original American, and that I can \n     exist unscathed is what being a citizen of this realm is all \n     about. Existing as a member of this free country means, to \n     me, that if in 60 years my family can go from savoring every \n     drop of water to survive to having a house with a mezuzah on \n     each doorway, I can savor the prospects presented by freedom \n     and find a way to take it a step farther.\n       After all, my door is always open.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12444-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARY KAY ASH\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nMary Kay Ash.\n  On November 22, 2001, America and Texas lost a great person Mary Kay \nAsh.\n  Throughout Mary Kay Ash's life, her unswerving devotion to principles \nand to doing what is right enabled her to exert an influence unique in \na society that was known for strict rules of hierarchy, specifically \nmale hierarchy. She flourished where many fail, or simply remain in the \nshadows of obscurity. By doing so, she blazed the path for many women \nafter her, we have all profited from her success.\n  Over her career, Mary Kay sacrificed a lot to fulfill her dream, do \nher duty to her family and her God, and to stand by her principles. It \nis women and men of that caliber who have made our country great.\n  Her savvy created an incredible business from a profit point of view, \nbut, most important, she created a business that offers women the \nchance for personal and professional fulfillment and success. It is no \nwonder that Mary Kay Cosmetics is considered by Fortune Magazine as one \nof the top ten best companies for women, indeed, it is also recognized \nas one of The 100 Best Companies to Work for in America.\n  But Mary Kay never stopped with work, she did not even start with \nwork. Her priorities were always clear: God first, family second, and \ncareer third. It is why, when her husband died from cancer, she put her \nendless energies to work in that arena as well, creating the Mary Kay \nAsh Charitable Foundation in 1996. This nonprofit provides funding for \nresearch of cancers affecting women, and it has recently expanded its \nfocus to address violence against women.\n  Since she was a fellow Texan, I was never surprised by her zest for \nlife. E.B White once wrote, ``I arise in the morning torn between a \ndesire to save the world and a desire to savor the world. This makes it \nhard to plan the day.'' Not for people like Mary Kay, she knew how to \naccomplish both.\n  Mary Kay remembered what was important yet still reached for the \nstars--and all of us are the better for it. Thank you Mary Kay, I hope \nyou are driving a beautiful pink Cadillac up in heaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12444-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12444-S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO KAREN NYSTROM MEYER\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Karen Nystrom Meyer was appointed \nto serve as the Executive Vice President of the Vermont Medical Society \n(VMS) in 1988. Throughout her tenure in office, Karen's work has been \ncharacterized by great integrity, compassion and a strong understanding \nof the critical role physicians play in improving the quality of life \nin the Green Mountain State. Many Vermonters shared my sense of loss \nwhen Karen Meyer recently announced her resignation in order to accept \na new position in the field of higher education.\n  The fourteen years she led the society were years of great change and \naccomplishment for the organization. It was Karen's first job as an \noffice assistant in a large internal medicine practice that gave her a \nreal appreciation for the struggles and rewards of practicing medicine. \nThe first woman executive of a State medical society in the country, \nshe completely restructured the governance of the society moving from \nthe traditional House of Delegates representative structure to an \nannual membership meeting format where each VMS member may participate \nin making Society policy. While Vermont was the first State to \nrestructure its governance structure in this way, many other State \nsocieties have followed Vermont's lead.\n  During Karen's tenure at VMS, the society was able to achieve many of \nits policy initiatives at the State and Federal level. These include \npassing the ``Clean Indoor Air Act,'' supporting lead screening for \nchildren, ensuring coverage of clinical trials, increasing access to \nhealth care for Vermonters, funding anti-tobacco programs, and \ndeveloping a strong education program for physicians around end-of life \ncare.\n  Karen was also instrumental in helping to establish the Vermont \nProgram for Quality in Health Care (VPQHC). Over the years, VPQHC has \nachieved national recognition for its important work developing \nclinical guidelines, reporting on health care quality in Vermont and \neducating physicians and practitioners. Karen has also demonstrated \noutstanding leadership and gained national recognition for her\n\n[[Page S12445]]\n\nwork with the American Medical Association and the American Association \nof Medical Society Executives, where she has participated on many work \ngroups and policy teams.\n  Prior to becoming Executive Vice President of the Vermont Medical \nSociety, Karen was the Commissioner of Housing and Community Affairs \nfor the State of Vermont. As Commissioner, she worked tirelessly to \nincrease the availability of affordable housing in Vermont. However, I \nam sure she will say that her most enjoyable job was working for me as \na legislative assistant in the 1970's when I represented Vermont in the \nHouse of Representatives. Based on our work together, I can personally \nattest to her grace, competency and sense of humor--all of which are \nthe key characteristics of a successful public servant.\n  While Karen is leaving the medical society, she will continue to play \nan important role in improving the social fabric of Vermont. She has \naccepted a new position at the University of Vermont where she will \nwork with the acting President to develop a renewed sense of mission \nfor the University. I know that I speak for thousands of Vermonters in \nthanking her for extraordinary service to the Vermont Medical Society \nand conveying our best wishes in her future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12445-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MONICA TENCATE\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a \ndeparting Senate Finance Committee staffer, Monica Tencate. She has \nserved the Senate with great distinction, and it is with much sadness \nthat I am bidding her goodbye. I'd like to take a few moments to \ndescribe her contribution.\n  Monica came to the Senate from California in 1998, and joined \nChairman Roth's Finance Committee health team. After effective service \nthere, she moved to Senator Frist's Subcommittee on Public Health, \nmaking a tremendous contribution on a broad range of challenging HELP \nCommittee issues. I know her years with Senator Frist were very \nrewarding ones for her, so I was delighted that she was willing to \nreturn to the Finance Committee to work with me, as Director of the \nFinance Committee's health policy team.\n  As I look back at this year, Monica was a real leader in the \nCommittee's effort to strengthen and improve Medicare for the 21st \nCentury, including prescription drug coverage for Medicare \nbeneficiaries. She did a stellar job in helping to assemble a \nTripartisan group, which put forward a framework for future success in \nthis area. Due to the September 11 terrorist attacks, making major \nimprovements to Medicare will have to wait until 2002. I believe, \nhowever, that we've laid a solid foundation for next year's efforts, \nand Monica's contribution was indispensable.\n  Monica also played a key role in the Committee's efforts to help \nprovide coverage to the uninsured, to streamline Medicare regulations \nfor beneficiaries and providers, and to address potentially serious \nproblems posed by the new hospital outpatient payment system. She's \ndone all this while keeping in mind the reality that our federal health \nprograms aren't free--it's hard-working Americans who pay for them. \nIt's easy to lose sight of that fact here inside the Beltway, but \nMonica never has.\n  Monica's contribution to me and to the Senate, in fact, went beyond \npolicy and politics. She was a true team player, earning the respect of \neveryone she worked with, and the affection of her fellow Finance \nCommittee staffers. And she did all this during one of this body's most \ntumultuous years in recent history--a year we'll all remember for the \n50-50 Senate, the change in party control, the September 11 attacks, \nand finally the anthrax attack that drove many of us out of our \noffices. She served in her extraordinarily challenging job under these \ndifficult circumstances with grace, commitment, and good humor. She \nwill be sorely missed.\n  Now Monica is heading home to San Diego, to rejoin her husband Mike, \nwho's also serving the nation in the United States Marines.

At that moment, without discussion or explanation, \nan appreciation for the extraordinary service and leading citizenship \nof firefighters became a prominent and, I hope, permanent feature of \nour collective consciousness.\n  In my State of Delaware, we have a rich heritage of local fire \ncompanies serving our communities, a tradition of neighbors helping \nneighbors. And I rise today to honor one of those local departments, \nthe Carlisle Fire Company, which serves the City of Milford, Delaware \nand which will celebrate its 200th anniversary in 2002.\n  Originally founded under charter from the State Legislature, as, \nsimply, a ``Fire Fighting Organization,'' the company began its service \nin the spring of 1802, a full 90 years before the first water mains and \nfire hydrants were installed in Milford. A hand drawn hook-and-ladder \nwas acquired, and was stored along with other equipment at a building \nowned by Mrs. Angeline Marshall, appropriately, on Water Street.\n  In 1915, the department reincorporated as the Milford Fire Company, \nand that same year, there was a 10-day fund drive which raised money to \npurchase a triple combination fire truck Milford's Truck No. 1. A \nsecond name change followed in 1918, to honor Paris T. Carlisle, a \nMilford resident and member and officer of the Fire Company, who was \nkilled in France during World War I. In 1921, the Company broke ground \nto build its first fire station, and in 1923, after another successful \nfundraising drive, Truck No. 2 was purchased and Truck No. 1 refitted \nto better serve the community. Ground was broken for the current fire \nhall on Northwest Front Street in 1977, and as the folks in Milford \nwill tell you with well-earned pride, they paid off and burned the \nmortgage in 1990. At about the same time, ambulance service was added.\n  From that hall on Front Street, the Carlisle Fire Company responds to \nmore than 1,800 calls per year. With an active Ladies Auxiliary, \nfounded in 1963 with Peggy Jester as its first president, and a Junior \nMember program, created by then-Chief Marvin Hitch in 1973, the Company \nis truly a center of community life in Milford. And it also has a \nspecial place in our statewide firefighting community; the Delaware \nVolunteer Firemen's Association (DVFA) was organized in Milford in \nFebruary of 1921, and the first president was Charles E. Varney, who \nwas also president of the Carlisle Fire Company. The Company has \ncontinued its leadership in statewide programs ever since.\n  It is my privilege to share some of the history and hopefully some of \nthe spirit of the Carlisle Fire Company with my colleagues and with our \nfellow citizens today. We honor the Company's 200th anniversary, and \nthe extraordinary commitment and service that it represents, with \ngratitude to local firefighters, our neighbors who are there when we \nneed them most. Congratulations to President Francis Morris and Fire \nChief Kevin Twilley, and to all the officers, members and friends of \nthe Carlisle Fire Company again, with great respect and with \nthanks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12445-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12445-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12445-5", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12445-S12446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks,\n\n[[Page S12446]]\n\nannounced that the House has passed the following bill, with an \namendment:\n\n       S. 494.

A bill to provide for the energy security of the Nation, and \nfor other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \ncomprehensive energy bill that is being introduced today.\n  As we all know, there has been a great deal of discussion this year \nabout the nation's energy situation. The increasing volatility in \ngasoline and diesel prices and the growing tension in the world from \nthe terrorist attacks have affected all of us. There is a clear need \nfor energy policies that ensure long term planning, homeland security, \nfuel diversity and a focus on new technologies.\n  To this end, I am very pleased that a comprehensive energy bill has \nbeen introduced in the Senate by my South Dakota colleague, Senator Tom \nDaschle. The bill is the result of many months of hard work by the \nMajority Leader and the chairmen of the committees of jurisdiction, \nincluding Senator Jeff Bingaman, the chairman of the Energy Committee, \nof which I am a member. They have listened to the concerns of both \nthose who run our energy systems and our constituents in crafting the \nlegislation. The result is a balanced and thorough product that \naddresses most of the major segments of the energy system and looks \nahead to the needs of future.\n  The bill covers a number of important areas, including incentives to \nincrease oil and gas production and the nation's supplies of \ntraditional fuels, streamlining of electricity systems and regulations, \nimportant environmental and conservation measures, and provisions to \nincrease efficiency of vehicles and appliances.\n  One of the key provisions in the bill is the inclusion of a renewable \nfuels standard. Earlier this year, I introduced a bill with Senator \nChuck Hagel of Nebraska, the Renewable Fuels for Energy Security Act of \n2001 (S. 1006), to ensure future growth for ethanol and biodiesel \nthrough the creation of a new renewable fuels content standard in all \nmotor fuel produced and used in the U.S. I am pleased the framework of \nthis bill is included in the comprehensive energy legislation.\n  Today, ethanol and biodiesel comprise less than one percent of all \ntransportation fuel in the United States. 1.8 billion gallons is \ncurrently produced in the U.S. The energy bill's language\n\n[[Page S12449]]\n\nwould require that five billions gallons of transportation fuel be \ncomprised of renewable fuel by 2012--nearly a tripling of the current \nethanol and renewable fuel production.\n  There are great benefits of ethanol and renewable fuels for the \nenvironment and the economies of rural communities. We have many \nethanol plants in South Dakota and more are being planned. These \nfarmer-owned ethanol plants in South Dakota, and in neighboring states, \ndemonstrate the hard work and commitment to serve a growing market for \nclean domestic fuels.\n  Based on current projections, construction of new plants will \ngenerate $900 million in capital investment and tens of thousands of \nconstruction jobs to rural communities. For corn farmers, the price of \ncorn is expected to rise between 20 and 30 cents per bushel. Farmers \nwill have the opportunity to invest in these ethanol plants to capture \na greater piece of the ``value chain.''\n  Combine this with the provisions of the energy bill and the potential \neconomic impact for South Dakota is tremendous. Today, 3 ethanol plants \nin South Dakota (Broins in Scotland and Heartland Grain Fuels in \nAberdeen and Huron) produce nearly 30 million gallons per year. With \nthe enactment of a renewable fuels standard, the production in South \nDakota could grow substantially, with at least 2000 farmers owning \nethanol plants and producing 200 million gallons of ethanol per year or \nmore.\n  An important but under-emphasized fuel is biodiesel, which is chiefly \nproduced from excess soybean oil. We all know that soybean prices are \nhovering near historic lows. Biodiesel production is small but has been \ngrowing steadily. The renewable fuels standard would greatly increase \nthe prospects for biodiesel production and benefit soybean farmers from \nSouth Dakota and other states.\n  Moreover, the enactment of a renewable fuels standards would greatly \nincrease the nation's energy security. Greater usage of renewable fuels \nwould displace the level of foreign oil that we currently use. During \nthese difficult times, it is imperative that we find ways to improve \nthe nation's energy security and reduce our dependence on foreign oil. \nA renewable fuels standard would go a long way towards achieving this \ngoal.\n  The House passed an energy bill without any provisions for a \nrenewable fuels standard. Moreover, the House looks backward by \nfocusing too heavily on tax breaks for traditional fuel supplies \nwithout enough encouragement for new technologies and provisions that \nwill reduce our dependency on foreign oil. The Senate bill achieves the \nright balance for the nation's future. I commend Senators Daschle and \nBingaman for their efforts and look forward to enacting the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Daschle for their leadership on the introduction of a \ncomprehensive energy bill today, the Energy Policy Act of 2001. This \nbill has many components, and it required a great deal of coordination \nand effort to compile pieces that address issues that cut across \ncommittee lines. I appreciate their efforts in this regard.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I am particularly pleased to see several areas of \ncoverage in the bill. This bill incorporates many climate science and \ntechnology provisions from a bill Senators Kerry, Stevens, Inouye, \nAkaka, and I recently introduced, S. 1716, the Global Climate Change \nAct of 2001. These provisions will improve our climate monitoring, \nmeasurement, research, and technology so that we are better able to \ndiscern climate change, understand its patterns, and manage its \neffects. In addition, it contains provisions that would establish a \nservice to provide expert, unbiased technology advice to Congress, \nwhich we have sorely lacked since the Office of Technology Assessment \nwas abolished in 1995.\n  In addition, there is a placeholder in the bill for a CAFE provision. \nIn 1975, I co-sponsored the legislation that became the current CAFE \nlaw. I was also very involved in efforts during the 101st and 102nd \nCongresses to increase CAFE standards. I am pleased to report that the \nCommerce Committee is again taking up the issue of fuel economy \nstandards. In fact, we will be holding a hearing on this topic tomorrow \nmorning.\n  The Committee is embarking on a process to develop a strong and \ntechnically feasible CAFE proposal that will strengthen our domestic \nand economic security. Such a provision must achieve oil savings to \nreduce our petroleum consumption and dependence on imported oil. It \nalso must ensure that our automotive industry remains technically \ncompetitive. This is quite a challenge, but it is an issue that must be \naddressed.\n  The CAFE measures originally arose out of concern for the nation's \nenergy security following the oil crisis of the early 1970s. When the \nU.S. first pursued CAFE, imported oil accounted for 36 percent of the \nnation's oil use; today imported oil accounts for 56 percent of U.S. \noil use. Twenty-eight percent of our nation's total oil consumption is \nused in the transportation sector.\n  Since CAFE was implemented in 1975, we have seen an approximate \ndoubling in the fuel economy of the nation's vehicle fleet. In 2000 \nalone, we saved over 3 million barrels of oil per day because of the \nfuel economy gains made since the mid-1970s. Clearly, a comprehensive \nenergy policy must incorporate provisions to reduce energy use in the \ntransportation sector--a goal that I believe can best be achieved by \nusing technological advances to boost the fuel economy of passenger \nvehicles.\n  I appreciate that Senator Bingaman and Senator Daschle recognized the \ncomplexity of CAFE issues. I look forward to reporting back in a few \nmonths with a solid piece of legislation, compiled through the entire \nCommerce Committee, to fill the current placeholder in the energy bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 1767. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nthat certain service in the American Field Service ambulance corps \nshall be considered active duty for the purposes of all laws \nadministered by the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege to join Senator McCain \nin introducing the American Field Service Recognition Act to correct \nthe long-standing injustice suffered by these courageous World War II \nveterans who saved the lives of so many American and Allied service \nmembers, but who have long been denied the veterans benefits that they \nneed and deserve.\n  The American Field Service was a corps of nearly 2200 Americans, who \ndrove ambulances into combat zones where American and Allied troops \nfought between 1939 and 1945. Twenty-seven were killed, seventy-one \nwere wounded, and at least twenty-three were captured during that time.\n  The AFS members were volunteers who wanted to contribute to the war \neffort, but many were ineligible for service in the U.S. Armed Forces \nbecause of their age or their physical disability. The AFS received \nsubstantial support from the American government and its personnel were \nassigned in the theaters of North Africa, Western Europe, and India-\nBurma. During the war, the AFS evacuated approximately 700,000 wounded \non these fronts.\n  Their application under a 1970's law for veterans' benefits was \nfinally, but only partially, approved in 1990. The request for \neligibility was that each AFS driver must have served under direct U.S. \nArmy command during prescribed periods of time. The result was to \nexclude AFS drivers who served in France and North Africa before \nJanuary 1943, half of the drivers who served in Italy, and all who \nserved in the India-Burma Theater. Overall, because of this narrow \ninterpretation of the law, fifty percent of the drivers who served \nunder fire were denied benefits given to other drivers who served in \nother combat regions.\n  Sadly, AFS drivers are passing away at an increasingly rapid rate. \nThere are currently 631 living drivers from World War II on the AFS \nroster, and 198 of them are still ineligible for benefits, including \nsix who have recently passed away without access to VA medical care. \nClearly, these courageous veterans, such as Clifford Bissler of Stuart, \nFL, who lost a leg and received two Purple Hearts for his service in \nthe India-Burma Theater, deserve the help and recognition that this \nlegislation will bring.\n\n[[Page S12450]]\n\n  In 1943, President Roosevelt wrote to the leader of AFS and said of \nthe drivers, ``In serving our allies, they serve America.'' It is long, \nlong past time for Congress to finally recognize the contributions of \nall of these dedicated Americans who served during World War II, \ngranting them the veteran's benefits and assistance that they very much \nneed and deserve. If you would like to cosponsor this bill, please \ncontact us or have your staff contact Duane Seward at 224-2008.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1768. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nimplement the Calfed Bay-Delta Program; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nauthorize the CALFED Bay Delta Program. I am pleased that Senator Boxer \nhas agreed to co-sponsor this bill with me. The bill that I am \nintroducing today is also supported by Senator Bingaman, the chairman \nof the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He has committed \nto helping move this bill through his committee and hopefully through \nthe Senate.\n  The most important thing about this new bill is that it fully \nauthorizes the CALFED Record of Decision and all the projects \nassociated with it with Federal costs of less than $10 million. Any \nprojects of more than $10 million that are ready to be constructed will \nbe reported to the authorizing committees in a package every 2 years.\n  This bill authorizes $2.4 billion to cover the one-third Federal \nshare of the CALFED program. The State and water users will each be \nresponsible for the other two-thirds.\n  California's population is 35 million today and could reach 50 \nmillion within the next 20 years. There simply is not enough water in \nthe system to meet the future demand. CALFED is the best hope we have \nto increase our water supply, preserve the environment and protect \nagainst a water emergency. I don't believe we can wait any longer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am very pleased to be joining Senator Feinstein today \nin the introduction of a bill that will help address California's water \nneeds. We have worked closely together on this effort over the last \nyear and I believe that this bill will help the CALFED program move \nforward in the right direction.\n  In California, as in many parts of the West, water is our lifeblood. \nFor decades, water allocation was conducted through endless appeals and \nlawsuits, and divisive ballot initiatives. Such battles were painful \nand, they prevented us from finding real solutions to our state's very \nreal water problems.\n  In 1994, a new state-federal partnership program called CALFED \npromised a better way--a plan to provide reliable, clean water to \nfarms, businesses, and millions of Californians while at the same time \nrestoring our fish, wildlife and environment. What has made CALFED work \nis that it employs a consensus approach that balances the needs of \nthese various interests.\n  This bill stays true to that balanced approach. It authorizes the \ncontinuation of the CALFED program over the next 5 years and provides \nfor a federal contribution of $2.4 billion over that time period. The \nbill requires that the CALFED program goals of protecting drinking \nwater quality, restoring ecological health, improving water supply \nreliability, and protecting Delta levees progress in a balanced manner. \nThe bill describes a detailed set of reports that should be provided to \nCongress prior to approving any project costing over $10 million. This \nreporting process is designed to ensure that major projects are not \napproved until the environmental and economic impacts are clearly \nunderstood.\n  I believe CALFED offers the best hope for ending California's \nintractable water wars. This bill will ensure that the CALFED program \ncan continue its good work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1769. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject for flood protection and ecosystem restoration for Sacramento, \nCalifornia, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. S. 1769, Mr. President, I am introducing a bill to \nimprove flood protection in Sacramento. This is a companion bill to one \nthat Representative Matsui is introducing today in the House.\n  Currently, Sacramento only has an 85-year flood protection. This bill \nwould raise the existing walls of Folsom Dam by 7 feet, which would \nimprove flood protection to 213 years. Without this improvement, $40 \nbillion of property, including the California State Capitol, 6 major \nhospitals, 26 nursing home facilities, over 100 schools, three major \nfreeway systems, and approximately 160,000 homes and apartments, are at \nrisk of a devastating flood.\n  For a city of its size, Sacramento falls shockingly below the 400 \nyear-level of flood protection enjoyed by other river cities such as \nSt. Louis, Tacoma, Dallas, and Kansas City. The Folsom mini raise is \nthe critical next step in providing Sacramento with an adequate level \nof flood protection.\n  Next year, the Environment and Public Works Committee, of which I am \na member, will reauthorize the Water Resources and Development Act. I \nhope this bill will be included as part that legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1770. A bill to implement the International Convention for the \nSuppression of Terrorist Bombings to strengthen criminal laws relating \nto attacks on places of public use, to implement the International \nConvention of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, to combat \nterrorism and defend the Nation against terrorist acts, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Terrorist Bombing \nConvention Implementation Act of 2001 and the Suppression of the \nFinancing of Terrorism Convention Implementation Act of 2001. This bill \nwould bring the United States into indisputable and immediate \ncompliance with two important international conventions, which were \nsigned by the United States and transmitted to the U.S. Senate for \nratification by President Clinton. Both Conventions were entered into \nafter the terrorist bombings at the United States embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania. The bill also contains a provision which would enhance \nthe ability of law enforcement authorities to work with their foreign \ncounterparts in fighting sophisticated international criminal \norganizations by sharing wiretap information when appropriate.\n  The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist \nBombings, ``Bombing Convention'', was adopted by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly in December 1997 and signed by the United States in \nJanuary 1998. In September 1999, it was transmitted to the Senate by \nPresident Clinton for ratification.\n  The International Convention for the Suppression of Financing \nTerrorism, ``Financing Convention'', was adopted by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly in December 1999 and signed by the United States in \nJanuary 2000. In October 2000, it was transmitted to the Senate by \nPresident Clinton for ratification.\n  Under the chairmanship of Senator Biden, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee has moved expeditiously to report these conventions to the \nfull Senate. Once ratified, they should be swiftly implemented. The \npassage of the proposed implementing legislation which I introduce \ntoday would ensure that the United States is in immediate compliance \nwith these international obligations relating to terrorism.\n  Both conventions require signatory nations to adopt criminal laws \nprohibiting specified terrorist activities in order to create a regime \nof universal jurisdiction over certain crimes. Articles 2 and 4 of the \nBombing Convention require signatory countries to criminalize the \ndelivery, placement, discharge or detonation of explosives and other \nlethal devices, ``in, into, or against'' various defined public places \nwith the intent to kill, cause serious bodily injury, or extensively \ndamage such public places. The Bombing Convention also requires that \nsignatories criminalize aiding and abetting, attempting, or conspiring \nto commit such crimes.\n  Articles 2 and 4 of the Financing Convention require signatory \ncountries to\n\n[[Page S12451]]\n\ncriminalize willfully ``providing or collecting'' funds, directly or \nindirectly, with knowledge that they are to be used to carry out acts \nwhich either 1. violate nine enumerated existing treaties, or 2. are \naimed at killing or injuring civilians with the purpose of intimidating \na population or compelling a government to do any act. The Financing \nConvention also requires that signatories criminalize aiding and \nabetting, attempting, or conspiring to commit such crimes. Signatories \nmust criminalize such acts under Article 2 whether or not ``the funds \nwere actually used to carry out'' such an offense.\n  Both conventions require that signatory nations exercise limited \nextraterritorial jurisdiction and extradite or prosecute those who \ncommit such crimes when found inside their borders. The conventions \nalso require that signatories ensure that, under their domestic laws, \npolitical, religious, ideological, racial or other similar \nconsiderations are not a justification for committing the enumerated \ncrimes. Thus, signatory nations will not be able to assert such bases \nto deny an extradition request for a covered crime. Finally, Article 4 \nof each convention requires that signatory states make the covered \noffenses ``punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account \nthe grave nature of [the] offenses.''\n  This proposed implementation legislation, consistent with the House \nversion of this bill, H.R. 3275, creates two new crimes, one for \nbombings and another for financing terrorist acts, that would track \nprecisely the language in the treaties, and bring the United States \ninto undisputed compliance. The bill would also provide \nextraterritorial jurisdiction as required by the conventions. \nFurthermore the bill would create domestic jurisdiction for these \ncrimes in limited situations where a national interest is implicated, \nwhile excluding jurisdiction over acts where the convention does not \nrequire such jurisdiction and there is no distinct federal interest \nserved.\n  The bill, again consistent with the H.R. 3275, also contains \n``ancillary provisions'' that would make the two new crimes predicates \nfor money laundering charges, wiretaps, RICO charges, an 8-year statute \nof limitations, include them as ``federal crimes of terrorism,'' and \nmake civil asset forfeiture available for the new terrorism financing \ncrime. Existing laws which relate to similar crimes are predicates for \neach of these tools, and providing law enforcement with these ancillary \nprovisions is both consistent and appropriate.\n  Neither international convention requires a death penalty provision \nfor any covered crime, and the Department of Justice has provided a \nmemorandum to Congress, in response to a request for its views, that \nsuch a provision would not be required to bring the United States into \ncompliance. This should come as no surprise, given international \nsentiment opposing the United States' use of the death penalty in other \ncontexts. Indeed, the inclusion of a death penalty provision in the \nimplementing legislation for these conventions could lead to \ncomplications in extraditing individuals to the United States from \ncountries that do not employ the death penalty. Therefore, unlike the \nHouse version of the implementing legislation, the Senate version \ncontains no new death penalty provision.\n  Unlike H.R. 3275, the bill does not contain a third crime for \n``concealment'' of material support for terrorists. The Department of \nJustice has conceded in the memorandum which it provided to Congress \nthat this provision is not necessary to bring the United States into \ncompliance with the conventions. Indeed, in the wake of the passage of \nsimilar provisions in the USA Patriot Act, P.L. No. 107-56, such \nlegislation is not needed. Furthermore, although a similar provision is \ncurrently set forth in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A, the House bill provides a \nlower mens rea requirement than that law; an important change which was \nnot highlighted in the Administration materials provided explaining the \nproposal.\n  Finally, the Senate bill contains an important new tool for \ninternational cooperation between law enforcement which is not included \nin H.R. 3275. Currently, there is no clear statutory authority which \nallows domestic law enforcement agents to share Title III wiretap \ninformation with foreign law enforcement counterparts. This may create \nproblems when, for example, the DEA wants to alert Colombian \nauthorities that a cocaine shipment is about to leave a Colombian port \nbut the information is derived from a Title III wiretap.\n  This bill would clarify the authority for sharing wiretap derived \ninformation, specifically in the Title III context. The bill provides a \nclear mechanism through which law enforcement may share wiretap \ninformation with foreign law enforcement, while at the same time \nensuring that there are appropriate safeguards to protect this \nsensitive information against misuse. It adds a subsection to 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2517, that permits disclosure of wiretap information to foreign \nofficials (1) with judicial approval, (2) in such a manner and under \nsuch conditions as a court may direct, and (3) consistent with Attorney \nGeneral guidelines on how the information may be used to protect \nconfidentiality. This clarification will provide an additional tool to \ninvestigate international criminal enterprises and to seek the \nassistance of foreign law enforcement in our efforts.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nand I urge its swift enactment into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, along with the sectional analysis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1770\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n               TITLE I--SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS\n\n     SEC. 101.

Twenty-eight States are \n     currently party to the Convention, which entered into force \n     internationally on May 23, 2001. The Convention requires \n     State Parties to combat terrorism by criminalizing certain \n     attacks on public places committed with explosives or other \n     lethal devices, including biological, chemical and \n     radiological devices. The Convention also requires that State \n     Parties criminalize aiding and abetting, conspiring and \n     attempting to undertake such terrorist attacks.\n\n\n                        Section 101. Short Title\n\n       Section 101 provides that title I may be cited as ``The \n     Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act of 2001.''\n\n\n                      Section 102. Bombing Statute\n\n       Section 102 adds a new section to the Federal criminal \n     code, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332f and entitled \n     ``Bombings of places of public use, government facilities, \n     public transportation systems and infrastructure \n     facilities,'' which makes terrorist acts covered by the \n     Convention a crime. New section 2332f supplements and does \n     not supplant existing Federal and State laws, and contains \n     five subsections, which are described below.\n       Subsection (a) makes it a crime to unlawfully place or \n     detonate an explosive in certain public places and facilities \n     with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or \n     with the intent to cause extensive destruction, where such \n     destruction results in, or is likely to result in, major \n     economic loss. Conspiracies and attempts to commit such \n     crimes are also criminalized. This provision implements \n     Article 2, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Convention.\n       Inclusion of the term ``unlawfully'' in subsection (a), \n     which is mirrored in Article 2 of the Convention defining the \n     offenses, is intended to allow what would be considered under \n     U.S. law as common law defenses. For purposes of subsection \n     (a), whether a person acts ``unlawfully'' will depend on \n     whether he is acting within the scope of authority recognized \n     under and consistent with existing U.S. law, which reflects \n     international law principles, such as self defense or lawful \n     use of force by police authorities. This language is not to \n     be construed as permitting the assertion, as a defense to \n     prosecution under new section 2332f, that a person \n     purportedly acted under authority conveyed by any particular \n     foreign government or official. Such a construction, which \n     would exempt State-sponsored terrorism, would be clearly at \n     odds with the purpose of the Convention and this implementing \n     legislation.\n       With respect to the mens rea provision of subsection (a), \n     it is sufficient if the intent is to significantly damage the \n     targeted public place or facility. Further, for the purpose \n     of subsection (a), when determining whether the act resulted \n     in, or was likely to result, major economic loss, the \n     physical damage to the targeted place or facility may be \n     considered, as well as other types of economic loss \n     including, but not limited to, the monetary loss or other \n     adverse effects resulting from the interruption of its \n     activities. The adverse effects on non-targeted entities and \n     individuals, the economy and the government may also be \n     considered in this determination insofar as they are due to \n     the destruction caused by the unlawful act.\n       Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdictional bases for the \n     covered offenses and includes jurisdiction over perpetrators \n     of offenses abroad who are subsequently found within the \n     United States. This provision implements a crucial element of \n     the Convention (Article 8(1)), which requires all State \n     Parties to either extradite or prosecute perpetrators of \n     offenses covered by the Convention who are found within the \n     jurisdiction of a State Party. While current Federal or\n\n[[Page S12454]]\n\n     State criminal laws encompass all the activity prohibited by \n     the Convention that occurs within the United States, \n     subsection (b)(1) ensures Federal jurisdiction where there is \n     a unique Federal interest e.g., a foreign government is the \n     victim of the crime or the offense is committed in an attempt \n     to compel the United States to do or abstain from doing any \n     act.\n       Subsection (c) establishes the penalties for committing the \n     covered crimes at any term of years or life. This provision \n     differs from the Administration proposal, which sought to add \n     a new death penalty provision for this crime, despite the \n     fact that such a provision is not required for compliance \n     under the Convention and may create hurdles in seeking \n     extradition to the United States under this statute.\n       Subsection (d) sets forth certain exemptions to \n     jurisdiction as provided by the Convention. Specifically, the \n     subsection exempts from jurisdiction activities of armed \n     forces during an armed conflict and activities undertaken by \n     military forces of a State in the exercise of their official \n     duties.\n       Subsection (e) contains definitions of twelve terms that \n     are used in the new law. Six of those definitions (``State or \n     government facility,'' ``infrastructure facility,'' ``place \n     of public use,'' ``public transportation system,'' ``other \n     lethal device,'' and ``military forces of a State'') are the \n     same definitions used in the Convention. Four additional \n     definitions (``serious bodily injury,'' ``explosive,'' \n     ``national of the United States,'' and ``intergovernmental \n     organization'') are definitions that already exist in other \n     U.S. statutes. One of those definitions (``armed conflict'') \n     is defined consistent with an international instrument \n     relating to the law of war, and a U.S. Understanding to the \n     Convention that is recommended to be made at the time of U.S. \n     ratification. The final term (``State'') has the same meaning \n     as that term has under international law.\n\n\n                      Section 103. Effective Date\n\n       Since the purpose of Title I is to implement the \n     Convention, section 103 provides that the new criminal \n     offense created in Section 102 will not become effective \n     until the date that the Convention enters into force in the \n     United States. This will ensure immediate compliance of the \n     United States with its obligations under the Convention.\n\n\n          Title II. Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism\n\n       Title II implements the International Convention for the \n     Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was signed \n     by the United States on January 10, 2000, and was transmitted \n     to the Senate for its advice and consent to ratification on \n     October 12, 2000. The Convention is not yet in force \n     internationally, but will enter into force 30 days after the \n     deposit of the 22nd instrument of ratification with the U.N. \n     Secretary-General. Once in force, the Convention requires \n     State Parties to combat terrorism by criminalizing certain \n     financial transactions made in furtherance of various \n     terrorist activities. The Convention also requires that State \n     Parties criminalize conspiracies and attempts to undertake \n     such financing.\n\n\n                        Section 201. Short title\n\n       Section 201 provides that title II may be cited as ``The \n     Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Convention \n     Implementation Act of 2001.''\n\n\n                Section 202. Terrorism Financing Statute\n\n       Section 202(a) adds a new section to the Federal criminal \n     code, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C and entitled \n     ``Prohibitions against the financing of terrorism,'' which \n     makes financial acts covered by the Convention a crime. New \n     section 2339C supplements and does not supplant existing \n     Federal and State laws, and contains five subsections, which \n     are described below.\n       Subsection (a) makes it a crime to provide or collect funds \n     with the intention or knowledge that such funds are to be \n     used to carry out certain terrorist acts. Conspiracies and \n     attempts to commit these crimes are also criminalized. This \n     subsection implements Article 2, paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of \n     the Convention.\n       Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdictional bases for the \n     covered offenses under section 2339C(a) and includes \n     jurisdiction over perpetrators of offenses abroad who are \n     subsequently found within the United States. This provision \n     implements a crucial element of the Convention (Article 10), \n     which requires all State Parties to either extradite or \n     prosecute perpetrators of offenses covered by the Convention \n     who are found within the territory of a State Party. The \n     structure of this provision is designed to accommodate the \n     structure of the Convention, which sets forth both mandatory \n     and permissive bases of jurisdiction, and excludes certain \n     offenses that lack an international nexus. Some portions of \n     this provision go beyond the jurisdictional bases required or \n     expressly permitted under the Convention, however, where \n     expanded jurisdiction is desirable from a policy perspective \n     because a unique Federal interest is implicated and is \n     consistent with the Constitution.\n       Subsection (c) established the penalties for committing the \n     covered crimes at imprisonment for not more than 20 years, a \n     fine under title 18, United States Code, or both. This \n     penalty is consistent with the current penalties for money \n     laundering offenses. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956.\n       Subsection (d) contains 13 definitions of terms that are \n     used in the new law. Two of those definitions (``government \n     facility,'' and ``proceeds'') are the same definitions used \n     in the Convention. The definition for ``funds'' is identical \n     to that contained in the Convention with the exception that \n     coins and currency are expressly mentioned as money. The \n     definitions for ``provides'' and ``collects'' reflect the \n     broad scope of the Convention. The definition for ``predicate \n     acts'' specifies the activity for which the funds were being \n     provided or collected. These are the acts referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 2339C(a)(1). The \n     definition of ``treaty'' sets forth the nine international \n     conventions dealing with counter-terrorism found in the Annex \n     to the Convention. The term ``intergovernmental \n     organization,'' which is used in the Convention, is \n     specifically defined to make clear that it contains within \n     its ambit existing international organizations. The \n     definitions for ``international organization,'' ``serious \n     bodily injury.'' and ``national of the United States'' \n     incorporate definitions for those terms that already exist in \n     other U.S. statues. One of the definitions (``armed \n     conflict'') is defined consistent with international \n     instruments relating to the law of war. The final term \n     (``State'') has the same meaning as that term has under \n     international law.\n       Subsection (e) creates a civil penalty of at least $10,000 \n     payable to the United States, against any legal entity in the \n     United States, if any person responsible for the management \n     or control of that legal entity has, in that capacity, \n     committed an offense set forth in subsection (a) of the new \n     section 2339C. This civil penalty may be imposed regardless \n     of whether there is a conviction of such person under \n     subsection (a), and is in addition to any other criminal, \n     civil, or administrative liability or penalty allowable under \n     United States law. Subsection (e) fulfills Article 5 of the \n     Convention.\n\n\n                      Section 203. Effective Date\n\n       Section 203 provides that those provisions of the Act that \n     may be implemented immediately shall become effective upon \n     enactment. However, two jurisdictional provisions will not \n     become effective until the Financing Convention enters into \n     force for the United States. Those provisions are the new 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2339C(b)(1)(D) and (2)(B). In addition, new \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C(d)(7)(1), which is a definitional \n     section specifically linked to the Bombing Convention, will \n     not become effective until that Convention enters into \n     effect.\n\n\n                     TITLE III. Ancillary Measures\n\n       Title III, which is not required by the International \n     Conventions but will assist in federal enforcement, adds the \n     new 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2332f and 2339C to several existing \n     provisions of law.\n\n\n                    Section 301. Ancillary Measures\n\n       Sections 2332f and 2339C are made predicates under the \n     wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1)(q)) and under the \n     statute relating to the provision of material support to \n     terrorists (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A). Sections 2332f and 2339C \n     are also added to those offenses defined as a ``Federal crime \n     of terrorism'' under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332b(g)(5)(B), as \n     amended by the USA PATRIOT Act. P.L. No. 107-56. In addition, \n     a provision is added to the civil asset forfeiture statute \n     that makes this tool available in the case of a violation of \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C. These provisions are consistent with \n     the treatment of similar Federal crimes already in existence.\n\n\n           TITLE IV. Foreign Disclosure of Wiretap Intercepts\n\n       This provision, which is not required by the International \n     Conventions, clarifies that Federal law enforcement \n     authorities may disclose otherwise confidential wiretap \n     information to their foreign counterparts with appropriate \n     judicial approval. This provision is intended to ensure \n     effective cooperation between domestic and foreign law \n     enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of \n     international criminal organizations.\n\n\n                        Section 401. Short Title\n\n       Section 401 provides that title IV may be cited as ``The \n     Foreign Law Enforcement Cooperation Act of 2001.''\n\n\n               Section 402. Amendment to Wiretap Statute\n\n       Section 402 adds a new subsection to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2517 \n     that governs the disclosure of otherwise confidential \n     information gathered pursuant to a Title III wiretap. This \n     provision clarifies the authority of domestic law enforcement \n     officers to disclose such information as may show a violation \n     of either domestic or foreign criminal law to foreign law \n     enforcement officials. The provision requires a court order \n     prior to making such a disclosure and sets the standards for \n     the issuance of such an order. It is intended to allow \n     foreign disclosure only to enforce the criminal laws of \n     either the United States or the foreign nation. It also \n     requires that an attorney for the government certify that the \n     foreign officials who are to receive the wiretap information \n     have been informed of the Attorney General's guidelines \n     protecting confidentiality. This provision is intended to \n     enhance the ability of domestic law enforcement to work with \n     their foreign counterparts to investigate international \n     criminal activity at the same time as protecting against \n     improper use of such wiretap information.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 1773. A bill to designate the Richard J. Guadagno Headquarters and \nVisitors Center at Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge, California; \nto\n\n[[Page S12455]]\n\nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a bill to honor a \nCalifornia, Richard J. Guadagno, who sadly lost his life on United \nFlight 93 when it crashed in Western Pennsylvania on September 11. This \nlegislation will designate the Headquarters and Visitors Center of the \nHumboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge as the Richard J. Guadagno \nHeadquarters and Visitors Center. Representative Thompson introduced \nthis bill in the House.\n  Mr. Guadagno was the manager of the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife \nRefuge and devoted his life to the preservation of wildlife. As refuge \nmanager at the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife Refuge, he lead with a \nvision that his colleagues embraced and admired. He always keep the \nbest interests of the refuge at heart, and he enthusiastically worked \nto improve the condition of the refuge. Colleagues in the Fish and \nWildlife Service consistently commended his courage and dedication to \nconservation and protecting biological diversity.\n  Mr. Guadagno began a career in public service as a biologist at the \nNew Jersey Fish and Game Department and the Great Swamp National \nWildlife Refuge. Before joining the Humboldt Bay National Wildlife \nRefuge, he worked at the Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge in \nDelaware, Supawna Meadows National Refuge in New Jersey, and the \nBaskett Slough and Ankeny National Wildlife Refuges in Oregon.\n  Richard Guadagno worked his entire life to preserve our Nation's \nwildlife. This legislation will ensure that we have a lasting memory of \nhis work.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1774. A bill to accord honorary citizenship to the alien victims \nof September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States and \nto provide for the granting of citizenship to the alien spouses and \nchildren of certain victims of such attacks; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Terrorist Victim Citizenship Relief Act, that would quickly provide \ncitizenship relief to hundreds of families adversely affected by the \nattacks of September 11, 2001.\n  Today I am meeting with several of the families of the victims of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks to discuss crucial legislation that \nwould provide them with tax relief in the wake of a national calamity. \nThey are dealing with a personal anguish that many of us can only \nimagine. It is critical that the House of Representatives move swiftly \nto pass the tax relief legislation that has already passed the Senate, \nby unanimous consent, I might add. But there is more that Congress must \ndo to account for the shocking and unanticipated failure of the \nexisting legal framework in the aftermath of September 11. I believe \nthat the Terrorist Victim Citizenship Relief Act is an important part \nof this vitally necessary overhaul.\n  When American citizens, foreign nationals, and immigrants perished in \nthe cowardly terrorist acts of September 11, the immigration status of \nhundreds of families was thrown into turmoil. The attacks were on \nAmerican soil on a major American institution and directed at the \nUnited States. Yet American citizens were not the only victims. \nHundreds of temporary workers and immigrants died shoulder-to-shoulder \nwith thousands of Americans. Their deaths should be acknowledged and \ntheir families should be honored.\n  My legislation would bestow honorary citizenship on legal immigrants \nand non-immigrants who died in the disaster. This would honor their \nspirit and their tremendous sacrifice. Perhaps more important, the bill \nwould offer citizenship to surviving spouses and children, subject to a \nbackground investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In the \nspirit of fairness and unity, it is appropriate and responsible to \noffer the privilege of citizenship to families who lost so much because \nof this attack on the United States.\n  More than 3,000 people lost their lives when four planes crashed on \nthat fateful September morning. Bodies are still being uncovered, and \nthe death count has been revised several times. Nationals from some 86 \ncountries perished in the attack, including visitors, non-immigrant \nworkers, and legal permanent residents.\n  America was not the only country that suffered losses. There was good \nreason the complex was called the World Trade Center. In the September \n11 attacks, England lost 75 people, with 60 other British nationals \nunaccounted for. India lost more than 100. Germany has 31 confirmed \ncasualties. Mexico has 19. Colombia has 15. Japan has as many as 21. \nCanada, Australia, the Philippines, Ireland, South Africa, and Pakistan \nall suffered tragic losses. And there were many more. It would be wrong \nto allow the tragic destruction of that fateful day to derail the hopes \nof hundreds of immigrant families to secure a better life for \nthemselves and their children in the United States. And we must \nacknowledge the hundreds of families from 86 countries who lost loved \nones in the attack.\n  In New Jersey, there are dozens of poignant stories of immigrant \nfamilies who experienced tragic losses in the World Trade Center \ndisaster. These innocent people have lost husbands and wives, sons and \ndaughters, sisters and brothers. Their families have been fractured and \ntheir livelihoods jeopardized. Immigrant families have been forced to \ngrapple with a bureaucratic nightmare, wading through the myriad of \nprograms available to the families of victims in an effort to keep \ntheir heads above water. They are often disheartened to learn that, \nalthough their loved ones died in the same attack, non-citizens are \nineligible for many of the programs designed to assist the surviving \nfamilies of victims.\n  Concerns about immigration status have only added to the tremendous \nburden immigrant families are already confronting. Take the example of \none New Jersey woman who came to my office seeking assistance. Her \nimmigration status was directly dependent on the non-immigrant worker \nstatus of her husband who died in the attack. Both of her children were \nborn in the United States. They are full citizens and are enrolled in \nAmerican schools. She wants to continue to raise her children in the \nUnited States. However, under the antiterrorism legislation that \nCongress passed this month, this mother of two will be allowed just one \nadditional year to sort out her affairs before being forced to uproot \nher children and return to England.\n  One year is simply not enough to compensate this innocent woman for \nthe loss of her husband. My legislation would grant her citizenship \nimmediately, helping her to avoid the burden of removing her children \nfrom the only country they have ever truly known after having just lost \ntheir father. Granting her citizenship is the right thing to do.\n  But, this woman's story is one of hundreds. My office has received \nnumerous inquiries from immigrant families concerned that their \nimmigration status has been undermined by the death of a loved one. \nMany families were in the process of preparing the necessary paperwork \nto apply for a change in status, only to have their potential sponsor \ndie alongside thousands of others in the World Trade Center attack. \nThis legislation would ensure that those families would be allowed to \nbecome American citizens and avoid undue paperwork and heartache.\n  More than two months have passed since the United States was brutally \nattacked. When perpetrating their horrific crime, the terrorists did \nnot distinguish between immigrants and American citizens or between \nundocumented workers and legal permanent residents. They were attacking \nthe United States, and, in the process, killed thousands, citizens and \nnon-citizens alike. In death, citizenship was irrelevant. In death, \nthey were all unified.\n  The thousands who died did not know it when they went to work, but \nthey were at the front lines in the next American war. Their deaths are \na tragedy that every civilized human being wishes could be reversed. \nUnfortunately, we cannot turn back the clock. However, we can \nacknowledge the tremendous loss of hundreds of immigrant families by \nallowing them to take on the full rights and responsibilities of \nAmerican citizenship.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation, and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S12456]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1774\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the naturalization of Deena Gilbey; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce private \nlegislation granting citizenship to Deena Gilbey, a woman profoundly \naffected by the disaster of September 11. Since then, Deena has endured \na tremendous hardship, a hardship that has been compounded by mounting \npaperwork and an unyielding, dispassionate bureaucratic process. \nWithout swift congressional action, Deena, a British national, will be \nforced to uproot her two children and remove them from the only country \nthey have ever known just one year from the death of their father.\n  Deena Gilbey first moved to the United States in July 1993 when Paul, \nher husband was transferred from London to the New York office of Euro \nBank. They spent the eight years that followed building a life in the \nUnited States in suburban Chatham Township. They began to raise two \nchildren, Max, 7, and Mason, 3, both of whom were born in the United \nStates. Although the children are both U.S. citizens, Deena is not and \nwas present in the county as part of her husband's H1-B work visa. Both \nDeena and Paul were attempting to become citizens when disaster struck.\n  For all Americans, September 11 will be remembered with a deep \nsadness. However, that national anguish took on a personal quality for \nthe Gibleys when the family learned that Paul, like so many others, was \nlost beneath the rubble of the World Trade Center.\n  With the death of Paul, Deena was forced to face up to the difficult \nrealization that her own lawful status in the United States was in \njeopardy. For the first several weeks after he died, it was unclear \nwhether Deena would be allowed to leave the country and spend time with \nfamily or even work to support her children. The anti-terrorism bill \nthat passed the Congress earlier this year was a step in the right \ndirection. But it did not go far enough. It did not give Deena and \nPaul's children the stability they deserve.\n  The anti-terrorism legislation that passed the Congress earlier this \nyear allowed Deena to remain in the United States just one additional \nyear to sort out her affairs. She had just one year to wrap up the life \nshe and Paul had made together in the United States. She had just one \nyear to prepare her children for the trauma of moving to a foreign \ncountry and of leaving the only country that had ever been home. One \nadditional year is simply not enough.\n  When Paul died in the attack on the World Trade Center, he died with \nthousands of Americans. Before that, he contributed to the American \neconomy for nearly a decade, paying taxes and lending his expertise in \na highly specialized field. On that fateful day, he embodied the \nAmerican spirit when he assisted coworkers in escaping the fire and \ndestruction of ground zero.\n  Paul Gilbey was killed in a callous and cowardly attack on America. \nIn the aftermath of this tragic event, we have a responsibility to help \nensure that stability returns to the lives of the children he left \nbehind.\n  Giving citizenship to Deena Gilbey is our patriotic responsibility. I \nhope this Congress will acknowledge her sacrifice and allow her and her \nchildren to remain in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1776\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATURALIZATION OF DEENA GILBEY.\n\n       Notwithstanding title III of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) Deena Gilbey shall be \n     entitled to naturalization as a citizen of the United States \n     upon being administered the oath of renunciation and \n     allegiance in an appropriate ceremony pursuant to section 337 \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Upon naturalization \n     of Deena Gilbey under this Act, the Attorney General shall \n     record the date of naturalization of Deena Gilbey as being \n     September 10, 2001.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12456-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12456-S12457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 187--COMMENDING THE STAFFS OF MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, \n   THE CAPITOL POLICE, THE OFFICE OF THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND HIS \nHEALTH CARE STAFF, AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE CAPITOL HILL COMMUNITY FOR \n THEIR COURAGE AND PROFESSIONALISM DURING THE DAYS AND WEEKS FOLLOWING \n           THE RELEASE OF ANTHRAX IN SENATOR DASCHLE'S OFFICE\n\n  Mr. CLELAND (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Allen, Mr. Cochran, Mr. \nMiller, and Mr. Akaka) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that \nwill recognize the courage and professionalism of Congressional Staff, \nthe Capitol Police, and other members of the Capitol Hill Community \nfollowing the release of anthrax in Senator Daschle's office. In the \naftermath of the first-ever evacuation of the Capitol and surrounding \noffice buildings due to the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, \nand especially after the bioterrorist attack on the Congress and the \nCapitol Hill Community it is important to acknowledge the approximately \n30,000 legislative branch employees who work on Capitol Hill including, \napproximately 6,200 Senate employees, 11,500 House employees, and \n12,800 additional staff from other entities who have been affected by \nthe release of anthrax in Senator Daschle's office. Therefore, in \nrecognition of their outstanding public service in continuing to do the \npublic's business in defiance of the terrorist attacks I am submitting \na resolution to commend Congressional employees, the Capitol Police, \nthe Office of the Attending Physician and his health care staff, and \nother members of the Capitol Hill community for their dedication to \npublic service.\n  This legislation acknowledges the extensive grounds of the Capitol \ncomplex which consists of the Capitol building, three Senate office \nbuildings, three House office buildings, two House annex buildings, \nthree Library of Congress buildings, and several other facilities that \ncomprise the Capitol complex of approximately 285 acres. The Office of \nthe Attending Physician, in response to the release of anthrax in \nSenator Daschle's office, tested approximately 6,000 individuals for \nexposure to anthrax, 28 of whom were positive. In addition, \napproximately 1,000 individuals received 60-day supply of antibiotics \nas a precautionary measure and the Senate and House office buildings \nwere closed while investigators and bioterrorism experts decontaminated \nthe offices exposed to anthrax.\n  During the closure of the Senate and House office buildings, Members \nand staff were forced to find alternative office space or work from \ntheir homes. Members and staff whose offices are located in the Hart \nSenate Office Building continue to utilize alternative office space \nincluding office space donated by other Members. Senate, House, and \nsupport staff continued to perform their duties and serve the public \nwith courage and professionalism in spite of the threat of exposure to \nanthrax. In addition, Capitol Hill police officers worked 12 hour \nshifts in response to the September 11, attacks and have been working \nadditional overtime since anthrax contamination in the Capitol Complex \nto ensure the safety of Members, staff, and visitors within the Capitol \nComplex. Finally, the release of anthrax and subsequent contamination \nof Congressional offices disrupted the daily routines of Congressional \nMembers and their staffs and caused frustration due to dislocated \noffices.\n  My legislation commends the Congressional leadership, Congressional \nemployees, the Capitol Police, the Office of the Attending Physician \nand the health care professionals in his office, in particular, for \ntheir quick actions and early intervention which prevented actual cases \nof anthrax within the Capitol Complex. Capitol Hill employees deserve \nto be commended for their strength, courage, and professionalism since \nthe September 11 attacks and this resolution asks the President to \nrecognize them for their unwavering commitment to public service in \ncontinuing to do the public's business in defiance of the terrorist \nattacks. Thank you to Senators Allen, Feingold, Cochran, Miller, and \nAkaka who have signed on as cosponsors to this legislation. I encourage \nother Senators to join us in this worthy recognition of the Capitol \nHill community by cosponsoring this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12457-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12457-S12458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 88--EXPRESSING SOLIDARITY WITH ISRAEL IN \n                      THE FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bond, \nMrs. Boxer, Mr. Brownback, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Carper, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nDorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Hutchinson, \nMr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. McConnell, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Torricelli) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, on Saturday evening, December 15, the Las \nVegas Philharmonic will be recognizing the work of one of Nevada's true \ncultural treasures, Vassili Sulich. I am pleased to speak of the vision \nand the accomplishments of this fine man.\n  In 1981, Vassili Sulich received the State of Nevada Governor's Arts \nAward for ``Outstanding Individual Artist,'' an award which recognized \nhis role in establishing the Nevada Dance Theatre and for bringing \nclassical ballet to southern Nevada. This award is only one of many \nthat have been bestowed upon Mr. Sulich, but it represents what he has \nmeant, and still means for the cultural evolution of my home state.\n  Born on the island of Brac, Yugoslavia, Vassili Sulich began \nimagining and improvising performances from an early age. As a refugee \nin Egypt, during World War II, he joined a Yugoslav children's theatre, \nwhich continued performing in Europe after the war. He received \nclassical dance training with the Zagreb Opera Ballet, and he remained \nin the theatre ever since.\n  In 1952, he received a scholarship to study in London. One year \nlater, he moved to Paris to be a member of the Ballet de France de \nJanine Charrat. Paris became his home for eleven years, where he rose \nto the status of Danseur Etoile; first with Ballet des Etoiles de Paris \nand later with other companies and opera houses.\n  During this time, he performed as a principal dancer in many ballets, \npartnering such famous ballerinas as Ludmilla Tcherina, Zizi Jeanmarie, \nand Colette Marchand. He made many appearances on television and film, \nand starred in ``Geraldine'' with Geraldine Chaplin.\n  In 1960, Vassili was named the principal dancer at the Lido de Paris, \nand he began his choreographic career with ``Suite Lyrique,'' ``The \nWall,'' and ``Oedipe-Roi'' with Jean Cocteau and composer Maurice \nThiriet. In 1964, he came to New York as a principal dancer with \n``Folies Bergere'' on Broadway and to study with Martha Graham.\n  That same year, he was offered a three-month contract by the producer \nof the ``Folies Bergere'' at the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas. It \nturned out to be a collaboration that lasted nine years. He was also \nnamed as ballet master, rehearsing and employing replacements for \ndancers and showgirls. The management of the Tropicana was always \navailable to help, and even recreated a studio atmosphere in the \ntheatre for ballet instruction in the afternoons and between shows.\n  After several years in Las Vegas, Sulich missed the beauty and focus \nof classical ballet, and he approached the University of Nevada, Las \nVegas, offering to teach classical dance. That same year, he organized \nhis first ``Dance Concert'' in the UNLV Judy Bayley Theatre, \nchoreographing three ballets for 26 voluntary dancers from shows on the \nLas Vegas Strip. The program received such enthusiastic acclaim that in \nMay of 1973, he presented a second Dance Concert. The projects were \nlabors of love: no one was paid, the dancers furnished their own \ncostumes, and the university provided technical support.\n  In 1974, a board of directors was formed, and the Nevada Dance \nTheatre came into existence, with Vassili Sulich at the helms as \nArtistic Director. Within a few years, the Nevada Dance Theatre was \nhome to 23 professional dancers, providing classical ballet at home and \ntouring the United States to critical acclaim. The Company was even \nrecognized by Dance Magazine as one of the 10 best regional ballet \ncompanies in America.\n  Since founding the Nevada Dance Theatre, Sulich has choreographed \nfifty-one ballets, ranging from classical to contemporary to dramatic \nworks with wide audience appeal. One of his works, ``Mantodea,'' \nreceived international acclaim in Bulgaria and Russia and was filmed \nfor Belgrade television. He has staged ``Mantodea'' for ballet \ncompanies in Canada, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Hungary, and \nthe United States. And just this year, he was again commissioned to \nstage the ballet in Brazil.\n  After twenty-five years, Vassili Sulich retired from the Nevada Dance \nTheatre, but he has not retired from cultural service. He was \ninstrumental in the forming of the Las Vegas Philharmonic, and he has \nrecently penned an autobiography, ``Vision in the Desert: A Dancer's \nLife.''\n  I am proud to take this opportunity to congratulate Vassili Sulich \nfor a lifetime of artistic achievement. He is indeed a cultural \ntreasure and an ambassador for the arts in Nevada, our nation and the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12459-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12459-S12460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                       payment for work performed\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, regarding this week's Senate passage \nof the fiscal year 2002 Transportation appropriations conference \nreport, Senator Durbin and I have recently become aware that several of \nthe major contractors on the Tren Urbano project have substantial \ndisputes outstanding with Puerto Rico concerning payment for work \nperformed on the project. I find this troubling given the extent of \noversight we have come to expect of major transit projects like this \none.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly agree with Senator Hutchison. It is indeed \nimportant that these transit projects be managed efficiently, and \npreferably without dispute; otherwise, these projects are viewed by the \ncontracting community as more risky, and thus they become more costly \nto deliver, to the detriment of the taxpayers who ultimately bear the \nfinancial burden of these projects.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I understand that the FTA is currently withholding \napproximately $165M of funding for the Tren Urbano Project, and has \nrequired a more accurate cost estimate and schedule for the Project \nthan has been previously furnished.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to encourage FTA to release only such funds as it \nconsiders appropriate in order to resolve outstanding disputes with \nrespect to payment for work performed on the Tren Urbano project, and \nsuspend all further Federal funding for the project.\n\n[[Page S12460]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I concur with the Senator and, if such disputes have \nnot been resolved by March 1, 2002, would further request that the \nInspector General promptly report back to the House and Senate \nCommittees on Appropriations on FTA's assessment of (i) The reasons why \nsuch disputes remain unresolved, (ii) the cost impact of such disputes, \nand (iii) the IG's recommendation, if appropriate, for a more cost \neffective dispute resolution process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12460-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 11, \n2001 in Milwaukee, WI. A lesbian woman, Juana Vega, was brutally \nassaulted and shot five times at point-blank range. Pablo Parrilla, the \nbrother of Vega's then-girlfriend, has been arrested in connection with \nVega's murder. Mr. Parilla objected to his sister's relationship with \nVega, and reportedly threatened to kill Vega for ``turning his sister \ngay.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12460-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOLD ON NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, the Senate Appropriations Committee \nyesterday marked-up H.R. 3338, the FY 2002 Department of Defense \nAppropriations Bill. I authored language in the report accompanying \nthat bill requiring the Pentagon to report to Congress on Thailand's \ndefense needs in the wake of Burma's recent purchase of 10 MiG-29 \nfighter aircraft from Russia. I did so because of my grave concerns \nwith regional security and stability--and with the welfare of the \npeople of Burma who endure hardships and indignities under the \noppressive misrule of the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). \nIn terms of oppressive regimes, the SPDC ranks right up there with the \nTaliban.\n  My colleagues should take note of the November 28 edition of Jane's \nDefence Weekly which states that Burma has ``significantly expanded the \ncountry's military strength while most other [countries] in the region \nare pursuing force reductions . . . military modernization since 1988 \nhas been heavily tied to China as the principal source of equipment--\nvariously valued at between $1 billion and $2 billion. [The purchase of \nthe MiGs from Russia] following up its 1996 purchase of Mi-17 \nhelicopters, suggests that a new dimension could dominate the next \nphase of development . . . [the SPDC] has stated publicly that armed \nforces strength has been targeted to expand by a further 25 percent, to \n500,000.''\n  Lest my colleagues fail to understand what is happening in Rangoon \ntoday, let me sketch a quick outline:\n  The legitimately elected leader of Burma--Daw Aung San Suu Kyi of the \nNational League for Democracy (NLD)--continues to be under house arrest \nin Rangoon, with up to 1,800 political prisoners languishing in Burmese \nprisons. While SPDC thugs and Suu Kyi are engaged in ``talks'', the \njunta is building up its military strength and purchasing billions of \ndollars of military hardware from Russia and China. To say that the \ndefense build-up sends conflicting messages to the NLD and the world is \na gross understatement.\n  Meanwhile, the people of Burma suffer from neglect and abuse at the \nhands of the SPDC who attached absolutely no importance to the welfare \nof Burmese citizens. None. And to make matters worse, Japan appears to \nbe rewarding the SPDC by providing a grant aid to Burma for the repair \nof the Baluchaung Hydroelectric Power Plant in Karenni State. The \nJapanese government must understand that such assistance is not only \npremature, it is also misguided. Money is certainly the language of the \nthugs and thieves in Burma, but it cannot buy peace and stability in \nthat mafia state.\n  I encourage my colleagues to read Fred Hiatt's excellent op-ed in \nMonday's edition of the Washington Post, and ask that it appear in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 3, 2001]\n\n                             Eyes Wide Open\n\n                            (By Fred Hiatt)\n\n       One inevitable reaction, as we hear now of the depredations \n     of the Taliban regime, is: Where were we all while this was \n     going on?\n       Oh, some feminists and human rights activists tried to call \n     our attention to Afghanistan's gender apartheid. Journalists, \n     including The Post's Pam Constable, reported from Kabul. We \n     took note briefly when religious minorities were ordered to \n     wear identifying marks and when those ancient statues were \n     destroyed.\n       But for most of us, the recent revelations of Taliban \n     brutality--of forced conscription, point-blank murder, \n     scorched-earth destruction and merciless impoverishment of \n     widows and children--have been just that, revelations. As the \n     Bush administration rails righteously against a regime it \n     barely seemed to notice before Sept. 11, we have to ask: \n     Where were they--where were we--these five long years? How \n     could we have let it happen?\n       One way to answer the question is to look at places where \n     it is happening still.\n       This week past Nobel Peace Prize winners will gather in \n     Oslo to honor one missing laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, the \n     rightful leader of the Southeast Asian nation of Burma, \n     wasn't allowed to pick up her prize in 1991, and a decade \n     later she remains under house arrest and cut off from the \n     world. Her countrymen--some 48 million of them, more or less \n     double Afghanistan's population--are preyed upon by their \n     leaders much as Afghans were by theirs.\n       The facts are depressingly familiar to the relatively few \n     who follow events in Burma (renamed Myanmar by the junta). A \n     promising, resource-rich nation with a well-educated and \n     peaceable population has been ground gradually toward poverty \n     and ignorance by a succession of malevolent and misguided \n     rulers.\n       In 1990 the ruling junta, apparently deluded about its \n     popularity, as dictators frequently are, staged elections. \n     The National League for Democracy, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, \n     won four out of every five parliamentary seats, even though \n     she was already under house arrest. Instead of letting the \n     parliament meet, the generals put many of the winners in \n     jail, where some remain to this day.\n       Among juntas, Burma's is particularly famous for its use of \n     forced unpaid labor. As many as 1 million Burmese, by the \n     estimate of the International Confederation of Free Trade \n     Unions, have been press-ganged into building roads, railroads \n     and military installations. Many of the conscripted are \n     children. Many are forced to act as porters for the army, \n     often in dangerous circumstances.\n       The generals, fearing the people they rule, maintain an \n     army of 400,000. They have shuttered the country's \n     universities for most of the past decade. People are jailed \n     for possession of unlicensed fax machines. Media are \n     controlled by the state. Some 1,500 people\n\n[[Page S12461]]\n\n     are in prison for political crimes, mostly for having sought \n     to peacefully express opinions of which the regime did not \n     approve. In a country where one in three children is \n     malnourished, the generals recently agreed to buy from Russia \n     a dozen advanced MiG-29 fighter jets.\n       The combined effect of repression and the military's \n     incompetence is ever-worsening poverty. In the past year, the \n     local currency has lost half its value. The only export on an \n     upward curve is heroin. Vast acreages of rain forest have \n     been destroyed to feed the generals' corruption. Just in the \n     past two months, the BBC recently reported, food prices have \n     doubled, and power outages have become routine. HIV-AIDS is \n     spreading fast.\n       Despite democracy's advances around the world in recent \n     years, the Burmese assuredly are not the only people still \n     enchained. North Koreans, Chinese, Belarusians, Iraqis, \n     Cubans--all are denied their freedoms, yet none is about to \n     be liberated by U.S. bombing. There's a limit to what we can \n     do, and what we should do.\n       Yet in all of those places the United States can and should \n     press for freedom. In Burma, economic sanctions are beginning \n     to have some effect. Concerned about their image and the \n     economy, the generals have released some 200 political \n     prisoners and at least entertained the efforts of a U.N. \n     envoy, now on his sixth trip to the nation. If other \n     countries remain steadfast in supporting Aung San Suu Kyi--\n     refusing to provide aid, for example, except in consultation \n     with her--there's some hope for more progress.\n       Burma, after all, would require no nation-building, no Bonn \n     conferences, no search for a viable opposition. A qualified \n     and democratically elected leader waits quietly in her \n     lakefront Rangoon house, still committed after a decade to \n     human rights and nonviolent change. When she finally moves to \n     the prime minister's office that belongs to her, and the \n     Burmese people cheer their liberation as many Afghans have \n     been cheering theirs, it would be nice if we could say at \n     least: We're not surprised. We knew that terrible things were \n     happening. We were with you all along.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12461-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANDEAN TRADE PREFERENCE ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) \nexpired yesterday. Signed into law in 1991 by the former President \nBush, this Act established a unique approach to combating the War on \nDrugs in Latin America. Rather than assisting Bolivia, Colombia, \nEcuador, and Peru solely through military assistance or direct \nfinancial aid, the supporters of ATPA sought to reduce drug trafficking \nthrough economic expansion. It was believed that increased trade would \npromote healthy economies, diversify export bases, and create jobs \noutside of the drug trade. Unlike other forms of aid, the expansion of \nfree trade benefits everyone. American consumers benefit from a wider \nvariety of lower-priced goods, while the citizens of Andean nations \nbenefit from the creation of legitimate jobs outside of the drug trade.\n  Since the enactment of ATPA, positive changes have occurred within \nthe region. Two-way trade between the United States and the Andean \nnations has doubled. Bolivia succeeded in eradicating 95% of its coca \nplantations. Recently, Peru experienced a peaceful democratic \ntransition from autocratic rule. In Colombia alone, ATPA helped to \ncreate over 140,000 new jobs. Today, farmers in the region are choosing \nto plant coffee beans, asparagus, and flowers instead of coca. With the \nexpiration of ATPA, these successes are now in jeopardy.\n  While our nation remains engaged in a battle against terrorism, we \nmust not lose sight of the critical security risks that remain not far \nbeyond our borders. The Andean region is not only the world's primary \nsource of coca, it is also a haven for terrorism and terrorist groups \nthat thrive on funding derived from the drug trade. I am a staunch \nsupporter of our war efforts, but I am also fearful of the consequences \nof neglecting this troubled region within our own hemisphere.\n  We are now at a critical juncture. Failing to extend ATPA sends a \nmessage to terrorist groups, drug traffickers, and counter-\nrevolutionaries, that the United States is no longer committed to the \nregion, and this inaction could impact our national security. Terrorism \nlurks in abandoned and hopeless regions, where good people resort to \nsuch measures out of desperation. As our nation's attention focuses on \nthe war effort, we must not allow ourselves to neglect regions that \nstill need our support and attention.\n  In March, Senator Graham introduced S. 525, the Andean Trade \nPreference Expansion Act, of which I am a proud co-sponsor. That bill \nwould expand and extend the current act, with the hope of furthering \neconomic development and stability in the region. Unfortunately, that \nbill has yet to be debated on the Senate floor. While the Senate \nremains mired in partisan squabbling, the House of Representatives \nsuccessfully passed a good bill on November 16 to extend and to expand \nATPA. The expiration of ATPA should be a concern of all of us. I hope \nthat the Majority leader will expeditiously move to schedule floor time \nfor the consideration of an expansion of this important legislation \nbefore the fragile economies of the Andean region are left to falter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12461-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12461-S12462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR SUPPRESSION OF FINANCING TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. REID.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate two \nmultilateral conventions, negotiated within the UN system, to combat \ntwo specific aspects of international terrorism. The treaties, the \nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, and \nthe International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of \nTerrorism, will provide important tools to the President in the global \ncampaign against terrorism.\n  The two treaties are similar in approach: they require parties to \ncriminalize the proscribed behavor--engaging in international terrorist \nbombings and fund raising for international terrorism--and to either \nextradite an alleged offender to another nation that has jurisdiction \nto prosecute or to submit the case for prosecution.\n  The conventions have received increasing support from the nations of \nthe world. In the last several weeks, many nations have signed or \nratified the treaties. For example, when the Committee on Foreign \nRelations held a hearing on the treaties in late October, 58 countries \nhad signed the International Convention for the Suppression of the \nFinancing of Terrorism, but just four had become parties to it. As of \ntoday, according to the web page of the United Nations, 125 countries \nhave signed the Convention, and 15 have become party to it. It will \nenter into force when 22 nations become party to it, so the Senate's \naction today will be an important step in helping bring the Convention \ncloser to entry into force.\n  I applaud and support the global campaign against terrorism that \nPresident Bush has waged to date. If we have learned anything about \nforeign policy since September 11, it is the global leadership and \nmultilateral cooperation are essential to combating the terrorist \nnetworks. If we want to use air power in Afghanistan, we need over-\nflight rights from countries around the region. If we want Al-Qaeda \ncells to be investigated and arrested, we need our foreign partners to \njoin us in the effort. If we want bank accounts of Osama bin Laden and \nhis cohorts frozen, we need the assistance of foreign governments and \nforeign bankers. In short, we cannot wage this campaign by ourselves.\n  I am pleased that the administration strongly supports these \nconventions. They will provide additional weapons in the terrorism \ncampaign. They set international standards--which we will expect \nforeign nations to embrace and enforce. The International Convention\n\n[[Page S12463]]\n\non the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism will be of particular \nimportance in our continuing effort to squeeze the financial lifeblood \nout of the international terrorism networks.\n  Despite this support for multilateral approaches, I find puzzling the \nAdministration's failure to seize the initiative in other contexts, \nespecially at this time when so many countries are lining up on our \nside in the present conflict. The vicissitudes of the war on terrorism \nalso present opportunities to the United States, if only we will seize \nthem.\n  For example, we all know that rogue states and terrorists are trying \nto obtain biological weapons. In response to this challenge, the \nAdministration--which earlier scuttled a draft compliance protocol to \nthe Biological Weapons Convention--proposes that countries enact \nnational legislation criminalizng violations of the BWC, improve \nbilateral extradition agreements, and adopt strict standards for access \nto dangerous pathogens. But as recently as earlier this week, at the \nBWC Review Conference held every five years, the U.S. delegation was \nresisting the idea of a protocol calling on countries to take those \nactions. It is a mystery to me why the Administration cannot see the \nvirtue of global adherence to a set of standards in the fight to \nprevent biological terrorism.\n  Mr. President, the Committee on Foreign Relations recommended, by a \nunanimous voice vote, that the Senate advise and consent to the two \ntreaties now before the body. I am pleased that my colleagues have \ngiven their strong support to these conventions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12463-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, after months of hard work by the chairman \nof nine committees, we are today introducing legislation to establish a \nnational energy policy. The bill we are introducing provides a \nblueprint for solving many of the nation's energy problems, and will \nprovide the American people with clean, reliable, and affordable energy \nfor generations to come.\n  This bill recognizes that the use of energy has profound consequences \nfor economic health, environmental quality and national security. The \nenergy policy we choose to adopt will have long-lasting consequences in \neach of these areas.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to dramatically reshape America's \nenergy future, and it is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose.\n  The strength of our economy depends, in large measure, in the \nabundant and inexpensive supply of energy.\n  The periodic price shocks experienced by American drivers since the \nmid-1970s underscores the vulnerability associated with our growing \ndependence on foreign oil. At the same time, the rolling blackouts \nexperienced by California last summer serves as a cautionary tale of \nthe failure to guarantee reliable and abundant supplies of electricity.\n  One of the greatest environmental challenges that our nation--and the \nworld--will face in the coming years is the rising tide of global \nclimate change. The way we generate and use energy in the future will \ndetermine whether we effectively face this challenge and prevent the \ncatastrophic impacts of global warming, and whether we can make the air \nwe breathe cleaner and more healthy.\n  And finally, the success of our foreign policy and the security of \nour nation are inextricably linked to our future patterns of energy \nuse.\n  In the last 12 years we have spent billions of dollars fighting two \nwars in the Middle East, both of which involved oil. When Iraq invaded \nKuwait it endangered the oil fields that supplied a significant \npercentage of the world's energy. The U.S., in cooperation with much of \nthe rest of the world, was forced to respond to that threat.\n  More recently, we have learned that much of Osama bin Laden's \nfinancial support came from supporters made rich by the oil-based \neconomy of the Middle-East.\n  It is long past time when we take whatever steps we can toward \nfreeing ourselves from our dependence on foreign oil, and the \nvolatility associated with it.\n  The bill we are introducing today is intended to address these \nchallenges by pursuing a thoughtful, progressive, and realistic energy \npolicies.\n  I thank Chairman Bingaman for the job he has done in working with \nnine committees to produce this bill. In addition to his Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, he also coordinated with: the Environment \nand Public Works Committee; the Commerce Committee; the Banking \nCommittee; the Indian Affairs Committee; the Foreign Relations \nCommittee; the Governmental Affairs Committee; the Agriculture \nCommittee; and the Finance Committee.\n  The events of September 11 have dictated that committees which have \njurisdiction over key elements of energy\n\n[[Page S12464]]\n\npolicy deal with the issues that demand our immediate attention. Those \ncommittees are now turning to their energy-related work, and will have \ntheir provisions complete prior to floor debate.\n  For Example, the Commerce Committee has worked tirelessly to address \naviation security and now is turning its attention to fuel economy. It \nwill develop provisions designed to improve fuel efficiency of vehicles \nover the next 2 months and add them to this package.\n  The Finance Committee, which has spent so much time working on the \neconomic stimulus legislation, will develop and add an energy tax \ncomponent designed to spur investment in new, efficient energy \ntechnologies.\n  And the Environment and Public Works Committee will add provisions \nrelated to the protection and insurance of commercial nuclear \nfacilities.\n  While those elements will continue to fall into place, the pieces of \nthe bill already in place outline a balanced energy plan that will \nstrengthen our economy, protect our environment, and provide energy \nsecurity for our nation for decades to come.\n  The bill Senator Bingaman and I are introducing today includes \nprovisions promoting renewable energy, clean coal use, oil and gas \nexploration, as well as greater efforts to improve the efficiency with \nwhich we use that energy. It will create hundreds of thousands of new \njobs, while reducing our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Under our legislation, the federal government will lead by exemple--\nreducing consumption of energy by 20 percent by 2011 and purchasing 7.5 \npercent of its energy from renewable sources by 2010.\n  Our proposal requires utilities to generate and sell 10 percent of \ntheir electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020. It requires \nthat five billion gallons per year of renewable fuels, such as ethanol \nand biodiesel, must be used in the nation's transportation fuels marked \nby 2012.\n  We increase funding for LIHEAP and state energy weatherization \ngrants.\n  Our bill establishes permanent authority for the President to operate \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserves and request that it be filled. The \nbill overturns the air conditioner efficiency standard recently adopted \nby DOE and replaces it with a more aggressive standard.\n  We authorize up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to encourage timely \ndevelopment of a pipeline to bring 35 trillion cubic feet of natural \ngas from Alaska to the lower 48 states. Construction of this pipeline \nis expected to generate 400,000 new jobs.\n  To keep our nation moving forward, our plan authorizes billions of \ndollars of additional funding for research and development of energy-\nefficient and renewable energy technologies, and more efficient use of \nfossil fuels.\n  By reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, our bill is designed to help \nrestore American's tattered credibility with the international \ncommunity on the issue of climate change.\n  This bill includes climate change provisions developed by the \nCommittees on Energy, Environment, Agriculture, Governmental Affairs, \nForeign Relations and Commerce.\n  I am pleased that Senator Bingaman has included the Byrd-Stevens \nclimate change legislation. This is a bipartisan and voluntary proposal \nthat was passed unanimously by the Government Affairs Committee earlier \nthis year.\n  It requires the establishment of comprehensive national plan, \nincluding a renewed commitment to develop the next generation energy \ntechnologies. We have complemented the Byrd-Stevens proposal with other \nclimate change proposals from members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I know many of my colleagues are eager to debate our energy policy, \nand I look forward to giving this issue the substantive debate it \ndeserves shortly after the new year.\n  I look forward to working with the White House, Senate Republicans, \nand our colleagues in the House to shape a national energy policy that \ncan be signed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/05/senate-section/article/S12464-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 6, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.
