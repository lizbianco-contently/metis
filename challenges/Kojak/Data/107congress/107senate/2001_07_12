Mr. President, as the Chair has announced, we are now going \nto resume consideration of the motion to proceed to the House \nBankruptcy Reform Act. There are 3 hours of debate, divided as the \nchair has announced, prior to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed. \nFollowing consideration of this bankruptcy debate, under the previous \nconsent order, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior \nAppropriations Act with a vote in relation to the Nelson of Florida \namendment. So at 12 o'clock there will be one vote, and at \napproximately 12:20 there will be another.\n  The majority leader, Senator Daschle, has asked me to announce that \nhe has every hope that we can complete this bill--and the two managers \nlast night indicated they believed they were very close to being able \nto complete the bill--at a reasonable time early this afternoon or this \nevening. If we cannot, we will work into the evening. And if we cannot \nfinish it then, we will have to come back tomorrow. There is a lot to \ndo. We hope we can finish this tomorrow. There are many things that \nboth the majority and minority would like to do tomorrow if we have the \nInterior bill out of the way.\n  Mr. President, at 11:30, as has been announced, the Senate will swear \nin the new Secretary of the Senate, Jeri Thomson, who has really \ndedicated her whole life to the U.S. Senate. I know for me it is a \nspecial occasion, as I am sure it is for anyone who knows Jeri. So I \nlook forward to that and to a fruitful debate today.\n  I ask if there is anything from the minority, they be allowed to \nspeak now.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is here. I did not see him in the Chamber \nearlier. He has his 2 hours.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, if I could get the attention of the Senator from \nAlabama.\n\n[[Page S7540]]\n\n  Does the Senator from Alabama--does the minority need the floor right \nnow to do some things? If so, I will be pleased to wait; otherwise, I \nam ready to go.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No. I think we are here on bankruptcy and are glad to \ngo forward.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, normally I do not do it this way. I try \nnot to rely too much on notes. But I want to try to be as detailed and \nas thorough as I can because what I am asking the Senate to do today is \nto step back from the brink and decline to go to conference with the \nHouse on the so-called bankruptcy reform.\n  I am going to be in this Chamber a number of times over the next \nweek, maybe over the next several weeks. There is a lot that I want to \nsay. There is a lot I think I should say as a Senator from Minnesota \nbecause I think Congress is about to make--or is headed toward--a very \ngrave mistake.\n  So I will not attempt to say it all today.

San Jose Mercury News; ``Bad Piece \nof Legislation,'' Buffalo News; ``Taking Care of Business,'' Bob Reich \nin the American Prospect. The list goes on and on.\n\n  I have for over 2 years been fighting this bill, with some of my \ncolleagues: Senators Kennedy, Boxer, Durbin, Schumer, Leahy, and \nFeingold. I will give myself a little bit of credit as to why we are \nstill debating this bill and it has not passed. In truth, a great deal \nof the credit goes to the proponents of the bill because it has been \ntheir consistent refusal to compromise on the legislation that has made \nthe job easier. I will go into some of the greedier aspects of this \nlegislation in a moment.\n  Some have argued that the tactics have been extreme, that I have been \nat this over and over and over again in trying to block it. I would \nrather be spending my time not stopping the worst but doing the better. \nI much prefer to do that. But this is a disastrous piece of \nlegislation. What has been done with this very harsh legislation is \nbasically shredding one of the important safety nets, not just for low-\nincome people but for middle-income people as well. Shredding that \nsafety net so that people can no longer rebuild their financial lives \nis truly egregious.\n  To argue that the reason we need to do this is because a lot of \npeople have been filing chapter 7 in order to get out of repaying their \ndebt and that they are untrustworthy, they don't feel any stigma, et \ncetera, simply doesn't hold up under any kind of scrutiny.\n  We know in the vast majority of cases, 50 percent of the people who \nfile bankruptcy in this country file bankruptcy because of medical \nbills. Is somebody going to say they are lazy or they are slackers or \ncheats? We know beyond that one of the major causes of bankruptcy is \nloss of a job. More and more people are losing their jobs now; 1,300 \ntaconite workers at LTV Company on the Iron Range of Minnesota just \nlost their jobs.\n  Is it divorce? Not surprisingly, many of our citizens who find \nthemselves in the most difficulty are women after a divorce. They are \nthe ones who are taking care of the children in most cases.\n  It hardly holds up that these are a bunch of slackers and a bunch of \ncheats we are going after. As a matter of fact, the evidence is clear--\nI will refer to studies later on--that at best there is maybe 3 percent \nabuse. What about the other 97 percent of the people?\n  Major medical illness is a double whammy because not only do you have \nto pay the doctor and the hospital charges, but in addition quite often \nyou can't work. If it is your child, even\n\n[[Page S7541]]\n\nif it is not you, it is the same issue: it is the medical bills. But \nthen you are home taking care of the child. Now you have no other \nchoice. You are trying to rebuild your life and file for chapter 7, and \nyou can't do it any longer.\n  As I said, you can't argue that people overwhelmed with medical debt \nor sidelined because of an illness are deadbeats. This legislation \nassumes they are. It would force them into credit counseling before \nthey could file, as if a serious illness or disability is something \nthat could be counseled away. I had an amendment to this bill that \nwould have created an exclusion for people who were filing for \nbankruptcy because of medical bills. It did not pass.\n  Women single filers are now the largest group in bankruptcy. They are \none-third of all the filers. They are the fastest growing. Since 1981, \nthe number of women filing increased by 700 percent. A woman single \nparent has a 500 percent greater likelihood of filing for bankruptcy \nthan the population generally.\n\n  Divorce is a major factor in causing bankruptcy in America. Are \nsingle women with children deadbeats? This bill assumes they are.\n  The new nondischargeability of credit card debt will hit hard those \nwomen who use the cards to tide them over after a divorce until their \nincome stabilizes. The ``safe harbor'' in the House bill, which \nproponents argue will shield low- and moderate-income debtors from the \nmeans test, will not benefit many single mothers who most need the help \nbecause it is based upon the combined income of the debtor and the \ndebtor's spouse, even if they are separated, the spouse is not filing \nfor bankruptcy, and the spouse is providing no support for her, for the \ndebtor and her children.\n  In other words, a single mother who is being deprived of needed \nsupport from a well-off spouse is further harmed by this piece of \nlegislation which will deem the full income of that spouse available to \npay debts for determination of whether the safe harbor and means test \napplies. It makes no sense whatsoever, and it is incredibly harsh.\n  Over the past 2 years, any pretense that this piece of legislation is \nurgently needed has evaporated. Now proponents and opponents agree that \nnearly all the debtors resort to bankruptcy not to game the system but, \nrather, as a desperate measure of economic survival and that only a \ntiny minority of chapter 7 filers, as few as 3 percent, can afford any \ndebt repayment, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute.\n  Yet low- and moderate-income families, especially single-parent \nfamilies, are those who need most the fresh start provided by \nbankruptcy protection. The bill will make it harder for them to get out \nfrom under the burden of crushing debt, and that is why I oppose it.\n  The second reason why I oppose this legislation is that the timing of \nthis bill could not be worse. Basically people are not going to be able \nto file for chapter 7. Chapter 13 is going to be made more unworkable \nfor many debtors. We had a situation where 4 years ago, when we first \nstarted this debate, the big banks and credit card companies were \npushing so-called bankruptcy reform in good economic times. The stock \nmarket was soaring. The unemployment rate was coming down. But given \nthe economy we find ourselves with right now, given the fact that we no \nlonger have the same boom economy, that people are now out of work or \nunderemployed, that these are harder times, rushing this bill through \nseems completely divorced from reality.\n  What is the most cited reason for filing for bankruptcy? Job loss, \nand the unemployment rate is rising. What is the second most cited \nreason? Excessive medical bills, and the cost of health care is rising, \nas are the number of uninsured. At the same time, we are going to make \nit impossible for people to file for chapter 7 and rebuild their lives.\n  While the bill will be terrible for consumers and for regular working \nfamilies even in the best of times, its effects will be all the more \ndevastating now because we have a weakening economy. It boggles the \nmind that at a time when Americans are most economically vulnerable, \nwhen they are most in need of protection from financial disaster, we \nwould eviscerate the major safety net in our society for the middle \nclass, and that is precisely what this legislation does. It is the \nheight of insanity that we would be contemplating doing what we are \ndoing given this economy.\n  It may be the case that the Congress and the President will ignore \nthe plight of these families. Each one of them by themselves is not \nthat powerful. Most folks assume this is never going to happen to us. \nMost people and most families never expect they are going to have to \nfile for bankruptcy, but at least my colleagues should care about the \neffect on the economy.\n  This bill could be a disaster, but I do not want you to take my word \nfor it. I want to quote some excerpts from a column by Robert Samuelson \nin the March 14 Washington Post. To put it delicately, Mr. Samuelson \nand I rarely agree on anything. In fact, he likes--I want to be \nintellectually honest about it--he likes the substance of the \nbankruptcy bill. All the more reason, I say to my colleagues, to pay \nattention to him. The title of the editorial is ``Bad Timing on the \nBankruptcy Bill.'' He writes:\n\n       The bankruptcy bill about to pass Congress arrives at an \n     awkward moment: the tail end of a prolonged boom in consumer \n     borrowing. From 1995 to 2000, Americans increased their \n     personal debts by about 50 percent to roughly $7.5 trillion--\n     a figure including everything from home mortgages to student \n     loans.\n       Now comes the bankruptcy bill, which would make it slightly \n     harder for consumers to erase debts through bankruptcy. \n     Although the bill is not especially harsh, it could \n     perversely worsen the economic downturn.\n\n  I do not agree with part of his characterization. I am now focusing \non his argument about the effect of the economy.\n  He concludes:\n\n       The real pressures of high debt are now being compounded by \n     scare psychology. ``Drowning in Debt,'' says the cover story \n     of the latest U.S. News & World Report. ``Why you're in so \n     deep--and how to get out before it's too late.'' The \n     bankruptcy bill sends a similar message: Be prudent, don't \n     overborrow. The message is now about four years too late. Now \n     it may simply amplify the growing gloom. This is not a bad \n     bill, but it certainly is badly timed.\n\n  There you have it, I say to my colleagues. Not an opponent but a \nsupporter suggesting that now is not the time, that we could end up \nprolonging or actually worsening the downturn in the economy.\n  He is not the only one. A May 21 issue of Business Week had an \narticle titled ``Reform that Could Backfire.'' The article begins:\n\n       Just as bankruptcy reform seemed headed for certain \n     passage, the economic omens point to a sharp rise in personal \n     bankruptcies over the next few years. The likely results, \n     says economist Mark Zandi of Economy.com, Inc., will be \n     ``much pain for hard pressed households, little if any gain \n     for lenders, and, in the event of even a mild recession, \n     major problems for the overall economy.''\n\n  Again, this is not some leftwing rag; this is the magazine of note \nfor corporate America--Business Week. If Business Week and Paul \nWellstone are in agreement on an issue, then I ask you: How can we be \nwrong?\n\n  The article concludes:\n\n       The drop in bankruptcies in recent years partly reflected \n     the booming economy. Now, with sharply rising unemployment \n     and slowing income gains, Zandi expects high household debt \n     to take its toll. Especially at risk, he believes, are lower \n     income families, for whom debt repayment dictated by the \n     pending bankruptcy reform would entail tremendous hardship. \n     ``If the economy becomes mired in recession or sluggish \n     growth,'' he warns, ``the loss of the spending power could \n     significantly retard the recovery.''\n\n  I ask my colleagues, I ask the majority leader--I am not in agreement \nwith him--what is the rush? Why do you want to do this to the economy? \nWhy do you want to do this to families? Why are you prepared to go to \nsuch ridiculous lengths to move this legislation?\n  Mr. President, I have received a note, I say to Senator Sessions, \nthat he wants a few minutes before 9:30 a.m. I did not see it until \njust now. I will be pleased to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be returning later.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Whatever is best for the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Somebody else is going to be replacing me. The Senator \ncan go right ahead. I thank the Senator for his courtesy, as always.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not really get this. One of the \narguments being made is that what we are\n\n[[Page S7542]]\n\ngoing to see is an increase in bankruptcies because of a slowing \neconomy and high consumer debts that are overwhelming families and, \ntherefore, we need to pass legislation to curb access to bankruptcy \nrelief. Try that on for size.\n  For 2 years, while the good times were rolling, the proponents of \nthis bill were citing the number of bankruptcy filings as a reason to \npass the bill, although there actually was a dramatic drop in filings \ntaking place. I never understood that argument.\n  Now they are turning around and saying we need to rush to do this \nbecause the economy is slowing down and many hard-working people, \nthrough no fault of their own, are going to find themselves in dire \ncircumstances; therefore, we had better pass legislation that will curb \ntheir access to bankruptcy relief.\n  It is amazing: Increasing hard times, a lot of people finding \nthemselves in these impossible financial circumstances, and now they \nwant to make it harder for them to get a fresh start. The logic of this \nargument completely escapes me.\n  The point Mark Zandi makes in the Business Week article, as other \neconomists have done, is that restricting access to bankruptcy \nprotection will actually increase the number of filings and defaults \nbecause banks will be more willing to lend to marginal candidates. \nIndeed, it is no coincidence that the single largest surge in \nbankruptcy filings began immediately after the last major procreditor \nreforms were passed by Congress in 1984.\n  This is not a debate about winners and losers because we all lose if \nwe erode the middle class in this country. We lose if we take away one \nof the critical underpinnings for middle-class people. Sure, in the \nshort run big banks and credit card companies may pad their profits, \nbut in the long run our families will be less secure and our \nentrepreneurs will become more risk adverse and less entrepreneurial.\n  The whole point of bankruptcy is to allow people to get a fresh \nstart. Bankruptcy disproportionately affects the financially \nvulnerable, but it also disproportionately affects the risk takers, \nsmall businesspeople or entrepreneurs. Our bankruptcy system ensures \nthat utter insolvency does not need to be a life sentence, but it can \nbe an opportunity to start over, and that is what this bill erodes.\n  This is not a debate about reducing the high number of \nbankruptcies. No one can will a piece of legislation that can do that. \nIndeed, by rewarding--I make this argument--the reckless lending that \ngot us here in the first place, we are going to see more consumers \nburdened with that.\n\n  It is amazing; there is hardly a word in this whole piece of \nlegislation that calls for these credit card companies or lenders to be \naccountable as they continue to pump this stuff out to our children and \ngrandchildren every day of every week. But this is perfect for them \nbecause they don't have to worry any longer. They get a blank check \nfrom the Government. No, this is a debate about punishing failure--\nwhether self-inflicted--and sometimes it is--or uncontrolled or \nunexpected. This is a debate about punishing failure.\n  If there is one thing this country has learned, it is that punishing \nfailure doesn't work. You need to correct mistakes. You need to prevent \nabuse. But you also need to lift people up when they have stumbled, not \nbeat them down. This piece of legislation beats them down.\n  Both the House and Senate bills basically give a free ride to the \nbanks and credit card companies, that deserve much of the credit--you \nwould not know it from this legislation--for the high number of \nbankruptcy filings because of their loose credit standards. Even the \nSenate bill does very little to address this issue.\n  There are some minor disclosure provisions in the Senate bill. But \neven these don't go nearly as far as they should. Lenders should not be \nrewarded for reckless lending. Where is the balance in this \nlegislation? If we are holding debtors accountable, why don't we hold \nlenders accountable as well? I know the answer. These financial \ninterests have hijacked this legislative process. As high-cost debt and \ncredit cards and retail charge cards and financing plans for consumer \ngoods have skyrocketed in recent years, so have the bankruptcies. As \nthe credit card industry has begun to aggressively court the poor and \nvulnerable, is anybody surprised that bankruptcies have risen?\n  Credit card companies brazenly dangle literally billions of dollars \nof credit card offers to high-debt families every year, and they are \nnot asked to be accountable. They encourage credit card holders to make \nlow payments toward their card balances, guaranteeing that a few \nhundred dollars in clothing or food will take years to pay off. The \nlength to which the companies go to keep customers in debt is \nabsolutely ridiculous, and they get away with murder in this \nlegislation. After all, debt involves a borrower and a lender. Poor \nchoices or irresponsible behavior by either party can make the \ntransition go sour.\n  So how responsible has the industry been? It depends on how you look \nat it. On the one hand, consumer lending is unbelievably profitable, \nwith high-cost credit card lending the most profitable of all, except \nfor perhaps the even higher costs on payday loans. We don't go after \nany of these unsavory characters. So I guess by the standard of the \nbottom line, they are doing a great job. This industry is thriving. \nThese credit card companies are making huge profits.\n  On the other hand, if your definition of responsibility is promoting \nfiscal health among families, educating them on the judicious use of \ncredit, ensuring that borrowers do not go beyond their means, then it \nis hard to imagine how the financial services industry could not be a \nbigger deadbeat. The financial services industry is the big deadbeat. \nThe problem is that it is the heavy hitter, the big giver, and it has \nso much money that it dominates the politics in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. That is part of what this is about.\n\n  Theresa Sullivan, Elizabeth Warren, and Jay Westerbrook wrote a book \ncalled ``Fragile Middle Class.'' I recommend it to everybody. They \nwrite:\n\n       Many attribute the sharp rise in consumer debt--and the \n     corresponding rise in consumer bankruptcy--to lowered credit \n     standards, with credit cards issuers aggressively pursuing \n     families already carrying extraordinary debt burdens on \n     incomes too low to make more than minimum repayments. The \n     extraordinary profitability of consumer debt repaid over time \n     has attracted lenders to the increasingly high risk-high \n     profit business of consumer lending in a saturated market, \n     making the link between the rise in credit card debt and the \n     rise in consumer bankruptcy unmistakable.\n\n  Credit card companies perpetuate high interest indebtedness by \nrequiring--and there is not a Senator who can argue against this \npractice--low minimum payments and, in some cases, canceling the cards \nof customers who pay off their balance every month. Using a typical \nmonthly payment rate on a credit card, it would take 34 years to pay \noff a $2,500 loan. Total payments would exceed 300 percent of their \noriginal principal. That is really what this is all about. A recent \nmove by the credit card industry to make the minimum monthly payment \nonly 2 percent of the balance rather than 4 percent further exacerbates \nthe problem of some uneducated debtors.\n  These lenders routinely offer ``teaser'' interest rates which expire \nin as little as 2 months, and they engage in ``risk-based'' pricing \nwhich allows them to raise credit card interest rates based on credit \nchanges unrelated to the borrower's account. It is just unbelievable \nwhat they get away with.\n  Even more ironic, at the same time that the consumer credit industry \nis pushing a bankruptcy bill that requires credit counseling for \ndebtors, the Consumer Federation of America found that many prominent \ncreditors have slashed the portion of debt repayments they shared with \ncredit counseling agencies--in some cases by more than half. This may \nforce some of these agencies to cut programs and serve even fewer \ndebtors.\n  Well, Mr. President, I am sorry. I am glad there aren't a lot of \nSenators on the floor because it is hard to say this because you feel \nas if you are engaging in personal attacking. I don't mean it to be \nthat way. I can't say enough about the hypocrisy of this legislation--\nnot of individual Senators but the content of this legislation. It is \nincredible to me the way in which these banks and credit card companies \nhave rigged this system, and we have this harsh piece of legislation in \nincreasingly difficult economic times that is\n\n[[Page S7543]]\n\ngoing to make it impossible for many families to rebuild their lives. \nThe vast majority find themselves in these horrible circumstances \nbecause of medical bills, having lost their jobs, or divorce.\n  Do you know what. This legislation doesn't do anything about the \negregious greed, the exploitive practice of this industry. All of us \nwho have children know what they send out in the mail every day.\n  So the question is: Paul, if the bill is as bad as you say, how come \nit has so much support? This is a lonely fight. Just a few Senators are \nin strong opposition. I don't mean it in a self-righteous way, and it \ndoesn't make us closer to God or the angels. I don't understand why the \nbill is going through. The bill has a lot of support in the Congress, \nand some of those who are supporting it, such as Senator Sessions and \nothers, are worthy Senators. We have an honest disagreement. The \nPresident says he supports it. But the fact of the matter is--and I am \nnot talking about a specific Senator; I don't do that because that is \nnot what it is really about. At the institutional level, I believe the \nreason this legislation has so much support--I will repeat that--at the \ninstitutional level, I believe the reason this legislation has so much \nsupport is that it is a tribute to the power and the clout of the \nfinancial services industry in Washington.\n\n  Let's call it what it is. Might makes right. It is the financial \nmight of the credit card companies and the big banks that are big \nspenders, heavy hitters, and investors in both political parties. It \ndoesn't mean individual Senators support this legislation for that \nreason. I can't make that argument. People can have different \nviewpoints. But if I look at it institutionally, I can look at the \namount of money those folks deliver, their lobbying coalition, and the \nways in which they march on Washington every day, and I can't help but \nsay that is part of what this is about.\n  Why has the Congress chosen to come down so hard on ordinary working \npeople down on their luck? How is it that this bill is so skewed \nagainst their interests and in favor of big banks and credit card \ncompanies? These editorials in a lot of newspapers that say the \nCongress--the House and Senate--comes down on the side of binge banks, \nnot consumers, are right. Well, maybe it is because these families \ndon't have million-dollar lobbyists representing them before the \nCongress. They don't give hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft \nmoney to the Democratic and Republican Parties. They don't spend their \ndays hanging outside the Chamber to bend a Member's ear.\n  Unfortunately, it looks as if the industry got to us first. The truth \nis that, outside of this building, the support for this bill is a \npittance. I mean the truth of the matter is that if you go outside this \nbuilding, support for this bill is very narrow. The support has deep \npockets. Apparently the Congress responds to deep pockets--not \napparently; it does. Everybody knows that. People know it in Nebraska; \nthey know it in Alabama; they know it in Minnesota.\n\n  We can agree or disagree about this legislation, but that is the view \npeople have. They say when it comes to our concerns about ourselves and \nour families, our concerns are of little concern in Washington. Part of \nthat is the mix of money in politics. That is why the vote in the House \nis important and why everybody should know that McCain-Feingold and \nMeehan-Shays is just a step. Lord, we will have to do much more.\n  I am trying to win on a cloture vote on which I will get beat badly. \nOutside of this building, and I will stake my reputation on this--I \nhope I have a reputation--outside this building there is no support for \nthis, or very little. People are not running up to us in coffee shops \nin Nebraska and saying, please pass that bankruptcy bill because, by \nGod, that is the most important thing you can do that will help us.\n  People are talking about health care costs, childcare costs, good \neducation for their children, a fair price for family farmers, how we \ncan keep our small businesses going, the cost of higher education, the \ncost of prescription drugs, concern people will not have a pension, \nwhat happens when you are 75 or 80, in poor health, and you have to go \nto the poorhouse before you get help in a nursing home or home-based \ncare and receive medical assistance. That is what people talk about. \nThey don't say, please pass a bankruptcy bill so when we get into \ntrouble, no fault of our own, because of medical bills or we lost our \njobs, we will not be able to rebuild our lives. There isn't any support \nfor this legislation outside this building. The deep pocket folks got \nto the Congress first, as they usually do.\n  There is opposition. You can know something about a bill by who the \nenemies are. Labor unions oppose the bill. Consumer groups oppose the \nbill. Women and children's groups all oppose the bill. Civil rights \norganizations all oppose the bill. Many members of the religious \ncommunity oppose the bill. Indeed, it is a fairly broad coalition that \nopposes this. Behind them are millions of working families who have \nnothing to gain and everything to lose from this legislation. That is \nwhy I have been blocking this bill for over 2 years.\n  I come from the State of Minnesota. We had a great Senator and Vice \nPresident, Hubert Humphrey. He once said that the test of a society or \nthe test of a government is how we treat people in the dawn of life, \nthe children, in the twilight of their lives, the elderly, in the \nshadow of their lives, people who are poor, people who are struggling \nwith an illness, people struggling with a disability.\n  By this standard, this bill is a miserable failure. There is no doubt \nin my mind this is a bad bill. It punishes the vulnerable and rewards \nthe big banks and credit card companies for their own poor practices. \nFor all I know this legislation will only get worse in conference. I \nhope that is not the case but it is my fear.\n  Earlier I used the word ``injustice'' to describe this bill. That is \nexactly right. It would be a bitter irony if creditors used a crisis, \nlargely of their own making, to talk Congress into this legislation.\n  Colleagues, it is not too late to reverse the course of the bill. It \nis never too late to pull back from the brink until we have leaped. We \nhave not leaped yet. Let's step back. Let's do reform the right way. \nLet's wait until we are not adding to the economic pain that too many \nAmerican families are already feeling. Let's not prolong the pain.\n  I urge the Senate to change the course. If I lose on this vote, then \nwe will have to have another cloture vote, which will be next week, and \nthere will be more discussion. From there, we will see.\n  I ask unanimous consent a number of editorials from newspapers all \nacross our country be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, Mar. 2, 2001]\n\n                        Deeper Hole for Debtors\n\n       The bankruptcy reform legislation President Clinton vetoed \n     last year because it was unfair to consumers is being rushed \n     through Congress again. This time, if passed, President Bush \n     is sure to sign it into law. That would be a great victory \n     for banks, paid for by consumers in financial trouble.\n       Banks and credit card companies pushing for the reform \n     claim that current law is too lenient on those who file for \n     bankruptcy only to avoid paying bills. There are admittedly \n     abuses--3% of bankruptcies are filed by those with enough \n     money to pay at least some of their creditors--but this \n     legislation is too harsh on the genuinely distressed 97%. The \n     House approved its version of the measure Thursday, but there \n     is a chance it will be amended or defeated in the evenly \n     divided Senate next week.\n       Credit card companies could hardly ask for a better law. \n     They would have to take no responsibility for ever-more-\n     aggressive lending, even to those with poor credit records. \n     The companies know that some of that debt will go sour and \n     they account for it in the high interest rates they charge \n     cardholders. The bankruptcy bill deals them a few more aces, \n     making it harder for debtors to get out from under.\n       Lenders, who spent millions of dollars lobbying for the \n     legislation, argue that the current law allows too many \n     consumer to walk away from debt. But a recent study by the \n     independent American Bankruptcy Institute shows that in 97 \n     out of 100 bankruptcies, the debtors, facing either \n     catastrophic medical bills or loss of income, have hit bottom \n     and cannot repay. Nearly 90% have no assets and owe, on \n     average, $36,000. They are either renters or live in homes \n     worth less than $100,000. The cars they drive are, on \n     average, eight years old, and seven out of 10 don't earn \n     enough money to cover their living expenses.\n       The new law would close the door to many consumers filing \n     under Chapter 7, which does not require repayment, and force \n     them into\n\n[[Page S7544]]\n\n     Chapter 13, where they can lose homes and cars. Even in \n     Chapter 7, creditors can force borrowers to repay some of \n     their debt.\n       Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) is leading the battle against \n     the unfair legislation, and he has the support of both \n     California senators. He will need the backing of all Senate \n     Democrats and a Republican or two next week when he takes his \n     fight to the Senate floor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Mar. 15, 2001]\n\n                         A Bad Bankruptcy Bill\n\n       One of the low points in life is about to drop even lower. \n     After soaking up record amounts of special-interest money, \n     Washington is preparing a one-sided overhaul of bankruptcy \n     law, a change that will help the credit industry and further \n     punish debtors.\n       Last year, then-President Clinton wisely vetoed a near-\n     identical plan. The bill, The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, \n     rewrites historic bankruptcy rules that aim to erase \n     uncollectible debts and let consumers and businesses start \n     over.\n       But with the new administration, the revived measure has \n     easily passed the House and is due for a Senate vote this \n     week. President Bush has indicated he will sign the \n     legislation.\n       It's hard to know what's worse about this plan: the \n     ingredients making it harder to wipe out debts or the lavish \n     campaign contributions that shadow the bill.\n       Bankruptcy filings have grown during the last decade, \n     although the numbers declined last year to 1.3 million cases. \n     Most applicants seek the protection of Chapter 7, a category \n     that allows unsecured debts--generally credit cards--to be \n     canceled, while car and house payments remain.\n       The bill would push many more people to file for bankruptcy \n     under Chapter 13, which would impose a 3- to 5-year repayment \n     period for credit-card debt and allow creditors to go after \n     cars and homes in some cases. The concept of bankruptcy as a \n     fresh start will be ended.\n       The bill's supporters talk of personal responsibility, \n     abuse of bankruptcy laws by deadbeats and millionaires who \n     pour assets into mansions to shield money from bill \n     collectors. But the real causes of bankruptcy are divorce, \n     illness and layoffs. These are ruinous turning points that \n     bankruptcy was designed to soften.\n       The money behind the bill is as overboard as the measure's \n     provisions. Finance and credit-card firms gave $9.2 million \n     to both major parties last year, up from $4.3 million in \n     1996. Bush's largest contributor was MBNA, the world's \n     biggest credit-card issuer.\n       As the national economy cools, it's worth thinking about \n     the need for effective bankruptcy rules. The law shouldn't be \n     a haven for well-off debt-dodgers or spendthrifts who won't \n     curb bad habits.\n       But these aren't the targets of this bill. Instead, the \n     legislation hobbles a larger group of lower-income Americans, \n     who will be held back by continuing debt for a longer time.\n       Debt may be choking the livelihood of more than 1 million \n     Americans. But this problem should not be an opportunity for \n     the credit industry to make even more money. The bankruptcy \n     bill should be rejected by the Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 19, 2001]\n\n                       Reform Choice for Mr. Bush\n\n       Last December President Clinton refused to sign a \n     bankruptcy bill, for the good reason that it was too tough on \n     ordinary debtors who seek the protection of the courts and \n     too generous to high-rollers with fancy tax accountants. Now \n     Congress is returning to the subject: A bill recently moved \n     through a House committee, and the Senate is preparing to \n     mark up its version. Lawrence Lindsey, the White House \n     economics adviser, has suggested that President Bush isn't \n     sure whether to support a bill. The administration should \n     make it clear that bankruptcy reform will only be signed if \n     it is fairly balanced.\n       The case for reform is that the number of people declaring \n     bankruptcy has nearly doubled over the past decade, and that \n     this represents a damaging cultural shift toward \n     irresponsibility. If the old stigma associated with \n     bankruptcy evaporates, people may get the idea that they can \n     borrow freely and then get off without repaying; this imposes \n     costs on lenders, which in turn may be passed on to honest \n     borrowers in the form of higher interest rates. Up to a \n     point, this case is right--though it is also true that most \n     people who file for bankruptcy do so because of a calamity \n     such as illness, job loss or divorce.\n       The challenge for reformers is to limit irresponsible abuse \n     of bankruptcy without being too harsh toward those who \n     deserve second chances.\n       The bill Congress produced last year fell short in several \n     ways. It failed to close the egregious homestead loophole, \n     which allows expensively advised debtors to establish \n     residency in Florida or Texas and buy million-dollar homes \n     that they can keep while thumbing their noses at creditors. \n     It did too little to discourage hard-sell tactics by credit \n     card companies, whose relentless come-ons have done much to \n     seduce consumers into debt and to dissuade them from early \n     repayment. And it fails to restrict creditors' abusive \n     practice of pressuring unsophisticated debtors into \n     reaffirming their intention to repay even when they aren't \n     legally obliged to.\n       This time around, senators from both parties are preparing \n     amendments that might fix some of these abuses. The credit \n     card industry, on the other hand, will be issuing reminders \n     of the size of its campaign contributions. Experience shows \n     that it will take presidential leadership to tip the scales \n     against the lobbyists. Let's hope Mr. Bush delivers it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 16, 2001]\n\n                   A Business-Dictated Bankruptcy Law\n\n       Business interests generously supported Republican \n     candidates in the last election and are now reaping the \n     rewards. President Bush and Republican Congressional leaders \n     have moved to rescind new Labor Department ergonomics rules \n     aimed at fostering a safer workplace, largely because \n     business considered them too costly. Congress is also \n     revising bankruptcy law in a way long sought by major \n     financial institutions that gave Republicans $26 million in \n     the last election cycle. President Clinton wisely vetoed the \n     proposal last year, but a nearly identical bill has passed \n     the House and another version was approved by the Senate \n     yesterday. President Bush fully supports the overhaul.\n       The legislation makes it harder for debtors to have their \n     credit card and other unsecured debt erased under Chapter 7 \n     of the bankruptcy code. Instead, a rigid formula would \n     require more debtors to file under Chapter 13 and partially \n     repay all their debts.\n       The nation's bankruptcy laws have long reflected a delicate \n     weighing of society's interest in giving people in distress a \n     fresh start against the rights of creditors. Proponents of \n     this overhaul claim it is needed to curb abuses by high-\n     income debtors who run up big debts and then use the \n     bankruptcy code to avoid repaying them. But the House bill \n     allows wealthy debtors to keep their pricey homes, if owned \n     more than two years, out of creditors' reach, so it hardly \n     furthers that avowed goal. The Senate, to its credit, voted \n     to set a uniform $125,000 limit on the value of a house that \n     can be shielded. We hope this approach prevails.\n       On the broader issue, there is scant evidence that \n     bankruptcy abuse is rampant. Studies consistently show that \n     those obtaining Chapter 7 protection are truly in dire \n     straits. That is partly because the credit card industry \n     frequently bombards even low-income Americans who have a \n     checkered credit history with offers for high-interest loans. \n     Now credit card issuers want the government to reduce all \n     risk from their profitable business.\n       The legislation will weaken an important protection \n     available to people who fall on hard times as the economy \n     slows. Its timing is as poor as are its merits.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Mar. 16, 2001]\n\n           Congress, President Side With Banks, Not Consumers\n\n       Consumer confidence is slipping lower as 401(k) balances \n     shrink amid a Wall Street collapse. Economists fear that \n     fretful Americans will curtail spending enough to turn the \n     hint of a recession into the real thing.\n       What better time to send consumers the clear signal that if \n     hard times befall them, the government will be on the \n     creditor's side, not theirs? With breakneck speed, Congress \n     and President Bush are moving to do just that, so anxious are \n     they to repay the banks and credit companies that showered \n     them with unprecedented torrents of campaign money last year.\n       Certainly, the bankruptcy bill rapidly making its way \n     toward the president's desk, written as it was by the \n     creditors' own lobbyists, could be worse. But it could be a \n     whole lot better, and the timing couldn't be farther off-\n     base.\n       The bill is being sold as necessary to prevent \n     irresponsible high-rollers from escaping debts they could \n     repay. To the extent the bill accomplishes that, it's a good \n     thing. But it also makes it much more difficult for many of \n     us who are middle class by the skin of our teeth to get a \n     fresh start after an unexpected setback, such as a layoff, \n     medical problem or divorce.\n       For more than a century, bankruptcy law in this country has \n     allowed insolvent debtors to eliminate or reduce credit card \n     and other debt that is not secured by collateral such as a \n     house. Under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, people can erase most \n     unsecured debt. Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows debtors to \n     retain key assets, such as a house, in exchange for repayment \n     of share of debt under a court-ordered plan. Three of four \n     debtors choose Chapter 7.\n       The current bill would bar most people with income above \n     the median ($39,000 nationally) from filing under Chapter 7 \n     and eliminating credit card debt. Instead, they would be \n     forced to file under Chapter 13.\n       What does this mean for you, if you're a middle-class \n     worker forced into bankruptcy after a temporary layoff or \n     other exigency? Even after you emerged from bankruptcy, the \n     credit card companies would have as strong a claim to a share \n     of your wages as would child support, alimony or other court-\n     ordered obligation. In other words, your kids could get less \n     of the pie so the banks could get theirs.\n       Although the scamming high-roller has received all the \n     rhetorical attention, the truth is that most filers are \n     anything but that. The median income is $22,000 a year, and \n     about two-thirds file after an extended period of \n     unemployment.\n\n[[Page S7545]]\n\n       The bill is good business for the credit companies, though. \n     They'll see even higher profits, about 5 percent higher next \n     year. For companies like MBNA, which would see about $75 \n     million extra, that's a whopping return on last year's \n     investment in electoral campaigns of $3.5 million.\n       Meanwhile, the blizzard of credit card solicitations \n     continue to blow. There probably is no law Congress could, or \n     should, pass to stop credit companies from bombarding even \n     the most bankruptcy-vulnerable consumers with solicitations \n     for easy, high-interest debt. Democrats couldn't even pass an \n     amendment to place limits on credit cards granted to minors \n     without parental approval. The best check on those lenders' \n     practices is the potential for losses when they give credit \n     cards to consumers with bad credit history.\n       And we're sure to see a slew of people do just that in the \n     coming year, with or without this bill, as the economic \n     shakeout continues. For most Americans who are only dimly \n     aware of this legislation, the awakening will be rude indeed.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        [From the Boston Globe]\n\n                            Compounding Debt\n\n       If the credit-card companies really wanted to do something \n     about bankruptcies, they would stop filling the mailboxes of \n     America with ever-more enticing pitches for new credit cards. \n     Instead, they have teamed up with the banks to push a new \n     bill that harshly penalizes families that end up in \n     bankruptcy. Most do so because they lose their jobs, get \n     socked by medical bills, or go through a divorce.\n       Senator Edward Kennedy calls the bill the ``turkey of all \n     turkeys.'' Laid-off workers will have even worse names for it \n     if it is enacted and the economic slowdown puts more \n     employees on the street.\n       Kennedy and other Senators get their chance this week to \n     amend legislation that swept through the House on a 306-108 \n     vote and has already been approved by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. President Clinton vetoed a similar bill last year, \n     but President George W. Bush has said he would sign it.\n       The bill's major shortcoming is that it makes it too \n     difficult for families drowning in debt to qualify for \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which lets them wipe out credit-card \n     debt and other unsecured loans. Instead, they would be forced \n     into Chapter 13, which requires sometimes onerous repayments. \n     An especially objectionable provision would force parents and \n     children to fight credit-card companies to get their hands on \n     alimony or child support from debtors going through \n     bankruptcy.\n       Supporters of the bill, many of them recipients of campaign \n     contributions from credit card companies and banks, in the \n     past election, say it is aimed at the profligate rich who try \n     to walk away from their obligations. In fact, a 1999 study by \n     federal judges found that the median income of debtors \n     seeking bankruptcy protection was $21,500. Another study, \n     done at Harvard, showed that in 1999 no fewer than 40 percent \n     of all bankruptcies were due to unpaid medical bills.\n       Also, the legislation specifically ducks a chance to go \n     after affluent debtors by keeping a loophole in current law \n     that lets rich deadbeats in states like Texas and Florida \n     shield their mansions in bankruptcy court. The credit \n     industry had to swallow that provision to get the support of \n     powerful politicians from those states.\n       Another less than creditable argument of the credit \n     industry is that the rate of bankruptcy filings is out of \n     control. Although the total did rise from 718,000 at the \n     beginning of the 1990s to peak of 1.4 million in 1998, it has \n     declined in each of the past two years. What has increased in \n     recent years is the deluge of easy credit solicitations with \n     which the industry swamps the country. According to the \n     Consumer Federation of America, the industry sent out a \n     projected 3.3 billion credit-card pitches last year, an \n     increase of 14 percent over 1999. The Senate should tell the \n     industry to cut back on them before it seeks a more punitive \n     bankruptcy law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, Mar. 20, 2001]\n\nContributors to Irresponsible Acts; Credit-Card Firms Not Blameless in \n                            Bankruptcy Rise\n\n                          (By James Sollisch)\n\n       Last week the Senate voted 85-13 in favor of tightening the \n     bankruptcy laws and I received nine solicitations in the mail \n     offering me credit lines totaling more than I make in a year. \n     Several were preapproved. The bill is being pushed hard by \n     banks and credit-card companies, including MBNA, the largest \n     donor to the Republican Party this past election year.\n       Credit-card companies believe people should take more \n     personal responsibility for their debts. A noble aim. And a \n     perfect time to pose the question, ``Why not make banks and \n     credit card companies take more responsibility for their \n     lending practices?'' Let's make the bill a responsibility in \n     lending and borrowing bill--because there's certainly enough \n     irresponsibility to go around. In 1999, more than 1.3 million \n     Americans filed for bankruptcy. That's up from 650,000 in \n     1990. Last year, lending institutions mailed out more than 33 \n     billion solicitations. Coincidence? Only in the same way \n     tobacco companies tried to tell us that smoking and cancer \n     were coincidences.\n       We've spent the past eight years making the tobacco \n     companies take responsibility for their misleading practices. \n     Why are we so eager to give credit-card companies a free \n     ride? These are the friendly folks who interrupt your dinner \n     five nights a week to offer you a zero interest credit card \n     for six months if you transfer all 14 of your other balances. \n     And did we mention you're preapproved? These are the good \n     people who send you that fake check three times a week for \n     $58,017--the amount of equity they figure you have in your \n     home.\n       These are the decent corporate citizens who target college \n     students, suggesting that a credit card is a smart way to pay \n     for college expenses. Yeah, smart for the company that you \n     repay at 18 percent when you could be repaying a college loan \n     at 8 percent. These are the nice guys who still charge up to \n     24 percent in the states that will let them.\n       And these aren't just the small companies on the fringes of \n     the industry--these are respected bricks and mortar \n     institutions. I've gotten three equity lines of credit in the \n     past 15 years on three homes. Each time the bank appraiser \n     found that the value of my home was exactly the inflated \n     number I estimated it to be on my application. How \n     responsible is that?\n       Of course, lending institutions want us to be more \n     responsible for our debt. But without more regulation of \n     lending practices, lenient bankruptcy law is a much needed \n     check and balance. If these companies want fewer people to go \n     belly up on them, maybe they should tighten their lending \n     requirements. If I invest in a risky stock--and who hasn't \n     lately?--I'm not entitled to get my money back.\n       And that's what consumers are to credit card companies--\n     investments. They're banking on our ability to repay them. So \n     if they want safeguards, they should be wiling to give up \n     something in return. How about a solicitation tax? For every \n     solicitation by phone or mail, the institution must pay a \n     tax. The money could be used to educate consumers about the \n     dangers of overextending their credit.\n       I'm sure the two chambers, which are about to reconcile \n     their versions of the bill, can come up with additional \n     ideas, some hopefully even more distasteful to the credit \n     card lobby than a solicitation tax.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to make \nsome remarks about our bankruptcy bill that is now back before the \nSenate again. It is a bill that has been fought over, debated, \nimproved, refined, changed and, I think, gained greater and greater \nsupport as we have proceeded.\n  I know there are some people who remain very emotionally in objection \nto it, but when analyzed carefully and the provisions in it examined, \nthere is no doubt whatsoever in my mind that this bill is a major step \nforward for bankruptcy procedure in America.\n  Let me say what bankruptcy is and what it is not and what the bill is \nabout. Bankruptcy occurs when an individual in America may be being \nsued and they can't pay their debt. The bill collectors are calling and \ntheir income just won't pay their debts. So they can go and file in a \nFederal bankruptcy court for relief under the bankruptcy laws. They can \nfile under chapter 13, which says to the court, basically, I believe I \ncan pay my debt back, but I can't live and be sued, have creditors \ncalling me at home and that sort of thing. I will take a portion of my \nmoney. I will send it off to the bankruptcy court. You pay all my \ncreditors in an orderly fashion, make sure they get paid, but keep them \nfrom suing me, harassing me, and bothering me, and then I will be able \nto recover and get back on my feet.\n  That occurs a lot. In some States it is very small. In some States \nonly 5 percent of the individuals file under chapter 13. Other States, \nit is much higher. In my State of Alabama, where chapter 13 originated, \nthe number is almost 50 percent of the filers--I believe\n\n[[Page S7546]]\n\nit is 50 percent--in some parts of the districts that file under \nchapter 13. They find it has great advantages. They are able to keep \ntheir automobile, for example. They are able to keep their home, keep \nmore of their goods and services. It allows them to stretch out \npayments, to reduce the interest rates. Normally, the interest rates \ndrop down to zero or whatever, and then they pay it off on a regular \nbasis. It stops the harassment that comes when people legitimately are \ntrying to collect the money the individual owes to them.\n\n  That is a good system. Too few people utilize chapter 13. It has some \ngood advantages for themselves, not just for the people they are paying \noff. It has real advantages for them.\n  The other process which is more widely used is to file under chapter \n7. You are in debt. You go down to the bankruptcy court and it wipes \nout all your debts. The debts are wiped out. Then the person is able to \nstart afresh and not owe anybody. That is the common thing. It is the \ntraditional great American value. It is referred to in the Constitution \nthat the United States shall establish uniform laws for bankruptcy.\n  It has always been thought of as something we would do in the Federal \nGovernment. Bankruptcy laws are handled in Federal courts, and, \ntherefore, to improve them, unlike most collection cases, unlike most \ncriminal cases that are in State courts, these are in a separate \nFederal court.\n  It is important, since the last 1978 bill that passed, that Congress \nstudy what has been happening with bankruptcy and see what we can do to \nimprove it. That is what has occurred here. It is not unexpected that \npeople who are dealing in bankruptcy every day and see how the system \nworks would be people who would have some concerns about it and be able \nto make suggestions about how to improve it.\n  First and foremost, it ought to be a high value of America that those \nwho incur debt should pay it back if they can. We do not need to get to \na point in this society when people can borrow money from someone, \npromising to pay them back, and just not do so for light or \ninsignificant reasons.\n  Let me mention the bankruptcy filing issue. We have had a tremendous \nnumber of filings. In 1980, 2 years after the new bankruptcy act \npassed, there were just 287,000 bankruptcy filings. By 1999, 19 years \nlater, the bankruptcy filings had jumped to 1.3 million a year, a 347-\npercent increase. How did that happen? There are a lot of reasons for \nit. I suggest that a major factor for it is when you turn on your \ntelevision at night on a cable station, or pick up your shoppers guide, \nthere are advertisements and there are even billboards with lawyers \nsaying: If you have got debt problems, call me and we will wipe them \nout. People call them. The lawyers don't get paid unless they take you \nto court and file for bankruptcy. So there is an incentive there to do \nthat.\n\n  I want to mention something. In this 1998-99 period, we were in a \nvery strong economy. Yet we reached the highest point of filings in \nhistory. This chart is a little bit out of date. It shows a drop in \n1999. Around 2000, it has gone back up. But the numbers are much \nhigher--maybe 3, 4 times what they were 20 years ago. We know we have a \nproblem. Everybody knows that. I believe we can do something good for \nAmerica.\n  Let me say this: After all the debate, we had a number of votes on \nthis matter and had strong support each time. It is bizarre to me--and \nI came here in 1997--how hard it is to get a piece of legislation \npassed. The procedural posture of this bill is interesting. In 1998, \nthe House passed a bankruptcy bill, and all of these are fundamentally \nsimilar to what we have today. It passed in the House 306-118. It \npassed the Senate 97-1. In 1999, it came back, and I think we recessed \nor something and we never got it to the President to have him sign it \ninto law.\n  In 1999, it passed 313-108. In 2000, it passed the Senate 83-14. In \nthe House, in 2000, it passed by a voice vote. It passed in the Senate \n70-28 in 2000. In the year 2001, we came back again and the House \npassed it 306-108, and the Senate passed it 83-15. It still hasn't \nbecome law. How did this happen? At any rate, we are now moving to a \npoint where we are going to make this happen. We have discussed and \ndebated these issues, and we are excited now that we can perhaps see an \nend to this and have some real reform.\n  Let me mention one thing the bill does, which I think is significant. \nThe bill provides that before you can go into bankruptcy court, you \nmust at least inquire with a credit counseling agency, if there is one \navailable in the community. The bankruptcy judge can certify if there \nis not one and would excuse this requirement. But most communities--\nvirtually all of them--have a credit counseling agency. That agency is \na voluntary group you can go to and discuss with them your debt \nsituation and whether or not you have a chance to work your way out of \nit. They are very good with families. They bring in the mother, father, \nand sometimes the children, and they sit around the table and they \ndiscuss what is going on in the family's budget.\n  They call up this washing machine company that you have a debt with, \nor the bank, or the credit card company, and they say: We are a credit \ncounseling company and we are licensed. This family is in trouble \nfinancially. If you will reduce the required payments, reduce your \ninterest, we will commit to you to work with them and see that you get \npaid so much a month, and in a year, 2 years, 3 years, we will have you \npaid off. They may even ask them to reduce the amount owed. They may \nowe you $5,000 and there is no way they can pay that. They might say: \nThey are thinking about bankruptcy. If you will agree to reduce your \ndebt to $3,000, I believe they will pay you all of that.\n  Sometimes these people do that. Sometimes they work out a budget and \nthey teach the family how to get out of debt and get on their feet and \nstart their lives again. That is a very good thing. My friends in the \nbankruptcy bar don't do that. When people go to them in response to \ntheir ads on television, they go in and talk to them and they say: You \nhave enough debt; we ought to file chapter 7 and wipe this debt out.\n\n  So the debt is wiped out, but nothing has been done to deal with the \nproblem in that family that may have caused the debt to begin with. \nSometimes there is a gambling addiction, a drug or alcohol problem, and \nsometimes there are illnesses and problems that maybe this credit \ncounseling agency can help them get help for. Our bill says before you \ncan file for bankruptcy, you have to at least talk to a credit \ncounseling agency and see if they might have a plan for the debtor that \nmight be better than simply filing bankruptcy.\n  I think a lot of people would choose that option. I don't know how \nmany. It may be 2 percent or it may be 10 percent. But if they know \nabout that option, they will find it will be something good for them to \ndo. We should consider that.\n  Now, my friend from Minnesota is very aggressive about this bill. He \nis emotional about this bill. He says two different things. He says, \nwell, only 3 percent of the people will qualify for this thing, so the \nbill should not pass. Then he says that everybody is going to have \ntheir bankruptcy protections eliminated and it is a harsh bill.\n  Let's talk about the core matter within the bill. The core part of \nthe bill says if you make above median income in America--which is \naround $45,000 for a family of four--and you are able to pay back a \ncertain percentage of the debt that you owe, you ought not to go into \nchapter 7 and wipe out all those debts. You ought to be required to go \ninto chapter 13 and pay back the portion of those debts that you can--\nbut under the court's protection, so nobody can sue you for debts and \nyou can't receive phone calls and you are protected from harassment, \nbut you pay the debt back. It is our view that if you can pay some of \nyour debt, you should do that. I think that is just and fair. I don't \nthink the Federal bankruptcy law was ever conceived to create a \nsituation in which a person can simply, routinely go in and file and \nwipe out all their debts, even though they can pay them back.\n  We have story after story of doctors and lawyers making $100,000-plus \nper year going in and wiping out all their debts and keeping right on \nwith the salary they were making. I don't believe that is justice. I \ndon't believe that is right. I believe we have a right and a \nresponsibility to say if you can pay back some of that debt, you should \ndo that.\n\n[[Page S7547]]\n\n  How many people will be covered by that? I don't know. Maybe 10 \npercent, or less probably. But 90 percent of the people, because they \nwill be making below median income, will be able to file in bankruptcy \njust like they do today with very little change.\n  So this catches only what I would say are the abuses. Senator \nWellstone said it is 3 percent. Maybe it is only 3 percent who make \nabove median income. If so, only they will be affected. Even then, if \nyour debts are large enough, you will be able to stay in chapter 7 and \nwipe them out if the court finds you can't pay them. But if you are \nmaking $150,000 and you owe your neighbors and the bank and the \nhospital a total of $150,000, most people would try to work and pay \nthose debts down in some fashion. But why should a person making that \nkind of income just wipe them all out? This would say you would go to \nthe court and you have to submit a plan. The court will put you into \nchapter 13, and the court may say you ought to be able to pay half of \nthose bills, and you will pay them out on a monthly basis over 3, 4, 5 \nyears, and nobody can sue you, nobody can call you at night and harass \nyou. They will take care of the payment of the debt. You simply have to \nset aside a certain amount of your money. You can't throw it all away \nand wipe out debts that you owe.\n  It is true that a lot of people go into bankruptcy because of medical \ndebt, hospital debt, and things of that nature. They didn't have \ninsurance and they owe a lot of money for debts. Well, hospitals are \nnot evil people. They are good institutions. Presumably, they supplied \na need that they gave somebody health care and treatment and an \noperation and surgery, and whatever they needed, or fixed their legs \nthat were broken, or whatever. So are we to say just because it is a \nhospital debt and you have the money to pay them and you make above \nmedian income, that we should never pay a hospital debt?\n  What kind of thinking is that? We have this growing mentality in \nAmerica today. It is--I do not know how to describe it, but it reflects \na rejection of enforcement of contracts and laws and plain meaning of \nwords.\n  We have this deal where one has an obligation to pay if one can--I \nthink people should pay--but if you are not able to and you make below \nmedian income, you will be able to wipe out all the debts just as in \ncurrent law today.\n  A lot of complaints have been made that families will be impacted and \nthat this will be damaging to them. It has been said that the bill is \nincredibly harsh; that debtors file for bankruptcy for survival, and \nmany do, and that this bill will stop all of that. I do not think that \nis correct. It was said this bill will eviscerate a major safety net in \nthis economy for middle America.\n  Let me tell you who benefits from this. Women and children benefit \nfrom this. Under the bankruptcy bill, deadbeat dads with above-median \nincome and a moderate ability to repay debts will be required to enter \nchapter 13, just as I noted, supervised by a bankruptcy judge for 5 \nyears. The deadbeat dads must pay all past due alimony and child \nsupport before the bankruptcy judge will confirm the 5-year plan. This \nFederal judge will make sure that alimony and child support are paid \nand paid first, ahead of the debts.\n  Under current Federal law in bankruptcy--and if we reject this bill, \nwe will stay under current law--under current Federal law, child \nsupport and alimony payments rank seventh in the list of priority debts \nto be paid off in a bankruptcy proceeding. Incidentally, attorney's \nfees are now No. 1. This bankruptcy reform bill, on the other hand, \nreorganizes the priorities in a way that makes sense. Women and \nchildren come out to be No. 1 every time. This new priority list \nelevates child support and alimony payments to the top priority \nensuring that those payments are made before any others, even above \nattorney's fees.\n  That is a historic step forward for women and children in America. \nWhy anyone who claims to want to benefit children to further child \nsupport payments would want to kill this bill is beyond me.\n  It provides an automatic stay which is a trick some debtors have been \nusing to get out of paying child support payments after they file for \nbankruptcy. In bankruptcy, they are given an automatic stay. That means \nthe child support collection agencies that were trying to sue them for \nchild support have to stop their lawsuit when a bankruptcy is filed. \nThat is one of the principles of bankruptcy.\n  Once a bankrupt files, every litigation against that bankrupt is \nstayed and is brought into the bankruptcy court, not the State courts \nunconsolidated, so the bankrupt can get his life together and not be \nsued in every county and State where he owes money. It is a good thing, \nbut that stay can be abused when it comes to child support.\n  This legislation ends that practice by exempting child support and \nalimony support obligations from the automatic stay. They have to \ncontinue to pay and the lawyer or the State child support agency that \nis seeking to collect child support on behalf of a mother and children \nwill be able to continue their efforts to collect the money, even \nthough the deadbeat dad has filed for bankruptcy.\n  What about past due alimony and child support? The bill requires that \na parent filing for bankruptcy must fulfill both their current and past \ndue child support and alimony obligations before a judge can confirm a \nbankruptcy plan. They will ensure that the custodial parent gets \neffective and timely assistance from child support collection agencies \nby requesting the bankruptcy trustee and administrator to notify the \nparent and the State child support collection agency whenever a debtor \nowing child support or alimony files for bankruptcy. This notice will \nprovide vital timely information to the custodial parent so that he or \nshe can request help from the State child support enforcement agency if \nthey desire.\n\n  What does all this mean? Jonathon Burris, of the California Family \nSupport Council, put it in an open letter to Congress: The provisions \nincluded in this bill are ``a veritable wish list of provisions which \nsubstantially enhances our efforts to enforce support debts when a \ndebtor has other creditors who are also seeking participation in the \ndistribution of the assets of a debtor's bankrupt estate.''\n  In addition, Philip Strauss of the district attorney's Family Support \nBureau--and most district attorneys around the country have as one of \ntheir obligations collecting child support on behalf of indigent \nspouses and children--wrote to the Judiciary Committee to express his \nunqualified support for the bill.\n  He notes that he has been in the business of collecting child support \nfor 27 years. He knows what he is talking about. Mr. Strauss notes that \nthe National Child Support Enforcement Association, the National \nDistrict Attorneys Association, and the Western Interstate Child \nSupport Enforcement Council support his views and support this bill.\n  I think that should put to rest any allegation that somehow we are \nabusing children in this legislation, that somehow it is harsh and not \nactually beneficial to them.\n  When a parent who is not paying child support and makes above-median \nincome is forced into chapter 13 for 5 years, they are under a Federal \njudge's watch and order that entire time. During that 5 years, they \nhave to send their money for child support or they can be held in \ncontempt of court by the bankruptcy judge or have their bankruptcy \nbenefits all thrown out. That to me is a benefit for families and \nchildren that is little understood.\n  There has been a lot of talk about credit cards. Remember, our bill \nfocuses on how to process bankruptcy cases in bankruptcy courts. What \nkinds of notices that go on credit cards, how they declare their \ninterest, what kinds of rules should cover them is a banking matter \nthat is covered by an entirely different committee of this Congress, \nthe Banking Committee.\n  The chairman of the Banking Committee has agreed to allow some \nprovisions to be put in this bill, but he asserts his prerogative and \nthe Banking Committee's prerogative, and has done so, to handle any \nmajor reform of credit card laws.\n  That is not what we are about in this legislation. This is bankruptcy \ncourt reform. It is not to reform all problems of credit in America, \nalthough we have some, and I am sure we will make progress on them.\n  I inquire, Madam President, about the time.\n\n[[Page S7548]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 34 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It's only fair \nthat we go through the regular order on bankruptcy, which is to take up \nthe House-passed version, substitute that with the Senate-passed bill, \nand then proceed to conference to resolve differences between the two \nbills. The Senate bill, S. 420, went through proper procedure--in the \n107th Congress, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing and markup of \nthe bill, and then there was extended debate and amendments on the \nfloor. In March, S. 420 passed out of the Senate by a vote of 83 to 15.\n  But, to tell you the truth, a bankruptcy bill should have been signed \ninto law last year. We've been working on bankruptcy legislation for \nthree Congresses now. The bill has passed both houses several times. \nLast year, the bill was unfortunately pocket-vetoed by President \nClinton at the very last minute. The main reason we don't have a bill \nenacted into law is because of the determined efforts of certain \nSenators to delay and obstruct the process, even though a large \nbipartisan majority of the Congress supports bankruptcy reform. Certain \nSenators have made a point of impeding progress on this important \nreform measure every step of the way. They've done this because left-\nwing interest groups think that bankruptcy should be easy. But the \nmajority of us here in Congress don't think that should be the case.\n  The bill reforms the bankruptcy system to require repayment of debts \nby individuals who have the ability to pay their bills, by \nreinstituting personal responsibility in a bankruptcy system that is \nnow all too often being used as a financial tool for deadbeats. It is \nclear that the bill reinjects an individual's personal responsibility \nin regard to his or her financial situation, while at the same time \nprotecting the right of debtors to a financial fresh start when they \nare in a situation where they cannot repay their debts or have fallen \non hard times through no fault of their own. I repeat, the bill does \nnot eliminate bankruptcy as a recourse for people who come on hard \ntimes. In fact, the bill clearly indicates that it there is a change in \nthe circumstances of a debtor, that will be taken into account. And \nthat includes the loss of a job or unexpected medical expenses.\n  Furthermore, the bill strengthens protections for child support and \nalimony payments by making family support obligations a first priority \nin bankruptcy, up from number seven. What could help women and children \nmore than moving family support obligations to the first priority in \nbankruptcy? We can't move them higher than number one, we've put women \nand children at the top. The bill makes staying current on child \nsupport a condition of discharge--debt discharge in bankruptcy is made \nconditional upon full payment of past due child support and alimony. So \nthe bill makes payment of child support arrears a condition of plan \nconfirmation. In addition, the bill gives parents and state child \nsupport enforcement collection agencies notice when a debtor who owes \nchild support or alimony files for bankruptcy.\n  The bill requires bankruptcy trustees to notify child support \ncreditors of their right to use state child support enforcement \nagencies to collect outstanding amounts due. I think that these \nprovisions will help ensure that women and children are up front when \nthere is a bankruptcy.\n  The bill does a lot more to help reform the bankruptcy system. For \nexample, the bill makes permanent chapter 12 bankruptcy for family \nfarmers and lessens the capital gains tax burden on financially \nstrapped farmers who declare bankruptcy. As you know, we just extended \nchapter 12 for a few more months. It's high time that Congress get down \nto business and make chapter 12 permanent. I know that this is an \nimportant provision for many Senators out in farm country.\n  In addition, the bill creates new protections for patients when \nhospitals and nursing homes declare bankruptcy. This was the subject of \na hearing that I held in the Aging Committee when I chaired that \ncommittee, and so the bankruptcy bill will provide a ``patient's bill \nof rights'' to the elderly residents of bankrupt nursing homes.\n  Finally, the bill requires that credit card companies provide key \ninformation about how much people owe and how long it will take to pay \noff their credit card debt by only making a minimum payment. To help do \nthat, the bankruptcy bill provides a toll-free number to call where \nindividuals can get information on the length of time it will take to \npay off their own credit card balances if they make minimum payments.\n  The bill prohibits deceptive advertising of low introductory rates, \nand provides for penalties on creditors who refuse to renegotiate \nreasonable payment schedules outside of bankruptcy. The bill \nstrengthens enforcement and penalties against abusive creditors for \npredatory debt collection practices. And the bill includes credit \ncounseling programs to help avoid and break the cycle of indebtedness. \nSo, the bankruptcy bill that the Senate passed actually contains some \nof the most pro-consumer provisions we've seen directed toward the \ncredit industry in years.\n  The reality is that a large majority of the Senate voted for this \nbill. It's clear to me that the majority of Senators want a bankruptcy \nbill to pass. We've worked on bankruptcy legislation for three \nCongresses now, and it is time for us to get down to the business of \ngetting this bill over the goal line once and for all.\n  We already had an overwhelming vote on the Senate bill--83 to 15 \nvotes. So I'm urging my colleagues to vote for cloture.\n  Madam President, since I do not see other people ready to speak, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum. I ask unanimous consent the time for \nthe quorum call be evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased to be here today to support \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 333, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act of 2001. As my colleagues may remember, the \nSenate counterpart to this legislation, S. 420, passed this Chamber in \na bipartisan vote of 83-15 on March 15. Additionally, the conference \nreport to last year's bill, H.R. 833, passed the Senate by a similarly \nwide margin just last December, but was pocket-vetoed by President \nClinton at the very end of the legislative session.\n  Today, we are beginning what I hope will be the final leg of a \nlegislative marathon, a leg I hope we can complete soon. This bill has \npassed both bodies in the 105th, 106th, and now the 107th Congress. It \nis time to wrap up this debate, reach consensus and present a good bill \nto the President for his signature so American consumers can reap the \nbenefits.\n  I would like to briefly recount the legislative history of S. 420 \nduring this Congress. S. 220, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001 was \nintroduced by Senator Grassley in January and contained the same \nlanguage as last year's conference report. That bill was given a \nhearing and amended in mark-up by the Judiciary Committee. After that \nthe committee's bill was reintroduced as S. 420 by Senator Grassley and \nothers, and, after extensive floor debate and the adoption of several \nimportant amendments, it passed the Senate in an overwhelming vote. As \nyou can tell, many compromises and agreements have already been reached \non this bill. I look forward to working with members of the conference \nto reconcile the\n\n[[Page S7549]]\n\nfew remaining differences between the two bills.\n  Let me just take a minute at this point to talk about the highlights \nof this legislation.\n  First, it includes new consumer protections under the Truth in \nLending Act, such as new required disclosures regarding minimum monthly \npayments and introductory rates for credit cards. It also protects \nconsumers from unscrupulous creditors with new penalties for creditors \nwho refuse to negotiate reasonable payment schedules outside of \nbankruptcy.\n  This bankruptcy reform act also requires credit counseling to help \npeople avoid the cycle of the indebtedness. It provides for protection \nof educational savings accounts, and gives equal protection to \nretirement savings in bankruptcy.\n  The legislation would also put a stop to letting deadbeat parents use \nbankruptcy to avoid paying child support. It will also put an end to \npaying the lawyers ahead of children who rely on child support. It \ngives child support and other domestic support obligations first \npriority status. I am proud to have worked with Senators Torricelli and \nDodd on these important reforms. I am also proud to have cosponsored \nSenator Clinton's amendment that further improved these provisions.\n  Current bankruptcy law simply is not adequate, and frankly I was \noutraged to learn of the many ways deadbeat parents are manipulating \nand abusing the current bankruptcy system in order to get out of paying \ntheir domestic support obligations. The bill is a tremendous \nimprovement for children and families over current law. That is why \nthere is such overwhelming support for this legislation from the child \nsupport professionals across the country--the very people who go after \ndeadbeats to get children the support they need. In fact, this bill \nincludes a key provision that makes the full payment of past due child \nsupport and alimony a condition of getting a discharge in bankruptcy.\n  I also am pleased to have worked with the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, to include for the first time, privacy \nprotections in bankruptcy. That language protects personally \nidentifiable information given by a consumer to a business debtor by \nadding new privacy protections to the bankruptcy code and by creating a \nconsumer privacy ombudsman to appear before the bankruptcy court.\n  Now, I am the first to acknowledge that there are things I would like \nto see changed in the bill, but I recognize that we all have cooperated \nand compromised in order to enact this legislation that provides new \nconsumer protections, helps children in need of child support, and \nmakes other necessary reforms to a system that is open to abuse.\n  I want to emphasize emphatically that his legislation does not make \nit more difficult for people to file for bankruptcy, but it does \neliminate some of the opportunities for abuse that exist under the \ncurrent system. Our current system allows certain people with the \nability to pay to continue to abuse the system at the expense of \neveryone else. People with high incomes can run up massive debts, and \nthen use bankruptcy to get out of honoring them. In the end, all of us \npay for the unscrupulous who abuse the system. In fact, it has been \nestimated that every American family pays as much as $550 a year in a \nhidden tax for these abusers. The bankruptcy reform legislation will \nhelp eliminate this hidden tax, by implementing a means test to make \nwealthy people who can repay their debts honor them. I support we could \ncall this a tax cut for the responsible person.\n\n  There are numerous examples of people who take advantage of loopholes \ntoday at the expense of everyone else. A few months ago, I heard from \nthe president of a credit union in Wisconsin, who told me about a young \ncouple who wanted a ``clean financial slate'' before they got married. \nWhat did they do? They ran up their credit card purchases. One of them \nprepaid on a car loan with the credit union to have the other cosigner \nreleased. Then, although they were both employed full time, they filed \nfor bankruptcy to wipe out all their debt. The credit union--and its \nmembers--had to eat the $3,000 in credit card debt and another couple \nof hundred dollars on the car.\n  Bankruptcy relief was never meant to allow this kind of abuse. \nHardworking Americans, including the members of credit unions \nnationwide, have been victimized by abusers of the current bankruptcy \nsystem long enough.\n  Bankruptcy abuse also hurts our nation's small businesses. Without \nreforms from this bill, losses from bankruptcy abuse will continue to \nbreak the backs of the Nation's small businesses and retailers, which \nwork with slim profit margins and have even smaller margins for error.\n  Make no mistake: Misrepresentations about this legislation are still \nrunning rampant by those who oppose any meaningful bankruptcy reform. \nYet despite the allegations of opponents of reform,the poor are not \naffected by the means test. The legislation provides a ``safe harbor'' \nfor those who fall below the median income, so they are not subjected \nto the means test at all.\n  Another misrepresentation I have heard again and again is that this \nlegislation won't let people file for bankruptcy relief when they need \nit. The fact is, this legislation does not deny anyone access to \nbankruptcy relief, it just requires those who have the means to repay \ntheir debts based on their income to do so. It is that simple.\n  Opponents of this legislation have also waged the claim that it \nsomehow hurts women and children. This falsehood is a particularly \ndisturbing for me to hear, because I have had a long history of \nadvocating for children and families on Congress, and I have worked \ntirelessly, provision by provision, to make this legislation \ndramatically improve the position of children and ex-spouses who are \nentitled to domestic support.\n  It can be difficult to get the word out, when misrepresentations \nabound, about what bankruptcy reform legislation really does.\n  I am optimistic that this much needed bankruptcy reform legislation \nwill be signed into law this year. We have a no-nonsense President in \nthe White House, who understands the importance of personal \nresponsibility. Let's get through these necessary housekeeping votes \nand move to enact meaningful bankruptcy reform.\n  I said many times during the debates on bankruptcy that the American \npeople have waited long enough to have these improvements in the \nbankruptcy code that are fair to everybody and that basically require \npeople to be responsible instead of irresponsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I heard the Senator from Alabama, and \nI believe I heard the Senator from Utah as well, say that the core of \nthe bill is the means test, and all the means test does is force people \nto go into chapter 13. Therefore, the benefit doesn't affect low-income \npeople, contrary to what I have said in this debate.\n  The means test is only 9 pages out of a 200-page bill. If the means \ntest was all this bill consisted of, then this bill would have passed 2 \nyears ago or 2\\1/2\\ years ago.\n  The bankruptcy bill purports to target abuses of the bankruptcy code \nby wealthy scofflaws and deadbeats who make up, by the way, 3 percent \nof all the filers, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute. Yet \nhundreds of thousands of Americans file for bankruptcy every year, not \ngaming the system--I need to say it more times--but because they are \noverwhelmed with medical bills.\n  Unfortunately, there are at least 15 provisions in S. 420 that make \nit harder to get a fresh start, regardless of whether the debtor is a \nscofflaw or a person who must file because they are made insolvent \nbecause of their medical debt or because they have lost their jobs or \nbecause of a divorce in the family and they are now a single parent \nwith children. These measures not only include but also are in addition \nto the means test. If the means test was the whole piece of \nlegislation, it would be quite a different story.\n  Neither the means test nor the safe harbor in the bill apply to the \nvast majority of new burdens that are placed on debtors.\n  Under S. 420, debtors will face these hurdles to filing regardless of \ntheir circumstances.\n  An analysis in the Wall Street Journal last week put it this way. \nThese are not my words:\n\n[[Page S7550]]\n\n       The bill is full of hassle-creating provisions, some \n     reasonable, and some prone to abuse by aggressive creditors \n     trying to get paid at the expense of others. In a thicket of \n     compromises, Congress is losing sight of the goal of making \n     sure that most debtors pay their bills while offering a fresh \n     start to those who honestly can't.\n\n  That is the Wall Street Journal analysis.\n  This amendment will preserve the fresh start for those debtors who \nhonestly can't make it because they are drowning in medical debt.\n  My colleague from Alabama said this is a bankruptcy bill. It only \ndeals with the bankruptcy code and bankruptcy court reform, including \nbanking measures targeted at credit card companies that Senator \nWellstone suggested is inappropriate.\n  Why is it inappropriate? If the point of this legislation is to \nreduce bankruptcy, then it would seem to me that we might want to take \na look at the big banks and credit cards that have been pushing for \ntheir legislation. They are the only ones pushing for this legislation. \nYou are hard pressed to find a bankruptcy judge that supports this \nlegislation. You are hard pressed to find a bankruptcy law professor, a \nbankruptcy expert of any kind, anywhere, any place in the U.S.A. that \nbacks this bill. This bill was written for the lender. It is that \nsimple.\n  That is why this piece of legislation doesn't hold them accountable. \nIt has basically been written for them.\n  It is ridiculous on its face that this legislation divorces \nirresponsible behavior of the credit card companies from the high \nnumber of bankruptcies. All of the evidence points to the fact that \nlenders and their poor practices are a big part of the problem. It is \noutrageous that we don't confront them. There isn't a parent in this \ncountry that is not well aware of the ways in which these credit card \ncompanies are constantly pushing these loans onto our children or onto \nour grandchildren. Everybody knows we are bombarded with it all the \ntime.\n  Both the House and Senate bills basically give a free ride to banks \nand credit card companies that deserve much of the blame for the high \nnumber of bankruptcies because of their loose credit standards. But \neven the Senate bill does very little to address this issue. There is a \nminor disclosure provision, and that is it. It is pathetic. Lenders \nshould not be rewarded for reckless lending.\n  Where is the blame? If we are holding the debtors accountable, why \naren't we holding the lenders accountable?\n  Again, I want to make the argument one more time. I think we know the \nanswer. This legislation has the support of a lot of people, and the \nPresident says he supports it. As a matter of fact, there are going to \nbe precious few votes against cloture.\n  I am going to come back out here next week again and try to delay \nthis bill. I am not arguing one-to-one correlation of any one Senator's \nvote on this legislation, but at an institutional level in terms of, if \nyou will, where the mobilization of bias is. It seems to me it is \ncrystal clear that this legislation is a tribute to the power and clout \nof the financial service industry in Washington. Let's call it what it \nis. This legislation is a tribute to the power and the financial might \nof the industry that has plowed millions and millions of dollars into \nthis Congress.\n  Why has Congress come down so hard on ordinary folks who are down on \ntheir luck? Why is it that this legislation is so skewed towards the \ninterest of big banks and big credit card companies?\n  I think the people who are going to be affected in a very harsh way \nare the 50 percent who file for bankruptcy because of medical bills. It \nis a double whammy--a medical bill you can't afford to pay, and maybe \nyou can't work because of your illness or sickness or maybe it is your \nchild's sickness or illness. A large part of the rest are people who \nare either out of work or because of the dramatic rise in single adult \nhouseholds by women because of divorce with children.\n  Do you want to say these people are deadbeats? I think these families \njust do not have these million-dollar lobbyists representing them. They \ndo not get hundreds of thousands of dollars in soft money such as \neither the Democratic Party or the Republican Party. They do not spend \ntheir days hanging outside the Senate Chamber to bend a Member's ear. I \nthink what happened is the industry just got to us first.\n  The truth is--and I will conclude on this note--outside this building \nthere is hardly any support for this legislation. It is a bad bill. It \npunishes the vulnerable and rewards the big banks and credit card \ncompanies for their poor practices.\n  I will tell you something. I am just trying to delay this, and then \nwe will do it again next week. There are going to be very few votes, \nbut I will say, even to my colleague from Iowa, who I insist is \nprobably one of the best Senators in the Senate--I believe that; \notherwise, I would not say it--this bill makes no sense to me. First of \nall, it made no sense to me when we started on this issue a number of \nyears ago because the arguments were sort of outpaced by the data \nbecause all the bankruptcies supposedly were taking place. We were \nchasing a problem that did not exist, according to all the studies.\n  Now we are heading into difficult times. We are heading into hard \neconomic times. More people are losing their jobs and medical costs are \ngoing up. We are going to make it hard for people to rebuild their \nlives. We are going to make it hard for people to rebuild their \nfinancial lives.\n  This piece of legislation is too one-sided, and it is too harsh. I \nwill tell you, it is just testimony to the power of this industry. I do \nnot do any damage to the truth when I say that when I am in a coffee \nshop in Minnesota, I do not--I repeat this again--have people running \nup to me saying: Please, Senator Wellstone, pass that bankruptcy \n``reform'' bill because we think you ought to go after all the \ndeadbeats and all the people cheating, although you have no evidence to \nsupport that you have a lot of cheaters--not when 50 percent of the \npeople who file it do so because of medical bills, with more and more \npeople losing their jobs, and, as I say, the most dramatic rise is \namong single adult women who head households.\n  People do not come up to me and say: Please, do that. They want to \ntalk about the health care costs going up. They want to talk about a \nfair price, if they are farming. They want to talk about their children \nand education. They want to talk about the struggle to find a good job \nthat pays a good wage so they can support their families. They want to \ntalk about the costs of higher education. They want to talk about their \nconcern that they will not have a pension. That is what they want to \ntalk about.\n  What in the world is the Senate doing making this a priority? The \nfolks with the clout, with the power, and with the money got here \nfirst. I think that is what this is all about. I am going to continue \nto oppose this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Her responsibilities included managing all \ninstitutional issues for the Senate leader and all Democratic Senators. \nShe had the responsibilities for all the plans and the implementation \nof the issues conferences and other events for the Democratic caucus \nand managed all aspects of participation by Democratic Senators in the \nnational party conventions.\n  But that is just the latest in a series of responsibilities that she \nhas had that go back now almost three decades.\n  She was the Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Senate from 1989 to 1995. \nShe served as the Chief Operating Officer of the Secretary of the \nSenate, managing 12 departments with approximately 250 staff members. \nHer responsibilities at that time included budgeting, policy and \nprogram development, and implementation of human resources management. \nThe administrative reform and modernization programs were under her \nresponsibility as well.\n  Prior to serving in that capacity, she was a senior staff member to \nSenator John Tunney; special assistant to the Sergeant at Arms; and the \nDeputy Director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.\n  Jeri received her bachelor of arts from the University of Washington. \nShe was Kodak fellow at Harvard University's program for senior \nmanagers in government. She was selected as one of the 100 top data \nprocessors in government, industry, and academia for her work in \nautomating the legislative processes and procedures in the Senate in \n1993.\n  That is her resume. What you don't know in reading the resume is what \nkind of person she is. I know of no more dedicated person in the Halls \nof Congress than Jeri Thomson. I know of no one I have had a greater \njoy working with than Jeri Thomson. I know of no one who loves this \ninstitution more than Jeri Thomson. I know of no one who has greater \nrespect among our colleagues in the Senate than Jeri Thomson.\n  It should come as no surprise that Jeri Thomson is now our Secretary \nof the Senate. I commend her for all she has done. I thank her for what \nshe has now agreed to do. I wish her well as she begins this very \nimportant new responsibility.\n  I might add that her family, David James and two daughters, Kaitlin \nand Kristin, and mother Louise are all here to help celebrate this \nmomentous occasion. We welcome Jeri's family. We thank them for being a \npart of this celebration and we wish them and Jeri well as they begin.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I certainly join the distinguished \nDemocratic leader in congratulating Jeri Thomson on her selection and \nelection to be the Secretary of the Senate. I know that Senator \nDaschle, as majority leader, will have a very effective Secretary of \nthe Senate in this fine person and that she will do her typical \nnonpartisan, fair and efficient job in this role.\n  We know Jeri. She has been here a long time. She is one of the \ninstitutions, if I might say--except for age, of course--of the Senate. \nShe has always been very fair and very reasonable in her dealings with \nthe Republicans in the Senate. We appreciate that. We know that is the \nway that she will proceed in the future. This is a very important role. \nIf you go back and look at the history of the Senate, Senator Byrd \ncertainly can tell us that this is a position we have had for years. \nThe first Secretary was chosen on April 8, 1789, two days after the \nSenate achieved its first quorum for business. It is a very important \nrole in the functioning of the Senate--the paperwork, administratively, \nthe computers, the people serving here in the Chamber. There are so \nmany important roles that that position requires careful consideration \nof, and work and development. I know she will do that.\n\n  I urge Jeri Thomson to do as I urged her predecessor, Gary Sisco, in \nthat position, to make sure you do such a job that when you leave the \nposition, the office and the position will be even better than it was \nwhen you took it over. I know you will do that. We extend to you our \nbest wishes and our cooperation.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I offer my personal congratulations \nand all good wishes to Jeri. I think she is going to be a superb \nSecretary of the Senate. What most people don't know about Jeri Thomson \nis that not only is she a talented professional, but she is a very nice \nperson. She and I had knee surgery at approximately the same time, and \nI really never had a better friend during that period. She sent me \nbooks to read, made phone calls, even sent me a special pillow that \ncould be used to help the pain from one knee to another. It was a \nwonderful gesture.\n  In the course of discussions about our relative injuries, over the \npast almost year now, I have come to know her very well. This is truly \na distinguished woman because it is very hard to be an excellent \nprofessional and also to take the time that is necessary to reach out a \nhand to make someone feel a little bit better.\n  Jeri, you are all of the above. Congratulations and godspeed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7552]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was very pleased to see Jeri Thomson \nbecome the new Secretary of the Senate. Knowing my own days as a \nbrandnew Senator, the role of Secretary of the Senate was very \nimportant, and it is even more important now. I am delighted she is \nhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7552-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7552-S7553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nBANKRUPTCY ABUSE PREVENTION AND CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 2001--MOTION \n                         TO PROCEED--Continued\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand that the time of the swearing in and the \ncomments may have affected the time as to our 12 o'clock vote. Can the \nChair advise me how much time is remaining under controlled time prior \nto the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 21\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I think colleagues are \nexpecting a vote at 12. I yield the next 15 minutes to the Senator from \nVermont if he wants it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I probably won't even use all of that. I thank the Senator \nfrom Minnesota for his customary courtesy.\n  I suggest that we make a few comments, and I will certainly support \nwhatever moves to yield back whatever time we may have so that we can \nvote at 12. The Senator from Minnesota is absolutely right, Senators \nare expecting this noon vote.\n  After today's vote on the motion to proceed, I am going to send an \namendment to the desk for myself, the distinguished Senator from Utah, \nMr. Hatch, and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration. So that Senators will know, this amendment \nwill be the text of S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, as it \npassed the Senate on March 15 by a vote of 83-15. I was one of the 83, \nas were Senators Hatch and Grassley. I voted for the Senate form \nbecause it marked a bipartisan effort on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand Members on the floor. We worked in the committee and then in the \nChamber to produce a more fair and balanced bill because of our \nbipartisan amendment process.\n  During our consideration of the Bankruptcy Reform Act, Democratic and \nRepublican Senators authored and passed 38 amendments between the \nJudiciary Committee and the Senate floor. That improved the bill. I \nwill certainly be able to vote for it on the floor. I will be able to \nvote for that in conference.\n  We adopted the Leahy-Hatch amendment to protect the personal privacy \nof consumers whose information is held by firms in bankruptcy. Our \namendment permits bankruptcy courts to honor the privacy policies of \nbusiness debtors and creates a consumer privacy ombudsman to protect \npersonal privacy in bankruptcy proceedings--the first ever in Federal \nlaw.\n  Unfortunately, we had to do this. The reason the Leahy-Hatch \namendment is needed is that the customer lists and databases of failed \nfirms can now be put up for sale in bankruptcy without any privacy \nconsiderations. Just so people who don't spend much time on the \nInternet will understand what I am talking about, many times you go \ninto a Web site and they will have a very clear privacy policy where \nthey say: We will never share your name, disclose your address or your \ninformation. They may well mean it. For example, you may have a case \nwhere you want your children to be able to go on, but under the clear \nprivacy--they may be children's books or anything else. They are \nwilling to have your children go there, and you rely on the privacy \nline that says, ``Under no circumstances will we reveal these names.''\n  But then if the Web site goes into bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court \nis faced with this kind of a situation. They look at the failed \ncompany, and they say they have a few outdated computers, they have a \ncouple scuffed-up desks, a building. They do have one thing that may be \nworth something, one asset, and that is the list of all the people who \nhave gone there--the names of your children and everybody else who may \nbe on there. The bankruptcy court is put in this kind of a Hobson's \nchoice. They are sworn to have to seek the best return on whatever \nassets remain for the creditors. Yet the people who created the assets, \nthose who visit the Web site, are promised nobody is ever going to \ndisclose their names. So this will at least ameliorate, or go a long \nway toward solving, the problems there.\n  We adopted the Schumer amendment to prevent the discharge of debts \nfrom violence against reproductive health service clinics.\n  During our hearing on bankruptcy reform legislation, Maria Vullo, a \ntop-rated attorney, testified about the need to amend the bankruptcy \ncode to stop wasteful litigation and end abusive bankruptcy filings \nused to avoid the legal consequences of violence, vandalism, and \nharassment to deny access to legal health services.\n  If somebody is going to break the law and use violence against health \nclinics, and somebody then brings a suit against them to recover for \ndamages because of their violence, they should not be able to say: I am \ngoing to get away with this and go into bankruptcy court. They should \nnot be shielded by bankruptcy.\n  We adopted the amendment of the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, \nMr. Kohl, to cap homestead exemptions at $125,000, to limit wealthy \ndebtors from abusing State laws to hide million-dollar mansions from \ntheir creditors. If somebody knows they are going to declare \nbankruptcy, they can take whatever cash on hand and in certain States \nbuy a multimillion-dollar mansion knowing they might be protected. \nSenator Kohl has been a champion of closing this loophole for the rich.\n  At our hearing in the committee, Brady Williamson, the former chair \nof the National Bankruptcy Reform Commission, testified that ending \nhomestead abuse was a key and consensus recommendation from the \nBankruptcy Reform Commission. They all joined on that.\n  Last month, the Florida Supreme Court issued a ruling that \nunderscores the need for a national homestead cap to prevent bankruptcy \nabuses. The highest court in Florida ruled a debtor can still keep the \nfull value of his home even if the homestead is acquired with the \nspecific intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. That should not \nbe the rule.\n  We adopted several amendments by Senator Feingold to strengthen \nchapter 12 to help family farmers with the difficulties they face. I \nhope we can finally make chapter 12 a permanent part of the bankruptcy \ncode. Family farmers and ranchers deserve these protections to help \nprevent foreclosures and forced auctions.\n  I know Senator Grassley and Senator Carnahan, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, and other Senators on a bipartisan basis strongly \nsupport permanent bankruptcy protection for family farmers, and I am \nproud to join Senator Grassley and Senator Carnahan in that support.\n  The complex and competing interests involved in achieving fair and \nbalanced reforms of our bankruptcy system demand we work in a \nbipartisan manner throughout the legislative process.\n  I look forward to working with Senators and Representatives on both \nsides of the aisle to further improve this legislation in conference.\n  Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from Iowa is here. I \nask unanimous consent that at noon, all time, held by whomever, be \ndeemed to have been yielded back, and we will be prepared then to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I stand here today not in opposition to \nmoving forward with the Bankruptcy Reform Act, but to send a clear \nmessage that I continue to have strong reservations about whether this \nbill is both balanced and responsible. I have long said that debtors \nthat have the genuine capacity to repay some of their debt should be \nrequired to do so, but abuses by creditors need to be stopped.\n  I grew up with a father who never accepted any credit--never had a \ncredit card in his life. He taught me the importance of always working \nhard and paying your debts. I believe every American should work hard \nto spend\n\n[[Page S7553]]\n\nresponsibly and to repay their debts, but I also know that some \nfamilies are hit by unexpected hardships.\n  This bill should not have the effect of targeting our most vulnerable \nconsumers--women who are left with little resources as their husbands \nwho were the primary breadwinners leave the family; or families with no \nhealth insurance who are struck with financial hardship when one family \nmember becomes critically ill; or another family who suddenly finds \nthat the primary breadwinner is laid off with little employment \nopportunities available in the region.\n  These are not the families who need to be further stuck by hardship \nof bankruptcy reform that is inflexible or overly harsh on debtors.\n  I voted for the S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, because I \nbelieved and still do believe that there were some important \nprotections added to the Senate bill, but I will absolutely not vote in \nfavor of the final bankruptcy reform bill if it does not include at \nleast these minimal protections for our most vulnerable consumers.\n  During the floor debate on S. 420, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2001, \nI worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to add \nadditional protections for women and children. I worked hard to ensure \nthat once bankruptcy is complete, we do more to ensure that single \nmothers can collect the child support they depend upon. Senator Hatch \nand I passed an amendment to ensure that the holder of the claim, \nmeaning the parent with custody of the child, most often the mother, is \ninformed by the bankruptcy trustee of his or her right to have the \nState child support agency collect the nondischargeable child support \nfrom the ex-spouse. I believe this change will help inform women of \ntheir rights to have the State help them in their claims to collect \nchild support.\n  In addition, I was concerned about competing non-dischargeable debt \nso I worked hard with Senator Boxer to ensure that more credit card \ndebt can be erased so that women who use their credit cards for food, \nclothing and medical expenses in the 90 days before bankruptcy do not \nhave to litigate each and every one of these expenses for the first \n$750.\n  These are the most minimal of changes that I believe need to be in \nthe final bill. I still do not believe that they go far enough. I \nbelieve that the final bill should protect child support full stop. I \ndo not believe that child support should have to compete with any \ncredit card debt. But it should certainly not retreat from these \nchanges. The cap on protected expenses should not be lowered to the \nHouse version of $250.\n  I also believe that the bill needs to include Senator Schumer's \namendment to ensure that any debts resulting from any act of violence, \nintimidation, or threat would be nondischargeable. It was a victory for \nthe Senate to include this important amendment to ensure that those who \nare responsible for violence against women's health clinics are held \nresponsible for their actions. I do not believe we should retreat on \nthis point.\n  Let me be clear. This bill should go further to protect consumers, \nbut it should certainly not retreat from the consumer protections in \nthe bill.\n  I will vote for cloture on this bill, but I believe that as we move \nto conference we need to continue to work to ensure that we continue to \ngain more balance between creditors and debtors.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It was on the issue of oil drilling in \nnational monuments, national treasures.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, the beaches of Florida are \nnational treasures to us because of the importance of the beaches to \nour economy. If there is an oilspill, and a slick comes in on one of \nour beaches, it will shut down a beach, such as Clearwater Beach, for \nyears and years. In an economy with a $50 billion tourism industry, in \nthe Nation's fourth largest State, that is simply not worth the risk to \nus in Florida.\n  For the first time, the eastern planning area of the gulf, which \nheretofore has not been drilled, save for one test drill up here, is \nbeing invaded by this offering for lease of 1.5 million acres coming \nacross the line. It is inevitable, in the march eastward, it would go \nstraight toward Tampa Bay.\n  This is a matter of national treasure to us.

We think the Gulf of \nMexico, in places far from the shores of Florida, has an ample supply \nof natural gas.\n  Let us not move in the wrong direction. Our country needs us to \nrespond in a positive way. This is not a new area. It is rich with \nnatural gas. It was a compromise reached by a Democratic administration \nwith many environmental organizations and with the industry. It is \nmoderate.\n  If you are for rolling blackouts and high prices, vote with Senator \nNelson. If you are for reasonable energy policy, vote with me when I \nmove, on behalf of Senator Breaux, to table this amendment.\n  I yield the Senator 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Chair.\n  I bring to the attention of my colleagues, lease sale 181 was \nproposed by President Bill Clinton. It was this entire tract of area \nthat I show you on this map. Democratic President Bill Clinton proposed \nit. The Democratic Governor of Florida at the time was Governor Lawton \nChiles, our former colleague. He agreed to lease sale 181 because he \ntook into consideration where it was located. They signed off on it.\n  In addition to that, the Democratic energy bill offered by our \nchairman, Jeff Bingaman, calls for going forward with lease sale 181. \nThe potential natural gas in this lease sale, which has now been \nreduced in size by 75 percent, could supply 7 years' worth of natural \ngas to the State of Florida.\n  I ask, if we can't drill for oil and natural gas in the Gulf of \nMexico, where in the world are we going to find it?\n  I think we should table the Nelson amendment. It is bad energy \npolicy. It is not appropriate to undermine the carefully balanced \nproposal by President Clinton and also now by President Bush. We should \ntable the amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. 893.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 67, nays 33, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--67\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--33\n\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Carnahan\n     Cleland\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Stabenow\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, it is my understanding that we \nautomatically go to the Interior bill, is that right, for the purpose \nof further debate and amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Oregon has an amendment he wishes to \noffer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 899\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The pending amendment will be set \naside and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith of Oregon] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 899.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nfurther reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S7555]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To direct the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to take certain \n  actions for the recovery of the lost river sucker and the shortnose \nsucker, and to clarify the operations of the Klamath Project in Oregon \n                and California, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert:\n       ``None of the funds made available under this or any other \n     Act may be used to provide any flows from the Klamath Project \n     other than those set forth in the 1992 biological opinion for \n     Lost River and shortnose suckers and the July 1999 biological \n     opinion on project operations issued by the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service, until the Fish and Wildlife Service takes \n     the following actions identified or discussed in the April \n     1993 recovery plan for Lost River suckers and shortnose \n     suckers:\n       (a) establishes at least one stable refugial population \n     with a minimum of 500 adult fish for each unique stock of \n     Lost River and shortnose suckers;\n       (b) secures refugial sites for upper Klamath Lake suckers:\n       (c) uses aeration for improving water quality and to expand \n     refugial areas of relatively good water quality within Upper \n     Klamath Lake;\n       (d) improves larval rearing and refuge habitat in the lower \n     Williamson and Wood Rivers through increased vegetative \n     cover;\n       (e) extirpates exotic species that are predators of the \n     suckers:\n       (f) assesses the need for captive propagation and the \n     potential for improving sucker stocks through \n     supplementation, and the Secretary has submitted a report, \n     including recommendations, to the Congress;\n       (g) implements a plan to monitor relative abundance of all \n     life stages for all sucker populations;\n       (h) develops a plan to reduce losses of fish due to water \n     diversions;\n       (i) determines the distribution and abundance of suckers in \n     all waterbodies in the Upper Klamath Basin;\n       (j) implements the plan for wetland rehabilitation pilot \n     projects;\n       (k) implements the most effective strategy to provide fish \n     passage upstream of the Sprague River Dam;\n       (l) implements the plan to enhance spring spawning habitat \n     in Upper Klamath Lake and Agency Lake;\n       and develops water management plans and land management \n     plans, including sump rotations where appropriate, for the \n     national wildlife refuges that receive water from the Klamath \n     Project; and subsequently completes an evaluation of the \n     impact of these actions on the recovery of the suckers before \n     determining whether further modifications to project \n     operations are needed and submits such evaluation to the \n     Secretary of the Interior and to the Congress.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, many Americans are becoming \nfamiliar with a part of my State and a part of California known as the \nKlamath Basin because of the coverage of a tragic situation that has \ndeveloped there in a contest between suckerfish and farmers. If I may \nbe permitted, I will put some context to this conflict.\n  I am the first Senator to be elected from Oregon who comes from its \nrural parts--eastern Oregon--in 70 years. I represent all of my State, \nbut I have a special passion to represent those rural parts that I have \nwatched be devastated for too long by Federal action. I believe the \nEndangered Species Act is a noble act with noble purposes, but I \nbelieve it is being used by some to very ignoble ends.\n  My actions today are not to subvert the Endangered Species Act. This \nis not reform. This is an act asking that its terms be implemented in a \nway that will relieve genuine human suffering in a way that may prevent \nthe violence that has already been visited upon Federal property in a \ncontest between farmers and the Bureau of Reclamation for the essential \ningredient to life in the West, and that is water.\n  What has happened to the community of Klamath Falls, by conservative \nestimates, will cost that county $200 million. I thank the Senator from \nWest Virginia, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and \nothers, who helped me to get $20 million of relief to these people. \nObviously, it is 10 percent of what is needed, even by conservative \nestimates.\n  What I propose to do today is to try to go back to a biological \nopinion that was in place just last April that would have permitted \nthis drought to be managed as were the droughts in 1992 and in 1994, in \nwhich the suckerfish survived, as did the agricultural community around \nit.\n  When I speak of the agricultural community, I have to also mention \nthe wildlife refuges that get their water from this basin but which are \nnow drying up. So farmers and fowl are left with nothing under the new \nbiological opinion.\n  I do this because, in 1993, the Fish and Wildlife Service laid out a \nplan of action for what it could do to save the suckerfish, so that \n200,000 acres of land continue to receive water and that fish could \nsurvive. But none of these proposed action plans were pursued. For \nexample, it recommended the removal of the Sprague River Dam, which \nwould have made available tremendous spawning areas for the suckerfish. \nBut that wasn't done. And there were many other actions that could have \nbeen taken to provide aeration, to improve the condition of this lake, \nso that the suckerfish could survive and the farmers along with it.\n  But now what we are doing is we are raising this lake 3 feet--it is a \nvery big lake, very shallow, but it is being raised 3 feet--and cutting \noff all the water to farmers and fowl. It is being done to save the \nsuckerfish, and now, while it is being saved, it is warming up. So the \ncoho salmon that will soon be returning expecting to receive the cool \nwaters of the Klamath will receive waters the temperature of a swimming \npool. So, potentially, even the coho salmon--which is also a listed \nspecies--could be adversely affected by this biological opinion.\n  Well, there are two agencies of the Federal Government that are \ncompeting. One biological opinion is Fish and Wildlife with regard to \nthe suckerfish. The other is the biological opinion of the National \nMarine Fisheries Service and the Commerce Department that affects the \ncoho salmon. Both biological opinions essentially ask for 100 percent \nof the water which means cutting off 100 percent of the people.\n\n  The point I want to make is that would not be necessary if the \nFederal Government over the last 8 years would have kept its part of \nthe bargain and done what it could to mitigate the impact to the sucker \nso that farmers would not be victimized.\n  What I do is simply reinstate the previous biological opinions that \nwere in effect before this spring until the Federal Government can \ncomplete action on numerous recommendations of its 1993 recovery plan. \nAgain, they were not acted upon over the last 8 years. Why? They say \nbudgetary reasons.\n  I want this to be a priority. I want the budget to fix this problem. \nI do not want the whole budget burden thrown on the backs of rural \npeople, but that is what was decided to be done.\n  I want to put some other context to this. This is a current farm \nfamily in Klamath Falls. These are the human faces being affected by \nwhat is being done. Foreclosure notices are already going out. Let me \ntell my colleagues about their parents. These are the parents. This is \nthe front cover of Life magazine, January 20, 1947. This is a veteran \nof the Second World War. These are people who came home, having saved \nliberty, having defended democracy, having made the United States the \npower in the world that it is today, the force for good that it is \ntoday.\n  In his wisdom, Franklin Roosevelt, even before the war, began to open \nup this land so that people would have a way to escape the Great \nDepression, coming home from the war, and a place to go to work.\n  This is the land, the valley. I do not know whether my colleagues can \nsee it, but this couple is overlooking the Klamath Basin--farms being \ndeveloped, hay being raised, corn being raised, potatoes being raised \nthat fill our shelves today. Look at the hopes and dreams in the faces \nof these people.\n  This is a little girl at an assembly of people at a rally a few weeks \nago. Her sign says: ``Mommy says I can't eat, but fish can.''\n  That is what we are driving them to, and it is not right because they \nare being told they are of lesser value under our law than the \nshortnosed sucker.\n  This is a picture of the shortnosed sucker. It is a bottom-feeding \nfish. It lives in this shallow lake. It has gone through many droughts \nalong with the farmers. It has survived, stressed, I am sure, just as \nhumans are stressed in conditions of drought.\n  I am not saying this fish has no value. I have never thought the \nsuckerfish is very good looking, but it has a mother, and that mother, \nI am sure, loves this fish. I know the Native Americans in this area \nvalue this fish,\n\n[[Page S7556]]\n\nand I am not suggesting in any way that we are not interested in saving \nthis fish.\n  I am saying the purpose of the Endangered Species Act was not to \nengage in a process of rural cleansing, of throwing off their property \npeople who had been given great promise and hope for the future. They \nare meeting the mailmen with foreclosure notices because the Federal \nGovernment decided it is going to breach its promise.\n  Let me show you, Mr. President, the deeds of the lands they were \ngiven. These are veterans. I doubt you can see it, but this is a deed \nassigned to a veteran of the Second World War to go to Klamath. The \nveteran's name goes in this space, and it is signed by Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt.\n\n  My point is that when we proceed to engage in environmental \nrestoration, we must not forget that we have a human concern as well. \nWe can do both, I am absolutely convinced of it, but we cannot do both \nunder this condition.\n  This Klamath circumstance is different than other endangered species \nconflicts that always seem to pit the man against the beast. This is \ndifferent. This is about something that is possible, where we can save \nthe fish and we do not sacrifice the people.\n  I want to keep Franklin Roosevelt's promise alive today because these \nreclamation projects were greatly expanded under his leadership and an \ninland empire was built of rural people, but now those people are being \ntold they are of lesser value than the suckerfish. I do not think \nFranklin Roosevelt would agree. I do not agree.\n  Mr. President, I plead for my colleagues to remember the human faces \nin this picture, to remember the promises made, and to help me help \nthese people. This is not about a fish versus a farmer, unless we go \ndown the road of these current biological opinions which have not been \npeer reviewed, in which the people there have no confidence. They are \nbiological opinions that began with a determined outcome, and all of \nthe activities that were said would be pursued--to provide off-stream \nimpoundment, take out a dam, provide some aeration--none of those \nthings was done.\n  The only way I am going to get the Interior Department to understand \nthat it cannot forget its human stewardship, that the Bureau's promises \nstill ought to matter, is to go back to the old opinion and tell them \nthat the new one cannot happen until they keep the promises made in \n1993. In the meantime, this fish will survive, but my farmers will not \nif we do not begin to reverse course.\n  It is too late for this year's crops, I grant you that, but it is \nturning into a dust bowl that existed prior to Franklin Roosevelt's \nvision, and foreclosure notices are going out. At least now we can \noffer some hope that we, on our watch, will not permit this to be \nrepeated. We need to give them some more money to make sure that no \nfarm is lost to foreclosure because of Government inaction and then \nthis action. But we have to help. We have to say this will not happen \nagain.\n  I do not know how to plead this in as personal terms as I can for the \nhelp of this body to head off a disaster. This is not fish versus \nfarmers. It does not have to be that. But it is that now under what has \nhappened over the last 8 years.\n\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. In relation to the Smith amendment, I move to table. I ask \nfor the yeas and nays. And I further ask unanimous consent that the \nvote be held at 1:45. There are a number of people who are unable to \ncome to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second on the motion to \ntable?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that prior to the 1:45 vote, the \nSenator from Oregon be granted 2 minutes and the Senator from \nCalifornia be granted 2 minutes to explain the amendment to the Members \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada for making a \nmotion to table the Smith amendment, which we will vote on at \napproximately 1:45. I wanted to thank my friend from Arizona who has an \namendment he wants to lay down. He was gracious to allow me to go ahead \nof him and just not to interrupt the debate.\n  I hope the motion to table the Smith of Oregon amendment does carry. \nWe all share deep concerns about the current drought in southern Oregon \nand in northern California. My constituents have also been hard hit by \nthis very dry year. But I think we cannot legislate on an issue that is \nso far-reaching by bringing an amendment to the floor before we have \neven looked at the possible remedies.\n  I joined my colleague from Oregon in seeking $20 million in economic \nrelief for losses facing Klamath Basin farmers, and I certainly pledge \nto continue working with him to seek more funding and a long-term \nsolution to this very vexing problem of getting enough water for \neveryone who needs it and everyone who deserves it.\n  The whole history of my State is, in many ways, built around the \nwater issue. It is something we deal with all the time because we have \nmore ag than any other State. It is one of our biggest businesses in \nCalifornia. We also know our State thrives because of tourism, our \nenvironmental ethic is very strong, and because we have such a \nmagnificent State we get the tourists.\n  Of course, we have more people than any other State in the Union--now \nalmost 34 million people. So you have a constant debate, if you will, a \nconstant struggle, if you will, between all the stakeholders. Everyone \nhas something at stake with the water supply: The farmer, urban users, \nsuburban users, and certainly the wildlife which do not have a voice, \nbut we have to be their voice.\n  I can't join my colleague from Oregon in undermining the Endangered \nSpecies Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in a recent opinion \ntells us that without this water the endangered fish will go extinct.\n  Science tells us through the Fish and Wildlife Service that there are \ntwo species of fish that will become extinct if we carry out the plan \nof the Senator from Oregon.\n  If we are going to take an action that would lead to the extinction \nof two species of fish, it ought to be done with a little different \nformat and not come as an amendment to the appropriations bill.\n  I agree that it is very possible that the Fish and Wildlife Service \nhas not fully implemented its 1993 recovery plan for these fish. I call \non them to implement that plan. But cutting off water to the fish this \nyear doesn't solve that problem. It will cause the extinction to take \nplace.\n  I know that the immediate needs of my constituents in the farm areas \nand those in Oregon will not be helped this year. The reality is that \nmost of the region's farmers didn't plant this year because they knew \nabout this drought. Taking the water from these fish and the needs of \nthese species is not going to help the farmers now. But economic relief \nwill help them. I am certainly committed to that.\n  We need to answer the dire needs of the farmers of the Klamath Basin. \nBut driving the fish to extinction while providing little real gain to \nour farmers is certainly the answer.\n  It is very hard to look constituents in the eye when they have a \nproblem and say: If we help you make a move now that you say will help \nyou even though, in fact, in this case it wouldn't really help this \nyear, we can't do it because there is a bigger question; that is, the \ndelicate balance in terms of who needs this water. It is hard to do \nthat. But I think we can't come running to the floor every time to \nundermine laws that are in place--for real reasons. I happen to believe \nthat we have the Endangered Species Act because we have\n\n[[Page S7557]]\n\nto protect God's creatures. That is my own feeling. In fact, it is a \nresponsibility that we have as a people to do that. If we don't do it, \nit is not going to happen. We have to move to protect these species.\n  Again, there may be a reason to take another look at this matter, but \nI hope we will move to table. I am certainly committed to having some \nhearings and moving forward with more economic relief for the farmers \nthat are affected in this Klamath River Basin.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, is the parliamentary situation such that \nthere will be a vote at 1:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is to be a vote at 1:45 and there is 4 \nminutes of debate set aside prior to that vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona will yield, if \nthe Senator from Arizona needs the extra 4 minutes, we would be happy \nto work that out.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 904\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 904.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for any purpose relating to \n                       Vulcan Monument, Alabama)\n\n       On page 153, line 22, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``, of which no funds shall be used for any \n     purpose relating to Vulcan Monument, Alabama''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is with great disappointment I again \nspeak before the Senate about the compounding practice of porkbarrel \nspending, particularly in this year's Interior appropriations bill. \nEarlier this year, the administration and, I believe, our leadership \npledged to curb the Federal Government's practice of funding extraneous \nporkbarrel spending.\n  I applaud the administration for its responsible fiscal stance. There \nis a chance for us to get serious. It might sound amusing. But let me \ntell my colleagues that, according to the Washington Post, House \nMembers requested 18,898 earmarks in appropriations bills passed thus \nfar. Considering this bill in the Senate on Interior, the subcommittee \nreports that it received 1,799 requests for select projects. That is a \nthreefold increase since 1993.\n  It is shameful.\n  This year's Interior appropriations bill is no different. It includes \n$433 million in wasteful and unnecessary spending projects that have \nnot been reviewed to determine if they are indeed the highest funding \npriorities. This amount is $153 million higher than the bill last year.\n  Let me highlight a few examples for you: $5 million to pay for fish \nscreens in the Northwest power planning area; an increase of $2 million \nfor the National Fish Health Lab at the Leetown Science Center--you \nwill notice that most of these are designated geographically--an \nadditional $350,000 for the Chicago Wilderness Program; $1 million for \nnoxious weed management at Montana State University; $150,000 to \nrehabilitate a barn at the John Hay National Wildlife Refuge in New \nHampshire; $3.5 million to renovate a single lodge in a wildlife refuge \nin North Carolina; $700,000 for exhibits at the Rangle National Park in \nAlaska; and an extra $160,000 set aside for public education on the \nYukon River Salmon Treaty. I think that is also Alaska.\n  One of my favorite monuments of porkbarrel spending, another $2 \nmillion is provided to continue refurbishing the Vulcan Monument in \nAlabama. This particular monument also received $1.5 million last year. \nNow we are going to spend $3.5 million to refurbish the Vulcan \nMonument.\n  Earmarks for Alaska continue to exceed unprecedented levels, some of \nwhich are questionable inclusions in this bill. For example, an \nincrease of $1.3 million is earmarked for an Alaska Native aviation \ntraining program.\n  I happen to sit on the Commerce Committee. We were never asked to \nauthorize that.\n  Another $250,000 for the Alaska Market Access Program; $1.1 million \nfor the Cook Inlet Agriculture Association; and $2 million for \nconstruction of kiln drying facilities.\n  My colleagues are well aware the National Park Service still faces a \n$5 billion backlog in capital maintenance and resource needs, and we \nare spending $2 million for the construction of kiln drying facilities.\n  After years of unchecked, questionable spending, we are in the \nunfortunate position of facing critical budget constraints that will \nhamper our ability to fund fully many necessary Federal programs. \nInstead, we are cutting deep into the taxpayers' pockets once again by \nexpecting them to shell out more than $433 million in porkbarrel \nspending included in this bill.\n  I have compiled a 24-page list of objectionable earmarks and \nprovisions in H.R. 2217. Unfortunately, it is too lengthy to include in \nthe Record. But it will be available on my Senate Web page.\n  Now we come to the amendment.\n  Here is the Vulcan God of Fire and Iron. The colossal statue of \nVulcan God of Fire and Iron was in the Palace of Mines and Metallurgy, \nwhere it represented the great iron and fuel industries of Alabama. The \nfigure was cast in iron from a model by G. Morelli, a New York \nsculptor. It was brought to St. Louis in sections in over seven freight \ncars and mounted on a pedestal of coal and cike. The statue of Vulcan \nGod of Fire and Iron stood 50 feet high and weighed 100,000 pounds. It \nwas the largest iron casting ever made, and next to ``Liberty \nEnlightening the World,'' was the largest statue ever constructed. At \nthe close of the Exposition the figure was removed to Birmingham and \nset up in Capital Park to remain as a permanent monument. It is a very \nimpressive statue.\n  Now, in the bill before the Senate today--which, I mentioned, \ncontains over $430 million in spending items that have not been \nproperly reviewed to determine their worthiness for Federal funding--\nthere is another $2 million to add to the $1.5 million last to continue \nVulcan's face-lift.\n  At first blush, having the Federal Government give money to a Roman \ngod may appear to violate the constitutional separation of church and \nstate. Others, with some reason, may believe that this is a rather \nstrange use of limited tax dollars. After all, while the on-budget \nFederal surplus is rapidly dwindling, why should Federal dollars pay \nfor a face-lift of a statue of a Roman god in Alabama?\n  But, Mr. President, I worry this appropriation may set a dangerous \nprecedent for others to follow that will only add millions and millions \nto the billions and billions and billions in pork barrel spending doled \nout year after year.\n  For example, what is to stop a Senator from sunny Arizona or New \nMexico from demanding Federal dollars for a statue of Apollo, god of \nthe Sun?\n  Or how to we prevent a Senator from California to beseech money for a \nstatue of Bacchus, god of wine?\n  Or a Senator from Georgia, home to the great city of Athens, from \nasking for Federal funds to pay tribute to the Goddess Athena?\n  Or even a Senator form the home of some of the best hunting this side \nof the Mississippi, West Virginia, from getting Federal funds for \nArtemis, the ancient Greek goddess of the hunt?\n  Maybe this is the time to stop this. Not one more Federal dollar \nshould be spent on this kind of foolishness.\n  I ask my colleagues to extinguish this Roman god of fire and strike a \nvictory for taxpayers--and Metis, the goddess of prudence--by \nthrottling down our insatiable appetite for pork barrel spenidng--\nstarting today.\n  Finally, Mr. President, there are statues--for a moment of \nseriousness--all over this Nation that require refurbishing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, 4 minutes have been \nreserved at this time for the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7558]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, Mr. President, as I said before, there are \nstatues all over this Nation erected to worthy, wonderful, and \npatriotic Americans as well as people from other countries that need \nrefurbishment. If we are going to start down this path of millions of \ndollars to refurbish a statue of Vulcan, I don't know where it all \nends.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Arizona, it appears the two parties \nin relation to the prior amendment are going to talk for a couple \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Fine.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 899\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the previous order, the Senator from \nCalifornia has 2 minutes in opposition to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Oregon. The Senator from Oregon has 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank the majority whip and the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee for offering to \nhave a hearing. I hope we have a hearing. But, frankly, I need the \npeople of Klamath Falls to know where we are, so I am asking that we \nproceed with the unanimous consent agreement that is already in place, \nthat we have a vote. And I know I may lose this vote. But I say to my \ncolleagues, these are Federal projects. These were Federal promises. \nThis is a Federal action now that is crushing people, some of whom have \nbeen there for 100 years or more. I think it is deplorable that this \nGovernment would have had a biological opinion and a whole list of \nactions they said they would take, and 8 years later there is nothing \ndone except a new opinion that says no water for people, no water for \nfarms.\n  It is time for us to start caring about rural folks who are \nincreasingly powerless. I ask for a vote on their behalf.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized \nunder the previous order.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if I could just be told when I have used \n30 seconds, and I will leave the remainder of the time for Senator \nJeffords, my chairman. And I thank him for coming down here.\n  Water is a vexing issue in California. We have had water wars for a \nlong time. You have to figure out how everyone can be at the table: The \nfarmers, the urban users, suburban users, and the environmental \npeople--people with environmental concerns--because obviously the \nwildlife has no voice. We have to make sure we protect the wildlife.\n  If this amendment goes through today----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask for 10 seconds--two species of fish are gone--that \nis it, extinct. That is the scientific word from Fish and Wildlife. I \nhope we will defeat this amendment.\n  I ask my friend to continue this conversation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, unfortunately, I have to rise in support \nof the motion to table. I had hoped my good friend from Oregon would \nagree to withdraw his amendment so that I could hold a hearing and \nascertain for him and the public whether or not there should be an \nexception granted to the Endangered Species Act with respect to this \nparticular problem. Unfortunately, I understand he does not desire to \ndo so.\n  This is a critical issue and for us to summarily do this would be \nreally inconsistent with the purposes of the Endangered Species Act. \nThat act is an important one, and it is one that has saved many species \nwhich have resulted in huge breakthroughs in medicine and in other \nways.\n  We have to be very careful about what we do with respect to \nendangered species. So I will support the motion to table.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment would prevent the Fish and \nWildlife Service from providing water for fish in the Klamath basin. \nThe water at issue here is water the Service has determined is \nnecessary to prevent the extinction of threatened and endangered \nspecies like the suckerfish and coho salmon in Oregon and California.\n  Only 2 days ago, we approved a supplemental appropriations bill. \nDuring that debate we heard many Members argue for additional spending \nfor very important priorities. Fiscal constrains prevented us for \nmeeting many of them. But one of the priorities we did address in that \nbill dealt with the very subject of this amendment.\n  The bill provided $20 million to assist Oregon farmers who have been \nimpacted by the drought and species concerns in the Klamath basin--$20 \nmillion. They are not the only farmers who have been impacted by \ndrought (it's a problem that affects Nevada's farmers and ranchers this \nyear as well), but to my knowledge they are the only farmers that \nreceived special aid in the supplemental.\n  The State of Nevada faces many of the same problems my colleague has \nspoken about here this afternoon. I would like to work with him to \naddress those problems without modifying the Endangered Species Act in \nthe manner he proposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable amendment No. 899. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 52, nays 48, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 232 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--52\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n\n                                NAYS--48\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 904\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with permission of the managers of the bill, \nI ask that the two Senators from Alabama each have 2 minutes to speak \nin opposition to the McCain amendment, and Senator McCain have the \nfinal 2 minutes to speak in favor of his amendment.\n  This appears to be the last amendment we are going to have on this \nbill. The managers have informed me, along with the two leaders, that \naround 4 o'clock we will have a vote on final passage. It will take \nthat much time to work on the managers' amendment to get together the \nloose pieces.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we proceed now to a vote on the McCain \namendment after the two Senators from Alabama speak and the Senator \nfrom Arizona speaks, and I also ask unanimous consent that when that \nvote is completed, the Senator from Oregon be recognized to speak for 5 \nminutes in relation to the Smith amendment of which we just disposed.\n\n[[Page S7559]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill. I am troubled, quite \nfrankly, that I have to defend Federal funding for historic \npreservation of the Vulcan Monument, which is of great importance to \nthe people of Alabama and the South.\n  The Vulcan Monument in Birmingham, AL, is a unique and enduring \nhallmark of the city. It was constructed in 1904 to mark the 100th \nanniversary of the Louisiana Purchase and stands as a symbol of \neconomic transformation in the South. Much like the Arch, the Golden \nGate Bridge, the Statue of Liberty, and the Liberty Bell represent \ntheir respective cities and are symbols representing greater \nachievements for their communities and our Nation, the Vulcan stands as \nan important historical landmark for Birmingham and represents the \nrebirth of industrial development in the South.\n  I want the record to be clear that while Federal funds are important \nto the restoration of the Vulcan Monument, city and local fundraising \nefforts are leading the way towards completing the restoration project. \nWhile the Federal share for restoration efforts reaches $3.5 million, \nprivate citizens throughout the region have contributed over $10 \nmillion.\n  This is an excellent example of a public-private partnership trying \nto preserve an important historical treasure for the South and our \nNation. It happens to be in Birmingham, AL.\n  I believe this amendment is misguided, and I pray it will be \ndefeated.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know Senator Shelby travels throughout \nAlabama every year in every county, as do I. When we do so, we learn \nsomething about the State. As a kid going into Birmingham, I saw the \nVulcan statue, the symbol for the steel city of Birmingham. It is a \npreeminent symbol of Alabama, and there will be no other statue in the \nState with as much prominence.\n  With the local citizens raising $10 million, with my support and \ncertainly that of Senator Shelby, the contribution from the Federal \nGovernment will help complete this historical renovation and \nrestoration. It is a good use of the money, in my opinion as a Senator \nfrom Alabama. It is a good priority use of money for historic \ndevelopment.\n  I oppose the McCain amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me quote from an October 23, 2000, \nissue of ``U.S. News & World Report'' entitled ``Washington Goes On A \nSpending Spree.''\n\n       . . . a 56-foot, iron rendition of the Roman god of fire \n     and metalwork. Built as an entry for the 1904 World Fair, it \n     won the grand prize in the Palace of Metallurgy. Steward \n     Dansby, executive director of the Vulcan Park Foundation, \n     says officials at the organization talked to Alabama Sen. \n     Richard Shelby about helping to fund the renovation. ``Why \n     are federal tax dollars being spent on a statue in \n     Birmingham?'' asked Dansby. ``Because Vulcan is symbolic of \n     American industrial strength. He represents the working \n     person and. . . . [This is the best part.] These are federal \n     dollars that would have gone somewhere.''\n\n  There are statues all over America that need refurbishment. I hope \neverybody lines up with statues that need to be refurbished because the \nstore seems to be open.\n  I know this amendment will not pass, but everybody ought to be on \nrecord as to whether they support this kind of porkbarreling.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n904. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi) is \nnecessarily abent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 12, nays 87, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 233 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--12\n\n     Allard\n     Bayh\n     Carnahan\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Hollings\n     Kyl\n     McCain\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stabenow\n\n                                NAYS--87\n\n     Akaka\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Enzi\n       \n  The amendment (No. 904) was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nOregon is recognized for a period of 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 899\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, a few minutes ago the Senate voted on an \nEndangered Species Act amendment with special impact for farmers and \nrural people in my home State. I voted against the motion to table with \ngreat reluctance and wanted to take just a couple minutes to explain my \nvote this afternoon.\n  I think it is dangerous to legislate biological opinions about \nspecies without the opportunity to thoughtfully review the effects of \nsuch a far-reaching amendment. I think it is just as dangerous to force \nour citizens in rural communities into dire circumstances when a law \nthat has accomplished many good things contains serious administrative \nflaws that are producing an increasing number of bad things.\n  It was my intent, if the Endangered Species Act amendment had not \nbeen tabled, to offer a second-degree amendment to it. My amendment \nwould have allowed the Senate to pick up on the very generous offer \nmade by Chairman Jeffords to try to get this job done right.\n  My amendment would have sought to try to address the problems in the \nKlamath Basin in a comprehensive way, in a fashion that would have \nhelped farmers produce water conservation and improve water quality \nand, at the same time, would have protected species.\n  I think it is very clear that the challenge with the Endangered \nSpecies Act is to bring folks together. The challenge is to get \neverybody at the table--all of the stakeholders; farmers, environmental \nleaders, scientists, and others--to try to come up with ways that keep \nthe important protections of the Endangered Species Act and, at the \nsame time, encourage the administrative flexibility so we can have more \nhomegrown solutions.\n  I am absolutely convinced that the objectives of the Endangered \nSpecies Act make a lot of sense. But what you do in the Klamath Basin \nhas to be different than what you do in the Bronx. And what you do in \nDetroit to protect a species is different than the challenge in Coos \nBay, OR.\n  I look forward very much to picking up on the generous offer of \nChairman Jeffords to work with our colleagues, on a bipartisan basis, \nto find comprehensive solutions to this Endangered Species Act \nchallenge.\n  As I say, I voted against the motion to table today with great \nreluctance. I am very anxious to work with our colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, for a more comprehensive solution.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the Senate, on a hectic day, giving me a \nfew minutes this afternoon to explain my vote. I yield back and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 975\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside, and further, I ask\n\n[[Page S7560]]\n\nunanimous consent to send an amendment to the desk, that it be in \norder, and it also be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for Mr. Byrd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 975.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, first, I thank the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and the ranking member, Senator \nBurns, for the hard work they have put into this year's Interior and \nrelated agencies appropriations bill. It is a changing process and they \nhave done an excellent job in balancing the competing interests within \nthe confines of our effort to make sure we maintain a balanced budget.\n  At this point, I want to explain the amendment I present. I intend to \nwithdraw the amendment when I am finished discussing it for reasons \nthat will become apparent as I discuss it. In the past couple of years, \nwe have seen a disturbing trend in the Department of the Interior and \nin the Depart of Agriculture regarding our Forest Service relating to \nback-country airstrips. The administration has begun to follow a \npattern of allowing back-country airstrips to either go into a state of \ndisrepair--here they become unusable--or to actually close, permanently \nclose some of them, which is a serious problem to those parts of our \npublic lands that need the services that these back-country airstrips \ncan supply.\n  Idaho, right now, is home to more than 50 of these landing strips, \nand our State is known nationwide for its air access to public lands \nand wilderness and primitive areas. Unfortunately, in the past, many of \nthese airstrips in Idaho, and in other parts of the country, have been \nrendered unserviceable through the neglect I talked about earlier, or \nthe decisions to close the airstrips without adequate public notice or \nany justification being provided.\n  There is a concern about this because these airstrips provide not \nonly access to the back country for recreational use, but they are \ncritical for maintenance and some of the management purposes of the \nagencies in managing our public lands and fighting forest fires, for \nexample, or in providing the necessary access by agency personnel to \nperform their work on public lands, and also as part of rescue missions \nwhen they find the need to provide for rescue. It is those who use the \nback-country airstrips who are often the ones who provide the valiant \nefforts to make rescues of people who are in distress in our national \npublic lands.\n  Senators Craig and Murkowski are cosponsors with me on the \nlegislation to address this issue and to require the agencies to work \nwith State and local communities and to engage in a process of public \nnotice and justification. In fact, it is our hope that, ultimately, we \nwill be able to pass this legislation on a permanent basis. That would \nrequire the agencies to obtain the consent of the State personnel who \nare involved with the management of our airways and aviation concerns.\n  At this point, we were prepared to offer this amendment to the bill \nthis year to the Interior appropriations bill, which would have, simply \nfor the period of this appropriations bill, required the agencies to \nconsult with the State agency officials involved in aviation management \nin the States, and to assure that the right kind of consultation would \noccur between the various State and Federal officials before closure of \nany of these landing strips in our back-country areas.\n  However, we have been working with the administration to try to \nobviate the need to propose this amendment. I am pleased to say, that I \nam now able\n\n[[Page S7561]]\n\nto report to the people in the country that both the Department of the \nInterior and the Department of Agriculture have agreed--and I will be \nsubmitting letters for the Record in writing to indicate this \nagreement--that they will honor the purposes of this amendment and make \nit the policy of those two agencies to comply with the requirements of \nthis amendment and to continue to work with us on our permanent \nlegislation so we can address this issue on a permanent basis.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if I can interrupt the Senator from Idaho in \nan effort to develop a colloquy with the Senator with regard to \nencouraging various agencies to work with the States on the issue of \nbackcountry airport access.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I will be glad to yield to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is probably not applicable in areas of high \nconcentration of private land, but out West, we have vast areas of \nvirtually nothing. You can only appreciate that if you get in a small \nairplane and fly over the western part of the United States or my State \nof Alaska.\n  I had a group of Senators in a single-engine airplane a few years \nago. We had been in the air 2\\1/2\\ hours cruising along at about 80 \nknots. Finally, one of them said: How much more wilderness do I have to \nsee to, indeed, believe there is a lot of wilderness to be seen and \nbeauty to be seen?\n  Nevertheless, when that engine quits, you have a problem. If you do \nnot have some of these areas available--I know many of our friends from \nthe east coast and populated areas cannot quite appreciate why we need \nthem, but we vitally need them.\n  I join with my colleague in what I understand is a general commitment \nfrom the agencies, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of \nthe Interior, to work with the States to identify what is in the \ninterest of the States from the standpoint of safety access.\n  I commend him in that effort and hope when legislation is necessary \nthat our colleagues will understand we need this in the wide open \nspaces out West. I see my friend from Montana who also agrees with \nthis. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Alaska \nfor his strong support on this issue. He is, as I indicated, a \ncosponsor of the legislation we will be pursuing and was supporting us \nin the effort to put this amendment on this bill again as it was last \nyear.\n  Just so we can understand correctly, I want to read into the Record \nwhat the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture \ncommitted to so we can begin the process, which I think is a very \nimportant first step in moving toward resolution of this issue.\n  The first letter is from Secretary Gale Norton, the Secretary of the \nInterior:\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: The U.S. Department of the Interior is \n     committed to working with you and other Members of Congress \n     to develop a comprehensive process to ensure that state and \n     local governments and citizens have an opportunity to \n     participate in issues relating to backcountry airstrips \n     located on lands managed by the U.S. Department of the \n     Interior.\n       Our Nation's backcountry airstrips are important to many \n     activities that take place on our public lands. Airstrips \n     provide remote access for aerial firefighting efforts, they \n     are an essential safety tool for pilots operating in rural \n     and mountainous areas, and they provide a vital link to the \n     outside world for many rural communities.\n       It is important to ensure that legitimate uses of \n     backcountry airstrips are protected. It is also a priority \n     for this Department that any proposals to alter use of \n     federal lands must go through open and public process that \n     includes close consultation with local communities. I commit \n     to work with you, and other members of the congressional \n     delegation, the State of Idaho, and local communities on any \n     proposals to change the use of backcountry airstrips on lands \n     managed by the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n\n  The second letter is from the Department of Agriculture:\n\n       Dear Senator Crapo: The U.S. Department of Agriculture is \n     committed to working with you and other Members of Congress \n     to develop a comprehensive, long-term approach for managing \n     backcountry airstrips on lands managed by the USDA Forest \n     Service.\n       We agree that it is appropriate to maintain airstrips that \n     provide critical air access to rural, backcountry, or \n     wilderness areas; that contribute to pilot safety; or that \n     support aerial firefighting efforts. The Department also \n     agrees that these airstrips should not be permanently closed \n     without prior consultation with State aviation and other \n     appropriate officials.\n       We appreciate your leadership on this issue and look \n     forward to working with you in the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ann Veneman,\n                                                        Secretary.\n\n  Mr. President, because we have now obtained the commitment of the \nDepartment of Agriculture and the Department of the Interior that they \nwill work with us in a public process and in a consultative process \nwith the State officials involved in managing aviation issues, and \nbecause they have acknowledged the important critical needs of \nmaintaining these backcountry airstrips in good condition, and instead \nof closing them, keeping them open and available for use, we do not \nbelieve it is necessary to pursue this amendment on this legislation.\n  I appreciate the Secretaries of the Interior and Agriculture agreeing \nand working with us to avoid the need for this amendment, and we \nappreciate their commitment to work with us in the future on permanent \nlegislation that will fully resolve this issue statutorily.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 878) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to respond to the Senator from \nArizona who earlier today, in listing programs in this bill he felt \nwere inappropriate--I believe he used the word ``pork'' or some other \nderogatory reference to those programs--cited a $150,000 proposal in \nthis bill to build a barn at the John Hay estate in New Hampshire.\n  I honestly believe the Senator from Arizona has done a disservice to \nthe people of New Hampshire by citing this item as one of the items on \nhis list. It appears to me the research on that list may be rather weak \nif he is putting on the list items such as this. I want to give the \nhistory of this situation.\n  The John Hay estate is owned by the Fish and Wildlife Service. John \nHay was Abraham Lincoln's secretary. He was Theodore Roosevelt's and \nWilliam McKinley's Secretary of State. He served for years as a public \nservant of extraordinary import in our Nation's history in the latter \npart of the 19th century and into the beginning of the 20th century, \nplaying a major role in a number of very significant events, especially \nin the period 1890 to 1905 when he died.\n  As part of his lifestyle, he was a Renaissance man. He had been, as I \nmentioned, secretary to Lincoln and is quite famous for his notes on \nLincoln. In Washington, he started something called the Five of Hearts, \na very famous historical group that met regularly at his home, which is \nnow the Hay-Adams--Hay-Adams was not actually his home. His home was \nwhere the Hay-Adams is. That is the physical location.\n  That group involved five people of incredible intellectual capacity, \nand they became known as the Five of Hearts. He was part of that group \nand his wife was also.\n  As part of his effort and as part of the culture of that time \nactually, he wanted to set up a community which would be a respite from \nthe hectic life of policy and government, and he chose the shores of \nLake Sunapee in New Hampshire to try to do that. He came to New \nHampshire and purchased a significant amount of land at that time--over \na thousand acres--and an old farm and began to try to attract to that \npart of New Hampshire during the summer people who were world leaders \nin order to think and relax in what was really a bucolic atmosphere; it \nstill is. It is a fabulous pastoral setting.\n  It is a lot like what Saint-Gaudens, who was another significant \nperson in that period and tremendous artist in our history, had done in \nanother part of New Hampshire called Cornish.\n  He built a farmhouse; he took the old farmhouse and renovated it. It \nwas situated on 1,000 acres. Of course, with any farmhouse there was a \nbarn, as one might expect in that period. His family has owned that \nproperty for years and years. In the late 1980s, his daughter gave the \nproperty as part of her estate to the U.S. Government because she\n\n[[Page S7562]]\n\nthought it was so important it be preserved as part of history because \nit is a truly unique piece of property.\n  One of the things he did on that property was bring in some \nextraordinary plants. In his travels he collected plants of alpine \nnature and built an alpine yard which is one of the rarest gardens in \nthis country and has been designated so by the national garden groups. \nHe built other gardens around the home. He had Theodore Roosevelt there \nand planted trees. There is a Theodore Roosevelt tree which grows \noutside the house.\n  The house itself was architecturally unique and presents a classic \nexample of a Greek revival farmhouse in the New England tradition which \nexisted in the late 19th century. But most of those homes have been \nlost either through fires or being torn down over the years.\n  The gift of this property to us, the people of America, by his family \nwas an extremely generous act. At that time it was given to us, it \ninvolved only 100 acres but over a mile of frontage on the lake. \nFrontage on the lake is extremely expensive. The house itself was not \nin good repair, and the barn was not, and the gardens were at risk \nbecause the gardener who had been managing them for over 50 years was \ngetting a little old and decided to give it up.\n  So as a result of a community effort with over 600 people involved, \ncalled the Friends of John Hay, we restored this home. There has been a \nfair amount of Federal dollars committed to trying to restore the home \nover the years. Senator Rudman, my predecessor, got the initial funds, \nand I have been successful in obtaining funds to restore the home. Why? \nBecause, of course, it is a Federal property and we have \nresponsibility. It would be as if we owned the home, and we may well \nown the home of Abraham Lincoln of Illinois, for all I know, and are \nrestoring that home. But it is a Federal responsibility for which we \nhave responsibility.\n  More importantly than that, it is a property that had such a magnetic \neffect in the region as a truly unique, historical site architecturally \nand because of the gardens, that the community around the property has \nrisen up with great energy, enthusiasm, and support. There are over 600 \npeople who participate now in maintaining the gardens in what is a \nvoluntarism that is rather significant and instructive and now has the \ngardens back to where they should be, as the home is back to where it \nshould be.\n  As part of this property, as I mentioned, there was a barn. The barn \nwas also an architecturally unique building, with unique windows and \nunique buttresses inside. But more importantly, as part of the \nproperty, being a traditional New England home, it set the nature of \nthe property.\n  This winter, for those who had the good fortune to go to New \nHampshire and ski, we had great snow. We had such great snow, it never \nstopped snowing all winter long. Throughout our State and Vermont and \nMaine--Vermont does not get as great snow as we get, but they still get \nsnow--a lot of homes, buildings, schools, in fact, found their roofs \ncaved in. Regrettably, what happened at the Hay estate was, the barn, \nwhich was a historical barn, had a snow base on it which it could not \nmaintain, even after 100 years--maybe not 100; maybe 85. Regrettably, \nthe barn collapsed under the weight of the snow.\n\n  I guess it is the position of the Senator from Arizona that when a \nbuilding that is on a historical site, which is the responsibility of \nthe Federal Government to maintain, collapses, we should simply leave \nit there: Historical building that collapsed? Just leave it there. I \nguess that is the position of the Senator from Arizona.\n  What these funds were for--$150,000, which is not a great deal of \nmoney when you consider the character and size of the barn--was to \nrestore the barn, put it back together, put it back up, and hopefully \nput in buttresses which will withstand the next major snow, which, of \ncourse, we hope to have again for our skiers.\n  The fact is, for the Senator from Arizona to come down here and \nrepresent it as somehow pork or inappropriate that the Federal \nGovernment has a responsibility to maintain a historical site of such \nsignificance, which had such huge community involvement when there was \na disaster affecting that site which was the result of an act of God--\nby the way, an excessive snow year is pushing the envelope on how you \ndefine what are appropriate expenditures at the Federal level.\n  I cannot think of anything more appropriate than for the Federal \nGovernment to manage the property that has been given to the people of \nthis country in a reasonable way. The reasonable thing to do, of \ncourse, is to rebuild the historical barn so the integrity of the \nproperty is maintained.\n  I believe the Senator from Arizona is misguided on this point. I want \nto put that in the Record. I will be happy to invite the Senator from \nArizona on his next trip to New Hampshire, which appears to be \nreasonably frequent, to stop by at the Hay estate and see the barn, see \nthe estate, see the gardens, maybe meet with the 600 people who work \nthere on a regular basis as volunteers, and ask them whether that barn \nis an important part of that estate and whether the Federal Government \nhas a responsibility to at least rebuild the barn when the people are \nvolunteering literally thousands of hours to maintain the estate for \nfree. I look forward to the Senator stopping by at the John Hay estate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair and wish the Presiding Officer a \ngood afternoon and hopefully a short one.\n  It was my understanding there was a distinct possibility with the \nupcoming expiration of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, which expires \nin August, a renewal of the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act might be \noffered as an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. If that \nhad been the case, I was prepared to offer a second-degree amendment to \nthe ILSA renewal with respect to our energy dependence on Iraq. I have \nan amendment at the desk that would do just that.\n  I will not call up that amendment at this time, but I would like to \nalert my colleagues of the significance of what is going on with regard \nto Iraq. I think the occupant and other Members are aware of the Smith-\nSchumer letter which addresses the ILSA issue by extending for 5 years \nthe moratorium on trade with both Iran and Libya.\n  The important thing to note is the 71 signatures in favor of \nextending that moratorium. As we know, it takes a 50-vote point of \norder to waive rule XVI, which is legislation on appropriations. I am \nnot going to violate that.\n  We have a great inconsistency here. I have been coming to the floor \nfor a long time talking about energy policies. I am referring today, of \ncourse, to our continuing dependence on petroleum from Iraq. We import \nsomewhere between 500,000 and 750,000 barrels of oil from Iraq every \nday. That is about $6 billion worth in the last year.\n  Let me share with the Presiding Officer what the curve is relative to \nthe increase in our oil imports from Iraq to the United States. It \nstarted in 1997 and has had its ups and downs. In 1998 we had a \ntakeoff, and we are currently importing somewhere in the area of \n700,000 barrels a day.\n  We had an interesting occurrence about 6 weeks ago where Iraq was \nunhappy with its treatment by the U.N. and made a decision to reduce \nits production by 2.5 million barrels a day for a month. That took 60 \nmillion barrels a day off the market.\n  Now, there were many in this body who thought OPEC would simply \nincrease their production and offset that. That was not the case. OPEC \nsimply decided to wait 30 days. As a consequence, the 30 days have \npassed, and Saddam Hussein did not get what he wanted from the U.N., \nbut he did turn back his production level.\n  As a consequence, I think it is important to recognize what is \nhappening with regard to Iraq. Many people forget we had a war over \nthere in 1990 and 1991. That war cost us some 148 American lives. We \nhad 400-some wounded. We had several taken prisoner. We were \nsuccessful. The purpose of the war was very simple, it was to keep \nSaddam Hussein from invading Kuwait and going on into Saudi Arabia and \nbasically controlling the world's supply of oil. Make no mistake about \nit, that was a real war.\n  The consequences of that are rather interesting to reflect on now. If \nwe look at the situation with regard to our friend, Saddam Hussein, we \nfind American families are now going to\n\n[[Page S7563]]\n\nSaddam Hussein for energy. Iraq is the fastest growing U.S. source of \noil imports: Again, 750,000 from Iraq; about 2.3 million from the \nPersian Gulf countries; the OPEC countries, about 5 million barrels a \nday.\n  I am not going to stop there because I think that is where the issue \nis kind of left in the minds of many Americans. But let's think about \nrealities. Since the gulf war, we have enforced an aerial blockade. \nPerhaps some of my colleagues could share with me the difference \nbetween an aerial blockade and a surface blockade. A surface blockade \nwith the Navy is generally considered an act of war. We have been \nenforcing this no-fly zone. We call it a no-fly zone, but it is really \nan aerial blockade. We have flown nearly 250,000 individual sorties, \nflights, over Iraq, enforcing this aerial blockade. We have done it to \nprevent Saddam Hussein from threatening our allies in the region.\n  We are spending billions of dollars to keep Saddam Hussein in check. \nWhat are we doing with the oil? We take his oil, we fill up our \nairplanes, and send our pilots to fly over Iraq. They are shot at by \nIraqi artillery. Then they return, fill up on Iraqi oil, and do it \nagain.\n  I find that discomforting, to say the least. I am indignant. It is \nunacceptable. I could use many adjectives. But Saddam Hussein is \nheating our homes in the winter, getting our kids ready for school each \nday, getting our food from the farm to the table, and we pay him pretty \nwell to do that.\n  Let me refer to what is happening as a consequence of this. I will \nget back to this chart a little later. We can view it with some \nreflection because it represents a very significant trend.\n  Let's talk about what Saddam Hussein does with the money we pay him. \nHe pays his Republican Guards to keep him alive; he supports \ninternational terrorist activities--we are aware of that; he funds his \nmilitary campaign against American interests, American service men and \nwomen and our allies; and he is desperately trying to shoot one of our \naircraft down.\n  When that happens, if it happens, God forbid, I don't know what the \nreaction is going to be. But I know what my personal reaction is. This \nrisk has been evident to the American people and the American Congress. \nWe have condoned it. We have not done anything about it. Why not?\n  The inconsistency, of course, is we are proposing to extend our \nsanctions on Iran and Libya for another five years. We have not \nimported a drop of oil from Iran in 20 years. I am not suggesting we \nshould. But we do not even mention Iraq.\n  In addition to paying his Republican Guards, supporting international \nterrorists, he builds an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction with \nbiological capability. Who does he threaten? He threatens our ally, \nIsrael. As a matter of fact, he ends virtually every speech with, \n``Death to Israel.''\n  I don't know how more pointed I could get. Maybe I am missing \nsomething in this. Is this good policy? For a number of years the \nUnited States has worked closely with the United Nations on the Oil For \nFood Program. The program allows Iraq to export petroleum in exchange \nfor funds which can be used for food, medicine, and other humanitarian \nproducts. But despite more than $15 billion available for those \npurposes, Iraq has only spent a fraction of that money for the needs of \nthe Iraqi people. Instead, the Iraqi Government spends it on missile \ncapability, defensive and offensive capability, a highly trained \nmilitary. One has to wonder why, when billions of dollars are available \nto care for the people of Iraq; many of whom are malnourished, many of \nwhom are sick, many of whom have inadequate medical care; why would \nSaddam Hussein withhold the money available and choose, instead, to \nblame the United States for the plight of his people? Why is Iraq \nreducing the amount they spend on nutrition and prenatal care? Why are \nthey reducing that amount when millions of dollars are available? Why \ndoes $200 million of medicine from the U.N. sit undistributed in Iraqi \nwarehouses? Why, given the urgent state of humanitarian conditions in \nIraq, does Saddam Hussein insist that his country's highest priority is \nthe development of sophisticated telecommunications and transportation \ninfrastructure? Why, if there are billions available and his people are \nstarving, is Iraq only buying about $8 million in agricultural products \nfrom the United States?\n  I do not have any quarrel with the Oil For Food Program. It is well \nintentioned. I do have a problem with the means with which Saddam \nHussein has manipulated our growing dependency on Iraqi oil.\n  Three times since the beginning of the Oil For Food Program Saddam \nHussein has threatened, or actually halted, oil production, as I \nindicated, disrupting energy markets, sending world prices \nskyrocketing. Why did he do this? I guess he wants to send a message to \nthe United States. The message might be: I have leverage over you.\n  Every time I look at this chart I look at the increased leverage \nassociated with Saddam Hussein and OPEC and the cartel. We do not have \ncartels in this country. We cannot. We have antitrust laws against it. \nBut we are feeding this cartel with our appetite for crude oil.\n  The harsh reality is, as much as we would like to relieve our \ndependence on oil with alternative energies--we have alternative \nsources of energy. We have coal, we have natural gas, we have hydro, we \nhave nuclear, but you do not move America or the world on that kind of \nenergy. You move America and the world on oil. We do not have a \nsubstitute for that. We do not have anything realistic to replace it.\n  We are going to become more dependent unless we address the \nalternative and that is to reduce our dependence here at home by \nconservation and opening up new sources where we are likely to find a \nsignificant volume of oil.\n  One of the things in my energy bill as a specific goal and target is \nto reduce the dependence on imports of oil to less than 50 percent by \n2010. You can do it in one fell swoop if, indeed, the oil in ANWR is \nwhat it purports to be, somewhere between 5.6 billion and 16 billion \nbarrels a day. The question is, Can you do it safely; and the answer is \nclearly yes.\n  There is one other thing I would like to mention that has not gone \ninto the ANWR argument to any extent. That is the interests of the \nresidents of the area. That particular issue involved 95,000 acres of \nland that are in ANWR, up here at this very top of the world, in this \narea, Kaktovik--these Natives have 95,000 acres of land. I have a chart \nthat shows the Native ownership. But the Native ownership is basically \nsuch that it has no access to the existing pipeline. It has no access \nfrom the standpoint of producing, even for the villagers there, the gas \nthat is in the village site for use by the villagers. They are simply \nprecluded.\n\n  We use the term ``corked'' in Alaska. Corked means that when you are \nout fishing and you have your net the way fish are swimming, somebody \ntakes their net and goes in front of you.\n  That is just what has happened up here with our Native people. The \nNative people have 95,000 acres of private land. They are precluded \nfrom recovering even their own natural gas for development and usage. \nThat is wrong.\n  As we look at reality, and as we look at our increased dependence on \nimports, by the votes we have seen here, whether it is on lease sale \n181 or some of the issues relative to our national monuments, we had \nbetter come to grips with reality. Where are these deposits going to \ncome from if they do not come from areas that are still open?\n  This is a chart that shows the areas that are closed. The west coast \nand the east coast are off limits. Take lease sale 181. Three-quarters \nof that is off limits. The entire overthrust belt is off limits as a \nconsequence of actions by the last administration.\n  I make this point simply to highlight the reality. Here we are \ntalking about extending moratoriums against Iran and against Libya with \nno mention of Iraq. We have placed our energy security in the hands of \na madman, Saddam Hussein.\n  The administration has attempted valiantly to reconstruct a sensible \nmultilateral policy towards Iraq. Those attempts, unfortunately, have \nnot been successful. We are still dependent on foreign imports, and a \nsignificant portion is coming from Iraq.\n  I think before we can construct a sensible United States policy \ntowards Iraq, we need to end the blatant inconsistency between our \nenergy policy and\n\n[[Page S7564]]\n\nour foreign policy. We need to end our addiction to Iraqi oil. We need \nto basically go cold turkey. To that end, in a moment I will introduce \nlegislation which would prohibit oil imports from Iraq, whether or not \nunder the Oil for Food Program, until it is no longer inconsistent with \nour national security to resume these imports. I hope that this will be \nan initial step toward a more rational and coherent policy towards \nIraq.\n  As a consequence, I am withdrawing my amendment at the desk. I trust \nmy colleagues have picked up to some extent the points I have brought \nout.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute as if in morning \nbusiness to introduce my bill. Then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1170 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I think we are at a stage in the debate \non the bill that I can now say we have completed all of our work.\n  I compliment the chairman and the ranking member for their \nextraordinary work in the last couple of days in getting us to this \npoint. Let me also thank Senator Gramm of Texas for his work in the \nlast couple of hours in working with Senator Byrd on a concern of great \nimport to Senator Byrd.\n  There has been no request for a rollcall vote on final passage. I am \nnow in a position to announce that there will be no more rollcall votes \ntonight.\n  There are no rollcall votes scheduled for tomorrow, nor will there be \nvotes on Monday.\n  My hope is that we will be able to move to the energy and water \nappropriations bill on Monday for debate only, and then we will move \ninto debate on amendments beginning as early as Tuesday. I hope \nSenators will file their amendments and will be prepared to offer them \neven though we will not have votes on Monday. I encourage them to do \nthat.\n  I am hopeful we can get at least two appropriations bills done, if \nnot more, next week.\n  We have a lot of work to do. But there are no more votes tonight. As \npromised, I have also made a commitment that a number of nominations--\nif I recall, something on the order of 20 nominations--will be offered \nshortly. We are about ready to do that. There is at least one that will \nbe the subject of some discussion. But I know of no requests for \nrollcalls on those nominations. No more rollcall votes tonight.\n  We will begin work on Monday, hopefully, on energy and water.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I wish to take this opportunity to offer \na few observations as we are closing up this Interior appropriations \nbill. I must thank the senior Senator from West Virginia for his work \nas chairman of this committee. His staff has been remarkable. They are \neasy to work with, and they have accommodated, I think, as many people \nin this body as they possibly could.\n  Peter Kiefhaber has done a commendable job in his first year as the \nclerk for the majority. His willingness to work with my staff has \nensured that this bill has reached its bipartisan form. He has been \nassisted by a number of very capable staff members, including Ginny \nJames, Leif Fonnesbeck, Brooke Livingston, and a detailee from the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service, Scott Dalzell.\n  On my side of the ring, I thank my staff members who work with me on \nthe minority side.\n  Bruce Evans lent his expertise after spending numerous years as the \nmajority clerk under the very able chairmanship of Senator Slade Gorton \nof Washington. I have a lot more respect for the former Senator from \nWashington and the work he did because this is my first year on \nInterior appropriations. I personally thank Bruce for continuing his \nservice in the Senate and helping me through my first year as chairman \nand then ranking member on this bill.\n  I also thank Christine Drager for her assistance on a number of \nextremely difficult accounts, as well as Ryan Thomas, who moved from my \npersonal office to the Appropriations Committee to lend a helping hand \nin crafting this legislation.\n  While I am thanking those who have helped in the formation of this \nlegislation, I want to single out Mark Davis. Mark has joined my office \nas a congressional fellow from the U.S. Forest Service. I want my \ncolleagues to know that it was Mark's efforts that ensured we received \nall of your requests, and all the requests were considered. He sifted \nthrough the request letters, organized your request lists, and tracked \nyour staff down to make sure we had the information necessary to help \nus meet the desires of each Member and make some very tough decisions. \nI thank him for his service.\n\n  Madam President, this has been somewhat of a difficult process. We \nwere not able to fully meet the desires of every Member who offered an \namendment to this bill. However, the chairman and I have attempted to \nremain fair while avoiding adding legislative riders that would slow \nthe progress of this bill.\n  It is imperative that this bill be moved through Congress and be sent \nto the President as soon as possible. It is now mid-July and we have a \nlot of work ahead of us.\n  Again, I thank my chairman, Senator Byrd of West Virginia. I could \nnot have asked for a better chairman as I enter the first year working \non Interior appropriations. I thank him very much for his patience \nbecause he helped me through some of the rough spots. I thank him for \nthat.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I express my heartfelt gratitude to my \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Montana, who is the ranking \nmember on the subcommittee of the Department of the Interior.\n  I thank him for his very able representation of his people. I thank \nhim for the consideration he has accorded to all other Senators as we \nhave developed this bill, brought it to the floor and managed it \ntogether. I thank him for his equanimity, his very friendly and \naccommodating spirit. I thank him for being Conrad Burns. I thank him \nfor the contribution he has made in the development of this bill in \nworking with me as we have attempted to manage the bill and bring it to \na conclusion.\n  I thank our respective staffs on both sides of the aisle for their \ncourtesies to us and to our colleagues. I thank our colleagues for \ntheir cooperation and understanding. I thank the leaders on both sides \nfor the assistance they have given to us. I particularly thank our \nDemocratic whip.\n  I believe that Members will remember my taking the floor on many \noccasions to speak on the theme that the dog is man's best friend. \nHarry Truman said, ``If you want a friend in Washington, you better go \nbuy a dog.'' Well, I believe that. Members often hear me extol the \nvirtues of the dog. Not only can we say that a dog is man's great \nfriend, but for those of us who have to manage bills on the floor, it \nhas been my experience that the majority whip is the best friend that a \nmanager of a bill can have.\n  I have seen a goodly number of whips in my time on the Senate floor. \nThe Office of Whip goes back a long way, into\n\n[[Page S7565]]\n\nthe 1600s, as a matter of fact, when it was said in the British \nParliament that the whipper-in--the individual who kept the hounds from \nstraying from the field during the fox chase. In those days, whips were \nsent in the form of circular letters to members of the opposition, \nmembers of the King's party to northern England, and sent as far away \nas Paris, France, to tell members to come in on a certain day and be \nprepared to vote on a certain matter. That was the whip's job.\n  The whip's position here has grown into an institution. During the \nearly 1900s, during the first quarter of the 20th century, the offices \nknown as majority whip, majority leader, minority leader, minority whip \ncame into being. They are not constitutional offices, but these are \noffices that have been developed over the years.\n  The whip system in the House is much more refined and more highly \ndeveloped than it is in the Senate, not quite so highly developed as it \nis in the British Parliament. In our body, we do not have the whip \nsystem they have in the House, but we have an extraordinarily good whip \nin Harry Reid from Nevada.\n  I was what I consider a good whip here for a good many years. I \nserved with Mike Mansfield when he was majority leader. I was the \nmajority whip, and I sat on the floor all the time. I never left the \nfloor but a few minutes at a time. This whip, Harry Reid, performs that \nsame function. He is on the floor. He is helping Senators with their \nneeds. He is helping the managers of the bills to arrive at agreements. \nHe is helping the managers of the bills to reach time agreements on \namendments once they have been offered. He does an extraordinarily good \njob.\n  I express those compliments concerning Harry Reid. I think he is a \nbetter whip than Robert Byrd was. He has more patience than Robert Byrd \nhad. I would say he has more political gumption than Robert Byrd \nprobably had. He is a great whip. I salute him.\n  I have no hesitancy at all in saying if somebody does a better job \nthan I can do, I salute them for it. He does an excellent job. I thank \nhim.\n  He helped me and Senator Stevens on the supplemental bill. He has \nhelped Senator Burns and myself on this bill. I thank him again.\n  Madam President, we will be going to conference next week on this \nbill, and Senator Conrad Burns and I will, again, stand shoulder to \nshoulder with the other members of our team on both sides of the aisle, \nand we will be working with the House Members in an effort to bring \nfrom the conference a bill the President will sign into law.\n  I merely wanted to express those few compliments, those few \nexpressions of gratitude, and to say I am very glad that the Senate has \nreached the point now of finalizing the action on this bill prior to it \nbeing sent to conference.\n  The Senate has now approved the fiscal year 2001 Supplemental \nappropriations bill and the first fiscal year 2002 appropriations bill, \nthe fiscal year 2002 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill. \nWe have scheduled nine bills for action in the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee during July and we hope to have Senate action on those bills \nbefore the August recess.\n  We have a long tradition on the Senate Appropriations Committee of \nworking together on a bipartisan basis to produce fiscally responsible \nand balanced appropriations bills. Working together with my \ndistinguished colleague and good friend Ted Stevens, we have gotten off \nto a good start this year.\n  The fiscal year 2001 supplemental appropriations bill passed the \nSenate on Tuesday by a vote of 98-1. It totaled $6.5 billion, not one \nthin dime over the President's request. It is a balanced bill that \napproved most of the President's request for defense and included a \nnumber of other priority programs such as funding for Education for the \nDisadvantaged, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, and the \nGlobal AIDS program. It included no emergency funding. All unrequested \nitems were fully offset so that we remain under the statutory cap on \nspending for fiscal year 2001.\n  Today, we have approved the fiscal year 2002 Interior appropriations \nbill by a voice vote. We have exercised discipline. The budget \nresolution sets very tight limits on overall discretionary spending. \nAnd this bill stays within the 302(b) allocation that the \nAppropriations Committee approved pursuant to the budget resolution.\n  In both bills we held the line. We stayed within our budgetary \nboundaries. We took a deep breath and were able to squeeze in between \nthose narrow walls. But the walls are getting tighter. We have been \ngiven a difficult task. Much has been asked of us; a tremendous amount \nis expected when it comes to providing for the national need.\n  We are attempting to conduct the people's business--to pass the \nthirteen bills that fund government in a timely fashion. The clock is \nticking. We hope to go to conference soon so that this bill can be sent \nto the President before the August recess.\n  The House and Senate Budget Committee are now projecting that we will \nbe dipping into the Medicare surplus in fiscal year 2001 and fiscal \nyear 2002 and that this trend is likely to continue for several years. \nThis is taking place before a single appropriations bill has been sent \nto the President.\n  I believe that this change in our budget outlook will result in very \ntight limits on discretionary spending over the next few years. I don't \nlike it, it won't be good for America, but it is a reality. As we \nconsider the fiscal year 2002 bills, it will be very important that we \nunderstand the long term consequences of our actions. We should not be \ntaking actions this year that will lock us into long term costs. We \nhave a long tradition on this committee for working together on a \nbipartisan basis to produce responsible bills, one year at a time.\n  There will be a strong temptation to approve provisions this year \nthat will mandate costs for specific programs in future years. We \nsimply can not go down that road when we know that we are facing tight \nspending limits over the next few years.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that during the pendency of \nH.R. 2217, the managers be permitted to offer a managers' amendment; \nthat once the amendment is reported, it be considered agreed to and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any amendments laid \naside be modified and agreed to, as modified; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that no further amendments be in \norder; that the bill be advanced to third reading; that the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill with no intervening action; that \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \nof Representatives, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I again thank Senator Byrd for his \nleadership on this legislation. We set a record for an Interior \nappropriations bill due to the chairman's leadership. Two days is about \nas fast as we have done an Interior appropriations bill. That is a \ngreat credit to his leadership. I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that any \nstatements by Senators in connection with the bill be printed in the \nRecord as though spoken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF J. STEVEN GRILES\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the vote on final passage of H.R. 2217, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the nomination of J. Steven Griles to be \nDeputy Secretary of the Interior; that the Senate immediately vote on \nthe confirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action; that \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action; that there then be a \nperiod for debate regarding the nomination; and that following that \ndebate, the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I ask \nunanimous consent that the agreement be\n\n[[Page S7566]]\n\nmodified to reflect that the vote occur on the nominee following my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I ask for no more than 2 minutes \nfollowing the comments of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. REID. I say under my own consent request, it is likely that the \njunior Senator from Florida will also want to speak. He has indicated \nthat when we take our voice vote, he wants to be one of those known as \nhaving voted no. So I reserve some time for him, too, if he desires to \ncome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 976\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the managers' amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd], for himself and \n     Mr. Burns, proposes an amendment numbered 976.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 976) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all the pending \namendments are agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 880) was agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 975), as modified, as agreed to, as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. MODIFICATION TO STEEL LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 101 of the Emergency Steel Loan \n     Guarantee Act of 1999 (Public Law 106-51; 15 U.S.C. 1841 \n     note) is amended as follows:\n       (1) Terms and conditions.--Subsection (h) is amended--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``2005'' and inserting \n     ``2015''; and\n       (B) by amending paragraph (4) to read as follows:\n       ``(4) Guarantee level.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) \n     and (C), any loan guarantee provided under this section shall \n     not exceed 85 percent of the amount of principal of the loan.\n       ``(B) Increased level one.--A loan guarantee may be \n     provided under this section in excess of 85 percent, but not \n     more than 90 percent, of the amount of principal of the loan, \n     if--\n       ``(i) the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed at such \n     percentage and outstanding under this section at any one time \n     does not exceed $100,000,000; and\n       ``(ii) the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed at such \n     percentage under this section with respect to a single \n     qualified steel company does not exceed $50,000,000.\n       ``(C) Increased level two.--A loan guarantee may be \n     provided under this section in excess of 85 percent, but not \n     more than 95 percent, of the amount of principal of the loan, \n     if--\n       ``(i) the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed at such \n     percentage and outstanding under this section at any one time \n     does not exceed $100,000,000; and\n       ``(ii) the aggregate amount of loans guaranteed at such \n     percentage under this section with respect to a single \n     qualified steel company does not exceed $50,000,000.''.\n       (2) Termination of guarantee authority.--Subsection (k) is \n     amended by striking ``2001'' and inserting ``2003''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply only with respect to any guarantee issued on or \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and the third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n\n\n                         indian health services\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I would like to bring to the attention \nof the Senate the critical shortfall in Indian Health Service funding. \nThe Indian Health Service is unable to provide basic health services to \nAmerican Indians and Alaska Natives. We are failing to uphold a promise \nwe made many years ago in federal-tribal treaties as well as federal \nstatute.\n  The Indian Health Service is tasked with providing full health \ninsurance for American Indians and Alaska Natives, but is so \nunderfunded that patients are routinely denied care that most of us \ntake for granted and, in many cases, call essential. The budget for \nclinical services is so inadequate that Indian patients are subjected \nto a ``life or limb'' test. Unless their condition is life-threatening \nor they risk losing a limb, their treatment is deferred for higher \npriority cases; by the time they become a priority, there are often no \nfunds left to pay for the treatment.\n  I attempted to address this crisis by offering an amendment to the \nfiscal year 2002 budget resolution. The amendment called for a $4.2 \nbillion increase for the clinical services budget of the Indian Health \nService. Seven of my colleagues cosponsored this amendment, which \npassed the Senate, but was not included in the bill that returned from \nconference.\n  I again attempted to address this situation in the Interior \nAppropriations bill, but it appears that we will be unable to do that \nat this time due to the inadequate budget allocation facing the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee. I would like to engage in a \ncolloquy with the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee on how we might address this situation in conference and \nadvance the goal of living up to our commitment to provide essential \nhealth services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I am happy to address that issue with the \nmajority leader. Can the leader tell me what would be required to offer \nthe basic health services we promised to American Indians and Alaska \nNatives?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we have estimates of the funding that \nwould be required to provide basic clinical services to American \nIndians and Alaska Natives. The President's fiscal year 2002 budget \nrequests $1.8 billion for Indian Health Service clinical services. \nWhile this is an increase over the fiscal year 2001 appropriation, it \nwill not allow the Indian Health Service to meet the basic level of \nhealth needs for American Indians and Alaskan Natives. For many years \nnow, appropriations for the Indian Health Service have not even kept \npace with medical inflation or population growth. The per capita \nspending on health care for each Indian Health Service beneficiary is \nonly one-third of what is spent per capita for the general U.S. \npopulation. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Indian \nHealth Service produce a tribal needs-based budget that calculates the \ntrue cost of meeting the health needs of Native Americans. According to \nthese estimates, a $4.2 billion increase in the 2002 budget is required \nto meet the most basic health care needs.\n  The impact of serious, chronic under-funding of the Indian Health \nService is immense. The disparities in health outcomes between American \nIndians and Alaska Natives as compared to other Americans is appalling. \nInfant mortality is just one example. An American Indian baby is 50 \npercent more likely to die before the age of one than a Caucasian baby. \nIn some counties of my state, the infant mortality rate is 33.6 per \n1,000, more than 5 times the Caucasian rate. The same disparities exist \nfor diabetes, tuberculosis, alcoholism, liver disease, and fetal \nalcohol syndrome, all of which plague America's native communities at \nrates far above the incidence for other Americans. Sadly, the mortality \nrate for American Indians and Alaska Natives is higher than for all \nraces in the United States; life expectancy is the lowest.\n  I know the distinguished chairman is concerned about these \nconditions, and I know that his efforts to increase Indian Health \nService funding have been undermined by an inadequate budget allocation \nfor this subcommittee. I certainly appreciate the severe constraints on \nthe Appropriations Committee, particularly in light of the tax cut \nlegislation recently enacted and the budget reestimates that indicate \nthe projected budget surpluses are\n\n[[Page S7567]]\n\ndwindling. Still, I hold out hope that, as he and the other conferees \nnegotiate with our colleagues in the House, they can find some way to \nprovide additional funding for the clinical services budget of the \nIndian Health Service. I would not make this request unless I were \ntruly convinced that we have fallen far short on our commitment to \nprovide health care services to American Indians and Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I assure the majority leader of my \ncommitment to that effort. While we certainly will not be able to \naddress all of the funding shortfall this year, I, too, am hopeful that \nwe can find additional funds in conference to begin to address that \nshortfall.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I am concerned that there are members \nof the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians who are currently not \nallowed to be provided with health care services under the Indian \nHealth Services Contract Health Services program. It is my \nunderstanding that there is a procedure which would allow the \nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to include the approximately 300 \ntribal members who reside in Ripley, TN, within their authorized \nservice area.\n  The Ripley community lacks the most basic health services. There are \nno resources for preventive health education and no access to either \nIndian Health Services or tribally operated facilities.\n  The Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians has demonstrated a commitment \nto these tribal members by providing updated housing and other \ninfrastructure and services. The tribe is currently constructing an \nappropriate health care facility at the Ripley Community. However, it \nis concerned that it does not yet have the authorization from Indian \nHealth Services to provide those services.\n  I am sensitive to the constraints in the Interior Appropriations \nbill, which did not allow an increase in the Contract Services Program. \nI am hopeful that we can work with our colleagues from the House of \nRepresentatives in the conference for this bill to find additional \nfunds for this program, to increase the likelihood that tribal members, \nno matter where they live, will be able to have access to the health \nservices their tribe can offer.\n  Regardless of the funding situation, I hope that the Indian Health \nServices officials here in Washington, D.C., will review this situation \nand work closely with Chief Phillip Martin, the tribal council, and \nother officials of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians, to expand \nits Contract Health Services area.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Mississippi has my assurance that I will \nsupport his effort to assist the tribe in his State. I encourage the \nDirector of Indian Health Services to pay particular attention to the \nrequest of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians to serve its tribal \nmembers in Ripley, TN.\n\n\n                      Atlantic Salmon Conservation\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, my colleague from Maine and I would like \nto engage the subcommittee chairman and ranking member if we may.\n  Mr. BYRD. Please proceed.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank my colleagues from West Virginia and \nMontana for the support they have provided in their bill for Atlantic \nsalmon conservation and restoration efforts in our State. I appreciate \ntheir fully funding the administration's request for $597,000 in the \nFish and Wildlife Management Account as well as their willingness to \nmake $1.1 million available to the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation to carry out a competitively awarded grant program to fund \non-the-ground recovery efforts for Maine's Atlantic salmon.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I also want to thank my colleagues for their support for \nAtlantic salmon recovery. As the Senators know, the fiscal year 2001 \nInterior appropriations bill provided the funding to establish the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Atlantic salmon grant program. \nThe program, which has leveraged an even greater amount of non-federal \nmoney, has been extremely successful at identifying and supporting \ninnovative projects that will help with the recovery effort.\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate the comments of my colleagues from Maine and \ncommend them for the hard work they have done to secure resources to \nhelp with the Atlantic salmon recovery efforts in their State.\n  Ms. COLLINS. In reporting its bill, the subcommittee originally \nprovided $500,000 for the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation's \nAtlantic salmon grant program. It is my understanding that, in \nincreasing funding for the program to $1.1 million, the subcommittee \ncontinues to meet the administration's request for $597,000 in funding \nfor Atlantic salmon recovery efforts through the Fish and Wildlife \nManagement Account.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator from Maine is correct. The subcommittee \nrecommended an increase of $7,380,000 for Fish and Wildlife Management \nabove the administration's request for this account. Of the $7,380,000, \n$600,000 has been reallocated as part of the manager's amendment to the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's General Administration Account for the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation's Atlantic salmon grant program, \nbringing the total provided by the bill for this program to $1.1 \nmillion.\n  Ms. SNOWE. The money that was provided last year has been utilized to \nengage a wide range of stakeholders, including local community groups \nas well as aquaculture, agriculture, and forestry companies in \ncooperative restoration efforts. They have worked hard to aid the \nrebuilding process. It is a reflection of the strong commitment of \neveryone in Maine that we have far more projects being proposed than \nfunding to accommodate them all. I can assure you that the money you \nare providing today will make a significant impact. I thank the \nsubcommittee chairman and the ranking member for their courtesy and \ncontinued support.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I also thank the Senators from West Virginia and \nMontana, and I look forward to continuing to work with them and the \nsenior Senator from Maine to ensure that resources are available to \nassist in Atlantic salmon recovery efforts.\n\n\n        funding for the urban parks and recreation recovery fund\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nclarify that it is the intent to seek additional funding for the Urban \nPark and Recreation Recovery Fund, UPARR, when the Senate Interior \nappropriations bill goes to conference.\n  UPARR plays a vital role in supporting the last remaining green \nspaces in some of our most congested urban areas. This program takes a \nrelatively small amount of federal funds and leverages them to make a \nsubstantial contribution to the development and improvement of our \nnation's urban parks, playgrounds, and recreational areas. For many of \nmy constituents, these small pockets of open space are a vital part of \ntheir community. They serve as playgrounds for children, meeting places \nfor adults, and areas for fun, recreation, and respite from the daily \nhustle and bustle of our Nation's most economically and socially \nstressed neighborhoods.\n  I was pleased to see that the House included $30 million for this \nimportant program in its fiscal year 2002 Interior appropriations bill. \nThis amount includes a slight increase over last year's funding levels \nand is consistent with the commitment made to this program last year in \ntitle VIII of the Interior appropriations bill.\n  I was disappointed, however, that the Senate bill did not match this \nfunding level. I realize that this lower level of funding for UPARR is \nrelated to the lower overall level of funding in the Senate bill. When \nthe bill gets to conference with the House, I hope we can accept the \nHouse level. Is that the chairman's intent?\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with my distinguished colleague from California \nthat UPARR is a worthy program. If additional funds become available in \nconference, I shall be glad to consider a higher level of funding for \nUPARR.\n\n\n                          sewall-belmont house\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to ask my colleagues \nSenator Byrd and Senator Burns to work with me in conference on the \nInterior appropriations bill to ensure that the Interior Department \nprovides funding for an important Capitol Hill landmark, the Sewall-\nBelmont House.\n  The Sewall-Belmont House has been a center of political life in \nWashington for more than 200 years. It was the home of Treasury \nSecretary Albert Gallatin from 1801 to 1813 and the only site in \nWashington to offer armed resistance when British troops invaded\n\n[[Page S7568]]\n\nthe city in August 1814. The building later became a beacon of liberty \nfor American women in the 20th century as the headquarters of the \nhistoric National Woman's Party and home of the suffragist leader, \nAlice Paul.\n  Congress provided $500,000 last year to begin much needed site \npreservation work at the Sewall-Belmont House. Funds will be needed \nthis year to continue construction and ensure that this home remains a \nnational treasure.\n  Recognition of the Sewall-Belmont House as a nationally significant \nheritage site has dramatically increased as a result of this \npreservation effort. Visitorship is steadily increasing, and the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation recently called the Sewall-\nBelmont House ``the most significant unrestored women's history site in \nthe country.'' Again, I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nensure funding for the continued preservation of Sewall-Belmont House.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank my colleague and share her \ncommitment to preserving Sewall-Belmont House. As my distinguished \ncolleague from Texas is undoubtedly aware, it will be difficult to \naddress the funding needs of all the worthy requests before us. \nNevertheless, I look forward to working with her in conference to \naddress the funding needs of this unique historic site.\n\n\nauxiliary power units and portable power in the DOE transportation fuel \n                              cell program\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, fuel cells, a family of technologies \nthat produce energy electochemically, without combustion, are being \ndeveloped for a exciting variety of applications. Some of these \napplications were not contemplated in 1992 when Congress authorized the \nOffice of Transportation Technologies to support development in a \nvariety of product areas. To its credit, the department has attempted \nto keep pace and to provide the most meaningful support possible to the \nresearch, development and demonstration of fuel cells.\n  My purpose today is to clarify the Senate's interest in two \napplications, auxiliary power units for motor vehicles and portable \npower. Auxiliary power units promise a substantial improvement in \nenergy efficiency of vehicles of all types and may reach commercial \nreadiness before complete fuel cell engine systems for vehicles. APU's \nmight also encourage the development of fuel infrastructure and \nencourage consumer acceptance, readying the marketplace for fuel cell \nvehicles.\n  Successful development of fuel cell portable power units will also \naccelerate consumer understanding and market acceptance. The \nmanufacture of portable power units would yield important experience in \nmanufacturing technology and the increased production volumes would \nhave a direct benefit in reducing the cost of fuel cell engines and \nsystems for vehicles.\n  Is it the understanding of the distinguished chairman that these \napplications fall within the jurisdiction of the Office of \nTransportation Technology?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. The committee recognizes that vehicle auxiliary power \nunits and portable power systems may be early commercial uses of fuel \ncells that would also develop infrastructure and experience needed for \nfuel cell vehicles, and considers these applications to be within the \nscope of the Office of Transportation Technologies fuel cell program.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                          Ohio Water Projects\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with \nAppropriations Chairman Byrd and the ranking member of Interior \nAppropriations, Senator Burns. I want to briefly discuss with my \nhonorable colleagues an important conservation and recreation project \nthat is of great interest to me and request their favorable \nconsideration of $5 million for this project in the fiscal year 2002 \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  Madam President, a few miles west of Ohio's State capital of Columbus \nflow two outstanding waterways: the Big and Little Darby Creeks. These \ntwo creeks are recognized as State and National Scenic Rivers for their \ncrystal clear water, their abundance of wildlife, and their importance \nto many Ohioans as a source of high quality outdoor recreation. The \nNature Conservancy has even listed these watersheds as one of the \n``Last Great Places'' in the Western Hemisphere. On more than one \noccasion, I have had the pleasure of visiting these two creeks. As a \nmatter of fact, Mr. President, I spent a wonderful day canoeing on the \nBig Darby Creek earlier this week with two of my children.\n  Since 1959, the Franklin County Metro Parks have been purchasing land \nfrom willing sellers along these two creeks as part of their Battelle-\nDarby Creek Metro Park. The Park currently offers several recreational \nopportunities including a Streamside Classroom Education Program, a 1.6 \nmile walking trail, and several canoe access sites. In addition to \nwelcoming the thousands of visitors the park receives each year, the \npark's dedicated and highly trained staff are conducting important \nwetland and prairie restoration programs in the area. At this time, \nthere are several potential purchases that could substantially expand \nthe park and ensure the protection of the creek and increase public \naccess opportunities. I have urged my colleagues on the Interior \nAppropriations Committee to provide funding for these purchases.\n  I have discussed my interest in providing financial support for \nfurther expansion of the park with Senators Byrd and Burns and I \nappreciate their willingness to enter into this colloquy. I also \nappreciate their interest in exploring funding opportunities for this \nproject through the fiscal year 2002 Interior appopriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I have had the opportunity to discuss this \nproject with Senator DeWine, and I rise today to assure him that I \nappreciate and understand his interest in this important project and \nwill give it serious consideration during further consideration of the \nfiscal year 1902 Interior appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I too have had the opportunity to discuss \nthis project with my friend from Ohio. I share Senator Byrd's interest \nin examining potential funding opportunities to support this project.\n\n\n                         Wolf Recovery Program\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I rise to commend Mr. Byrd and Mr. Burns \non their leadership and hard work on this bill. The subcommittee has \nhad to make hard decisions about scarce resources and has labored to do \nso fairly. They have made real efforts to make sure the taxpayer's \ndollar is spent effectively and efficiently. I have seen first-hand, \nand appreciate, their dedication to the integrity of this process.\n  Would the distinguished gentlemen form West Virginia and Montana \nengage in a colloquy with me concerning the Central Idaho Wolf Recovery \nProgram for the nonexperimental population of gray wolves?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be pleased to engage in such a colloquy.\n  Mr. BURNS. As this program also affects my State, I too would be \npleased to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. CRAIG. While I wish gray wolves did not reside in my State, they \ndo, and they are not going away. Thus, I believe the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service must be pro-active and aggressive in addressing issues \nrelated to the monitoring of the wolf population and working with the \naffected States of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming to delist the \npopulation. The wolf population in Central Idaho is growing by leaps \nand bounds. As a result, permittees are faced with growing livestock-\nwolf conflicts. In addition, private property rights are infringed as \nthese conflicts occur on private property. Yet the permittee must have \na Federal permit to address conflict issues on their own land. Last, as \nthe population grows, management efforts have not increased at the same \nrate. I feel that these individuals should not be punished because the \nwolves were re-introduced into central Idaho.\n  The subcommittee has worked to secure an additional $200,000 for the \nCentral Idaho Wolf Recovery Program. I fee this additional money should \nbe used to increase monitoring efforts and increase communication with \npotentially affected permittees, as well as, to focus efforts on \ndefining and meeting criteria for delisting the wolves in central \nIdaho. I believe these funds should work to provide Idaho with \nflexibility in managing the wolf population to meet the needs of those \nmost affected by the wolves.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will work with Mr. Craig to see that these funds are used \nfor monitoring of the central Idaho wolf population.\n\n[[Page S7569]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree with the gentleman from Idaho, these funds should \nbe used to provide flexibility in managing the wolf population of \ncentral Idaho.\n\n\n                Judicial Training in the Pacific Islands\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I would like to discuss with my \ndistinguished colleagues, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nand the ranking member on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, the \nneed for judicial training in the Pacific Islands.\n  I have been working over the past year with the judges of the ninth \ncircuit, the circuit charged with overseeing the judiciary in the \nPacific Islands, to help them secure the funds to conduct a needs \nassessment for the training of judges in the United States territories \nand Freely Associated States in the Pacific. That assessment has been \ncompleted, and has identified the need for more training programs for \nnonlawyer and legally trained judges.\n  The judges of the ninth circuit have worked with the National \nJudicial College to design two separate one-year training programs for \njudges in the Pacific Islands. One is aimed at nonlawyer judges, and \nwould be conducted in Pohnpei, the capital of the Federated States of \nMicronesia, in order to be the most cost effective. The second program \nwould be conducted in the United States, and would be geared toward \nchief justices or presiding judges.\n  These training programs are necessary to help Pacific Islands facing \nburgeoning populations and judicial systems that are not fully \ndeveloped. The need for further training of these judges has long been \nrecognized by the ninth circuit. This program has the full support of \nthe judiciaries in American Samoa, Guam, the Commonwealth of the \nNorthern Marianas, the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall \nIslands, and the Federated States of Micronesia.\n  If we are to expect these areas to be able fully and effectively \nenforce applicable laws, including traditional laws, then we must \nensure that the persons who serve in the local judiciaries are fully \ntrained. Of all the technical assistance programs that we provide to \nimprove the operations of government, this particular program has the \ngreatest potential for improving society and the quality of life in \nthese islands.\n  The cost of this 1-year program would only be approximately $100,000. \nI ask my colleagues' support in encouraging the Secretary of the \nInterior to support this effort.\n  Mr. BYRD. I support the training of these judges and would be pleased \nto encourage the Secretary to support this effort as well.\n  Mr. BURNS. I, too, support such an allocation by the Secretary.\n\n\n                  don edwards national wildlife refuge\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to join the chairman and \nranking member of the Interior Subcommittee to discuss an issue \nimportant to the State of California. That is the continuing funding \nfor the acquisition of San Francisco baylands adjacent to the Don \nEdwards National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Since the early 1900s, more than 90 percent of California's interior \nwetlands have been lost to development and other land use changes. The \nproperty for purchase constitutes more than 13,000 acres of salt ponds \nat the edge of San Francisco Bay, which itself provides important \nhabitat for more than 1 million birds per year. This purchase will \nincrease the bay's wetland area by 50 percent.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am familiar with this project. As I understand it, the \nowner of the land is asking for $300 million in Federal and State funds \nfor the 13,000 acres. While, this may be a worthwhile endeavor, I \nquestion whether it will be possible to allocate such a large sum.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I understand the chairman's concern about the level \nof funding required to complete this purchase. I share his concern. I \nam personally working with all parties involved in the agreement in an \neffort to substantially reduce the federal share of the purchase price.\n  I am concerned, however, that by providing no funding in the fiscal \nyear 2002 Interior appropriations bill, the seller will be forced to \nseek other buyers. This would be a lost opportunity of historic \nproportions. It would be my intention to secure a small amount of \nfunding in the Senate bill to keep the project alive as we move forward \nin appropriations process with the goal of increasing the project's \nappropriation should a more realistic price be negotiated.\n  Mr. BURNS. As the Senator from California knows, funding for the Fish \nand Wildlife Land acquisition account has already reached its cap and \nany new funding would have to be offset from within the account.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I am aware of the problem raised by the ranking \nmember. To this end, I am willing to reduce funding for two California \nland acquisition projects--the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge and \nthe San Joaquin National Wildlife Refuge--by $250,000 each. I want to \nbe very clear--I fully support these projects. In fact, they were \nincluded in the bill at my request. I intend to see that they are fully \nfunded by the end of this process. However, due to the procedural \nnecessity of providing an offset, the only way to ensure that all three \nequally important projects go forward is to make this reduction. Should \nthe interested parties fail to come to an acceptable agreement over the \nSan Francisco baylands, the funding could return to the San Diego and \nSan Joaquin projects.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from California for this statement. \nWith these assurances, I will support the reduction of funds at the San \nDiego National Wildlife Refuge and the San Joaquin National Wildlife \nRefuge, and the increase of funds at the Don Edwards National Wildlife \nRefuge.\n\n\n                            jacob riis park\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to take a moment to thank \nSenators Byrd and Burns for their stewardship of the Interior \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002. Their work on this bill will \nsecure millions of dollars in funding to help preserve our Nation's \nprecious natural resources, and I support their efforts wholeheartedly.\n  My colleague from New York, Senator Clinton, and I would like to take \na moment to engage our colleague in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my colleague for his kind words and will be happy \nto engage in a colloquy with the Senators from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. In 1905, New York City's officials entered into an \ninformal agreement with the New York Association for Improving the \nCondition of the Poor, an organization co-founded by journalist Jacob \nRiis, to build a recreational facility for the relief of New York \ntenement dwellers. The resulting Riis Park, opened to the public in \n1936, provided opportunities for diversion to millions of city \nresidents. The facility became part of the National Park Service's \nGateway National Recreation Area in 1974, and nearly 30,000 people \ncontinue to visit this historic site every weekend.\n  Over the past few years, I have worked with colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle, in both the Senate and the House, to try to secure \nfunding toward the construction of a natatorium complex at Jacob Riis \nPark. This project is supported by the New York Landmarks Conservancy, \nthe Historic Districts Council, and the Queensboro Preservation League, \nas well as the thousands of constituents who turn to this park as a \nresource for recreation opportunities every spring, summer, and fall.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, Riis Park serves an ethnically diverse \npopulation including hundreds of inner-city families, adhering to the \nideas envisioned by Jacob Riis and carried on by City Parks \nCommissioner Robert Moses. By investing in this urban park, our \ngovernment can ensure that it remains a viable resource for years to \ncome. I stand in full support of funding for the Riis Park Natatorium \nComplex.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. My colleague and I have an inquiry to make of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from West \nVirginia. Both the House and Senate reports to the Interior \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002 have included $4.13 million in \nNational Park Service construction funding for rehabilitation of Jacob \nRiis Park. Would the chairman support the use of these funds for \nconstruction on the Riis Park Natatorium Complex?\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate the remarks of the Senators from New York, and \nwould support the use of these funds for such construction.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I thank the \nChair.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S7570]]\n\n        Department of Agriculture, United States Forest Service\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I first thank my distinguished \ncolleagues for their leadership and superb management of this bill. I \nwant to take a moment to express my support for a matter of great \nimportance to the people of my State, specifically obtaining funding \nfor land acquisition in the Chattahoochee National Forest. I understand \nthat the $2,320,000 included in the Appropriations Interior \nSubcommittee report for that purpose will be used to purchase available \ntracts of land in, or bordering, the Chattahoochee National Forest in \nGeorgia. I inquire of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and \nchairman of the committee, am I correct in understanding that \n$1,300,000 of that total is intended to purchase property at Mount \nYonah near Helen, GA, with the remainder being used to purchase \nproperty at Jack's River near the Cohutta Wilderness and the Etowah \nRiver near Dahlonega, GA?\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Georgia is correct regarding the \ncommittee's intent.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator for his inclusion of these \nworthwhile projects in the Interior appropriations bill.\n\n\n  Technical Assistance for the New River Gorge National River Parkway\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I want to take a moment to ask the ranking \nmember for his agreement to continue a program of importance to the \nState of West Virginia. The New River Gorge National River is a scenic \nwhitewater river that flows through deep canyons and rugged terrain. \nThe Congress has provided $125,000 annually for technical support and \nmaintenance on the New River Gorge National River Parkway. Would the \nranking member agree that funding for this purpose be continued within \nthe National Park Service appropriation in fiscal year 2002?\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree with the distinguished chairman that this funding \nshould be continued in fiscal year 2002.\n\n\n   North American Wetlands Conservation Act and Caddo Lake Institute \n                            Wetlands Project\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to thank my colleagues \nSenator Byrd and Senator Reid for agreeing to work with me in \nconference on the Interior appropriations bill to ensure that the \nInterior Department funds the Caddo Lake Institute's wetlands project \nin east Texas through the North American Wetlands Conservation Act.\n  Caddo Lake and its associated wetlands provide habitat for over 150 \nspecies of fish and wildlife. It is one of only 17 wetlands in the U.S. \nthat has earned the distinction of being designated a Ramsar wetland of \ninternational importance pursuant to the international wetlands \nconvention signed in Ramsar, Iran in 1971. Caddo Lake earned this \ndistinction, in part, because the local community surrounding Caddo \nLake spearheaded a long effort to convert the area from an army \nammunition plant to a refuge for fish and wildlife. With that \naccomplished, the next stage of the effort is to secure North American \nWetlands Conservation Act funding through the Interior bill for the \nCaddo Lake Institute so that it may advance the planned restoration and \nwetlands education work at the lake. The Institute has been the local \nvoice and enduring champion for Caddo Lake.\n  Mr. REID. I would like to be associated with the remarks of my \ncolleague from Texas. I was fortunate to learn about Caddo Lake and the \nInstitute's wetlands work at an April 10, 2001 Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee hearing on wildlife conservation \nefforts. The premise of that hearing was that national and \ninternational conservation goals stand a better chance of \naccomplishment if they are driven by the local community.\n  Caddo Lake is a perfect illustration of that idea. At the lake, the \nlocal community organized the Caddo Lake Institute and then worked with \nthe State of Texas and the federal government to further the \nconservation and educational wetland resources there. This not only \nimplements important wetland conservation goals in the North American \nWetlands Conservation Act and the Clean Water Act, but also the charge \nof the Ramsar Convention; that is, it implements both national and \ninternational conservation goals. Congressman Max Sandlin from the \nregion testified eloquently about the beauty and value of the lake at \nmy April 10 hearing, and I am happy to work with my colleagues to \nadvance the important conservation and education work at Caddo Lake.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my colleagues for their work on this issue, and \nwill work in conference to encourage the Interior Department to \ncontinue the work my colleagues have begun by funding a Ramsar-based \nwetland science, site management and education program through the \nCaddo Lake Institute working in partnership with the Division of \nInternational Conservation and the National Wetlands Research Center.\n\n\n                                 htirc\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I appreciate the previous support the \nsubcommittee has granted to the Fine Hardwoods Tree Improvement and \nRegeneration Center at Purdue University. The HTIRC is engaged in \nresearch problems and technology transfer related to the regeneration \nof fine hardwoods. It is a regional center emphasizing not only genetic \nimprovements and silvicultural goals, but addressing wildlife and \nriparian buffer issues and providing information and outreach to forest \nlandowners.\n  In establishing the center, I worked with Dr. Robert Lewis of the \nForest Service. The project has widespread support and is financially \nsupported not only by the Forest Service and Purdue University, but by \nthe Indiana Department of Natural Resources and by a very wide variety \nof forest landowner, industry groups and foundations. It is designed to \nimprove the quality of hardwood tree seedlings and to address the \nannual shortage of hardwood tree seedlings in the midwest.\n  The Forest Service and the Department of Agriculture view the center \nas an excellent example of cooperation between government, academia, \nand industry in addressing important issues concerning the regeneration \nof hardwoods. The proposed new forest biology building and laboratory \ncomplex will soon house eighteen Forest Service employees and would \nprovide office space and high tech laboratories for these Forest \nService employees rent-free and without any charges for maintenance or \nservices over the lifetime of the facility.\n  The total cost of the forestry complex is $27 million. Purdue has \ncommitted $20 million to this effort. The remaining $7 million would be \nderived from the Forest Service as its share of the cost to house its \nemployees, who would receive office space rent-free and maintenance-\nfree over the lifetime of the facility. Based on a life cycle analysis, \nthe Forest Service has concluded that this degree of cost sharing is \nfully justified and is in fact extremely favorable to the Forest \nService.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for including a provision \nin this bill that releases $300,000 in previously appropriated funds \nfor the design and construction of this facility. Construction of the \nfacility is planned to begin during fiscal year 2002 and the Forest \nService share of that fiscal year's funding needs is estimated at $2 \nmillion.\n  Mr. BURNS. I understand the need for the project, and I appreciate \nthe Senator's leadership and strong desire to bring this into fruition.\n  Mr. BYRD. Senator Burns and I will work with the Senator from Indiana \nto see if we can find sufficient resources through the conference \nprocess to support the Forest Service's share of this worthy effort.\n\n\n                   cane river national heritage area\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I express my sincere appreciation to \nthe distinguished floor manager and chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee for support of my request to provide funds for the Cane River \nCreole National Historical Park and Heritage Area. This park, one of \nAmerica's most unique historical parks, is in Natchitoches Parish, LA, \nthe seat of Louisiana's oldest settlement and home to one of the most \ninteresting and unique cultures in the United States. It is my \nunderstanding that the committee report recommends $650,000 for the \nCane River National Heritage Area.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Louisiana is correct. We were pleased to \nbe able to recommend funding for this high priority of the Senator.\n\n[[Page S7571]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. With the Senator's forbearance, I want to clarify the \npurposes for which these funds are allocated. My request to the \ncommittee, and I assume the committee's recommendation, will continue \nfunding for the Cane River Heritage Area at last year's rate of \n$400,000 for salaries, expenses and grants and will make available to \nthe Creole Center at Northwestern State University $250,000 to support \nimportant research and documentation of Creole culture in Louisiana. Is \nthis the committee's intent?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. In developing this recommendation the committee \nassumed funding for both these activities in the amounts the Senator \ndescribed.\n\n\n                        minnesota forest funding\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I ask consent to engage in a colloquy \nwith my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and of its Subcommittee on Interior. The \npurpose is to discuss two items in the bill which relate to the \nmanagement and vitality of national forests in my state of Minnesota--\nspecifically, the Superior and Chippewa National Forests. The chairman \nand the subcommittee have done a very commendable job in the bill of \nproviding needed funding for the continued multiple uses of our \nnational forests. I would like to draw his attention to two provisions \nimportant to Minnesota.\n  First, as my colleague knows, on July 4, 1999, both the Superior and \nChippewa National Forests bore the brunt of a massive, once-in-a-\nthousand years wind and rain storm that devastated parts of northern \nMinnesota. The storm damaged over 300,000 acres in seven counties, \nincluding as much as 70 percent of the trees in our national forests, \nand it washed out numerous roads. The damage severely hindered the U.S. \nForest Service's ability to responsibly manage both the Chippewa and \nSuperior National Forests.\n  The ``blowdown'' of trees created extreme risk of catastrophic fire \ndue to the amount of downed and dead timber. Yet while the storm has \nchanged affected portions of the forests for years to come and has \ncreated new risks and experiences for visitors and residents, officials \nfrom the Superior and Chippewa National Forests officials have been \nworking with state, county, and local officials on storm recovery \nactivities and planning to meet future needs. Key to that recovery is \nhelp provided last year in this bill. The Senate last year provided $14 \nmillion for efforts that continue today. I was pleased to work with the \nchairman, and I still appreciate his support at that time.\n  At the same time, there remains a dangerous fire threat in Superior \nand Chippewa, and the Forest Service plans to continue their recovery \nwork there through fuel reduction, reforestation and general \nrehabilitation. The bill before us contains increased general funding \nfor such management, recovery and rehabilitation, and I would seek my \ncolleague's assurance that it is his understanding that an adequate \nportion of that funding will allow the Superior and Chippewa National \nForests to continue their crucial efforts.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am aware of the devastating storm that affected my \ncolleague's state in 1999, and I was pleased to assist the Senator from \nMinnesota at that time. The recovery efforts begun with that funding \nshould certainly continued as needed, and I believe the subcommittee \nintends that this bill will provide adequate resources to complete \nscheduled work in the Superior and Chippewa National Forests.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. The second item I would like to \nmention is that both the Superior and Chippewa National Forests are \ncurrently working to complete their forest management plans. The \nexisting plans for these two forests, last revised in 1986, guide the \nforests' multiple use missions and lay out goals for habitat \nprotection, resource production, soil protection and other aims. The \nNational Forest Management Act requires an update of forest plans every \n10-15 years. The Chippewa and Superior National Forests are now jointly \nrevising their plans. This process allows efficient public \nparticipation rather than two parallel processes. It also provides \ngreater consistency in resource management between the forests. \nSubstantial public involvement has already helped develop the purpose \nand need for revising the plans, defining the issues and building a \npreliminary set of alternatives. The forests have ongoing consultation \nwith four Minnesota Bands of Ojibwe, the Minnesota Department of \nNatural Resources, seven adjacent counties, as well as various \ninterested stakeholders. The current forest planning work includes \nincorporating a required species viability evaluation initiated during \n2000. While the 1986 forest plans continue to provide direction during \nthe revision process, with ongoing public involvement, a final \nenvironmental impact statement and revised forest plans are expected in \nnext year.\n  Again, I am seeking my colleague's reassurances that sufficient land \nmanagement planning funds in this bill should be available to the \nSuperior and Chippewa National Forests to allow for full revision of \ntheir forest plans?\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate the Senator's attention to this issue. He is \ncorrect to point out the commendable work underway in the Minnesota \nforests. The Senator is aware that the President requested $70,358,000 \nfor land management planning in fiscal year 2002, while this \nAppropriations Committee has provided $70,718,000, an increase of \n$360,000. For that reason, I agree, and I believe the subcommittee \nwould agree, that this legislation should provide adequate resources to \nthe Superior and Chippewa National Forests to complete their forest \nmanagement plans.\n\n\n                ``Critical Energy Efficiency Programs''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Bingaman, Boxer, and Dorgan, to state our strong support for \ncritical energy efficiency programs within the Department of Energy. My \ncolleagues and I have been working with the chairman and ranking member \nover the last few days to restore and fully fund these important \nprograms. We believe that the proven efficacy of these programs merit \nallocation of additional funds.\n  The Federal Energy Management Program, or FEMP, uses alternative \nfinancing vehicles, technical assistance, and outreach campaigns to \nmake our federal agencies more energy efficient. Although this program \nuses only a small amount of federal funding, its energy reduction \nstrategies save the U.S. government, and thus American taxpayers, \nhundreds of millions of dollars a year. This program has proven to be a \ngreat investment. The Federal government is the largest user of energy \nin the United States and FEMP has helped reduce energy use per square \nfoot of floor area in federal buildings by 19 percent since 1985, \nresulting in cumulative savings of $6 billion since 1985. FEMP has also \ntrained over 13,000 federal energy managers, assisted with the design \nof over 200 energy saving projects, and helped federal agencies make \nuse of market-based energy saving performance contracts.\n  These are the type of programs we must support, programs that provide \na great return for our Federal dollars and keep returning those \nbenefits year after year. These programs also lessen the environmental \nimpact of the federal government, reduce our government's dependence on \nforeign oil, and leverage private sector resources.\n  I also suggest expanding several successful, community-based building \ntechnology assistance programs. These programs provide technical \nassistance, demonstrations, training, and education to communities to \naccelerate the use of innovative and cost-effective energy \ntechnologies, strategies, and methods. One particularly successful \nexample is the Energy Smart Schools campaign that provides a \ncomprehensive portfolio of energy efficiency technologies, and works \ndirectly with national, state, and local organizations that influence \nschool construction and modernization.\n  Let me share with you how Seattle Public Schools used this program to \nreap the extensive rewards of energy-saving retrofits. Through a \ncollaborative effort involving Seattle City Light, Seattle Public \nUtilities, Puget Sound Energy, and the Bonneville Power Administration, \ndozens of Seattle public schools received lighting retrofits, water \nconservation measures, upgraded energy management systems, and \neducation on how to use energy more efficiently. Combined, these \nefforts reduced the school system's annual energy bills by a third, \nsaving 15.5\n\n[[Page S7572]]\n\nmillion kilowatts of energy. I urge the Department to commit these \nadditional funds in the Western states that have been severely impacted \nby the electricity crisis.\n  Because the budget allocation in the Senate is significantly less \nthan the House, the Weatherization Program also has received less \nfunding in the Senate than in the House bill. It is an effective \nprogram--for every one dollar spent, three are saved.\n  Mr. Chairman, my colleagues and I appreciate the budgetary \nconstraints that we must operate within for the Interior and related \nagency appropriations bill. We appreciate the chairman's assistance in \nincreasing funding levels for these programs.\n  Could the chairman of the Appropriations Committee inform me as to \nhis intention with regard to increasing the funding levels of these key \nenergy conservation programs?\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree that these energy conservation programs are very \nimportant. If additional funds are available during conference, I would \nconsider increases in these programs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Thank you for your support.\n\n\n           restoration and maintenance of the arlington house\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise to enter into a colloquy with \nChairman Byrd and Ranking Member Burns concerning the renovation and \nrestoration needs of the National Park Service property, the Arlington \nHouse, across the Potomac River in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Arlington House is uniquely associated with the historic Virginia \nfamilies of Washington, Custis and Lee. It was built by George \nWashington Park Custis and was the home of Robert E. Lee until the \nCivil War. Over the years, Arlington House has become an integral part \nof the core monument area here in the Nation's Capital. Not only is it \nlocated at the center of the Arlington National Cemetery, but it is \nemblematic of the post-Civil War bond between North and South, Abraham \nLincoln and Robert E. Lee are symbolically united by the Memorial \nBridge which connects the Lincoln Memorial to Arlington House.\n  In recent years, the National Park Service has been unable to \nproperly maintain the physical structure of Arlington House to \nsafeguard its artifacts and collections, thereby causing many of the \nrooms in this historic house to be closed to the public.\n  The National Park Service has identified the total funding \nrequirements to restore Arlington House. It is my understanding that a \nminimum of $2.5 million is needed in fiscal 2002 to preserve this \nfacility.\n  I am aware that the chairman and ranking member were faced with many \nsignificant funding demands in this bill. They have done an admirable \njob to provide the maximum amount of funding available to preserve our \nnation's historic resources. I bring to their attention the significant \nneeds of Arlington House and respectfully request that in conference \nwith the House that this matter be given their attention.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for his \ninterest in the historic Arlington House. I am aware that funding for \nthe restoration needs for the Arlington House was requested in the \nPresident's budget and I can assure the Senator from Virginia that the \ncommittee will carefully consider this important project as we continue \nto assess the maintenance and restoration needs of National Park \nService properties.\n  Mr. BURNS. I concur with Chairman Byrd and can assure the Senator \nfrom Virginia that the restoration of the Arlington House will receive \nour attention during the conference with the House of Representatives. \nWe will make every effort to address the needs of this historic home.\n\n\n                   THE FOREST SERVICE AND WILD FIRES\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President there is a serious crisis in my home \nState of Alaska on the Kenai Peninsula, where literally millions of \ntrees have been killed due to insect infestation. This is causing a \nmajor fire danger situation. Many homes and communities are at risk. I \nwas very disturbed to learn recently that the Forest Service had \ninitiated a prescribed burn near Seward that got away from them when \nthe wind shifted. While fortunately the fire was contained before it \ndamaged private property, this incident causes me to be concerned about \nthe level of oversight the agency uses when burning in these very high \nrisk areas.\n  Mr. BYRD. I recall that my friend from Alaska mentioning this during \nthe committee markup of this bill. I assure you now, as I did then, \nthat I am ready to help in any way possible to be sure the Forest \nService applies adequate oversight to its hazard reduction activities.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the chairman's remarks. I just recently met \nwith Chief Dale Bosworth of the Forest Service and expressed my \nconcern. I asked the chief to promptly provide me with a report that \naddresses how communities that are at risk can be assured when the \nagency plans a prescribed burn, that all potential factors are taken \ninto account, and the decision to initiate a prescribed burn has been \nadequately reviewed. I also asked the chief to insure that local \nelected officials concerns are accounted for before a burn is ignited \nand to look at naming a Forest Service official in each region who \nwould be in charge of approving any burn plans. I have also provided an \namendment that I understand is in the managers package that addresses \nthe specific situation with the prescribed burn I just noted on the \nKenai and other areas of high fire risk across the country. This \namendment provides the Forest Service with the authority to use \n$15,000,000 of Wildland Fire Management funds on adjacent non-federal \nlands, using all authorities available to the agency under its State \nand Private Forestry Appropriation. These funds will be available for \nreducing fire hazard on adjacent non-federal lands and protecting \ncommunities when hazard reduction activities planned on adjacent \nnational forest lands. The Forest Service assures me that portions of \nthese funds will be used to protect communities on the Kenai Peninsula. \nI expect the Forest Service to strongly consider areas of the Kenai as \ncandidates for the stewardship end results contracting, as specified in \nSection 347 of public law 105-277, and which the committee has amended \nto provide for up to 28 additional contracts.\n  Mr. BYRD. I am pleased to include this amendment in the managers \npackage and feel it will be extremely helpful in protecting communities \nfrom the threat of wild fire.\n\n\n        smithsonian center for materials research and education\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the distinguished chairman yield for the purpose \nof a colloquy regarding language contained in the bill concerning the \nSmithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be happy to yield to my friend, the senior Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, I remain deeply concerned with the \nSecretary of the Smithsonian's decision to close a number of the \nInstitution's scientific and research facilities, including the \nSmithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education (SCMRE) located \nin Prince George's County, MD. It is my understanding that language \ncontained in the bill would preclude any funds to be utilized for the \npurpose of closing SCMRE and the other relevant facilities without the \napproval by the Board of Regents of recommendations made in this regard \nby the Secretary's proposed Science Commission.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is also my understanding that the bill provides \nsufficient funding to ensure that SCMRE's programs can continue at last \nyear's level.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is again correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. For nearly 40 years, researchers and scientists at \nSCMRE have been leaders in the field of preservation research and \nanalysis. They have contributed greatly to the conservation efforts of \nmuseums and institutions throughout the nation and around the world by \noffering training programs and technical assistance. I would like to \nquote from an editorial that appeared on May 8 in the New York Times \nthat captures the importance of preserving this facility:\n\n       . . . [C]aring for artworks, which can often be done in \n     museum labs, is far different from scientifically studying \n     how to care for them. Over the years, the Materials Research \n     Center has created an extensive store of archaeological data \n     based on its work on collections from around the world. It \n     makes no\n\n[[Page S7573]]\n\n     sense for the Smithsonian--the most remarkable accumulation \n     of objects on earth--to close a national laboratory whose \n     very purpose is to analyze the material basis of its \n     collections.\n\n  I thank the chairman for his time and commend him for his leadership \nand assistance in this matter.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to thank the managers of the \nfiscal year 2002 Interior appropriations bill for working with me to \nprovide Forest Legacy funding for an important conservation project in \nthe western mountain region of Maine.\n  In drafting the Interior appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002, \nthe managers have demonstrated, once again, their commitment to \npromoting conservation. I am particularly pleased that the bill funds \nForest Legacy at $65 million--the most that has ever been allocated for \nthis important and growing program--and I am grateful for the support \nChairman Byrd and Senator Burns have given to projects in my Sate this \nyear and in years past.\n  Neither the Interior appropriations bill that passed in the house nor \nthe Senate bill voted out of committee included funding for the \nTumbledown/Mt. Blue conservation project in the western mountain region \nof Maine. Because of the importance of this project to my State, I \nproposed an amendment to the bill to dedicate Forest Legacy fund to the \nTumbledown/Mt. Blue initiative. Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Burns \nhave graciously agreed to accept a modified version of my amendment, \nwhich will earmark $1 million for the project.\n  The western mountain region of my State is a beautiful area that has \nlong been valued for recreation, natural resources, scenic values and \nproductive forest lands that fuel Maine's forest product industries. \nThese traditional uses, which would be protected in perpetuity by this \nconservation project, are of tremendous value to the local communities \nand the region's economy.\n  Recent changes in land ownership and land use has led to local \nconcern that the character of the Tumbledown/Mt. Blue area will be \npermanently altered. This has prompted the State, local businesses, and \nconservation groups to promote a long-term conservation vision for the \nregion that will prevent this forested landscape from being converted \nas a result of development pressures. Making this conservation vision a \nreality entails the acquisition of 31,240 acres around Mt. Blue State \nPark and along Tumbledown Mountain through fee and easement purchases.\n  Funding the Tumbledown/Mt. Blue Conservation project will enable the \nState to protect critical properties adjacent to the park and some of \nMaine's most scenic areas--including Tumbledown Mountain, Jackson \nMountain, Blueberry Mountain, and trailheads leading to these peaks. I \nwould also proudly point out to my colleagues that Mt. Blue State Park \nis one of Maine's most popular recreation spots and was recently voted \nby Outdoor magazine as one of the ten best family vacation areas in the \ncountry. The area contains rugged summits, alpine ridges, and wetlands, \nas well as habitat for the federally listed bald eagle and one of \nMaine's only successful peregrine falcon nesting terrorities.\n  I am pleased to say that several landowners within the project area \nare ready now to put their resource lands into a conservation plan that \nwill permanently protect and allow public access to recreation lands, \nscenic areas, and trailheads leading up Tumbledown, while providing for \nsustainable harvesting on the more productive and less environmentally \nsensitive forested areas. This is a locally driven win-win approach to \nresolving the various concerns that arise out of changes in the region. \nI applaud the many individuals and groups that have invested time in \nbringing this project about. It is heartening to know how deeply they \ncare about their community, and I appreciate having this opportunity to \ndetermine my support for their efforts.\n  Last year, because of the generous funding level the Interior \nSubcommittee was able to provide the Forest Legacy Program, $1.17 \nmillion was allocated to the Mt. Blue/Tumbledown Mountain project for \nthe first phase of acquisition. This year, to complete the project \nanother $4 million is needed. I am concerned that unless we make \nfunding progress in fiscal year 2002 with the willing sellers now in \nplace, Maine will lose a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to protect a \ntruly wonderful resource.\n  I want to thank very much the Senators from West Virginia and Montana \nfor their willingness to work with me and Senator Snowe on this \ncritical important project.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to commend an agreement that was reached with regards \nto the Landrieu-Smith amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. \nSimply put, the purpose of the amendment was to fix what is essentially \na technical concern with the bill and improve the way that States \nreceived their portions of the $100 million. This would be done by \nutilizing an already established wildlife conservation fund and its \nformula parameters instead of creating a new program with a new \nformula.\n  I do want to make it clear that I am extremely supportive of the \nfunding that is provided in this Interior appropriations bill for the \nState Wildlife Grant Fund. I believe that these dollars will be of \ngreat benefit to State efforts to protect wildlife populations. I am \nespecially pleased that the bill allows the States to determine the \nmanner in which to utilize these resources.\n  The Landrieu-Smith amendment would seek to use the Wildlife \nConservation and Restoration Program, under the popular and successful \nPittman-Robertson Program, that was established in the fiscal year 2001 \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriation law. The law also provided $50 \nmillion under formula apportionment to the States for high priority \nwildlife conservation, education and recreation projects. That language \nwas included at my request because of my concern for equitable \ndistribution of valuable conservation funds. In fact, I have recently \nintroduced a bill--the American Wildlife Enhancement Act of 2001, \nS.990--that would extend the authorization of that program through \n2006. The Landrieu-Smith amendment would allocate the $100 million set-\naside for the State Wildlife Grants Fund to the already established \nWildlife Conservation and Restoration Program.\n  Adoption of our amendment would improve, and make more equitable, the \nway that these dollars are allocated to the States. Our amendment would \nallow for the allocation of funds under the formula established last \nyear in the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program. Funding in \nthat program is based two-thirds on the population of the State and \none-third on the land area. It also guarantees that a single State \nwould receive no less than one percent and no more than five percent of \nthe available funds. This formula was supported by all 50 State fish \nand wildlife agencies as being the most equitable distribution to \naddress conservation needs throughout the country.\n  The Interior appropriations bill that was reported by the \nAppropriations Committee would have changed that formula. This would \nresult in a considerable gain of funds for only 2 States, but a loss \nfor 37 other States. To change the already established formula would \ncompromise the ability of the majority of our states to effectively \naddress their wildlife conservation needs.\n  I am seeking to change back to what was established last year because \nI believe that is what is most fair to all States and already has their \nstrong support. Regardless of whether or not our amendment was agreed \nto, New Hampshire's funding will not be impacted--to me it is an issue \nof fairness.\n  It also makes much more sense to appropriate the $100 million to an \nalready existing account with set allocation parameters that has \ndemonstrated success than to create a new bureaucratic process. The \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and State fish and wildlife are agencies \nalready familiar with the Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Program \nand could administer the program efficiently. Why impose a new set of \ncriteria for allocation of the fiscal year 02 funds when the previously \nestablished criteria works so well?\n  Through excellent cooperation between the Fish and Wildlife Service \nand the State fish and wildlife agencies, all 50 States have already \nqualified to receive their apportionment of the $50 million made \navailable by last\n\n[[Page S7574]]\n\nyear's Commerce-Justice-State appropriations law and are in the process \nof submitting their project agreements. Adopting this amendment would \nhave allowed this process to continue smoothly into the next fiscal \nyear.\n  I am pleased to support what I believe is a fair compromise to this \namendment. The Interior appropriations bill that passed the Senate this \nevening reflects the changes in the formula that our amendment intended \nto make, without sending the funds through the Wildlife Conservation \nand Restoration Program. Even though the previously established account \nis not being used to distribute the funds, I am pleased that the funds \nwill be allocated using a formula that all 50 State fish and wildlife \nagencies have agreed to as fair and equitable.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise in favor of the Landrieu \namendment to the Interior appropriations bill regarding the \ndistribution of $100 million in state wildlife grants for priority \nwildlife conservation, education, and restoration projects. As \ncurrently written, the Interior appropriations bill changes the way \nthese grants are allocated to the States. The change would negatively \naffect the amount of grant money most states would receive.\n  Last year, Congress established the Wildlife Conservation and \nRestoration Account as part of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife \nRestoration Fund. It was Congress' intent that funds from the account \nbe distributed to the states through a formula based on one-third of \nthe land area of a state and two-thirds population. Congress also said \nthat no state will receive less than one percent or more than five \npercent of the total funding.\n  The Landrieu amendment would distribute the funds under the same \nformula allocation that was enacted last year by directing them through \nthe Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Account.\n  All 50 State fish and wildlife agencies agree that the formula \nCongress enacted last year is the most equitable distribution of these \nfunds. If we agree to the formula proposed in the Interior \nappropriations bill, 37 States will receive less money. Ohio would \nreceive over $100,000 less than under the already established formula. \nThe Ohio Department of Natural Resources supports the Landrieu \namendment.\n  With so many States facing such large reductions in the amount of \ngrant money they would receive, it makes sense to distribute these \nfunds based on the equitable formula that Congress agreed to last year. \nSupport of the Landrieu amendment will ensure that the $100 million \nappropriated for State wildlife grants is distributed fairly and \nprovides all states with the funds they need for their most critical \nwildlife and conservation projects.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, in the managers' package is contained an \namendment which provides for the repeal of section 819 of the Omnibus \nIndian Advancement Act.\n  In my view, this is a matter that is more appropriately addressed in \nthe authorizing committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Accordingly, I intend to work with my colleagues to see that this \nproposed repeal of a section of authorizing legislation is removed from \nthe Interior appropriations bill and addressed in the appropriate \nforum.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, this bill is the first appropriations \nbill for fiscal year 2002 the Senate is considering. I am pleased to be \na member of the subcommittee that has the responsibility for writing \nthis bill each year.\n  I have enjoyed working on the issues and programs that must be \naddressed each year during our hearings and the development of this \nlegislation.\n  The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Forest Service have a \nmajor presence in my state. The levels of funding for their activities \nand responsibilities in Mississippi have a significant impact on our \ninterest in protecting our natural resources and historic attractions.\n  I'm glad the Committee's bill provides an increase in the funding for \noperation and maintenance of the Natchez Trace Parkway. The beauty and \nliving history facilities of this parkway attract tourists and local \nvisitors alike, and its completion has been one of my highest personal \npriorities.\n  The Vicksburg National Military Park will be enhanced by the \nacquisition of the house used by General Pemberton as his headquarters \nduring the siege of Vicksburg. Along with funding for a needed \nstabilization project, this commitment will enable the Park to continue \nto attract more than one million visitors each year.\n  There are also funds in this bill to help pay the cost of \nacquisition, as part of the Gulf Islands National Seashore, of Cat \nIsland, which is located in the Gulf of Mexico off the Coast of \nMississippi.\n  Other provisions of this bill allow the continued construction of the \nFranklin County Lake in the Homochitto National Forest which will be a \nvery important recreational resource for the people of southwest \nMississippi.\n  An increase in funding is also provided in the bill as payments in \nlieu of taxes to counties that contain federal lands. This will help \noffset the losses that have occurred in many of these counties by \nchanges in forest management policies of the U.S. Forest Service.\n  The bill also includes $6.3 million for research programs that will \nbe performed by the University of Mississippi and Mississippi State \nUniversity.\n  The National Park Service is also responsible for the operation and \nmaintenance of the Natchez National Historical Park which contains some \nof the most interesting properties that reflect the lifestyles and \ncultural diversity of the early settlers in the oldest continuously \ninhabited town on the Mississippi River. The City of Natchez is also \nthe southern terminus of the Natchez Trace Parkway.\n  This bill contains funds for continued enhancement of the historical \npark which will enrich the experience of visitors to this unique \neducational resource in my state.\n  Another interesting destination for visitors is the Corinth \nBattlefield in northeast Mississippi which was included in a list of \nthe top ten most important Civil War battlefields by former Secretary \nof the Interior Manuel Lujan. It is located near the Shiloh National \nMilitary Park and will be the site of a new Civil War Interpretive \nCenter. This building will be constructed with funds that are included \nin this bill at the request of our state's delegation in Congress.\n  My colleague, Trent Lott, has taken the lead in making this new \naddition to our state's list of federally supported projects a reality. \nCongressman Roger Wicker has also been a key influence in the \nappropriations process on this project as well as the Brice's \nCrossroads site.\n  Taken as a whole, the provisions of this Interior Appropriations bill \nwill contribute to the economy of our state and at the same time help \nprotect valuable natural resources, historic attractions and our \nenvironment.\n  I appreciate the cooperation and assistance of the managers of the \nbill and my staff member, Ginger Wallace, who worked hard to help \ndevelop the provisions of the bill that were of specific interest in \nour State of Mississippi.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to support the Education and \nTraining Center for the Power Generation Industry at Bismarck State \nCollege. Although funding for this program is not explicitly mentioned \nin the Interior Appropriations bill, I would like to see the \nrelationship between Bismarck State College (BSC) and the Department of \nEnergy grow during the next fiscal year as BSC builds on its \nPartnership to Improve Energy Technology Training and Education. Last \nyear, BSC's Energy Technology Program received $50,000 in competitive \nFederal funding to develop a new curriculum based on conventional and \nadvanced power technologies. Given that the Chairman has been kind \nenough to increase the budget request for fossil fuel research and \ndevelopment, I would hope that the DoE will provide the funds to expand \nthis program next year, especially given the challenges that the power \nindustry will face in the coming years.\n  I applaud those at Bismarck State College who have been working on \nthis project, and it is my hope that the Committee could provide some \nfunding for this program as we move this bill to conference so that the \nCollege could further develop the curriculum plan and provide \nnationwide online courses in power generation management.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nhave\n\n[[Page S7575]]\n\noffered to section 107 of the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2002. The amendment is intended to clarify that under that section \npreleasing activities are prohibited, just as they are in other \nsections of the bill that restrict oil and gas development in other \nwaters.\n  Section 107 now reads as follows: ``no funds provided in this title \nmay be expended by the Department of the Interior for the conduct of \noffshore leasing and related activities placed under restriction in the \nPresident's moratorium statement of June 12, 1998.'' This includes the \nareas of northern, central, and southern California, the North \nAtlantic, Washington, Oregon, and the eastern Gulf of Mexico south of \n26 degrees north latitude and east of 86 degrees west longitude.\n  I want to stress that it is my belief that section 107 prohibits \npreleasing activities because preleasing activities are, by their very \nnature, related activities. However, sections 108, 109 and 110 create \nmoratoria on offshore leasing for the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic, \nNorth Aleutian Basin and portions of the Gulf of Mexico, and these \nsections restrict preleasing, leasing, and related activities. I am \nconcerned that the discrepancy between Section 107 and these other \nsections creates the potential for legal ambiguity that may put the \nareas listed in Section 107 at risk. Specifically, it may be argued \nthat a set of activities exists preleasing activities that are \nprohibited under Sections 108, 109 and 110 but not prohibited under \nSection 107.\n  The simple, straightforward amendment I have proposed adds preleasing \nto the list of prohibited activities in Section 107. It would clarify \nCongressional intent and serve as a preventative step against any \nchallenge to the meaning of the prohibition. It would do no more than \nclarify that California, the North Atlantic, Washington, Oregon and \nportions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico have the same protections now \nprovided to the Mid-Atlantic, South Atlantic and other areas in \nSections 108, 109 and 110.\n  In closing I want to briefly discuss one reason why this amendment \nand the clarification it would provide is important to Massachusetts \nand New England. That reason is Georges Bank a natural wonder \ncritically important to our state's economy and environment. Georges \nBank supports Atlantic cod, scallops, haddock, yellowtail flounder and \nother valuable commercial species. Endangered species including the \nright whale, humpback whale and sei whale rely on Georges Bank and the \nsurrounding area for feeding and as a migratory pathway. The National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency charged with \nprotecting marine resources, has warned that oil and gas exploration in \nGeorges Bank threatens these commercial and endangered species. NOAA \nand others have pointed out that despite advances in drilling \ntechnology, exploration carries inherent risks from spills, other \naccidental releases, drilling muds, seepage and other sources. I \nstrongly believe petroleum exploration in the unique and extremely \nvaluable habitat of Georges Bank poses unnecessary economic and \nenvironmental risk.\n  I want to thank Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Burns for working \nwith me to secure the passage of this important amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts and I have \nintroduced the Kerry-Snowe Georges Bank amendment to the fiscal year \n2002 Interior Appropriations bill today to make absolutely certain that \nlanguage in the fiscal year 2002 Interior Appropriations bill before us \nis modified to ensure that there will be no pre-leasing activities on \nGeorges Bank. Language in the bill does prohibit the expenditure of \nfunds by the Department of Interior for activities related to offshore \nleasing in the North Atlantic area, but I wanted the guarantee that \npre-leasing activities would be out of bounds as well.\n  Currently, both the United States and Canada have moratoria on oil \nand gas exploration until 2012 for the ecologically sensitive Georges \nBank. What the Kerry-Snowe amendment does is include language in the \nSenate bill to prohibit any pre-leasing activities for the Georges Bank \narea, such as is included for the Mid- and South Atlantic. We are \nadding this language for the North Atlantic as well because of \nindications over the past few months that the administration could be \nconsidering legal and administrative groundwork for accessing Georges \nBank.\n  Report recommendations to the Secretary of Interior by the \nSubcommittee on Natural Gas on the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf \nincluded a recommendation that the Mineral Management Service, in \nconsultation with industry and affected States, identify the five top \ngeologic places for natural gas reserves in the moratoria areas, where \nindustry would most likely explore, and where seismic data could be \ncollected. Georges Bank is reported to be one of these prospects.\n  Our added pre-leasing language for the North Atlantic area makes \nSection 107 of the bill consistent with Section 110 of the bill that \ndoes not allow Interior Department funding to conduct oil and natural \ngas pre-leasing, leasing and related activities in the Mid-Atlantic and \nSouth Atlantic planning areas.\n  As I recently wrote the President, I strongly believe that the \nmoratoria should not be lifted on this 185-mile-long bank that \nstretches from Nova Scotia to Cape Cod--five-sixths of which is owned \nby the U.S. This broad, shallow fishing ground is one of the world's \nmost productive, and current available natural gas reserves in the U.S. \ndwarf those which are projected to be available on the Georges Bank.\n  I want to sincerely thank the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nChairs Byrd and Burns for accepting the Kerry-Snowe amendment as part \nof the Managers amendment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I rise to support the Trails and Rails \nProgram, a national partnership between Amtrak and the National Park \nService. This program provides on-board educational programs to rail \ntravelers. It has played a valuable role in educating Americans about \nthe historic landmark sites in this country. This is an excellent \noutreach program that allows the National Park Service to reach non-\ntraditional visitors and introduce them to our national parks, trails \nand historic sites.\n  I am particularly excited about this program as we begin to celebrate \nthe bicentennial of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Last May, the \nfamous footsteps of the Lewis and Clark along the trail in North Dakota \nand Montana came alive as their historic journey was retraced by guests \naboard Amtrak's Empire Builder train. This program has been laying the \nfoundation for the National Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Commemoration, \nwhich will officially begin in 2003. Train passengers have already been \nable to explore historic areas along the Lewis and Clark trail such as \nthe Union Trading Post National Historic Site in Williston, ND. It is \nmy hope that the National Park Service could continue its partnership \nso that Amtrak passengers can explore other historic sites in the Lewis \nand Clark expedition.\n  Although fiscal year 2002 funding has not yet been identified for \nthis program, I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nimportant National Park Service partnership. I trust that some funding \nwill be included for this partnership in the final version of the \nInterior appropriations bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the provisions \nin this bill that enhance the Steel Loan Guarantee program. The changes \nadopted today will provide invaluable assistance to our nation's steel \ncompanies as they strive to stay afloat in the face of overwhelming \nsurges of finished and semi-finished steel imports.\n  As you know, our domestic steel industry finds itself reeling from \nrecord import surges. Numerous companies are either in bankruptcy, have \nfiled for bankruptcy, or are on the verge of doing so. On the Iron \nRange in my home state of Minnesota, for example, citing poor economic \nconditions, LTV Steel Mining Company halted production at the Hoyt \nLakes mine, leaving 1400 workers out of work and affecting another 5000 \nadditional workers as well. These are hard working people who want \ndesperately to work the trades they were trained for and have been \ndoing for generation upon generation.\n  The changes we are making today in the Steel Loan Guarantee program \nwill make it easier for companies to access much needed capital. In \nparticular, we are increasing the loan coverage for a\n\n[[Page S7576]]\n\nportion of the loans under this program from 85 percent to 95 percent \nand extending the duration of financing from 5 to 15 years. These \nchanges represent one component of S. 957, the comprehensive Steel \nRevitalization Act of 2001 that I, along with Senator Byrd, Senator \nDayton and others introduced earlier this year.\n  I am pleased that we are taking the opportunity today to move a \nportion of this comprehensive measure. And I will continue to press \nthis passage of the remaining elements of this much-needed legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I wish to comment on the Interior \nappropriations bill which the Senate has passed by voice vote. I am \nsatisfied, that unlike in years past, this bill is relatively free from \nanti-environmental riders. I commend the chairman (Mr. Byrd) and the \nranking member (Mr. Stevens) for producing a bill that is largely free \nfrom riders which many of my constituents view as an undemocratic way \nto address environmental issues. I have been pleased by the progress on \nthis bill, and by the manager's efforts to allow important \nenvironmental issues the benefit of an up or down vote on the floor.\n  Though the bill this year has been considered by the Senate with an \nimproved process, I do have some concerns about a few of the bill's \nprovisions. First, I understand that the Senate fiscal year 2002 \nInterior bill includes $65 million for the Forest Legacy Program of the \nU.S. Forest Service, a program I strongly support. I further understand \nthat, of the $65 million provided for the Forest Legacy program, $35.26 \nmillion has been allocated by the Senate Interior appropriations \nSubcommittee in the committee report to fund specific projects. I hope \ntat this allocation leaves approximately $29.8 million available to be \ndistributed by the Forest Service to other priority projects, such as \nthe Tomahawk Northwoods project in Northern Wisconsin. The Tomahawk \nproject was specifically enumerated to receive funds by in the House \nreport on the 2002 Interior appropriations bill, and it is my hope that \nthe Senate's bill leaves flexibility so that this project can indeed be \nfunded by the Forest Service.\n  I also want to share my concern regarding section 330 of the fiscal \nyear 2002 Interior appropriations bill. Section 330 extends for 50 \nyears a special use permit for a cabin located in the Absaroka-\nBeartooth Wilderness Area in Montana. I hope that the conferees on this \nlegislation will give serious consideration to removing this provision \nand referring the matters to the Senate Energy Committee for their \nreview. My concern, as a Senator who is concerned about federal \nwilderness management, is that allowing the cabin to remain, without \nthe benefit of review by the appropriate authorizing committee, could \nset a precedent that is contrary to the Wilderness Act, Forest Service \npolicy and the Custer National Forest Management plan. It would be my \nhope that review by the Energy Committee would clarify whether the \nMontana State University-Billings indeed has the ability to apply for \nan extension of the special use permit that had been held by the \ncabin's previous owner.\n  Finally, I understand that the managers' amendment contains language \nconcerning the management of cruise ships in Glacier Bay National Park. \nThough I understand that this language represents a compromise worked \nout over the last few hours, I feel that an important policy matter \nsuch as this one would be better left to the authorizing committee. I \nbelieve legislative language which seeks to addresses serious legal \nissues over the reduction of cruise ship traffic required by Federal \ncourts deserves full and fair consideration through proper hearings and \nreview. I hope that the conference committee will give serious \nconsideration to removing this provision.\n  I am pleased to support this year's bill, and I hope so see a bill \nfree from environmental riders emerge from conference.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have been fortunate to be in this \nChamber during the entire time the Interior bill has been debated. I \nwould like to take a few minutes to commend the President pro tempore \nof the Senate, who is also the chairman of the Interior Subcommittee, \nfor the tremendous leadership he has shown not only on the Interior \nbill but on the supplemental appropriations bill we passed. It shows \nhis experience and his dedication to the Senate. He has taken the helm \nof the Appropriations Committee firmly and has confidently steered this \nbill in the right direction. There have been very difficult decisions \nto make in crafting this bill.\n  I also want to take a minute to express my public appreciation to \nRanking Member Burns for the work they have done. If there were ever a \nbipartisan bill--and I hope it remains that way in the remaining hours \nof this bill, and I am confident it will--this is it.\n  These two legislators have worked to come up with an appropriate \npackage that has the best they could do with the tools they had, the \nlimited amount of money they had, to satisfy hundreds and hundreds of \nrequests from Members and from different entities making up our Federal \nGovernment. It has been a very difficult time. From a personal \nperspective, I think they have done exemplary work.\n  About 4 years ago I asked President Clinton to convene a summit in \nLake Tahoe. I did that out of desperation. I was at the lake and had, \nfor 15 years, worked to try to do something to improve the quality of a \nplace that has been called by Mark Twain the fairest place in all the \nEarth. It is a beautiful lake. It is a part of nature that you can only \nappreciate by being there; it is so absolutely fantastic.\n  We had a show over here, and there is a display now in the rotunda of \nthe Russell Building that has great photographs of Lake Tahoe. I spoke \nbriefly there last night. A man by the name of Dr. Goldman, who is the \nleading expert on the ecology of that lake, spoke. He said he has been \nall over the world. He has been to Lake Baikal in Siberia in the Soviet \nUnion. Lake Baikal has 20 percent of all the fresh water in the world, \nin one lake. It is well over a mile deep. It is a beautiful lake. I am \nfortunate; I have been there. But Dr. Goldman said he has been to most \nall the major lakes in the world, and, by far, Lake Tahoe is the most \nbeautiful.\n  So I asked the President to convene a summit because I had not been \nable to accomplish what I needed. Out of desperation, I said to the \npress that I thought the only thing that would work is to convene a \nsummit and have the world understand what a calamity is about to occur.\n  I confided in the President that I had done this and asked if he \nwould support me in this effort. He said: Yes, I will come to Lake \nTahoe. And he did. It was not a photo opportunity. And that would have \nbeen more than I could ask, if the President of the United States would \ncome to Lake Tahoe for a photo opportunity, but he did more than that. \nWe had six Cabinet officers who held townhall meetings in the months \nprior to the President coming. Over 1,000 people participated in those \ntownhall meetings when the summit was convened, with the President and \nVice President there at Lake Tahoe, and the groups concerned about the \nlake--the environmentalists, the people who had wanted to build homes \nthere, contractors, small businessmen, big businessmen, people who were \nagainst gambling, people who were for gambling. They were all there \nspeaking from the same page.\n  They agreed that something had to be done. So the summit--rather than \nbeing a boisterous affair where people were pointing fingers at each \nother--was a lovefest. As a result of that, we have been able to get a \nlot of help for Lake Tahoe. Part of that help is in this bill.\n  This bill increased, by over 100 percent, the amount of money going \nto Lake Tahoe. Senators Feinstein and Boxer--and now Senator Ensign--we \nhave worked together. We have made progress. But it all started as a \nresult of that summit.\n  I appreciate very much the attention of Senators Burns and Byrd, \nrecognizing that Lake Tahoe really may be the fairest place in all the \nEarth.\n  They have increased funding this year by over 100 percent. This \ncommitment will help make the Federal Government a full partner in the \nongoing effort to conserve this exquisite jewel of the American \nenvironment. California has done its share. Nevada has done its share \nby floating bond issues. Now the Federal Government is coming through.\n\n[[Page S7577]]\n\n  Chairman Byrd and ranking member Burns also helped improve the \nprospects for county governments throughout the entire West by \nallocating $220 million for PILT--Payment in Lieu of Taxes--Programs.\n  I thank Senators Byrd and Burns for making an effort to breathe life \nback into the budget of the United States Geological Survey, which was \ntreated very badly by this administration. The Bush administration did \neverything it could to kill the Geological Survey, this great \ninstitution of government. John Wesley Powell was the first leader of \nthe U.S. Geological Survey, a man whose arm was cut off. The nerves \nwere exposed and whenever he would bump it, it would hurt more than a \nperson can imagine. With that bad arm, he led the first group to float \nthe mighty Colorado. He was the father of the Geological Survey. \nSenators Byrd and Burns have breathed life back into this wonderful \ninstitution that is so important to our country.\n  This agency has had a tremendously positive impact all over the \nUnited States. For example, the Presiding Officer traveled with me to \nFallon, NV, to find out why we have children dying. Since we were \nthere, one child has died. They have discovered two or three other \ncases of childhood leukemia. We went there seeking evidence as to why \nthese children are sick and dying.\n  One of the things being done about this is being done by the U.S. \nGeological Survey. They are testing water wells in Fallon as I speak so \npeople in Nevada know whether the water they are drinking is safe. The \nU.S. Geological Survey is our preeminent scientific agency, some say \nthe greatest scientific agency we have in Government. That is \ndebatable, but they do great work.\n  I appreciate the leaders of the subcommittee who recognized this by \nrestoring the budget. The public land agencies funded by the Interior \nappropriations bill are of great importance to the State of Nevada: the \nBureau of Land Management, Bureau of Reclamation. They do tremendous \nthings for our country. I am grateful that Chairman Byrd and ranking \nmember Burns have done their best to fund these agencies.\n  I am confident we can finish this bill today. I hope we can. The \nmanagers have worked during the night, and staff members are still \nworking to come up with a proposal to end this legislation quickly. \nThere may be a few disputed matters to be resolved this afternoon. I \nwanted to spend a minute recognizing the great work done by the two \nmanagers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER: The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass?\n  The bill (H.R. 2217), as amended, was passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

STEVEN GRILES OF VIRGINIA TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF \n                              THE INTERIOR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of J. Steven \nGriles to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of J. Steven Griles of \nVirginia to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise tonight to discuss my opposition to \nthe nomination of J. Steven Griles as Deputy Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior. In my view, Mr. Griles' past record and \nrecent statements, both public and private, indicate he is lacking the \nsingle most important quality needed for this key position; that is, \nthe ability to bring people together despite very disparate and \ndiffering views on natural resources issues.\n  We have learned in the West--and I see my good friend Senator Craig \nfrom Idaho. He and I, again and again, sat in hearings in the forestry \nsubcommittee, and we have seen how difficult these natural resources \nissues are. I am proud we have come together on issues such as the \ncounty payments bill which the Forest Service said was the most \nimportant law in the last 30 years, and Senator Craig and I teamed up \nto get that law passed because we recognized how important it was to \nbring people together.\n  What has troubled me about Mr. Griles' past record--and I will \ndiscuss that--and his recent statements, both public and private, is \nthat record indicates he really isn't much interested in the kind of \nwork that Senator Craig and I have spent many years pursuing.\n\n  One of the things that struck me earlier this year was that Mr. \nGriles told the Washington Post, in effect, that he had changed. He \nsaid he had matured, he had learned from his past experience. When I \nread about these statements, I was very encouraged. I don't oppose \npeople on philosophical grounds; I don't think that is right. I read \nthese statements and I got the distinct impression that Mr. Griles was \ngoing to work to be more inclusive, collaborative, and more creative in \nlooking at the difficult natural resources issues.\n  He said he was going to be a problem solver who would try to listen \nto all the parties involved and try to take a balanced approach to any \nand all issues.\n  Again, I was encouraged by these comments. Mr. Griles came to my \noffice. I told him about my concerns about his past record, and given \nhis statements I was hoping he had, in fact, changed, and if he would \ngive me some examples. He really didn't have any that day. I said: I \nwill ask you about this when you come for your confirmation hearing.\n  When he came for his confirmation hearing, he was not any more \nforthcoming. I said after the hearing my door would still be open to \nhim and that I hoped he would give me some examples in areas such as \nthe Endangered Species Act that require so much cooperation, that he \nwould come forward with some specific ideas. He has not. He has not \nbeen willing on three separate occasions to show some evidence that he \nwould take a more collaborative, inclusive approach, and that he would \nbe more balanced in his approach to natural resources issues.\n  My concern is that as of now the record indicates the J. Steven \nGriles of the past is going to be back in action after the Senate \nconfirms him.\n  I will talk for a few minutes about that Jay Steven Griles' track \nrecord over 20 years. Over 20 years, again and again, he has placed the \ninterests of powerful special interests above the public. This includes \nthe support for environmentally unsound drilling for oil off the coast \nof California and looking the other way when powerful corporations were \nfined for breaking the environmental laws.\n  It is one thing to try to figure out ways to ensure compliance with \nthe environmental laws; however, it is another thing to not follow \nthrough when these powerful interests have actually been fined for \nviolating the law.\n  I was troubled about those past positions. I told Mr. Griles about \nthat. It is certainly his right to hold those views. I have not made it \na habit of opposing candidates with whom I differ on substantive \nissues. Given those past positions, given his public statements and his \nprivate statements to me that, in fact, he was going to change, it is \ntroubling we have not seen any evidence of it.\n  His record is important. I will give a few examples of that record.\n  During his service with the Reagan administration, Mr. Griles is \nreported to have single-mindedly pushed for an oil lease sale off the \ncoast of California, despite objections from his own Fish and Wildlife \nService biologists. In 1988, he wrote a memo to the Assistant Secretary \nadvising him to change the tone and conclusions of a Fish and Wildlife \nService report citing the specific environmental damage that could be \ncaused by a proposed northern California offshore oil lease. Mr. Griles \nconcluded that memo by stating:\n\n\n[[Page S7578]]\n\n\n       The memorandum is part of the public record and could prove \n     very damaging to this lease sale.\n\n  The subsequent final report on the sale, from Fish and Wildlife, did \nnot refer to any potential environmental harm that could result from \nthe lease sale. Within the year, as Americans know, the Exxon Valdez \ndisaster occurred and, by 1990, the first President Bush declared a \nmoratorium on offshore oil leases, so this lease sale was never \ncompleted. But it is certainly troubling to me that Mr. Griles wanted \nFederal researchers not to report accurate conclusions but to prop up a \ndecision, regardless of the environmental facts.\n  This, in my view, would have been an ideal issue that Mr. Griles \ncould have raised with me and with colleagues and said: Look, there are \na variety of ways that I treat these oil sales differently now, having \nlearned from some of the controversy in the past. Yet he was unwilling \nto say that or anything resembling that.\n  He has also, as far as the public report, indicated that he has no \ninterest in cracking down on the illegal behavior of polluters and \nspecial interests. Of course, that would be a task that he would be \nexpected to perform in this position.\n  Between 1984 and 1987, the House of Representatives reviewed, for \nexample, the internal workings in the Office of Surface Mining. They \nfound that, under his leadership, this office collected only $6.8 \nmillion of an estimated $200 million due in civil penalties for those \nwho broke the environmental laws.\n  Again, I have tried to single out just the areas of the record that \nconcern me the most. There is not a Member of the Senate who is in \nfavor of breaking the environmental laws. Yet this was an instance \nwhere there were violations and they were not followed up. I think that \nis troubling and, in fact, in successive years the percentage of \ncollection of the civil penalties that were owed continued to go down.\n  I am concerned about the past public record, but I would not be here \nmaking the statement that I am tonight if Mr. Griles had said: Look, \nall of us change and here are some approaches that I would take in the \ndays ahead to ensure that we could do the kind of work that Senator \nCraig--I see my friend Senator Burns here as well--that the three of us \nhave sought to do.\n  These natural resources issues are extraordinarily difficult. The \nAmerican people want what I call the win-win. They want to protect our \ntreasures and at the same time they want to be sensitive to local \neconomic needs. It is a lot easier said than done. But Senator Craig \nand Senator Burns and I have teamed up to do just that.\n  I had been hoping that Mr. Griles would offer some specifics, given \nthat he said he had changed, and would indicate he would want to do the \nkind of bipartisan work that we Westerners have done on some of these \nparticularly contentious issues. Unfortunately, on three separate \noccasions, in both public and private, Mr. Griles was unwilling to back \nup his public statements about how he had changed, how he would take a \nmore collaborative approach. So tonight I want to make clear I am \nopposed to the nomination of J. Steven Griles to be Deputy Secretary of \nthe Department of the Interior. My questions have not been answered. My \nreservations about the nominee's commitment to finding common ground \nhave not been resolved.\n  I tell my colleagues, I do not think we can get on top of these \nnatural resources issues without a collaborative approach. Mr. Griles \nhas said he is in favor of it but has not offered any evidence that he \nwill actually do it. With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask for a couple of minutes. Let me also \nask unanimous consent that Senator Frank Murkowski, who is coming to \nthe floor, be allowed to speak for a period of time prior to the \naction. I believe Senator Nelson is here to do the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join with my colleague, Chairman Ron \nWyden, tonight to visit about Steven Griles and the reality that Steven \nis about to become a major operative in the Department of the Interior. \nI stand tonight in full support of the decision of George W. Bush to \nnominate him to become Deputy Secretary. I do that because I know \nSteven Griles and I know he will do it when he looks me in the eye and \nhe looks Senator Wyden in the eye and says he will work in the \ncharacter of the new Secretary, Gale Norton, as it relates to the four \nC's that she has so clearly laid out over the time of her confirmation \nhearings and as, I think, she has clearly demonstrated in the period of \ntime in which she has served our country as our new Secretary of the \nInterior. That is one of consultation, cooperation, and communication \nthat results in conservation of our natural resources to benefit all of \nthe interests of our country. I believe Steven Griles will do that \nfollowing the direction of the Secretary of the Interior.\n  While Ron Wyden and I will disagree a bit, we also understand the \ncritical nature of cooperation, as he has so clearly spelled out, in \nthe collaborative process. The models under which we must make \ndecisions on our public land resources have changed from the days in \nwhich Steven Griles served the Reagan administration and in which \nSteven Griles will now have the privilege of serving the Bush \nadministration. We have tried to pioneer with the concept of a \ncollaborative process. Clearly, the effort Senator Wyden and I launched \nlast year that is now law incorporates within it the idea of bringing \nall of the principals together to sit down to resolve conflict over \nresource issues at the local level and ultimately we believe we can \naspire to that at the national level.\n  Therefore, I stand in favor of Steven Griles becoming our new Deputy \nSecretary at the Department of the Interior and I think he will at the \nend serve us well and I think the record will demonstrate that.\n  Let me say in closing, and I say it in all fairness to our majority \nleader, Tom Daschle, I thank him and I thank Harry Reid for the \ncooperation they have offered to all of us tonight in moving \nexpeditiously some of the nominees that were at the desk or other \nnominees who were just moved out of committee today, both the Armed \nServices Committee and the Interior Committee.\n  It is absolutely critical that the President of the United States be \nallowed to nominate and have people of his choice to serve him in the \nadministration of our Government at the executive level. Tonight we \nmove a great number of people, probably the largest number we have \nmoved to date at one time. That has been because of a cooperative \neffort on the part of the majority leader, Tom Daschle, and all of us \nworking together to make that happen.\n  I hope to achieve our goal that the some 173 who are now before the \nauthorizing committees across the Senate can be brought to hearings, \nheard, voted out of committee, brought to the floor and I hope many of \nthem could be moved before the August recess.\n  A lot of these fine people who have been asked to serve our \nGovernment are men and women who have families and who need to make \ndecisions over whether to leave their families and their children in \nthe schools where they now are or whether they are going to be allowed \nto get them in Washington in time to enroll them in school as it would \nstart in late August or early September. Surely this Senate can operate \nin a reasonable and responsible fashion to do the appropriate hearings, \nto find out if these men and women are clearly qualified, as the \nPresident believes they are, to serve our country at the executive \nlevel, bring them from the committee, bring them to the floor, and \nallow to happen what is happening this evening.\n  When disagreements arise, as they do--as with Senator Wyden and Mr. \nGriles--they are either voted on or are spread upon the Record as a \ntemplate from which to judge the people who will serve in the executive \nbranch, and to hold before them as a constant reminder of what they \npledged to us in their confirmation hearings before the committee. That \nis fair and responsible, and it is the job of the Senate to respond in \nthat fashion.\n  I am extremely pleased that we are able to move expeditiously on a \ngood number tonight to give our President the tools by which to operate \nthe executive branch of Government and to\n\n[[Page S7579]]\n\nallow him, as the citizens of this country have chosen, to govern our \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me congratulate the floor manager \nfor offering the conclusion associated with the Interior appropriations \nbill. It has been a difficult battle, and it has been really tough with \nthe many issues that are subject to rule XVI which often come up in \nthis process.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana and his colleagues on the other \nside. They have done an extraordinary job.\n  My purpose in rising is to recognize an injustice that has been done \nto Steven Griles. The injustice was not on the merits of whether Mr. \nGriles is qualified or not. It is the manner in which his nomination \nwas delayed.\n  I think it is appropriate that the Record note that the intent to \nnominate Mr. Griles occurred on March 9. The nomination was received on \nMay 1. Hearings were held May 16. He was reported favorably by the \nEnergy Committee, which I happened to chair at that time, 18 to 4. I \nrepeat--18 to 4 on May 23, 2001.\n  All of this, of course, occurred before the switch of Senator \nJeffords and, as a consequence, the control of the Senate.\n  Mr. Griles was cleared on the Republican side on May 23. In executive \nsession on May 23, we moved one nomination. On May 24 we moved 19 \nnominations. On May 25 we moved 33 nominations. On May 26 we moved 8 \nnominations. In each case, Mr. Griles was cleared on our side and was \nobjected to by the Democrats, which they have every right to do.\n  But during this period, a unanimous consent agreement was offered to \nallow for 2 hours of debate, and a vote on which the Democrats \nindicated, according to the Record, that they needed 2 hours, with \nconsideration the week we returned from that recess. That was rejected \nby the Democrats, as was the modification that then deleted the time \ncertain and only included the time limitation.\n\n  At that point, it was clear that we would no longer as Republicans \ncontrol the floor, and hence the timing on our return.\n  In executive session on June 14, under Democratic control, we cleared \nthree additional nominations, but the Democrats would not agree to \nGriles. It wasn't agreed to as an issue of the debate on the merits, it \nwas simply an effort to deprive--that is the only conclusion one can \ncome to--the Department of Interior of his services, and hence to the \npublic of this country.\n  As of today, Mr. Griles has been pending 51 days. Again, I refer to \nthe fact that he was reported out of the committee 18 to 4. He is going \nto be voted out tonight on a voice vote. But I think it is appropriate \nto note the manner in which it was handled.\n  I am very disappointed. I, as chairman under the former \nadministration, felt the obligation to respond to the development of \nthe precedents and the officials within the various Cabinet \ndepartments. Under no circumstances had we had a situation similar to \nthis where a nominee was delayed for such an unreasonable amount of \ntime.\n  Who suffers? Perhaps this body suffers in self-examination.\n  Again, I am not arguing the merits concerning issues that my friend \nfrom Oregon or my friend from Florida may have, but clearly, the way \nthis was handled was delay, delay, delay. The public suffered. The \nDepartment of the Interior suffered. Up until a short time ago, the \nDepartment of the Interior had one confirmed position. That was the \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  I think all of us have a responsibility to work together, in spite of \nour political differences, to serve the country.\n  I think it is appropriate that the Record note the reality associated \nwith this nominee. It is my hope that situation is not repeated again \nbecause I think this body bears the responsibility.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend from Florida.\n  I wish the Presiding Officer a good evening, and the rest of my \ncolleagues, and in particular the staff. I hope we get out at a \nreasonable hour.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the administration's policy is \nto try to drill its way out of an energy problem--and that is clearly \nreflected in their nominee for the number two position at the Interior \nDepartment, J. Steven Griles.\n  I have expressed my opposition to Mr. Griles prior to today, in the \nform of an objection to a Senate vote on his nomination.\n  However, based on assurances I received today from Interior Secretary \nNorton--specifically that the agency's upcoming 5-year plan contains no \nnew drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, beyond the disputed area in \nlease sale 181--I have withdrawn my objection to proceeding to a vote.\n  I also met with Mr. Griles this morning. While I respect his \ncommitment to public service, I cannot vote for his nomination.\n  He has a history of advocating for oil and gas exploration off the \ncoasts of both Florida and California.\n  In fact, his record as a former Reagan administration official and an \noil- and gas-industry lobbyist reveals his aggressive support for \nexpanded oil drilling in sensitive waters.\n  Mr. Griles' support for drilling is so forthcoming that in \nbiographical information he supplied the Senate for his confirmation he \nemphasizes his record for helping lease ``more Federal offshore oil and \ngas acreage during 1984-1989 than in any prior period of federal \nleasing activities.''\n  His position is clear. Unfortunately, this position presents a \nserious risk to Florida's economy and environment.\n  I thought I would take this opportunity to clear up for the Senator \nfrom Alaska some of the things he said.\n  The Senator from Alaska should know that this Senator from Florida \ndid not place a hold on the Griles nomination until June 19. That is \njust a matter of some 2\\1/2\\ weeks ago. It became apparent to me--and \nit didn't have anything to do with personalities or politics--on the \nsubstance of the matter that this was something of such importance to \nFlorida on whether or not we were going to have drilling off the coast \nof Florida which would threaten the economy of Florida because of its \nbeaches. I think Florida has the longest coastline of any State in the \ncountry. So much of our economic lifeblood comes from those pristine \nbeaches.\n  When I looked at the substance of the nominee's background I saw that \nhe had been an advocate for offshore oil drilling not only over a \ndecade ago in California but where he stated in his testimony that he \nwas in favor of drilling for the entire 6 million acres of the lease \nsale 181 and what that represented as a threat to Florida in that \noriginal lease sale coming to within 30 miles of Perdido Key, which is \nthe westernmost beach of the State of Florida.\n  It became very clear as a matter of substance to me that it was going \nto be something that was perceived to be--and he was perceived to be--a \nthreat to the economic lifeblood of the State of Florida.\n  Only on June 19 did I write a letter to the majority leader asking \nhim to honor my request, which was a hold on the consideration of the \nnomination.\n  Today, Mr. Griles came to see me. I find him entirely a delightful \nfellow, an engaging fellow, and one with whom I shared exactly this \nstory. I asked him the question: Since the likelihood was that the \nreduced lease sale 181 was in fact going to be approved--the \nadministration apparently had been working it very hard and had the \nvotes, as the vote earlier today showed--what was his intention with \nregard to the drilling in the rest of the eastern Gulf of Mexico \nplanning area?\n  He said since he had not been confirmed that he could not speak with \nthe administration. But he offered that he thought he could get an \nanswer from the administration and get back to me before this vote \noccurred.\n  Indeed, it was within a few minutes that a phone call came in that \nSecretary Norton was requesting to come and see me, of which I gladly \nreceived her. It is the first time I had met her --a very gracious \nlady. And I asked her the same question. And she said: Senator, I want \nto assure you that in the 5-year plan, which is going to be issued next \nweek, there will be no additional lease sales in the 5-year plan. And \nthe 5-year plan that will be issued next week is operative, \neffectively, as law, since a lease cannot be offered for sale or lease \nunless it is in the 5-year plan.\n  That was a little bit of good news. It was on the basis of that that \nI additionally encouraged the majority leader that I thought he was \nright. It is his\n\n[[Page S7580]]\n\nprerogative as majority leader to lift the hold.\n  I shared with Mr. Griles that I was going to vote against his \nnomination because of his history. I am glad that I was in this Chamber \nto hear my friend from Alaska so that he could hear from his colleague \nfrom Florida as to exactly what my intention on the substance of the \nmatter has been.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on this nomination?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am glad we are finally considering the \nnomination of Steve Griles. It has been a long time. I can remember \ngoing through the hearings on the Energy Committee and him being \nreported out of that committee on the 23rd. It has been a long 40-some-\nodd days. It has been too long.\n  It seems that we are asking our Cabinet Secretaries to do their jobs \nby themselves. We are having a hard time getting them any help \ndowntown. I just think that is a wrong thing to do to any \nadministration.\n  I remember when President Clinton first came to town back in 1992, \n1993; whenever we went through the process, I always took the position \nthat each President got his Cabinet members and the people he wanted in \nhis administration because he had been duly elected by the people of \nthis country. So he could move his agenda as he saw fit. We have been \nholding up folks going downtown far too long.\n  Twenty-eight percent of Montana is public land. With the BLM and the \nForest Service and, of course, with the BIA and the Indian lands and \nIndian country, this position is very important. Of course, with Mr. \nGriles coming from a standpoint of multiple use, single use does not \nwork. I think that we can balance the use of our lands. We have had a \ntendency in the last 10 or 15 years to redefine conservation. \nConservation is the wise use of any resource. That has been the driving \nforce on any of our resources found on our public lands and on our \nprivate lands.\n  I have an agricultural background. This position in the Department of \nthe Interior requires a man of not only high integrity and high purpose \nbut also to have guts enough to make a decision. We have gone through \nthese situations where nobody wants to make a decision.\n\n  We had a situation on the Flathead Lake in just finding its level. We \nhad too many cooks in the kitchen and nobody knew who was in charge \nwhen trying to make a decision on what level we wanted to maintain at \nFlathead Lake in northwestern Montana.\n  I know there are some of my colleagues in this body who have some \nreal heartburn with Mr. Griles. In fact, I know there are many \ncolleagues in this body who have heartburn with the words ``multiple \nuse.''\n  But, nonetheless, we who come from the land and the resources--and \nespecially from a resource-based economy--think we understand just how \nimportant renewable resources are. We realize that in oil and gas, it \nis sort of finite--there may not be any more of it made. But on \nrenewables, we should be using conservation practices that consider \nwise use.\n  Tough decisions will have to be made by the Department. We need \nsomeone who is confident in making them and also basing the decisions \non science and common sense.\n  So the reason I support Steve Griles is because he brings outstanding \ncredentials to the job. He served at many levels, both inside and \noutside of Government. I think everybody will find he will be an able \nlistener, and he will also show the cooperation in being a good Deputy \nSecretary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the nomination?\n  Mr. BURNS. Are we ready to vote?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I urge that this nomination be confirmed as \nDeputy Secretary, and on a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the nomination?\n  If not, the question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the \nnomination of J. Steven Griles, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary of \nthe Interior?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the motion to \nreconsider is laid upon the table, and the President will be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7580-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THANKING THE MANAGERS OF INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID.

The International Olympic Committee is going to \nannounce tomorrow which country will host the 2008 summer games. The \ncompetition is fierce. Toronto and Paris are serious contenders. Yet it \nseems likely that Beijing will get the prize.\n  I will speak briefly about this decision because I think there should \nbe some discussion on the Senate floor and the implications. I believe \nChina's authoritarian and oppressive government should not be granted \nthe privilege of hosting the 2008 games. The current Government in \nBeijing does not deserve the international legitimacy and the spotlight \nthat this honor bestows. Its chronic failure to respect human rights \nviolates the fundamental spirit of the Games, and I think it should \ndisqualify Beijing.\n  Many of my colleagues argue that human rights should never be a \nconsideration in determining our trade relations with other countries. \nI don't agree. I do think a government's record on human rights should \nnot be ignored with respect to choosing the site for the Olympics which \nconfers enormous prestige on the host government and which is intended \nto celebrate human dignity and achievement.\n  I have a sense-of-the-Senate amendment because the feeling was it \nwould be inappropriate to do it on an appropriations bill. I do not \nbelieve doing it that way gets the support that it deserves. I know \nthere are Senators who argue that to say the Olympics should not be in \nChina is to politicize this question. If we are silent about this and \nBeijing hosts the Olympics, we are making a political statement. The \npolitical statement we are making is their violation of human rights \ndoes not matter.\n  Either way, it is a political statement. I prefer to speak out for \nhuman rights. The Olympics are first and foremost about sports and the \njoy of athletic competition, but human rights and dignity are also \ncentral to the Olympic ideal. The Olympic charter makes clear ``respect \nfor universal fundamental ethical principles'' are central to the \nOlympic ideal.\n  Look at the State Department report. China's Government record has \nworsened as it committed ``numerous serious abuses\" from raiding home \nchurches, imprisoning Tibetan monks and nuns, locking up Internet \nentrepreneurs, silencing democracy activists, and cracking down on \nFalun Gong.''\n  The Chinese Government continues to hold a number of American \nscholars on suspicious charges of spying. Dr. Gao Zhan has not been \nallowed to contact her husband, her 5-year-old child, both American \ncitizens, or her lawyer or the State Department.\n  This doesn't matter? Moreover, hundreds of thousands of people \nlanguish in jails and prison camps merely because they dared to \npractice their Christian or Buddhist or Islamic faith. These are the \nfacts. Respected international human rights organizations have \ndocumented hundreds of thousands of cases of arbitrary imprisonment, \ntorture, house arrest, or death at the hands of the Government. That is \na fact.\n  What they have done, the brutal crackdown on the Falun Gong is \nunbelievable. This is a harmless Buddhist sect. According to \ninternational media reports, approximately 50,000 of these \npractitioners have been arrested and detained, more than 5,000 have \nbeen sentenced to labor camps without a trial, and hundreds have \nreceived prison sentences after sham trials, show trials. Detainees \nhave often been tortured and scores of practitioners of this faith have \ndied in Government custody. These are facts. This is the empirical \nevidence. Millions of others have been persecuted for so-called crimes \nsuch as, if you are ready, advocating for political pluralism and the \nideals of democracy. Hundreds continue to languish in jail under a \n``counterrevolutionary'' law which the Government repealed 3 years ago. \nSome of them are survivors of the Tiananmen Square massacre.\n  While China signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political \nRights--I remember the Clinton administration has made such a big deal \nof this--the Chinese Government has not\n\n[[Page S7582]]\n\nratified it. Instead, it stepped up its repression of individuals \nseeking to exercise the very rights the covenant is designed to \nprotect. And we do not speak out about this.\n  We make the argument, to grant this country the honor of hosting the \nOlympics, we should not raise questions about this because to raise \nquestions would be to make a political statement about the Olympics. \nIsn't it also making a political statement about the Olympics not to \nraise questions, to legitimize and validate this repression?\n  Chinese courts have sentenced members of the Chinese Democracy Party, \nan open opposition party, to terms of 11, 12, and 13 years for \n``conspiring to subvert state power.'' This is a fact.\n  Charges against these political activists--do you know what they are? \nThey included this: They organized a party--wound up in prison. They \nreceived funds from abroad promoting independent trade unions--they \nwound up in prison. They used e-mails to distribute materials abroad--\nthey wound up in prison. And they gave interviews to foreign \nreporters--they wound up in prison.\n  Here is where the Olympics is going to go. Without a word from our \nGovernment? Without a word from the Senate?\n  Chinese officials have also ruthlessly suppressed dissent from ethnic \nminorities, including Xinjiang and Tibet. According to a report by \nAmnesty International, the Chinese Government has reportedly committed \ngross violations, including widespread use of torture to exact \nconfessions, lengthy prison sentences, and numerous executions. Are we \nnot going to speak up about a government that tortures its citizens and \nthat executes its citizens for no other reason than they have had the \ncourage to speak up for democracy or to try to practice their religion?\n  In an apparent attempt to stop the flow of information overseas about \nthis crackdown, Chinese security officials continue to detain a \nprominent businesswoman, Ms. Rebiya Kadeer, in the Province of \nXinjiang. Her husband is a U.S. resident who broadcasts on Radio Free \nAsia and the Voice of America, championing the cause of people. She was \narrested by the Chinese security forces on her way to meet with members \nof a visiting Congressional staff delegation.\n\n  For years, the same Ms. Kadeer has been praised by the Chinese \nGovernment for her efforts to promote economic development, including a \nproject to help women own their own businesses. She has also been \npraised in the Wall Street Journal for her business savvy. She owned a \ndepartment store in a provincial capital, as well as a profitable \ntrading company. But now she has been put out of business, charged \nwith--here is the charge, Mr. President--``illegally offering state \nsecrets across the border,'' and sentenced to 8 years of hard labor. \nHer son and her secretary were also detained and sent to a labor camp.\n  Given this horrendous record, I do not believe China should be \nrewarded for this sort of repression. I am not a cold war warrior. I am \nnot trying to resurrect the cold war. My father was born in Odessa, \nUkraine. Then, to stay ahead of Czarist Russia, he was a Jewish \nimmigrant. They moved to Habarovsk in the Far East, Siberia, and then \nHarbin, and lived in Pakeen, lived in China, and he came to the United \nStates of America at age 17, in 1914. I am an internationalist.\n  I look forward to the day that Beijing hosts the Olympic games. The \nChinese people are some of the most extraordinary, talented, and \nresourceful people on the planet. I do not for a moment want to bash or \novergeneralize. I dream of a day when I can come to the Senate floor \nand I can celebrate the idea of China hosting the Olympic games. But \nnot now. Not with the persecution, not with the torture, not with the \nmurder of innocent citizens, not with the political oppression, not \nwith the religious persecution, not with what they have done to the \ncountry of Tibet, the people of Tibet.\n  I believe strongly China's authoritarian, repressive Government \nshould not be granted the privilege of hosting the 2008 games. It does \nnot deserve the international legitimacy and spotlight that this honor \nbestows. Instead, this Government's chronic failure to respect human \nrights, I believe, violates the fundamental spirit of the Olympic games \nand should disqualify Beijing.\n  This is perhaps my morning for tilting at windmills because I believe \nthe international committee will probably give China the Olympic Games, \nbut sometimes it is important just to make that statement on the floor \nof the Senate. I believe others should speak out as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7582-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7582-S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN OFFICE ACT\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my \ncosponsorship of S. 570, the Violence Against Women Office Act \nintroduced by my colleague Senator Biden. This bill will further our \nefforts in combating the problem of domestic violence. Domestic \nviolence is not simply a localized, private issue, the ripple effect--\nsocially and economically--from this problem makes it a concern for all \nAmericans.\n  The statistics make my case. The crime of battering occurs every 15 \nseconds in this country. Over 50 percent of women will experience \nphysical violence in an intimate relationship during their lifetime. \nEstimates range from 960,000 incidents of violence against a current or \nformer spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend per year to three million women \nannually who are physically abused by their husband or boyfriend.\n  The Violence Against Women Act is a strong indication of our \ncommitment to address this problem. Any possible action we can take to \nenhance the effectiveness of our government's efforts in this arena \nmust be taken. This bill is one such action.\n  Establishment of the Violence Against Women Office, (VAWO) by statute \nwill provide permanency in our federal efforts to combat domestic \nviolence. This bill will institutionalize the office and will help to \nfulfill the federal government's responsibility to meet the goals \nembodied in the Violence Against Women Act, (VAWA).\n  This office will be located within the U.S. Department of Justice, \nplaced within the Associate Attorney General's Office, and will be led \nby a director appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. In \naddition to running the VAWO, the Director will serve as Special \nCounsel to the Attorney General on all issues related to violence \nagainst women. The office is responsible for the development of policy, \nprograms, public education initiatives, and management of all grant \nprograms funded under the VAWA. I would underscore that this \nlegislation does not contemplate increased staff or require any \nexpenditure of funds beyond that currently appropriated.\n  In the past, the VAWO director has brought visibility and credibility \nto the matter of violence against women, making it an issue of national \nconcern and earning the respect of police, prosecutors, and victim \nservice providers. This precedence should be furthered by establishing \nan office to address violence against women by statute. The Office and \nits Director will reflect the importance that Congress and the \nAdministration place on making this issue a priority for the federal \ngovernment and the country.\n  In addition, this step will insure that succeeding Administrations \nwill continue to fully implement the provisions of the VAWA. An office \nplaced under the direct supervision of the Associate Attorney General \nwill reflect the Justice Department's understanding that non-criminal \njustice system services should be offered as part of a community \ncoordinated response. By employing a specialized knowledge of the best \npractices in the field, a statutory mandate will guarantee that grant \nfunds are well utilized. A strong and visible office is necessary to \nimplement the recommendations embodied in the National Agenda and Call \nto Action on Violence Against Women.\n  I am proud that New Mexico has many dedicated individuals offering \nservices to battered women in our state. The Violence Against Women Act \nhas bolstered their means to provide shelters for women in crisis, get \naccess to legal assistance, and transition out of abusive situations. \nFurther, VAWA funding is provided for educational outreach to medical \nproviders and local law enforcement to increase their abilities to \nidentify and respond in domestic violence cases.\n  Just last year, New Mexico entities received numerous grants as a \nresult of the Violence Against Women Office. These grants included:\n\n[[Page S7583]]\n\n  El Refugio, Inc. of Silver City received $304,931 from the Civil \nLegal Assistance Grant Program, an increase from their 1998 grant of \n$295,596. With these monies, they will be able to continue existing \nproject activities in their legal assistance program from low income \nand indigent battered women.\n  Likewise, The Eight Northern Indian Pueblos, Inc., the Jicarilla \nApache Tribe, the Pueblo of Laguna, and the Santa Ana Pueblo have \ncollectively received $331,593 from the STOP Violence Against Indian \nWomen Discretionary Grant Program. This allocation will be used to \nenhance and maintain current programs aimed at decreasing violence \nagainst women.\n  Since enactment of VAWA, other grants totaling over $1.5 million have \nbeen provided to the City of Albuquerque in support of the Albuquerque \nPolice's Domestic Abuse Response Team (DART), to Santa Fe County for \nimplementation of a judicial oversight program to enhance offender \naccountability, and to Dona Ana County's efforts to expand \nprosecutorial services for victims, DART and La Casa Inc., the local \nbattered women's shelter.\n  This nation-wide problem demands a local response. Federal funding is \nbeing effectively used to leverage existing community-based \norganizations and local law enforcement officials to help prevent and \npersecute domestic violence.\n  Last year I cosponsored the Violence Against Women Act. This year I \nam supporting full funding of VAWA programs for the Justice Department \nprograms and in the Health and Human Services budget, despite the tight \nfiscal constraints and competing priorities for those agencies.\n  Domestic violence is a scourge. We must commit to addressing it. This \nlegislation is one concrete step in the right direction.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7583-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before we adjourned for the Fourth of July \nrecess, we spent two weeks on the Senate floor discussing the Patients \nBill of Rights. I supported the strong, enforceable bill which the \nSenate finally approved on June 29th. After years of consideration and \na hard legislative battle, the bipartisan vote this bill received \nreflects the overwhelming support the bill has from the American \npeople.\n  Over the next several months we will continue to discuss the \nimportance of reforming our health care system to make it more \naffordable and more accessible to the American people. But as we debate \nthe subject, we must not ignore an issue that is often overlooked as a \npublic health problem. I'm talking about gun violence. Because, Mr. \nPresident, accompanying the tremendous human costs of gun violence are \nenormous public health costs that we cannot afford to ignore.\n  According to a 1999 report from the Office of Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention, every day in the United States, 93 people die \nas a result of gunshot wounds and an additional 240 sustain gunshot \ninjuries. The report states that ``the fatality rate is roughly \nequivalent to that associated with HIV infection--a disease that the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention has recognized as an \nepidemic.'' In addition, according to a 1997 study cited by the \nViolence Policy Center, the cost of gunshot wounds exceeded $126 \nbillion in 1992 alone. That same year, the injury cost per bullet sold \nin the United States exceeded $25.\n  So as we in the Senate work to improve health care for all Americans, \nwe should work just as hard to address the loopholes in our gun laws. \nOnly by doing the latter can we reduce the costs to public health that \nresult from gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7583-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BURMA MILITARY PURCHASES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the illegitimate regime in Rangoon has \nonce again shown its true colors. On this bright, sunny morning in \nWashington, I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to gathering \nstorm clouds in Southeast Asia.\n  According to Jane's Defence Weekly, Burma's State Peace and \nDevelopment Council, SPDC, has signed a contract to purchase 10 MiG-29 \nfighter aircraft from the Russian Aircraft-building Corporation. These \nfighters were built in the early 1990s and are being stored at the \nLukhovitsy machine-building plant. The total cost of the 10 MiGs to the \nSPDC is $130 million, 30 percent of which will be paid up front and the \nbalance settled over the next decade.\n  This purchase is troubling for several reasons, and underscores that \ndespite its name the SPDC is neither committed to peace nor the \ndevelopment of Burma. Thailand--and the United States--should be \nconcerned with the acquisition of these aircraft, which boosts the \njunta's capabilities well beyond the 42 Chengdu F-7M and Nanchang A-5C \ncurrently sitting on Burmese runways. Tensions between the Thais and \nthe junta have already spilled over into exchanges of gunfire and \nmortars; an escalation to an air war would be destabilizing to the \nentire region. China may be the only country to view the sale in a \npositive light, as it strengthens the military capability of one its \nstaunchest allies in the region.\n  From drug dealing to the forced use of child soldiers, the Burmese \nmilitary has distinguished itself as a world's leading violator of \nhuman rights and dignity. This purchase serves as evidence that the \nregime is committed to remaining in power at any and all costs. The \ninternational community must now double its efforts to ensure that even \ngreater human rights abuses are not waged against the innocent people \nof Burma by the military, which is corrupt to the core.\n  The acquisition of MiG fighters adds 10 more reasons why the United \nStates should view skeptically the discussions between Rangoon's thugs \nand thieves and Burma's legitimate leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. The \ncontract with Russia sends a signal that despite all the rhetoric and \nfew prisoner releases, the talks may be hollow. What meaningful \nconcessions can the generals make to Suu Kyi if they are arming \nthemselves?\n  The $130 million contract--and where is that money coming from, Mr. \nPresident?--demonstrates yet again that the junta has not made the \nwelfare of the people of Burma a priority. From an escalating HIV/AIDS \ncrisis to forced labor practices, the junta has yet to demonstrate the \npolitical will to tackle the hardships the Burmese face every day.\n  Finally, the sale is an indication that the Russians are willing to \nsell military hardware to anyone, anywhere. We can add Burma to the \ngrowing list, which includes Iran and North Korea, of Russian client \ncountries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7583-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7583-S7584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RACISM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to call attention to racism \nin our society.\n  There are certain moments when we are reminded that it exists, and \nthat it is a very ugly thing. Recently, the Committee of 100, a group \nof prominent Chinese-Americans, published a survey that measured \nattitudes toward Asian-Americans, especially those of Chinese descent. \nIt was the first such comprehensive survey--the group wanted to \nestablish a baseline that can be compared to future studies so that we \ncan determine whether racist attitudes against Chinese-Americans are \nrising or falling.\n  The result of this first survey was distressing. Apparently, one-\nquarter of Americans hold ``very negative attitudes'' toward Chinese-\nAmericans, and one-third think that Chinese-Americans are more likely \nto be loyal to China than to the United States. Stop and think about \nthat: a charge of disloyalty is a sensational accusation when it is \nleveled by one American against another. This survey suggests that 90 \nmillion people in this country accuse millions of their fellow \nAmericans of disloyalty.\n  The same poll also tested attitudes toward Asian-Americans in \ngeneral, with similar results. Twenty-four percent of Americans would \nbe upset if someone in their family married an Asian-American; 23 \npercent would be uncomfortable voting for an Asian-American president; \nand 17 percent would be disappointed if an Asian-American moved into \ntheir neighborhood.\n  Prejudice toward Chinese-Americans, and toward Asian-Americans in \ngeneral, is not unique. Immigrants from all parts of the world have \nbeen stereotyped and reviled at some point in our\n\n[[Page S7584]]\n\nhistory, and many groups continue to face these attitudes today. I \nchose to focus on Chinese-Americans today only because the survey so \nsurprised and concerned me.\n  Chinese immigrants began entering the country in large numbers in the \n1850's. They were initially welcomed in the tight labor market of the \nrapidly expanding West. In fact, American industry brought many of the \nimmigrants from China as contract laborers. Some of these immigrants \ntoiled in gold mines and on the transcontinental railroad. Others \nworked in vegetable and fruit farms in California or on sugar \nplantations in Hawaii. Still others opened grocery stores, laundries, \nand other businesses.\n  But as labor became more plentiful and the gold rush petered out, \npublic sentiment toward these new Americans turned. A campaign to drive \nthe Chinese out of the country was fueled by racist slogans and \ndeveloped , at times, into all-out hysteria. Discriminatory laws and \nboycotts against Chinese labor resulted, along with lynchings and \nbeatings. In 1882, the federal government put an official stamp on this \nracism by passing the Chinese Exclusion Act, which made it illegal for \nChinese people to emigrate to this country. This unprecedented and \nembarrassing law stayed on the books until 1943.\n  Another indignity that immigrants faced was the system of ``anti-\nmiscegenation'' laws against intermarriage. In 1880, California passed \na statute forbidding marriage of a white person to a ``Negro, Mulatto, \nor Mongolian.'' The federal government passed the Cable Act in 1922, \nrevoking the citizenship of any American woman who married an Asian \nman. It wasn't until 1967 that the Supreme Court struck down these \nlaws.\n  I am sorry to report that my own state of Montana was not immune to \nanti-immigrant action. Census data show that in 1870, the Chinese \naccounted for the largest foreign-born population in the state--larger \neven than the Irish. Chinese workers made a particularly significant \ncontribution to the mining town of Butte, but by the 1880's they faced \ndiscrimination and hate attacks. Ads in newspapers appeared with the \nslogan ``Chinese need not apply'' Anti-peddling ordinances were enacted \nagainst Chinese grocers. In fact, the town's fourth mayor rode to \nvictory on the slogan ``The Chinese must go.''\n  There is no single description of a Chinese-American. Some Chinese-\nAmericans were already wealthy and well-educated when they arrived \nhere. Others arrived in penury and followed the American path to \neducation and success. Some Chinese-Americans continue to celebrate \ntheir Chinese origin. Others deny, or have forgotten completely, the \ncultural heritage of their ancestors. Yet all are Americans.\n  Cruz Reynoso, the first Mexican-American to serve on California's \nSupreme Court, put it this way:\n\n       Americans are not now, and never have been, one people \n     linguistically or ethnically. America is a political union--\n     not a cultural, linguistic, religious, or racial union. It is \n     acceptance of our constitutional ideals of democracy, \n     equality, and freedom which acts as a unifier for us as \n     Americans.\n\n  Political scientist Carl Friedrich made a similar point when he wrote \nin 1935: ``To be an American is an ideal, while to be a Frenchman is a \nfact.'' An individual is an American if he or she embraces the founding \npolitical ideals of our Nation.\n  It is the responsibility of all of us, as the elected representatives \nof the American people, to combat racism in our society, to raise \nawareness of how racism damages our nation and our society, to point to \nthe ideals that bind us together as citizens of this great nation. \nThank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7584-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUPPORT FOR THE U.S. COAST GUARD\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the chairman and \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senators Byrd and \nStevens, for working with me and so many others in support of the $92 \nmillion for the U.S. Coast Guard. This funding was included in the 2001 \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations bill we recently passed.\n  The Coast Guard needs this assistance to meet basic operational \nexpenses and fund unexpected fiscal year 2001 budget requirements. We \nmust support the critical services that the Coast Guard performs across \nthe country. By passing this bill, we have demonstrated our strong \nsupport for its missions and will help it stay in the business of \nsaving lives.\n  Known as ``the rescue expert,'' our Coast Guard responds to 40,000 \nsearch and rescue cases each year, saving 3,800 lives. And, though it \nis the rescue and response missions that get the headlines, the Coast \nGuard also is very dedicated to preventing emergencies. The Coast Guard \ninspects all commercial ships--including cargo ships, tankers, and \ncruise ships.\n  There are many other ways that the Coast Guard protects our citizens. \nOne major component of Coast Guard operations is drug interdiction. \nLast year, the Coast Guard seized more than 66 tons of cocaine, with a \nstreet value of $4 billion--that's more than the total operating cost \nof the entire Coast Guard.\n  Perhaps one of the Coast Guard's toughest jobs is the day to day \nenforcement of U.S. immigration law. Coast Guard men and women are \nchallenged daily to carry out their responsibilities with due regard \nfor the law, human dignity, and above all, the safety of human life. It \nis a tough job, and each case is unique. But day in and day out, the \nCoast Guard continues to carry out its duties with professionalism and \na never-ending commitment to those it serves.\n  These are just some of the vital missions the Coast Guard conducts. \nBut the Coast Guard is reaching the point where it is stretched so thin \nand the condition of its equipment is so poor that I fear it will no \nlonger be able to sustain daily operations.\n  When compared to 41 other maritime agencies around the world, the \nships that make up our Coast Guard fleet of cutters are the 38th \noldest. Because the fleet is so old, the Coast Guard has had to spend \ntwice as much money to fix equipment and hull problems. This is a very \nserious problem, Mr. President. It is a problem that does not result \nfrom mismanagement, but rather, it is a problem that has resulted from \na continual lack of adequate funding for our Coast Guard.\n  We need to provide the Coast Guard with the resources necessary so \nthe American people can have the services that they require and \ndeserve. The funding included in the 2001 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill certainly will help keep our Coast Guard afloat. \nAnd, we must remain committed to ensuring that our Coast Guard has \nadequate resources not just now, but well into the future.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on this vital \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7584-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred March 13, \n1998 in San Francisco, California. A gay man, Brian Wilmes, 45, was \nbeaten to death allegedly by another man who yelled anti-gay epithets \nand then fled with a woman. Edgar Mora, 25, was charged with murder.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7584-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7584-S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RURAL TRANSPORTATION\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge a group of \ncourageous young men and women from Canton, MO. They are visiting the \nNation's capital this week.\n  The group's journey began more than a year ago on a two-lane road in \nnortheast Missouri. Seventeen-year-old Kristin Hendrickson was killed \non Highway 61 when her car struck another vehicle head on. A four-lane \nroad with a divider might have saved her life.\n  Kristin was just a few months away from graduation at Canton R-5 High\n\n[[Page S7585]]\n\nSchool. Her unused prom dress hung in her closet, a reminder of how \nfull of life she had been.\n  Kristin's friends tried to make sense of what happened.\n  Determined to make something positive out of this terrible loss, they \nstarted a grassroots movement: Students of Missouri Assisting Rural & \nUrban Transportation, or SMART. Their goal was to ``promote and ensure \nthe safety of rural transportation needs in the State of Missouri.''\n  Many of the students who created SMART graduated a few weeks later, \nbut younger students carried on the work. And those who graduated \nstayed involved as advisors.\n  The group developed four objectives:\n  First, to educate the public on the need to improve local \ntransportation;\n  Second, to grow into other local districts, and then move statewide;\n  Third, to lobby legislators for funding to improve rural \ntransportation; and\n  Fourth, to contact candidates for statewide office for their position \non transportation, and use this information to educate the public.\n  SMART has already become a powerful advocacy group in Missouri. Just \n2 months after the organization was founded, the nonpartisan group made \na presentation at a meeting of the Missouri Highway and Transportation \nCommission. Their members have also addressed the Missouri Governor's \nConference on Transportation. Representatives of the group have met \npersonally with Missouri Governor Bob Holden and members of the \nMissouri General Assembly to encourage additional funding for rural \ntransportation projects.\n  But their greatest victory to date came in January when the Missouri \nDepartment of Transportation announced that it would upgrade more than \n10 miles of highway 61 between Canton and LaGrange to a four-lane road.\n  Although the victory came too late for Kristin, there is no way to \nknow how many lives it will save in the years to come. It would not \nhave happened without the forceful activism of these young people.\n  I am extremely proud of these young people. Not only because of what \nthey accomplished, but because of what they still intend to accomplish. \nThey are not yet satisfied, and we have not heard the last of them.\n  The group continues to organize similar groups throughout Missouri. \nThey have come to Washington this week to encourage Members of Congress \nto support highway safety and to advocate for additional federal \nresources for transportation infrastructure.\n  These committed young people can teach us all a lesson about how to \nget things done. The example they have set is not just valuable for \nother young people, but also for adults who have grown cynical about \nthe political process. These young leaders have shown that you can make \na difference--through action and determination. And I intend to work \nwith them to increase the Federal Government's investment in our \nNation's highways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7585-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

These \nFord vehicles will drive across Missouri from July 18-20, allowing \nMissourians to view them. Ford Motor Company and its employees, \nincluding the men and women of the United Auto Workers, have been \ninstrumental in keeping Missouri's economy strong and our communities \nprosperous. More than 8,000 Missourians are employed in Ford assembly \nplants, credit locations, and dealerships across the state. We are \ngifted with a strong automotive industry in both the Kansas City and \nSt. Louis areas.\n  In addition, at each stop along this tour, Ford is raising money for \nthe Missouri Children's Trust Fund, which is a nonprofit organization \nstarted by the state legislature in 1983. This organization provides \neducation and training to reduce abusive situations for\n\n[[Page S7586]]\n\nchildren, while creating a friendly environment for them to thrive.\n  I am very pleased to welcome this automobile tour to Missouri to \ndemonstrate the quality of these vehicles and highlight the hard work \nand the generosity of Ford's Missouri employees. Thank you to all Ford \nemployees across the State for making me proud to be a \nMissourian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7586-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING INDEPENDENCE, MISSOURI AS AN ALL-AMERICAN CITY\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President. I am proud to take this \nopportunity to honor a very special place in Missouri. On Saturday, \nJune 23rd, Independence, MO, the hometown of Harry S. Truman, was \nselected as an All-American City. The All-American City Competition is \nthe Nation's oldest award for civic accomplishment. The winning cities \nserve as ``models of exemplary grass-roots problem solving.''\n  A 51-member delegation of business interests, community leaders, and \nnonprofit organizations came together to lead Independence's \nparticipation in the competition. While community partnerships are \nsprouting up in cities across America, Independence is in a league of \nits own. Under the leadership of Mayor Ron Stewart, Independence has \nachieved a real sense of unity and community. So many different \nentities with widely divergent interests were recognized for their \nability to successfully work together when faced with civic challenges.\n  Independence's winning presentation, appropriately themed ``Together \nWe Can,'' highlighted recent citywide improvements such as cleaning up \nthe historic Truman district, a sales tax approved by the voters to \nrepair streets and parks, and the William Chrisman High School program \nwhich involved youth in public service programs. Furthermore, even \nIndependence's physical presence at the competition was a united \neffort. Community groups worked together to raise funds to pay for the \ntrip and prepare the presentation. This truly exceptional community \ncertainly deserves its prestigious recognition as an All-American City.\n  Congratulations to Mayor Ron Stewart, participation coordinator Larry \nKaufman, the delegation, and the residents of Independence. Your \npassionate work epitomizes the unlimited possibilities of cooperation. \nThank you for making me proud to be a Missourian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7586-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7586-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7586-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \ndisagrees to the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. 2216) an Act \nmaking supplemental appropriations for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2001, and for other purposes, and agrees to the conference asked by \nthe Senate on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses thereon; and \nappoints the following Members as the managers of the conference on the \npart of the House: Mr. Young of Florida, Mr. Regula, Mr. Lewis of \nCalifornia, Mr. Rogers of Kentucky, Mr. Skeen, Mr. Wolf, Mr. Kolbe, Mr. \nCallahan, Mr. Walsh, Mr. Taylor of North Carolina, Mr. Hobson, Mr. \nIstook, Mr. Bonilla, Mr. Knollenberg, Mr. Obey, Mr. Murtha, Mr. Dicks, \nMr. Sabo, Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Mollohan, Ms. Kaptur, Mr. Visclosky, Mrs. \nLowey, Mr. Serrano, and Mr. Olver\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2330.

A bill to streamline the regulatory processes applicable to \nhome health agencies under the medicare program under title XVIII of \nthe social Security Act and the medicaid program under title XIX of \nsuch Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Home \nHealth Nurse and Patient Act of 2001. This legislation reduces \nadministrative burdens, requires a focused analysis of crucial claims \nprocessing concerns, and provides the opportunity for constructive \nreforms of current inefficiencies.\n  I am especially pleased to be joined by a number of my colleagues, \nincluding Senator Murkowski and Senator Kerry who have been leaders in \nthe regulatory reform movement, and Senator Collins, who has truly been \na champion for preserving access to home health care.\n  Without Senator Collins' leadership on this issue, including the 1999 \nhearing that she held on the issue of regulatory burdens facing the \nhome health care industry, this legislation would not be where it is \ntoday.\n  Senator Collins' legislation to repeal the 15 percent reduction in \npayments to home health care providers is also of the utmost \nimportance, and is the other piece to the puzzle in terms of preserving \naccess to home health care. It is my hope that the Senate Finance \nCommittee will report out her legislation this year.\n  Scope of the problem: As many of my colleagues know, home health care \nprovides compassionate, at-home care to seniors and people with \ndisabilities in cities and towns throughout America.\n  Without it, many patients have no choice but to go to a nursing home, \nor even an emergency room, to get the care they need. For too many home \nhealth patients in my home state of Wisconsin, that day has arrived.\n  Over the past few years, home health agencies around Wisconsin have \nclosed their doors due to massive changes in Medicare, and seniors and \nthe disabled have been forced to go elsewhere for care.\n  In Wisconsin, over 40 Medicare home health providers have shut down \nsince the implementation of the Interim Payment System. Still more have \nshrunken their service areas, stopped accepting Medicare patients, or \nrefused assignment for high cost patients because the payments are \nsimply too low.\n  Over the past 3 years, nearly 30 of Wisconsin's 72 counties have lost \nbetween one and fifteen home health care agencies.\n  Quite frankly, in many parts of Wisconsin, beneficiaries in certain \nareas or with certain diagnoses simply don't have access to home health \ncare.\n  While we have thankfully moved beyond the interim payment system, \nmany home health agencies are facing another cloud in the horizon--an \nimpending nursing shortage and a regulatory system that causes nurses \nto fill out paperwork instead of caring for patients.\n  Burdensome and excessive paperwork often causes nurses to leave the \nhome health care profession, and that can mean that patients stay in \nthe hospital longer than necessary.\n  A 2000 national survey by the Hospital and Healthcare Compensation \nService reported a 21-percent turnover rate for home health registered \nnurses, a 24-percent turnover rate for home health licensed practicing \nnurses, and a 28-percent turnover for home health aides.\n  The actual amount of time that a nurse provides medical care during \nan average ``start of care'' home health visit is approximately 45 \nminutes, only 30 percent of the average 2.5 hours of a nurse's time \nduring the admission visit. According to Price Waterhouse Cooper, every \nhour of patient care time requires 48 minutes of paperwork time for \nhospital-owned home health agencies.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues this advertisement from \nNursing Spectrum magazine.\n  Let me read this line here in bold print: ``No OASIS.''\n  As you can see the main selling point in the advertisement is the \nfact that the job will not force nurses to collect OASIS data. This is \njust one simple example of how the administrative burden we have \nimposed on our nurses.\n  Our legislation takes a common sense approach to developing Medicare \nhome health regulatory policies that are pro-consumer, provider-\nfriendly, and efficient for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices, CMS, to administer.\n  It would also help to ensure that the policies are successful, fair \nand effective because all parties would collaborate on recommendations \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, through joint task \nforces.\n  This legislation would significantly alleviate the burdens that the \nOutcomes Assessment and Information Set (OASIS), the claims process for \npatients who are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid, and certain \naudit and medical review processes have had on home health providers.\n  More importantly, the changes to the OASIS and the claims review \nprocess also would reduce the stress often experienced by home health \npatients due to the complexity of both regulations.\n  It would also create a task force to analyze the appropriateness and \nefficacy of the OASIS patient assessment\n\n[[Page S7592]]\n\ninstrument on Medicare, Medicaid and non-government financed patients.\n  During the study, the OASIS process would be optional for the non-\nMedicare and non-Medicaid patients and inapplicable to those patients \nreceiving personal care services only.\n  Many beneficiaries are also concerned about arbitrary coverage \ndecisions, that leaves beneficiaries in the lurch. That is why this \nlegislation requires the Secretary to form a task force to develop an \nefficient process for the handling of Medicare claims related to \nindividuals also eligible for Medicaid coverage where the claim may not \nbe covered under Medicare.\n  Finally, the Home Health Nurse and Patient Act would create a task \nforce that would engage in a wholesale evaluation of the process used \nby Medicare to select and review home health services' claims.\n  The task force would consider such changes as establishing time \nlimits for claim determinations, the use of alternative dispute \nresolution processes, the development of formal claims sampling \nprotocols, allowing re-submission of corrected claims, and permitting \nphysician assistants and nurse practitioners to establish care plans.\n  I hope to continue to work with both providers and beneficiaries to \ntake a serious look at what refinements need to occur to ensure the \nhome bound elderly and disabled can receive the services they need.\n  Without that fine-tuning, I am quite certain that more home health \nagencies in Wisconsin and across our country will close, leaving some \nof our frailest Medicare beneficiaries without the choice to receive \ncare at home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1170. A bill to make the United States' energy policy toward Iraq \nconsistent with the national security policies of the United States; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I take the opportunity at this time to \nintroduce S. 1170. It is my intention to introduce the following bill \nto make the United States energy policy towards Iraq consistent with \nthe national security policies of the United States.\n  I anticipate that several colleagues will be cosponsoring the bill \nwith me. I will enter into that at a later time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, for some time I have been coming to the \nfloor to speak of a major inconsistency in our foreign and energy \npolicies. I am referring, of course, to our growing dependence on \nimported petroleum from Iraq.\n  We import somewhere between 500,000 to 750,000 barrels of oil from \nIraq every day. About six billion dollars worth last year. Since the \nend of the gulf war, we have also flown some 250,000 sorties to prevent \nSaddam Hussein from threatening our allies in the region. We spend \nbillions every year to keep him in check.\n  We fill up our planes with Iraqi oil, send our pilots to fly over and \nget shot at by Iraqi artillery, and return to fill up on Iraqi oil \nagain.\n  Saddam heats our homes in winter, gets our kids to school each day, \ngets our food from farm to dinner table, and we pay him well to do \nthat.\n  What does he do with the money he gets from oil?\n  He pays his Republican Guards to keep him safe.\n  He supports international terrorist activities; he funds his military \ncampaign against American servicemen and women and those of our allies; \nand he builds an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to threaten \nIsrael and our allies in the Persian Gulf.\n  Am I missing something? Is this good policy? For a number of years \nthe United States has worked closely with the United Nations on the \n``Oil-for-Food'' Program.\n  This program allows Iraq to export petroleum in exchange for funds \nwhich can be used for food, medicine and other humanitarian products.\n  Despite more than $15 billion available for those purposes, Iraq has \nspent only a fraction of that amount on its people's needs.\n  Instead, the Iraqi government spends that money on items of \nquestionable, and often highly suspicious purposes. Why, when billions \nare available to care for the Iraqi people, who are malnourished, sick, \nand have inadequate medical care, would Saddam Hussein withhold the \nmoney available, and choose instead to blame the United States for the \nplight of his people?\n  Why is Iraq reducing the amount it spends on nutrition and pre-natal \ncare, when millions of dollars are available?\n  Why does $200 million of medicine from the UN sit undistributed in \nIraqi warehouses?\n  Why, given the urgent state of humanitarian conditions in Iraq, does \nSaddam Hussein insist that the country's highest priority is the \ndevelopment of sophisticated telecommunications and transportation \ninfrastructure?\n  Why, if there are billions available, and his people are starving, is \nIraq only buying $8 million of food from American farmers each year?\n  I have no quarrel with the Oil-for-Food program. It is a well-\nintentioned effort.\n  I do, however, have a problem with the means in which Saddam Hussein \nhas manipulated our growing dependency on Iraqi oil.\n  Three times since the beginning of the Oil-for-Food program, Saddam \nHussein has threatened or actually halted oil production, disrupting \nenergy markets and sending oil prices skyrocketing.\n  Why do this? Simply to send a message to the United States: ``I have \nleverage over you.''\n  Every time he has done this, he has had his way. We have proven \nourselves addicted to Iraqi oil. Saddam has been proven right: he does \nhave leverage over us.\n  We have placed our energy security in the hands of a madman.\n  The Administration has attempted valiantly to reconstruct a sensible \nmultilateral policy toward Iraq. Those attempts have unfortunately not \nbeen successful.\n  I think that before we can construct a sensible US policy toward \nIraq, we need to end the blatant inconsistency between our energy \npolicy and our foreign policy.\n  We need to end our addiction to Iraqi oil. We need to go ``cold \nturkey.''\n  To that end I have introduced legislation today which would prohibit \nimports from Iraq, whether or not under the Oil for Food Program, until \nit is no longer inconsistent with our national security to resume those \nimports.\n  I hope that this will be an initial step towards a more rational and \ncoherent policy toward Iraq.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1174. A bill to provide for safe incarceration of juvenile \noffenders; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with Senator \nHatch legislation that addresses the problems caused by housing \njuveniles who are prosecuted in the criminal justice system in adult \ncorrectional facilities. In addition, this legislation reauthorizes the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, to maintain the core \nprotections afforded to juveniles who are adjudicated delinquent and \ndetained in the juvenile court system. This two-pronged approach will \nhelp ensure that we treat juvenile offenders with appropriate severity, \nbut also in a way that assists States in providing safe conditions for \ntheir confinement and appropriate access to educational, vocational, \nand health programs that address the needs of juveniles. Improving \nconditions for juveniles today will improve the public safety in the \nfuture, as juveniles who are not exposed to adult inmates have a lower \nlikelihood of committing future crimes.\n  The Justice Department reported last fall that of the 50 States and \nthe District of Columbia, 44 house juveniles in adult jails and \nprisons, and 26 of those do not maintain designated youthful offender \nhousing units. As a nation, we are relying increasingly on adult \nfacilities to house juveniles; for example, according to the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics' survey of jails, there was a 35 percent increase in \nthe number of juveniles held in adult jails between 1994 and 1997. I \nbelieve that there is a will in the States to improve conditions for \nthese juveniles, but resources are often lacking. The Federal \nGovernment can play a useful role by providing funding to States that \nwant to take account of the differences between juveniles and adults.\n  Although many juvenile offenders serving time in adult prisons have \ncommitted extraordinarily serious offenses, others are there because of \nrelatively minor crimes and will be released at a young age. According \nto the\n\n[[Page S7593]]\n\n1999 report of the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention, 22 percent of juveniles committed to State prisons were \nthere because they had committed property crimes, 11 percent because \nthey committed drug-related crimes, and only 25 percent because they \nhad committed murder, kidnaping, sexual assault or assault. Certainly, \nmany of those juveniles can be convinced not to commit further crimes. \nThe social and moral cost of not making that attempt is simply \nincalculable.\n  There is stunning statistical evidence that something is deeply wrong \nwith our current approach to incarcerating juveniles. According to the \nJustice Department, the suicide rate for juveniles held in adult jails \nis five times the rate in the general youth population and eight times \nthe rate for adolescents in juvenile detention facilities. Juveniles in \nadult facilities are also more likely to be violently victimized. \nSexual assault was five times more likely than in juvenile facilities, \nbeatings by staff nearly twice as likely, and attacks with weapons \nalmost 50 percent more common.\n  Moreover, many scholars have questioned whether housing juvenile \noffenders with adult inmates serves our long-term interest in public \nsafety. Multiple studies have shown that youth transferred to the adult \nsystem recidivate at higher rates and with more serious offenses than \nyouth who have committed similar offenses but are retained in the \njuvenile justice system. Some would suggest that we should not be \ntransferring youth to the adult system at all, and I am sympathetic to \nthat view. But that is a decision our States must make, and for now \nmost of our States have taken the contrary position. At the very least, \nthen, we must ensure that juveniles are treated humanely in the \ncriminal justice system to reduce the risks that upon release they will \ncommit additional and more serious crimes. One of the ways we can do \nthat is by helping States improve confinement conditions.\n  The problem this bill is intended to address cannot be described \nsimply through statistics or academic studies. The compelling stories \nof young people who have been part of the corrections system should \ncommand our attention. For example, United Press International and \nnumerous newspapers have reported the story of 15-year-old Robert, who \nwas held in a Kentucky adult jail for the minor infraction of truancy \nand petty theft. One night during his time there, Robert wrapped one \nend of his shirt around his neck, and one around the cell bars, and \nhanged himself. The county has now agreed not to house juveniles and \nadults together.\n  The New York Times magazine last year told the story of Jessica, who \nat 14 was the youngest female in the Florida correctional system and, \nwithin her first few weeks in prison, tried to commit suicide. Jessica \nwas then transferred to a rougher Miami prison where she does not \nreceive psychological counseling or attend class to get her GED. \nJessica has found an extensive surrogate prison family whom she turns \nto for advice. The woman she refers to as ``Mommy'' is serving a life \nsentence for murder. Jessica will be released at age 22 with no \neducation beyond the sixth grade, no job skills, and no life experience \noutside of prison after age 13. Now some will point out that Jessica \ncommitted a serious criminal offense she and two older teenagers robbed \nher grandparents and she deserves harsh punishment. And I agree that we \nmust deal severely with such crimes. But the fact remains that when \nJessica is released from prison she will be 22, with an entire adult \nlife ahead of her. I believe it is critical for the public safety for \nher and others like her to have options besides a life of crime.\n  The Miami Herald reported the stories of Joseph Tejera and Rebekah \nHomerston. Tejera was sentenced as an adult for a burglary offense, and \nwas placed in an adult prison instead of an intensive juvenile program \nwhere he would have received 24-hour supervision, had access to \neducational and other programs, and been surrounded by other juveniles. \nInstead, at the age of 16 and weighing 135 pounds, he was surrounded by \nadult inmates who constantly tried to beat him up. Despite a sterling \ndisciplinary record, he was involved in five fights because of the \naggressiveness of adult inmates. Homerston was the daughter of a father \nserving life in prison for sex crimes against minors and a mother \narrested for theft and drunk driving. At the age of 13, she ran away \nfrom home, and lived on the streets of Fort Lauderdale. At 15, she too \nwas prosecuted and sentenced to a two-year term as an adult after \nvandalizing the city's recreation center. Upon her release from that \nprison term, she was arrested at age 16 for shoplifting a shirt, and is \nnow serving three and a half years in an adult facility for that \noffense. While in prison, she has witnessed numerous suicide attempts.\n  Housing juveniles with adult inmates creates problems not just for \nthe juveniles involved. Such policies also create difficulties for \ncorrections administrators, whose prisons and jails often lack the \nphysical structure, programs, and trained personnel to manage a mixed \njuvenile-adult population. John Gorsik, the head of the Department of \nCorrections in my State of Vermont, has advised that corrections \nofficials from around the nation dislike having juveniles in their \nfacilities. These officials often become responsible for delivering \nthose services to which juveniles are entitled, including special \neducation services. As one report on Youth in the Criminal Justice \nSystem recently recommended: ``Administrative staff and people in \npolicy making positions dealing with youth in the adult system should \nhave education, training, and experience regarding the distinctive \ncharacteristics of children and adolescents.'' This bill would provide \nfor such education and training to make the jobs of corrections \nofficials around the nation easier. In addition, the presence of \njuveniles among adult inmates can lead to increased disciplinary \nproblems and the inculcation of a criminal mentality in young, highly \nimpressionable offenders like Jessica. Our prisons and jails are too \noften becoming schools for young lawbreakers.\n  I would like to explain how this bill addresses confinement \nconditions for juveniles.\n  Title I: The first title of this bill creates a new incentive grant \nprogram for State and local governments and Indian tribes. These grants \ncan be used for the following purposes related to juveniles under the \njurisdiction of an adult criminal court: (a) alter existing \ncorrectional facilities, or develop separate facilities, to provide \nsegregated facilities for them, (b) provide orientation and ongoing \ntraining for correctional staff supervising them, (c) provide monitors \nwho will report on their treatment, and (d) provide them with access to \neducational programs, vocational training, mental and physical health \nassessment and treatment, and drug treatment. Grants can also be used \nto seek alternatives to housing juveniles with adult inmates, including \nthe expansion of juvenile facilities.\n  It is important to note that States that choose not to house \njuveniles who are convicted as adults with adult inmates are still \neligible for grants under this bill. For example, they could use the \nmoney to train staff, or to provide educational or other programs for \njuveniles, or to improve juvenile facilities.\n  Applicants for these grants must provide a detailed plan explaining \nhow they will improve conditions for juveniles in their adult \ncorrections system. Let me be clear: the purpose of this grant program \nis not to fuel a prison-building boom, or to make it easier for States \nto prosecute juveniles as adults, but to improve conditions for \njuveniles. States will need to take this purpose into account in making \ntheir grant proposals. Moreover, to be eligible for a grant, States \nmust have developed guidelines on the appropriate use of force against \nincarcerated juveniles, and must also have prohibited the use of \nelectroshock devices, chemical restraints and punishment, and 4-point \nrestraints. The use of such punishment is inconsistent with our \ncommitments to treating juveniles humanely, and is at variance with the \nvery purpose of this grant program. Every State that can meet the \nrequirements of the grant program will receive funding under \nthis title, and rural representation is guaranteed.\n\n  Title II: The second title of the bill authorizes States to use their \nViolent Offender Incarceration/Truth in Sentencing (VOI/TIS) grant \nmoney to improve the treatment of juveniles under\n\n[[Page S7594]]\n\nthe jurisdiction of the adult criminal justice system. It also offers \nStates an incentive to use a substantial percentage of their VOI/TIS \nmoney for that purpose. States that use 10 percent of their grant money \nto improve juvenile conditions will receive a bonus of 5 percent above \nthe amount to which they are otherwise entitled under that program. The \nmoney can be used to alter existing facilities to provide separate \nspace for juveniles under the jurisdiction of an adult criminal court, \nor to provide training and supervision of corrections officials and \nreporting on juvenile conditions. This title, in conjunction with Title \nI, allows us to make improving conditions for juveniles a national \npriority by working through the States. No State will be forced to use \ntheir money for this purpose or see their funding reduced if they \nchoose not to. But those States that do make a serious effort in this \nregard will be rewarded.\n  Title III: The third title of this bill reauthorizes the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act. Under the JJDPA, States \nreceiving federal funds must maintain core protections for detained \njuveniles. These protections include ``sight'' and ``sound'' separation \nbetween those in the juvenile detention system and adult offenders. \nChildren cannot be put in adjoining cells with adults, or placed in \ncircumstances that allow them to be subject to threats and verbal abuse \nfrom adults in dining halls, recreation areas, and other common spaces. \nIn addition to establishing sight and sound separation, the JJDPA \nprovides three additional core protections: (1) removal of juveniles \nfrom adult jails or lockups, with a 24-hour exception for rural areas \nand other exceptions for travel and weather-related conditions; (2) \ndeinstitutionalization of status offenders; and (3) efforts toward \nreducing the disproportionate confinement of minority youth in the \njuvenile justice system.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Hatch has agreed with me that we need \na straightforward reauthorization of the JJDPA. He and I both worked \nvery hard in the last Congress to reauthorize that law, and our efforts \nwere sidetracked by numerous factors.\n  Title IV: Finally, the fourth title of this bill contains a number of \nprovisions that I would like to highlight today. First, it authorizes \nfunding for rural States and economically distressed communities that \nlack the resources to provide secure custody for juvenile offenders. \nSecond, this title calls for a study on the effect of sentencing \njuvenile drug offenders as adults. Many have raised concerns about the \ntoll taken on some of our communities, especially those in poorer \nareas, by lengthy drug sentences. There is no question that the \nproliferation of illegal drugs over the last 20 years has presented a \nsocial crisis with particularly serious effects on poor and urban \ncommunities. But we need to take a systematic look at whether our \napproach to that crisis has been effective and fair, and the study in \nthis bill should be part of that effort. Third, this bill instructs the \nGeneral Accounting Office to prepare a report on the prevalence and \neffects of the use of electroshock weapons, 4-point restraints, \nchemical restraints, restraint chairs, and solitary confinement against \njuvenile offenders in both the Federal and State corrections systems. I \nam deeply concerned about the disciplinary methods being used against \njuvenile offenders in the U.S., and I believe it is important for \nCongress to receive an accounting of the problem so we can consider \nwhether further legislation in this area is appropriate. Fourth, this \ntitle reauthorizes the Family Unity Demonstration Project, which \nprovides funding for projects allowing eligible prisoners who are \nparents to live in structured, community-based centers with their young \nchildren. A study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that about \ntwo-thirds of incarcerated women were parents of children under 18 \nyears old. According to the White House, on any given day, America is \nhome to 1.5 million children of prisoners. And according to Prison \nFellowship Industries, more than half of the juveniles in custody in \nthe United States had an immediate family member behind bars. This is a \nserious problem, and reauthorizing the Family Unity Demonstration \nProject will help us address it.\n  I would like to thank numerous people who have worked with me and my \nstaff on this proposal: Ken Schatz of the Vermont Children and Family \nCouncil, Marc Schindler and Mark Soler of the Youth Law Center, David \nDoi of the Coalition for Juvenile Justice, Jill Ward from the \nChildren's Defense Fund, and John Gorsik and John Perry at the Vermont \nDepartment of Corrections. Without their help, I would not be able to \nintroduce this bill today.\n  In conclusion, let me say that Congress must act to ensure that \nminimum standards are created in as many States as possible to \nameliorate the problems resulting from sentencing juveniles as adults. \nI think this bipartisan bill accomplishes that goal, and I urge the \nSenate to give its full consideration, and its approval, to this \nproposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. \n        Leahy):\n  S. 1177. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nclarify that the Secretary of Health and Human Services has the \nauthority to treat certain State payments made in an approved \ndemonstration project as medical assistance under the Medicaid program \nfor purposes of a rebate agreement under section 1927 of the Social \nSecurity Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill along with \nSenator Collins, Jeffords and Leahy to provide the states of Maine and \nVermont continued authority to expand access to discounted prescription \ndrugs under Medicaid.\n  Maine has instituted an innovative demonstration program called the \n``Healthy Maine Prescriptions'' program that is leading the way in \nproviding affordable prescription drugs for qualifying Maine residents. \nThis was made possible because Maine is one of two States, along with \nVermont, to have received approval from the Secretary of the Department \nof Health and Human Services for demonstration projects to expand \naccess to prescription drugs under Medicaid. Thousands of individuals \nwith no other prescription drug insurance benefits are enrolled in \nthose programs.\n  The sad truth is, many low-income individuals cannot afford to \npurchase the drugs prescribed by their doctors. The result is that \nthese individuals either split the doses to make them last longer--in \nviolation of doctors' orders; they cut back on other necessities like \nfood or clothing; or they simply decide not to fill the prescription at \nall--surely a prescription for medical disaster.\n  Not only does the inability to pay for medications have an adverse \nand potentially dangerous effect on individuals, it is also a detriment \nto the health care system in general when you consider the number and \nexpense of ailments that could have been prevented with the proper \nprescription drug.\n  The reason why we are introducing this legislation is that, \nunfortunately, last month, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia ruled against the Vermont program, \nfinding that Vermont ``lacked the authority to offer the same \nprescription rebates offered under federal Medicaid insurance'' because \nCongress ``imposed rebate requirements to reduce the cost of \nMedicaid.'' More recently, because of that ruling, a complaint has been \nbrought by PHARMA against the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nprovide injunctive relief in the case of Maine's program.\n  This bill sets forth findings that support the need and legitimacy of \nthe Maine and Vermont programs and provides, in statute, specific \nauthority for these prescription drug discounts for states whose \nwaivers were approved before January 31, 2001.\n  Specifically, the bill amends Section 1115 of the Social Security \nAct--the portion of the act granting the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices the authority to approve demonstration projections. It makes \nclear that any expenditures the state may make under the demonstration \nproject will be treated as payments made under the state plan under \nMedicaid for covered outpatient drugs for purposes of a rebate \nagreement, regardless of whether these expenditures by the state are \noffset or reimbursed, in whole or in part, by rebates received under \nsuch an agreement.\n\n[[Page S7595]]\n\n  It also makes clear that these projects are entirely consistent with \nthe objectives of the Medicaid program. Finally, it states that the \nregular cost-sharing requirements under Medicaid do not have to apply \nin the instance of these programs.\n  One of the objectives of the Medicaid program is ``to enable each \nState, as far as practicable under the conditions in such State, to \nprovide medical assistance on behalf of families with dependent \nchildren and of aged, blind, or disabled individuals, whose income and \nresources are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical \nservices.'' As part of carrying out this objective, every state has \nelected the option of providing prescription drugs as a benefit under \nthe Medicaid program, thereby providing an important means of \nincreasing the access of low-income individuals to drugs prescribed by \ntheir doctors.\n  Furthermore, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act provides the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services with broad authority to approve \ndemonstration projects that are likely to assist in promoting the \nobjectives of the Medicaid program, and waive compliance with any of \nthe state plan requirements of the Medicaid program. The fact of the \nmatter is, Medicaid demonstration projects help promote the objectives \nof the Medicaid program, including obtaining information about options \nfor increasing access to prescription drugs for low-income individuals.\n  If indeed the States are truly laboratories of democracy--and I \nbelieve they are--these demonstration projects deserve the chance to \nwork, to be examined, and to assist those that they are designed to \nassist. And there is no question of the need--in Maine, 50,000 people \nsigned up within the first three weeks of the program.\n  Under the ``Healthy Maine Prescriptions Program,'' Maine provides \nprescription drug discounts of up to 25 percent for all adults with \nincomes of up to 300 percent of the Federal Poverty Level. A second \nbenefit offering discounts of 80 percent of the cost of prescription \ndrugs is available for disabled citizens, and low-income adults over \nthe age of 62 who have an income of up to 185 percent of the Federal \nPoverty Level.\n  During this time when virtually everyone agrees that something must \nbe done to increase access to affordable prescription drugs, we ought \nto be encouraging innovative programs like those in Maine and Vermont. \nTerminating Medicaid demonstration projects prior to their planned \nexpiration dates may result in significant waste of public funds and \nmay be detrimental to those who have come to rely on such projects.\n  We ought to be doing all we can to provide relief to low-income \nAmericans, and at the same time give ourselves the opportunity to \nevaluate what works and what doesn't. Maine and Vermont are to be \ncommended for their efforts, not punished--they are entirely in keeping \nwith the spirit and intent of Medicaid and I hope my colleagues will \nrecognize the value of these demonstration projects.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, and my colleagues from Vermont, Senators \nJeffords and Leahy, in introducing legislation to ensure that States \nlike Maine and Vermont, which have taken the initiative in developing \ninnovative programs to make prescription drugs more affordable for \ntheir citizens, can proceed with these efforts.\n  The last 20 years have witnessed dramatic pharmaceutical \nbreakthroughs that have helped reduce deaths and disability from heart \ndisease, cancer, diabetes, and many other diseases. As a consequence, \nmillions of people around the world are leading longer, healthier, and \nmore productive lives. These new medical miracles, however, often come \nwith hefty price tags, and many people--particularly lower Americans \nwithout prescription drug coverage--are simply priced our of the \nmarket.\n  As so often happens, the States have been the laboratories for reform \nin this area and have come up with some creative ways to address this \nproblem. In January of this year, the Department of Health and Human \nServices granted Maine a waiver under the Medicaid program through \nwhich States can offer drug discounts of up to 25 percent for \nindividuals with incomes up to three times the Federal poverty level. \nOur new Healthy Maine Prescriptions Program includes both this new \ndiscount prescription drug benefit and a separate benefit, financed \nentirely with State funds, that offers discounts of up to 80 percent \nfor low-income elderly and the disabled. Maine began providing benefits \nunder the Healthy Maine Prescription Program on June 1st of this year, \nand by June 26th the Department of Human Services had enrolled 50,460 \nindividuals into the program. Ultimately, it is estimated that 225,000 \nMainers qualify for the program.\n  Unfortunately, however, this important new program has run into a \nstumbling block. Last month, in a case brought by the Pharmaceutical \nResearch and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), a three-judge appeals \npanel ruled that a similar program developed by Vermont ``lacked the \nauthority to offer the same prescription rebates offered under federal \nMedicaid insurance'' because Congress ``imposed rebate requirements to \nreduce the cost of Medicaid.'' The pharmaceutical trade group has \nsubsequently sued the Department of Health and Human Services to block \nthe Maine waiver, and the State of Maine has become a party to that \ncase.\n  The Maine program is different enough from Vermont's to provide a \ndifferent result in court. However, we believe that innovative programs \nlike these, which meet such a clear human need, should be able to \nproceed without having to fight endless legal battles. That is why we \nare introducing legislation today to give the Department of Health and \nHuman Services clear authority to grant States these kinds of waivers, \nwhich will allow them to pursue innovative uses of Medicaid, such as \nthe Health Maine Prescription program. Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Tommy Thompson made creative use of these kinds of Medicaid \nwaivers when he was Governor of Wisconsin. We believe that he should be \nable to continue to do so in his new role as Secretary without the \nchilling effect brought by lawsuits like PhRMA's.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will allow States like Maine \nto proceed with the innovative programs they have developed to meet the \nprescription drug needs of their citizens, and I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring the legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7595-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7595]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 129--ELECTING JERI THOMSON AS SECRETARY OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Lott) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 133\n\n       Whereas in the 1930s and 1940s, the German National \n     Socialist Party, the Nazi Party, methodically orchestrated \n     acts of genocide resulting in the deaths of 6,000,000 Jews \n     and 5,000,000 Gypsies, Poles, Jehovah's Witnesses, political \n     dissidents, physically and mentally disabled people, and \n     homosexuals;\n       Whereas the term Holocaust is used to describe the \n     systematic extermination of Jews and others by the Nazis \n     during the period beginning on March 23, 1933, and ending on \n     May 8, 1945;\n       Whereas in 1946, the International Military Tribunal at \n     Nuremberg declared the Shutzstaffel or SS, the elite corps of \n     the Nazi Party, to be a criminal organization guilty of \n     persecuting and exterminating Jews; of brutalities and \n     killings in the concentration camps; of excesses in the \n     administration of the slave labor program; and of \n     mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war;\n       Whereas Nazi war criminals include any person who ordered, \n     incited, assisted, or otherwise participated in the \n     persecution of any person because of race, religion, national \n     origin, or political opinion, during the Holocaust, under the \n     direction of, or in association with, the Nazi government of \n     Germany;\n       Whereas not all of these Nazi war criminals were brought to \n     justice as required by the Nuremberg Tribunal;\n       Whereas in the 1970s, information began to surface that the \n     United States intelligence community harbored Nazi war \n     criminals, including Klaus Barbie, a Nazi war criminal later \n     found responsible for the torture and death of more than \n     26,000 people, in order to spy on the former Soviet Union and \n     for other purposes;\n       Whereas in 1998, the 105th Congress passed and President \n     Bill Clinton signed into law the ``Nazi War Crimes Disclosure \n     Act'', which provided for the declassification of records \n     relating to Nazi war criminals, Nazi persecution, Nazi war \n     crimes, and Nazi looted assets, including those held by the \n     Central Intelligence Agency;\n       Whereas the Nazi War Criminal Interagency Working Group was \n     convened by Executive Order on January 11, 1999, to (1) \n     locate, identify, inventory, recommend for declassification, \n     and make available all classified Nazi war criminal records, \n     subject to certain specified restrictions; (2) coordinate \n     with Federal agencies and expedite the release of such \n     classified records to the public; and (3) complete work to \n     the greatest extent possible and report to Congress one year \n     after passage of legislation;\n       Whereas the Interagency Working Group recently declassified \n     and analyzed documents of the Office of Strategic Services \n     (OSS), forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, \n     revealing that the United States used Nazi war criminals for \n     intelligence operations against the former Soviet Union;\n       Whereas the declassified documents reveal further that the \n     OSS assisted Nazi war criminals in evading capture and \n     prosecution and, in a few cases, facilitated their \n     immigration and assimilation in the United States; and\n       Whereas it is unknown to what extent the former Soviet \n     Union and other nations used Nazi war criminals for spy \n     operations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Nazi War Criminal Interagency Working Group served \n     the public interest by investigating and publicizing the \n     extent to which the United States used Nazi war criminals for \n     intelligence purposes following the Second World War;\n       (2) the Administration should work with the international \n     intelligence community to expedite the release of information \n     regarding the use of Nazi war criminals as intelligence \n     operatives in the aftermath of the Second World War, \n     especially by the former Soviet Union; and\n       (3) information pertaining to Nazi war criminals should be \n     brought to light so that future generations can learn from \n     the Holocaust.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7596-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7596-S7597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 924.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING COASTAL IMPACT \n                   ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States continues to be reliant on fossil \n     fuels (including crude oil and natural gas) as a source of \n     most of the energy consumed in the country;\n       (2) this reliance is likely to continue for the foreseeable \n     future;\n       (3) about 65 percent of the energy needs of the United \n     States are supplied by oil and natural gas;\n       (4) the United States is becoming increasingly reliant on \n     clean-burning natural gas for electricity generation, home \n     heating and air conditioning, agricultural needs, and \n     essential chemical processes;\n       (5) a large portion of the remaining crude oil and natural \n     gas resources of the country are on Federal land located in \n     the western United States, in Alaska, and off the coastline \n     of the United States;\n       (6) the Gulf of Mexico has proven to be a significant \n     source of oil and natural gas and is predicted to remain a \n     significant source in the immediate future;\n       (7) many States and counties oppose the development of \n     Federal crude oil and natural gas resources within or near \n     the coastline, which opposition results in congressional, \n     Executive, State, or local policies to prevent the \n     development of those resources;\n       (8) actions that prevent the development of certain Federal \n     crude oil and natural gas resources do not lessen the energy \n     needs of the United States or of those States and counties \n     that object to exploration and development for fossil fuels;\n       (9) actions to prevent the development of certain Federal \n     crude oil and natural gas resources focus development \n     pressure on the remaining areas of Federal crude oil and \n     natural gas resources, such as onshore and offshore Alaska, \n     certain onshore areas in the western United States, and the \n     central Gulf of Mexico off the coasts of Alabama, Alaska, \n     Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n       (10) the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources is accompanied by adverse effects on the \n     infrastructure services, public services, and the environment \n     of States, counties, and local communities that host the \n     development of those Federal resources;\n       (11) States, counties, and local communities do not have \n     the power to tax adequately the development of Federal crude \n     oil and natural gas resources, particularly when those \n     development activities occur off the coastline of States that \n     serve as platforms for that development, such as Alabama, \n     Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas;\n       (12) the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.), which \n     governs the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources located onshore, provides, outside the budget\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n     and appropriations processes of the Federal Government, \n     payments to States in which Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources are located in the amount of 50 percent of the \n     direct revenues received from the Federal Government for \n     those resources; and\n       (13) there is no permanent provision in the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), which \n     governs the development of Federal crude oil and natural gas \n     resources located offshore, that authorizes the sharing of a \n     portion of the annual revenues generated from Federal \n     offshore crude oil and natural gas resources with adjacent \n     coastal States that--\n       (A) serve as the platform for that development; and\n       (B) suffer adverse effects on the environment and \n     infrastructure of the States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should provide a significant portion of the Federal \n     offshore mineral revenues to coastal States that permit the \n     development of Federal mineral resources off the coastline, \n     including the States of Alabama, Alaska, Louisiana, \n     Mississippi, and Texas.\n       On page 144, line 15, strike ``analyses'' and insert \n     ``analyses: Provided further, That $1,100,000 shall be made \n     available to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to \n     carry out a competitively awarded grant program for State, \n     local, or other organizations in Maine to fund on-the-ground \n     projects to further Atlantic salmon conservation and \n     restoration efforts, at least $550,000 of which shall be \n     awarded to projects that will also assist industries in Maine \n     affected by the listing of Atlantic salmon under the \n     Endangered Species Act.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7651-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                   committee on governmental affairs\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, roughly 2 years ago, we passed legislation \nto create the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program, Public Law 106-\n51. The President signed the legislation on August 17, 1999. At that \ntime, we were alarmed by a growing crisis in the steel industry. \nTherefore, Congress found that the U.S. steel industry had been \nseverely harmed by a record surge of more than 40 million tons of steel \nimports in 1998. In addition, we found that the surge had resulted in \nthe loss of more than 10,000 steelworker jobs in 1998 and was the \nproximate cause of bankruptcy for three steel companies; that the \nimports had damaged the financial viability of the American steel \nindustry and had affected the willingness of private lenders to make \nloans to the industry; that all of these developments were having \nserious negative effects on communities across the country; and that: a \nstrong steel industry is necessary to the adequate defense preparedness \nof the United States in order to have sufficient steel available to \nbuild the ships, tanks, planes, and armaments necessary for the \nnational defense.\n  In response to this growing crisis, I offered an amendment during an \nappropriations conference to create a loan guarantee fund for domestic \nsteel companies that have experienced layoffs, production losses, or \nfinancial losses since the beginning of the steel import crisis. The \nprogram was intended to provide guarantees of up to 85 percent of the \nprincipal amount of loans to qualified domestic steel companies for \nwhom credit is not otherwise available at reasonable rates, provided \nthere is reasonable assurance of repayment. The legislation provided \nbudget authority of $140 million to support $1 billion in guaranteed \nloans.\n  Since we took that action, the import crisis has deepened. During the \nlast 6 months, the number of steelworkers who have lost their jobs as a \nresult of the crisis has reached 23,500. The number of companies filing \nfor bankruptcy has reached 18. Current import levels remain well above \npre-crisis levels. Moreover, prices for finished steel products have \nfallen below the levels that prevailed during the depths of the 1998 \ncrisis.\n  The U.S. industry has been driven into this state of crisis by \nforeign producers who are generally less efficient and less productive, \nand who in many cases could not compete in the U.S. market or even \nsurvive without Government support. Since 1980, steel producers outside \nof North America have received well over $100 billion in direct \nGovernment subsidies. This does not include the costs incurred by \ncommunist governments in the former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and \nChina in establishing steel industries that would not have existed \nwithout government involvement. Enormous market distortions abroad have \nled to the creation and retention for over a quarter of a century of \nmassive foreign overcapacity--an estimated 275 million tons of excess \ncrude steel capacity, or more than twice the annual steel consumption \nof the United States. The U.S. steel industry, on the other hand, \nrestructured itself in the 1980s and early 1990s, emerging by the mid-\n1990s as the most productive in the world in terms of man-hours \nexpended per ton of steel produced.\n  Unfortunately, the emergency steel loan guarantee program has not \nbeen able to fulfill its mission. By February 28, 2000, the governing \nboard of the program had received 13 loan guarantee applications. Of \nthat number, three were rejected for failure to comply with statutory \nor regulatory requirements and three others were rejected because the \nboard did not find that there was a reasonable assurance of repayment. \nThe board approved the other seven applications, totaling $550,525,500 \nand issued offers of guarantee to the applicant lenders during Fiscal \nYear 2000. Nevertheless, no guaranteed loans were closed and funded \nduring Fiscal Year 2000, and only one guaranteed steel loan--$110 \nmillion to Geneva Steel Company of Vineyard, UT--has closed this year.\n  So, it is time to consider whether we can make changes to the program \nthat will increase its effectiveness without imposing significant \nadditional costs on the Federal Government. I have offered an amendment \nthat has three key features:\n  No. 1, for $100 million worth of guarantee authority, the amendment \nincreases the federal guarantee from 85 percent of principal to as much \nas 95 percent of principal, provided that no steel company gets more \nthan $50 million of these more favorable guarantees. Similarly, for \nanother $100 million worth of guarantee authority, the amendment \nincreases the federal guarantee from 85 percent to as much as 90 \npercent, with a $50 million limit for any single company.\n  No. 2, loans approved after the effective date of the amendment could \nbe structured so that repayment is not completed until 2015--extended \nfrom 2005 under current law.\n  No. 3, the Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Board would have guarantee \nauthority until December 31, 2003--extended from December 31, 2001, \nunder current law.\n  The current balance of budget authority is $127.2 million for $890 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nof unused guarantee authority. The Office of Management and Budget has \nestimated that the existing $127.2 million budget authority balance \nwill be adequate to support the more generous terms and conditions \ncontained in my amendment. The amendment, therefore, does not need to \nprovide any additional budget authority.\n  If we do not take every action we can to support this vital industry, \nI am afraid the wave of bankruptcies will continue. By the end of the \nyear, we may not have much of a steel industry to speak of. What will \nwe then say to those who question our defense preparedness? What will \nwe say to the steelworkers of America, to their families, and to the \ncommunities and consuming industries that depend upon a vital American \nsteel industry? What will we say to the industries that are next on the \nhit lists of foreign predators? Let us stand up for steel in its time \nof need, as the industry has stood up for us in times of war and times \nof peace. Let us not allow imports to eviscerate this efficient and \nproductive industry, an industry that has provided quality jobs to \ngenerations of hardworking Americans.\n  I would like to thank several Senators who helped in crafting this \namendment. Senators Gramm of Texas and Nickles of Oklahoma, as well as \nSenators Voinovich of Ohio and Specter of Pennsylvania, all of whom \ndemonstrated their creativity and flexibility--as well as good humor--\nin coming to agreement. I also wish to thank our distinguished majority \nwhip for his very considerable help and encouragement to all of us.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to the Emergency Steel \nLoan Guarantee Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/12/senate-section/article/S7653-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  Mr. REID.
