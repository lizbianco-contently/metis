Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to support the amendment introduced \nby my colleagues, Senators Craig and Domenici, that I feel is critical \nto the survival of many forests in Wyoming and across the rest of the \nUnited States.\n  This amendment gives the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior the \nability to recognize emergency conditions that exist on many of our \nforests\n\n[[Page S8702]]\n\nand then allows land managers to act to protect them from the extreme \nthreat of wildfire, specifically in those areas suffering from drought \nand high tree mortality resulting from insect infestation, disease, \ninvasive plant species, or other catastrophic natural events. In other \nwords, it allows our land management agencies to clean up their tinder \nboxes before they explode.\n  Wyoming is currently suffering its third year of drought, and our \nneighbor to the north, Montana, is in its fifth year. Colorado, to the \nsouth, had the driest 6 months on record from December to May. And \nSouth Dakota had the driest June on record.\n  More than half the United States is considered to be in drought \nconditions, and some estimates place this drought in the West to \neventually be worse than the Dust Bowl years of the 1930s.\n  When these dry conditions combine with the dense fuel loads that \nexist in our National Forest System, we get a fire season that sets new \nrecords for intensity, for severity, and for extent. In fact, things \nare so hot and dry in Wyoming, we have considered outlawing corduroy \npants.\n  Already, the 2002 fire season has burned more than 6,418,362 acres, \nor, in other words, 10,032 square miles, or--to put it a little \ndifferently--a 4-mile-wide strip from Washington, DC, to Los Angeles, \nCA. And that is packed into the Western States. This has already cost \nour Nation millions of dollars, and it will cost us millions more \nbefore the fire season is over.\n  Earlier this year, Forest Service Chief Dale Bosworth was forced to \nnotify his forest supervisors that his agency expects to meet--and I \nwould suggest it could even exceed--fire suppression costs spent during \nthe historic 2000 fire season, where more than 8.4 millions acres \nburned, and we spent more than $1.3 billion. As was noted earlier, 2002 \nhas already exceeded 2000's year to date acres burned. And in one \nrecent fire--the Rodeo-Chediski fire in eastern Arizona--the Department \nof the Interior and the Federal Emergency Management Agency spent $8 \nmillion per day--$8 million per day--at its peak to fight it.\n  Forests need to be controlled locally. The local forester has the \nbest idea of what is going on, and should have more control over the \ndecisions. Local forester decisions is recognized in the Daschle \nemergency military spending amendment.\n\n  Forests have vast differences. Eastern forests are particularly \ndifferent from western forests. People who have only seen eastern \nforests cannot rationally comment on health in a western forest. People \nof the East cannot understand how little moisture we get in the West.\n  Wyoming gets about an average of 16 inches of rain a year. I think we \nget that much per month out here, sometimes, in Washington. They do not \nunderstand the difference between drought in an arid area and drought \nin a rain forest. Because we have less moisture, the undervegetation is \ndifferent and is dry. It is often pine needles and pine needles easily \ncombust.\n  The West is mostly pine trees instead of hardwoods. The ground is \nsteeply sloped. We have real mountains out in Wyoming, not the rolling \nhills we call mountains here in the East. So the ground is steeply \nsloped and it has ravines; those are small canyons. Some of them are \npretty good-sized canyons.\n  Pines ignite easier than hardwoods because they are more porous and \nare dryer. The trees have needles instead of leaves. When bark beetles \ninfect a pine tree, they kill the pine, but the needles do not drop off \nlike leaves would drop off a normal tree. They dry out. They turn a \nrust color. And they stay on the tree for at least a year. They ignite \neven easier on the tree because the air can get to the needles. Even \nthe bark on the trees is different. Hardwoods have a denser bark, which \nis harder to ignite. Pines have a bark that makes really good tinder. \nIt peels off the tree pretty easily. Even controlled burns, prescribed \nburns--the burns that we set intentionally in the forests--can kill \ntrees; and they do. Many of the prescribed burn fires that we have get \nout of control. These are such tinder boxes that they get out of \ncontrol; they race through and kill the trees, not just the underbrush \nthey are supposed to kill. And a lot of it has to do with the \ndifference in trees.\n  If a beetle-killed pine is at the bottom of a hill, it easily fires \nup all the trees upslope from it. Fire burns up. The fire even creates \na wind that moves the fire faster. If the tree happens to be in a \nsloping ravine--one of these canyons--the ravine creates a wind tunnel \nthat amplifies the speed of the wind. The ravine provides a chimney \neffect that further dries the trees and warms them so they are more \ncombustible, so they can explode.\n  To fight the fires, it is necessary to get the firefighters to the \nfire. If the fire starts to move fast, it is also necessary to be able \nto get the firefighters out quickly. We are eliminating roads in our \nforests, and we are definitely not building any new ones. Roads cannot \nbe built during the fire, particularly in mountainous country.\n  Another difference with crown trees is they have a crown as opposed \nto the hardwood canopy of leaves. When a pine tree catches on fire, the \nflame burns to the point of the tree just like a candlewick. The last \nseveral feet of the tree is called the crown of the tree. When a wind \nis created by the burning trees, and the crown catches on fire, the \ncrown can be separated from the tree and thrown. The wind will throw \nthis crown a half mile to a mile, where it ignites another tree, \nusually at the top already, with that crown being thrown, and so on. So \nthese fires can move extremely rapidly and set multiple fires in \nmultiple areas.\n  There have been changes in western forests. Landscape comparisons, \nwhere we compare old photos with the same locations today, show us \nthere are many more places with trees today than there were 50 and 100 \nyears ago. And where there were trees, there used to be 50 trees to the \nacre--an acre is about the size of a football field--and, today, that \nsame forest area has an average of 200 trees, and sometimes as many as \n1,200 trees.\n  Trees are like most plants. If you plant too many, and you do not \nthin them, the growth of all of them will be stunted. Foresters have \nalso found that pine beetles are more likely to attack trees that are \nalways in shade.\n  Mr. President, 1,200 trees on an acre--the size of a football field--\nare going to be in shade just about all the time. Even 200 trees on an \nacre will be in shade all the time. Pine beetles like that. Trees \nalways in shade are weaker and more susceptible to disease. And they \nare not as useful. They do not provide protection. And should we ever \nallow any to be cut down, they do not provide nearly the wood, either.\n  Trees are also alive. They have a lifespan. It is a tree lifespan, \nnot a human lifespan, so it is often considerably longer, but not \nalways. If we only keep old-growth trees, the forest will die of old \nage, and nothing will be left because they will all die at the same \ntime, or approximately.\n  Why do we have more trees now? Because we do not have as many forest \nfires. Why don't we have more forest fires? Because we have more \nstructures to protect. Why shouldn't we let fires that are distant from \nhomes, then, burn to get rid of the excess trees?\n  First, it is a waste of product that could keep the price of homes \ndown and even provide homes for people who never thought they would be \na part of that American dream.\n  Second, an isolated fire that is allowed to burn becomes a huge \nwildfire and then is very difficult to put out. I will talk about that \na little bit later. The bigger the fire, the harder it is to contain \nand the more dangerous it is to the lives of those fighting it.\n  Third, when ``let it burn'' really worked was only when the western \npopulation lived in tepees. They started a lot of fires. They started \nfires to make meadows for the wild game and to produce some plants that \nneed more open space. But they lived in tepees. And when a fire \nstarted, they folded up their home and they moved out of range. When \nthe fire was over, they found more beautiful land and they started \nagain.\n  Today there isn't that flexibility of moving or of land availability. \nNo one wants their home burned down. In fact, no one even wants to save \ntheir cabin if the only view they will have for the next 20 years is \ncharred and limbless trees. Not only is the view ruined by a fire, but \non the slopes we have out West, erosion starts.\n\n  A woman who owns a Montana logging firm--I love this--does the \naccounting and runs the skidder. That is\n\n[[Page S8703]]\n\nsmall business, when you do all ends of the thing. She owns a Montana \nlogging firm. Two years ago, during those terrible fires we had in \n2000, she testified at a special hearing that Senator Burns and Senator \nCraig held in Billings, MT. One of the big points she made was that \nthere is a difference between what she does and what Mother Nature \ndoes, and it is primarily that her firm respects the rule banning \ntimber activities within 400 feet from a stream. A fire burns right \ndown to the stream, and so the erosion can go clear to the stream.\n  She also brought in a little bit of a sample of some wood. I should \nhave brought it this morning--except we are not supposed to have three-\ndimensional items on the floor--to show what some of these diseased \ntrees are like. It is a core of wood about that big around. It has pine \nbeetles in it, but it still would make homes.\n  So the big difference between having a conscientious firm do the work \nand Mother Nature do the work is that the firm respects the 400 feet \nfrom the stream.\n  I recently ran across a book called ``Fire on the Mountain.'' It is \nby John N. Maclean. Some of you are probably more familiar with his dad \nwho wrote a book that became a movie called ``A River Runs Through \nIt.'' It has some great pictures of the West in there and some great \nfishing pictures as well. I recommend ``A River Runs Through It.'' But \nfor knowledge of fires, I recommend to everybody, even in cities, that \nthey read ``Fire on the Mountain,'' which is very well done. It is from \n5 years' worth of research about a fire on Storm King Mountain in \nColorado. It was in the south canyon and in sight of the I-70 \ninterstate and Canyon Creek Estates. It happened on July 3, 1994, and \nresulted in the death of 14 firefighters, professional firefighters, \nones who had heard about the fires like the one at Mann Gulch. These \nare people who know how fast these things can go but still have trouble \nbelieving it.\n  I want to read a couple of excerpts from this book because it will \ngive us a little bit of an idea of what it is like when one of these \npine forests catches on fire:\n\n       Bryan Scholz, the foreman, felt a pinprick of apprehension. \n     He had seen the same thing a few weeks before, a routine \n     brushfire on a steep slope, and that time the fire had \n     exploded.\n\n  Further on:\n\n       ``I told them what was going to happen,'' Scholz said. \n     ``The folks on the other crews were looking at me like I was \n     some sort of knucklehead. And it happened. The fire made one \n     huge run from bottom to top in a minute, probably a good \n     half-mile square.\n       This is a drought year, Scholz told the crew. ``Learn the \n     lesson now, when we don't have to pay the price.''\n\n  Another example of how these things work:\n\n       A backwash of embers swirled above the flames. If sparks \n     from the backwash eddied down the slope and reach the \n     opposite side of the western drainage, there would be fire on \n     both sides of the gulch. That kind of fire creates its own \n     wind. It turns small flames into a giant fireball, and the \n     fireball races up the gulch faster than a man can run. That \n     had been the story forty-five years earlier in Mann Gulch: A \n     fireball had chased the smoke jumpers.\n\n  This is the progression of the fire. Incidentally, from Canyon Creek \nEstates they could see this little plume of smoke up the mountain that \nwas just a little plume of smoke for 3 days. Nobody paid any attention, \nexcept to worry that it could turn into a big fire.\n  Continuing with an excerpt:\n\n       A jet of flame shot upward and then another, seeming to \n     spring from nowhere. Piles of dead brush, branches and tree \n     trunks ignited. Living brush, tinder-dry from drought, took \n     fire. Darts of flame transformed into bonfires, which merged \n     into a single, expanding flame front. A booming wind raced up \n     the western drainage and struck the flames, pressing the \n     telltale smoke column nearly flat to the ground.\n       Muscular strands of scarlet flame appeared through the \n     smoke. The fire drew back to renew itself, taking in oxygen, \n     and the smoke covered the flames; then the fire surged \n     forward, and again ribbons of flame came into view.\n       The rapid transition of a fire burning in debris and litter \n     to one involving all available fuel, from the ground to the \n     tops of trees. But this falls short of describing the majesty \n     of the occasion.\n       A blowup is one of nature's most powerful forces, \n     equivalent to a mighty storm, avalanche or volcanic eruption. \n     It can sweep away in moments everything before it, the works \n     of nature and of humankind, and sometimes humankind itself. \n     It is destructive, but neither good nor evil; it goes where \n     wind and terrain take it.\n       Blowups happen every fire season across the West when wind, \n     fuel, dryness and terrain come together in the right \n     combination and meet with a spark. The blowup stokes itself \n     by creating its own wind, the hear drawing cooler air by \n     convection. If it happens in a gulch, as is common, the sides \n     of the gulch--in this case the western drainage--act as a \n     chimmey and compress its energy. The flaming tempest can send \n     a smoke column to a height of forty thousand feet or more. \n     The blowup may die out once the gulch is burned or move on \n     and reduce thousands of acres to ash. The blowing-up, in any \n     case, is over in minutes.\n       Flames also made downhill leaps as wind eddies scattered \n     sparks toward the bottom of the V. The eddies carried aloft \n     fistfuls of burning duff, decayed leaves, that is, twigs and \n     other matter.\n       . . . the gorge of the Colorado River, a natural wind \n     funnel, in a phenomenon known as a venturi effect, named for \n     the nineteenth-century physicist G. B. Venturi, who \n     discovered that a throatlike, constricted tube actually will \n     increase the velocity of fluids--\n\n  That is what these ravines do and what the river adds to.\n\n       The transition from a ``normal'' fire to a blowup took \n     seconds.\n\n  I have to tell you, when the fire was out, the trouble wasn't over. \nThe fire happened in July. In September--September 1--a motorist was \ndriving through heavy rain on I-70. That is the interstate visible from \nwhere the fire was, the fire that killed 14 people who were not able to \nget out of the way of how fast that fire raced through this tinder dry \nfuel.\n  On September 1, a motorist, driving through heavy rain on I-70 past \nthe foot of Storm King, heard ``a whoosh like a real strong wind going \nthrough the mountains.'' Hundreds of tons of mud, blackened trees, and \nscorched brush, loosened as a result of the fire, slid down gullies, \nspilled across I-70, and poured into the Colorado River. The mud \nengulfed 30 vehicles. Traffic on I-70 was backed up for 4 miles.\n\n       Several people and vehicles were swept into the river. Two \n     people were injured, but [fortunately] no one was killed.\n\n  That is the aftermath effect of a forest fire. That is another reason \nwe are trying to stop forest fires, particularly in these mountainous \nareas. They destroy the mountain.\n  Now, so far we have been lucky that some of our most dangerous areas \nhaven't caught fire. We have not been lucky in deaths caused by the \nforest fires. I think we are up to 22 deaths so far caused by the \nforest fires this year alone. Not all of those could have been avoided, \nbut many could have been avoided by having healthy forests.\n  We really need a discussion in this country about what a healthy \nforest is. We have to move away from thinking one side wants every tree \ncut down and the other side wants no trees cut down. We have to get to \nwhere we are thinking about the health of the forests and the beauty we \nwant our kids to be able to see in several years.\n  One of the areas I am particularly concerned about is just east of \nCody, WY, on Shoshone National Forest. It lies right next to \nYellowstone National Park. This is an area considered critical habitat \nfor wolves, grizzlies, whooping cranes, elk, bison, mule deer, and \nseveral other animals that spend their time living in Yellowstone \nNational Park when the snows get deep in Wyoming. The area is also home \nto a very severe pine beetle infestation that threatens to ignite and \ncause extreme damage to the park, the forest, and the surrounding \ncommunities.\n  This summer, the National Forest Foundation--these are individuals \nwho believe in putting their money where their mouth is. They put money \ninto a foundation and, occasionally, they get matching money. They do \npilot projects that allow experiments to be done in forests to make \nthem as healthy as possible. I want to challenge any environmental \ngroup out there to share with me their numbers on how much of the money \nthey collect goes to actually solving the problem they are talking \nabout--not going into court actions to stop other people from doing \nanything, but actually working on the problem they are talking about. I \nhighly congratulate the National Forest Foundation for putting their \nmoney where their mouth is. I got to see some of these projects which \nhave created habitat, primarily for elk, and where most importantly \nthey were able to drive down the fire danger, making some beautiful \nareas in Wyoming, getting rid of these rust-colored abominations that \nwe have.\n\n[[Page S8704]]\n\n  A year ago there was a fire in Yellowstone Park. I went to that fire. \nI wanted to see how the new fire plan was working. I have to tell you \nthat every firefighter I talked to was thankful that we have a policy \nnow of stopping the burn as fast as we can. We used to have a policy of \nlet it burn, and then when it started getting in the area of \nstructures, we started to worry about it. Often the flames were maybe \nas high as 150 feet, and we could not do anything about it. So they \nreally like this new policy. It is much safer for them to go in as soon \nas the fire starts and put it out.\n  On the Storm King fire, as I mentioned, they noticed flame from these \nCanyon Creek Estates on July 3, and it was 3 days later before anybody \nwent to take care of the fire. It was just a small plume of smoke quite \na ways from homes. In a matter of a few minutes, it turned and became a \ndanger to those homes. People living at the bottom of one of these \nareas are not very pleased to have a fire going alongside their homes, \neven if it is quite distant.\n  They showed me some of their maps and, from where we were, we could \nactually see what they were talking about. They were concentrating 80 \npercent of their fire suppression efforts on one small part of \nYellowstone Park, right at the edge of the park. The reason they were \ndoing that was there was this big pine beetle infestation next to that. \nIf the fire were to have jumped from Yellowstone into the infestation, \nit would have taken out the lodges and homes and the Boy Scout camp \nbetween there and the reservoir near Cody. They had meetings with \npeople in the lodges and in the homes and made sure they had an \nevacuation plan.\n  If you are a tourist in a lodge, and the owner of the lodge is \nexplaining the forest fire evacuation plan to you, it doesn't make a \nvery relaxing vacation. When you go home, you don't say: There is this \ngreat place outside of Yellowstone I would like you to visit, but you \nhave to watch out for forest fire evacuations.\n  At any rate, the firefighters there wanted to know what I was going \nto do about removing those pine beetle trees because they are a huge \ndanger to the forest. Nobody wants to drive through charred trees to \nget to Yellowstone Park. There are trees that need to be taken out. \nThey run through some ravines. What I talked about could actually \nhappen with the area just outside of Yellowstone Park. Fortunately, we \nhave the National Forest Foundation making some headway at getting a \nlittle bit of corrective work there. But it is nothing compared to what \nwe need.\n  Another example can be found in the Black Hills National Forest, \nwhere forest managers have been extremely lucky not to have to deal \nwith fires in the Beaver Park roadless area or the Norbeck Wildlife \nPreserve. These areas are suffering from severe storm-related damage \nand a mountain pine beetle infestation that has left acres of dead and \ndying trees. When trees are filled with dense and now dry underbrush, \nit creates a terminal condition for the entire ecosystem should \nsomething happen and a fire start in either of these areas. As I said \nearlier, we have been lucky these areas have not already caught fire.\n\n  One fire did get close. The Deadwood fire came within a mile and a \nhalf of these areas. It also burned down some structures. I have to \ngive you a report on that because, most recently, there has been a huge \nmud slide there. Mother Nature didn't observe some of our federal rules \nlimiting erosion.\n  Fortunately, the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, was able to \ninclude language in the emergency supplemental military bill that will \nallow the Black Hills National Forest to address this situation. If we \nare lucky, it will be done in a timely manner and before it is too \nlate. I only hope we can provide that same kind of protection for the \nareas in Wyoming and the other Western States.\n  Back when I was a Boy Scout, one of the requirements I had to \ncomplete to earn the rank of first class on my way to earning the Eagle \nScout Award was to start a campfire using not more than two matches. I \nbecame very good at starting campfires and was well known for winning \nwater-boiling contests at scout camporees. There are a number of tricks \npeople develop in starting campfires. I had my own system that helped \nme to win. But no matter who you are, or what your trick may be, there \nare three basic elements to every fire--oxygen, fuel, and heat.\n  Oxygen comes from the air and is readily available. Fuel is found in \nthe wood, particularly dry wood that burns easily when enough heat is \napplied. Heat comes from a spark, match, possibly friction--not \ncorduroy pants, however. We cannot do anything about oxygen. The fuel--\nwe can do and should do something about fuel. Usually, we cannot do \nanything about heat unless it is manmade.\n  The best way to apply enough heat to start a successful campfire is \nto properly organize the wood in a way that allows flames to climb from \nthe bottom of the firepit where you put the smaller, quick-burning \nsticks and tinder--to the larger, longer burning logs in much the same \nway as someone would climb a ladder one rung at a time. Some of you \nhave fireplaces. That is the way you do it. You put in the small tinder \nand then bigger and then the logs, which you like to see burn--you \ndon't if it is a forest fire.\n  To start a successful fire, I began by carefully putting the wood \nshavings at the bottom of the fire--this would be my light tinder, or \nthe first rung of the fire ladder. I then built a small teepee of \nsticks over my tinder--about the same as a ravine--and I added larger \nsticks, which is what catches fire when everything else happens. The \nlarger pieces of wood go on the top. They draw the heat from the flames \nof the intermediate sticks below them. If you did it correctly, you \nwould start your fire and boil a can of water before anybody else.\n  What does this have to do with our national forests? If you go out on \nthe ground now and look at the density of our national forests, they \nare laid out just like the campfires I was trained to build when I was \na Boy Scout. At the bottom of every forest lies a collection of small \ndried out brush, leaves, and fallen bark. Over this pile of tinder is \nthe next rung, which is made up of small to intermediate trees. These \nintermediate trees are then crowded in between the larger and older \ntrees that make up the top rung, or crown, of the forest fuels ladder.\n  This problem wasn't always as bad as it is now. There was a time when \nMother Nature and the Native Americans took care of thinning the \nforests by regularly starting wildfires. Because the fuel loads weren't \nallowed to grow as dense as they are today, the fuel ladder didn't \nreach all the way to the big trees. Fire would burn up the tinder and \nthin out the intermediate and dead and dying trees. This promoted \nbiodiversity, kept the intensity of the forests down, and in times of \ndrought the competition for limited water resources was dramatically \nless than it is today.\n  We now have forests that historically had 40 or 50 tree stems per \nacre that are now over 200 stems per acre. That is a 300-percent \nincrease.\n  When a fire starts in forests this dense, it quickly climbs the fuel \nladders and races out of control. These crown fires are all but \nimpossible to stop. The heat generated from all rungs burning at once \nsterilizes the soil and leaves nothing but desolation in its wake. This \nis only made worse with the added factor of drought.\n  By adding to the mix stands of dead trees that are as dry and \nvolatile as the tinder on the forest floor, one can imagine the threat \nthis kind of fire can have on the forests and their surrounding \ncommunities, and there are more and more communities, more and more \nhomes, more and more structures.\n  It is a much better conservation practice, therefore, to step in and \nduplicate the effect historic, healthy fires had on our forests by \nusing what we call mechanical thinning. This is a practice where our \nland management agencies hire experienced timber companies to remove \nthe dense underbrush and carry out the smaller and intermediate trees, \nthereby leaving a forest that is healthy, more biodiverse, more fire \nresilient and that has a better mix of older and younger trees so the \nwhole forest does not die off at once.\n  The alternative is to allow Mother Nature to step in and conduct one \nof her catastrophic clearcuts, and when Mother Nature does a clearcut, \nas I already mentioned, she does not care about riparian zones or \nraptor nesting sites.\n\n[[Page S8705]]\n\n  Another factor that must also be considered, now that we are fighting \nthe war on terror, is that these catastrophic clearcuts we are \nsuffering in the West also pose a serious threat to our national \nsecurity. It requires an extreme amount of resources and time to fight \nthese fires and often includes military support. The Air National Guard \nfacilities in Wyoming have been detailed as a support base for \ndispatching air tankers, and a lot of our Nation's airspace is now off \nlimits to anyone but firefighting aircraft.\n  We also have a report that the fires pose a serious threat to our \nNation's communications facilities and to the power grid. There is no \nway to build an extensive communication and power system in the West \nwithout putting some of it on Federal public lands, including forests. \nThe Federal Government is the largest landowner in the West, and we \nhave rights of way crossing all over it. When we have fires such as we \nhave this year, they are, at one time or another, going to threaten our \nNation's utilities.\n  We cannot afford in this day and age to surrender our Nation's \ngreatest assets in fighting the war on terror; namely, its \ntechnological advantage created by our extensive energy and \ncommunications networks.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \namendment and in giving our Federal land managers the tools they need \nto decrease the serious threat of fire on our forests caused by the \ndangerous combination of drought and infestation. It is a very limited \nbill. I would even hesitate to call it a pilot project. But it is \nessential to get started and to get started now. If we can establish \nsome good examples, we can show there can be healthy, beautiful \nforests, the way we envisioned them and dreamed of our kids and our \ngrandkids and our great-grandkids being able to see them. We have to \nhave better stewardship of our forests than what we are doing right \nnow, and it does include cutting some trees.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, for the last good number of minutes, I have \nbeen listening to the Senator from Wyoming talk about forest fires in \nthe making. I must tell you, it was not only fascinating but an issue \nhe and I, as westerners who live in forested States, have grown to \ndevelop some knowledge about over the years.\n  I liken Senator Enzi's speech to Forest Fire 101. It was appropriate, \nand it well defines the great problems we face, not just in the West \ntoday, although conifer trees--or pine trees, fir trees, all that the \nSenator was speaking about--have a different characteristic in fire \nthan do the broadleafs.\n  What is fascinating to me now is that in January, February, and \nMarch, which oftentimes are the dryer seasons on the Eastern seaboard, \nwe are beginning to see more and more fires in our broadleaf forests \nbecause of the fuel loading that is occurring. It starts in the brush \nand in the leaf flora and goes to trees that are not yet leafed out and \ngreen.\n  The point I make, and why we are talking about this as a national \nfire policy and why it is important for the Senate to stop, as we have, \nto focus on the need to reshape public policy in this critical area, is \nit is now of national importance and a magnitude we have never seen \nbefore.\n  We are not used to allocating $2 billion a year of taxpayers' \nresources to fight fires. That is approximately what we are going to be \ndoing this year. It is what we did last year and the year before. The \nAmerican public ought to be scratching their heads a bit and asking a \nfundamental question of their policymakers: Is that justifiable? Can \nwe, as a country, spend $2 billion a year to fight fire in our national \nforests? Why are we doing it?\n  As I have mentioned several times, it is not any longer just to put \nout fires that are burning trees and watershed and wildlife habitat. It \nis to protect an ever-growing number of homes that are built near or in \nthese forested areas because that has become an extremely popular place \nto live for the average American over the course of the last number of \nyears.\n\n  In 1998, we had some very severe fires in Idaho, and in an area with \nwhich I am very familiar--which is where I grew up--in the McCall-\nCascade area of the national forest--the forest supervisor of the \nPayette at that time told me--and I think we lost 200,000 to 250,000 \nacres in two or three fires that joined together that year--that the \ngreatest concern he had and the most resources he used was to keep fire \naway from homes; that while the fires had to be left to burn elsewhere \nbecause they simply did not have the manpower to put them out, they \nfocused on protecting homes.\n  We now call that the urban wildland interface. Over the course of the \nlast several years, we have tried to shape fire policy around that and \ndirect resources toward the thinning and cleaning of forests in the \nimmediate areas around these lovely homes that are being built out in \nthe wooded areas.\n  Is that a national responsibility, is that a Federal responsibility, \nor is that the responsibility of the homeowner? The homeowner builds \nhis or her home next to a national forest anticipating that forest is \ncared for and is not going to erupt in fire and, therefore, will not \nplace their home at risk. So this is a public obligation, in part, to \nsustain a healthy forest, not just for wildlife habitat and watershed \nbut to assure that fires will not sweep across private land and destroy \nprivate property. There is, at least arguably, a liability factor there \nif the forests are not properly maintained.\n  Over time, we have said there is a liability factor if the poor \nmanagement of product on one side of a property line causes damage to \nproperty on the other side of a property line. Out West, we say if you \nharbor noxious weeds on one side of a property line and they move over \nto your neighbor's property, you are liable. County law and State law \nsays so.\n  That is why we have dedicated phenomenal resources over the last \nnumber of years, as this fire situation has grown in our forested \nareas, to protecting homes. Even as we try to protect the home, as the \nSenator from Wyoming has so clearly spelled out, in this fiscal year, \nstarting in mid-June, we have lost now over 2,100 homes across this \ncountry, mostly along the Rocky Mountain front from the White Mountain \nforests of Arizona up through the Rocky Mountain forests of Colorado, \nhomes in California, a few in Oregon, an entire town almost wiped out \nin Arizona, and an entire community threatened in Oregon this year with \nsevere fire.\n\n  It is appropriate, while the Senate would wish to rush on to other \nissues, that we deal with this issue in some form. It is a national \ncrisis. Nowhere can we say that the loss of 6.5 million acres of our \nforested lands is anything but a crisis. As I have said, if this had \nbeen Hurricane Andrew--and I am not sure Andrew did much more damage \nthan that years ago in Florida--we would rush down there with all \npossible Federal resources to help the community, to turn the power on, \nto rebuild the homes, to clean up the debris.\n  Here we step back and say--or at least some do--this is all but an \nact of nature in a normal sense. It is not an act of nature to see \nabnormal fires of the kind the Senator from Wyoming has spoken so \nclearly about, with heat intensities in a multiple of hundreds of \ndegrees hotter than a normal fire, burning everything in its path, \nleaving nothing behind. That is not a normal forest fire. That is an \nabnormal forest fire that is a creation of public policy that has \ndisallowed the thinning and cleaning by mankind that was once done by \nfire, before we eliminated fire from the ecosystem about 90 to 100 \nyears ago.\n  We became extremely active in fire management in a post-World War II \nera when a bunch of young men came home who had learned how to jump out \nof airplanes. They could put a shovel and a pulaski on their back and \nfile in a Ford trimotor out across the forests of the West and jump off \nto a lightning strike and throw a few shovels of dirt on it and put it \nout and they became known as smoke jumpers. That was the beginning of a \nscenario on our western\n\n[[Page S8706]]\n\npublic land forests to put fire out. We got better and better at it \nover the years, to the point where we have nearly eliminated the fires, \nand in eliminating fire, which was the natural cleanser of our forests \nat that time, we did not replace it with a fire-like, man-created \npresence.\n  So the fuels begin to build and the small trees begin to grow and the \nbrush begins to multiply to the point we have added fuels to the acres \nof such magnitude that scientists tell us that they are fuels \nequivalent in Btu's to tens of thousands of gallons of gasoline per \nacre in explosive character or ignitable capability. That is the \nreality of many of these public land forests today.\n  In the White Forests of Arizona, where 100 years ago stood 25 trees \nper acre in a relatively pastoral setting, with grass growing beneath, \nwildlife ambling through, large trees scattered across the landscape, \nin that very forest this June, instead of 25 or 30 trees per acre, \nthere were 700 trees per acre--not big trees, little ones, 6 to 8 \ninches through. A forester would call those weed trees, scrub trees, of \nno value, except to do exactly what the Senator from Wyoming said--\ncreate that ignition of fire that starts from the bottom and sweeps \nupward to the crown of the tree along the natural coning shape of a \nconifer, a fur, a spruce, or a pine.\n  It is the characteristic of fire that we do not want to speak to \ntoday. We just want to ignore it because some groups have said it is \nnatural, leave it alone, turn your back on it, walk away. They want to \nbecause they do not want us in there. It has been in the name of the \nenvironment. You cannot call this anything but now an environmental \ndisaster, a total wipeout of the watershed. You heard the Senator from \nColorado last night talk about it.\n  Now, in Durango, CO, where the land burned but 2\\1/2\\ months ago, the \nrains have now come and the land is sliding down the mountainside and \nblocking the streams and the roads and filling the reservoirs full of \nmuddy ash and water. That is not natural. Had that watershed in the \nDurango area that feeds Denver been allowed to be thinned, cleaned, \nalive and vibrant, fire would not have burned it. The rains would have \ncome. The organic soils would have consumed the water and slowly \nallowed them to trickle down that watershed into the lakes and \nreservoirs that feed the Greater Denver area and its water systems.\n\n  Absent that is nothing but a tragedy. To say that is only a natural \noccurrence and that somehow we have to accept it is wrong. To the \nenvironmentalists who make that argument, I say, shame on you. You \nought to become a copartner in working with us to determine how we can \neffectively thin and clean and restore the health and vibrancy and \nenvironmental integrity of those watersheds so they can support \nwildlife habitat and become the ever-replenishing source of water for \nthe urban areas of the West or anywhere else in our country.\n  Our forests are important to our ecosystem. They are great sequesters \nof carbon that flows out of the air as a result of the human presence \nand great storehouses of water that then feed out over the course of a \nyear, to be used by all of us for life-sustaining purposes, not to \nslide down mountains in the form of mud and ash and broken, burned \ntrees, of a kind that you will now see all over the West this winter in \nthose 6.5 million acres that have already burned. It is a disaster that \nhas happened.\n  To not stand here on the floor and shout out about it would be a \nfailure of anyone who represents those areas. It is not natural. It is \na creation or a result of public policy that has allowed that.\n  I am suggesting we not look backwards and start pointing fingers and \nblame, but we look forward. We know the conditions today. We know the \nproblem. We also know a solution. And every forest scientist will line \nup and tell you exactly what to do. Most all of them will agree. It is \nnot clearcutting. It is not logging. It is not all of the kinds of \nthings that some accuse us of wanting to do. It is a systematic \ncleaning and thinning and restoring of health, and replacing fire with \nman's presence in a fire-like way. By that, I mean the thinning, \ncleaning process.\n  No, I am going to be an advocate of green sales, and I will be an \nadvocate of a logging program as a part of a multiple use base of our \nnational forests, but that is a different argument and a separate issue \nfrom the issue of forest health. When we have hundreds of millions of \nacres of forests across our Nation today, and we know there are over 94 \nmillion acres that are in some form of health problems, and there are \nnearly 30 million that are at crisis today by big kill of the kind that \nthe Senator from Wyoming spoke of, by dead and dying trees, by \nmagnitudes of large fuel loading that creates the kindling of the fires \nthat swept across and are continuing to burn in the West today, that is \nwhere we ought to focus. That is where we are focusing with the Craig-\nDomenici amendment. It is why we have invited all of our colleagues to \nbecome involved and help us work out these problems, instead of simply \nsaying no, because some special interest group said, tell them no.\n  This is not an answer today in the West. No means we will continue to \nburn. And every year we will burn 5 or 6 or 7 million acres--every year \nfor the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years. That is a magnitude of \nenvironmental disaster of the kind this country has never seen. It is \none of which I do not want to be a part; it is one the Senator from \nWyoming does not want to be a part. It is why we are working so hard to \nstrike a compromise, to make a small step forward, to change the \nthinking just a little bit. It is why the Craig-Domenici amendment \nselects urban wildlife interface, municipal watersheds, and an \nunlimited number of those 30 million acres of the critical dead and \ndying--less than 10 million acres in total.\n  We have said, let us make this small step forward and watch the U.S. \nForest Service--bring the cameras in--prove we can thin and we can \nclean and we can reestablish the health of these forests. And it is not \nby someone also's definition of logging. That it is not evil and \nclandestine and somehow a subterfuge to get loggers back into the \nwoods. There is nothing wrong with loggers in the woods, nothing wrong \nat all. But this is not that issue. This is a forest health issue. If \nwe do the right logging in the right areas and we sustain ourselves, we \ncan always have a healthy forest. But today we ignore it.\n  The last 3 years I fought the effort of the former President, \nPresident Clinton, to lock up 94 million acres of roadless lands. I \nguess it was about 1994. We succeeded in stopping him. But he wanted to \nlock it up, again at the advice of some interest groups, and then ask \nAmerica to simply turn their back on it and let it sit.\n\n  That is where all these fires are starting today. Many of the fires \nthat started in the roadless class 3 lands today are the ones that \nswept out of those, into class 2 and class 1 high-quality forest lands, \nand wiped everything out in the process. Because fires of the kind the \nSenator from Wyoming spoke about know no bounds. The Senator said it: \nAll they know is heat, fuel, oxygen. And in a drought-like environment \nwhere humidity is dramatically low, kindling points drop dramatically \nand forests literally do explode.\n  Those who have seen the great forest fires of the West, have seen the \ndevastation, have seen the plumes of smoke going 12,000, 14,000, 20,000 \nfeet into the air and mushrooming like an atomic bomb, will never \nforget what they saw.\n  When the White Forests were burning this year, I was flying from \nDallas to Denver. Somewhere out over northwestern New Mexico we began \nto hit the cloud plume and the smoke rolling off the fires in Arizona. \nThe pilot came on the intercom--we were at 35,000 feet, and the \nairplane was in smoke--and he said to the passengers on the plane: As a \npilot, I have never experienced this before, but we are in the smoke \nfrom the forest fires of Arizona.\n  We were in smoke from that time, as that plane flew out of New \nMexico, across Arizona, and into Colorado, until we landed in Denver \nand then the winds had shifted; Denver had cleared, but from Denver \nsouth, it was all full of smoke.\n  But to have an airline pilot say he had never experienced that, to \nme, is a simple description of the magnitude of these fires, the \nintensity of them, the phenomenal fuel consumption, the tremendous \nrelease of carbon into the air, that smoke cloud that literally spread \nacross the United States at high altitude.\n  That is the crisis to which we speak. Some would like to rush to \njudgment,\n\n[[Page S8707]]\n\nignore these problems, walk away from them. Shame on us if we do. Shame \non us if we do not work to make one small step toward correcting these \nproblems. If we then, by that small step, can prove to the American \npublic that we have done the right thing--and I think we will be able \nto--then will they allow us to make another step? I hope that is the \ncase. That is what we are going to try to get accomplished, and I think \nwe can get that accomplished today. I hope we can.\n  What I would appreciate, if we are wrong, is to have the opposition \ncome speak on the floor and tell us why we are wrong. I have heard no \none come to the floor this year and try to justify the fires that have \nburned across America's public forests this year. In fact, they are \ncowering in the smoke, wishing not to speak out. They will vote for the \nspecial interests that ask them to vote no, but they will not come out \nand openly express that what happened in Arizona and Colorado and \nCalifornia this year, and parts of Oregon, is all but a natural process \nand 2,100 homes and 22 or 25 lives and $2 billion is an acceptable \nreality to America's forest environment.\n  I do not believe that is the case. So, if you can't justify the \ncurrent policy and the current policy is creating that kind of damage, \nthen why not change it just a little bit, enough to prove to the \nAmerican people, and to the critics, that what we are advocating is the \nright and proper direction? Give us the time to do the programs, turn \nthe television cameras on, come out and look at it, and tell America \nwhat we are doing. If it is wrong, we will change it. But I think they \nwill be very surprised, finding out we can thin and we can clean and we \ncan improve the watersheds and you can save the forests and you can \ndefuel them and therefore fireproof them--at least from the kinds of \nfires the Senator from Wyoming and I have been discussing--and allow \nthese forests to return, in some instances, to the natural fires of 100 \nyears ago that burned lightly and ambled across the land, thinning and \ncleaning but not destroying and not burning large trees or the pastoral \nlandscape that Europeans first experienced when they landed on these \nsoils and began to trek across this great continent and through these \nmarvelous forests from east to west.\n\n  It is a legacy. The legacy of today is a legacy of embarrassment, in \nmy opinion. It is a legacy of misguided public policy that has brought \nus to a point of decision. We ought not take it lightly. We certainly \nought to deal with it now rather than later.\n  I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for his \nkind comments but more so for his leadership he is providing on this \nissue. The speech he gave now and the several speeches he has given, I \nknow they have been extemporaneous and from the heart and contain a lot \nof information that people across this country need to have.\n  I congratulate you for your leadership. I also congratulate Senator \nBurns, Senator Domenici, and Senator Allard from Colorado for their \nleadership on this.\n  Yes, it is interesting there are not some speeches against what we \nare doing. We had an interesting vote on the floor yesterday. We had a \ncloture vote. We had a vote to stop discussion, not on this amendment \nbut on the one that is just above it in the food chain. The purpose of \nthat cloture vote was to keep us from getting a vote on having healthy \nforests in this country.\n  I don't want people to think we are filibustering. We are trying to \nget a vote. We want a vote. But there are all kinds of tactics being \nused to stop us from getting a vote on whether we ought to have healthy \nforests, because everybody in this body knows how everybody in this \nbody ought to vote on healthy forests. They ought to vote for them.\n  We need a lot more dialog on what a healthy forest is. I admit that. \nI want to point out the amendment we are talking about is not even of \nsignificance to be a pilot project. It has virtually wiped out the \nchance to really do the job in our forests. But it does give us a \nchance to start showing what could be done in the forests. It is a \nshame anybody thinks that is worth stopping--just a small, pilot \nproject.\n  I did have a couple of other thoughts as the Senator from Idaho was \nspeaking. We have covered quite a bit about what a waste fire is. It \nbrings to mind a little controversy that was happening at the time I \ncame to the Senate, and that was a discussion about timbering. There \nwas a discussion about how we were doing the timbering in this country \nbelow cost.\n  I am the only accountant in the Senate. I love looking at numbers. So \nwhen somebody starts talking about below-cost timber sales, that is in \nmy category, that is something in which I am interested. So I took a \nlook, to see how much it was costing us, as American taxpayers, to have \ntimbering in the national forests. I saw some of the greatest \ngymnastics of accounting I have ever seen. We are taking corporations \napart right now for their bad accounting--and they should be, if they \nare doing it wrong. But, by golly, somebody ought to take a look at the \nGovernment accounting while they are at it. They ought to take a look \nat timbering and the terrible accounting that was done on that.\n  You know, you really should not be able to take all of the costs of a \nnational forest, which include a whole variety of different things and \nare supposed to include a whole variety of different activities, some \nof which are recreation. Did you know that recreation has costs? We \nprovide a lot of services to people who are recreating in the national \nforests, and we should. But we should not take those costs of \nrecreating and charge them to timbering, to show that it is a bad deal.\n  Let me tell you what kind of a bad deal we have going right now. \nRight now, we are talking about hiring a whole bunch of Federal \nemployees to go in and clean up forests. There is a whole bunch of \npeople out there who are already experienced at doing this. Yes, if you \ngo back a few years in the methods they use, you can question some of \nthose methods. We need to make sure those methods never happen again. \nBut there is a right way to do it, and there are people out there who \nknow the right way to do it, and do it the right way. Instead of having \nto pay for the whole job and throwing away whatever is taken out of the \nforests, they would pay for that right to cut out some of this dead \ntimber.\n  Some of this has already happened, over by Rapid City. The forests \ncome right up over against the city, and they were worried about it \nburning the city up, so they hired some people to come in and do some \nlogging. They hired another crew to come in and clean out the \nunderbrush. The ones who did the logging were from a little town in \nWyoming. They were from Sheridan, WY. Do you know what they had to say \nto me when they found out that a second crew came in to clean out the \nunderbrush after they did the logging? They said: We could have done \nboth jobs for almost the same cost because the setting up costs money.\n\n  We are doing some really poor stewardship things in this country by \nnot having a great dialog and getting the people involved who know how \nto do the things, because they have done them. There are jobs out there \nthat could be done with credits for the lumber that might be usable. I \nhave to tell you a little bit about the lumber that might be usable.\n  It used to be that you had to have a pretty big tree to get anything \nusable for housing. There is an innovative company in Sheridan, WY, I \nlearned about after the problem over by Rapid City. They are able to \ntake the core of small trees and laminate them together to make beams \nfor houses, 2 by 4's for houses, tabletops. They have some phenomenal \ningenuity, and they have some products that will be released shortly--\nagain, with bits and pieces of very small trees. These are small \nbusinesses.\n  I am really proud of small businesses in this country because I know \nthat is where the ingenuity of the Nation comes from. If a company gets \na really good idea, they may be bought out by a bigger company. The \nstart of these ideas usually comes from one person having a great idea, \nbeing willing to put their money where their mouth is, take on all the \nrisks for it, and prove that the product will work. We have several of \nthose very small operations in Wyoming. You can take almost anything \nyou can call wood and put it to\n\n[[Page S8708]]\n\nuse in something that will drive down housing costs and make some \nbeautiful features. We need to be doing that. As I mentioned, they are \npaid to cut the trees, but they are paid to clean up the forests. So if \nyou want to save a little bit of money, put people to work, and make \nsure we don't have the terrible waste because of fires, that is how we \ncan do it.\n  I hope everyone will support this amendment. It is not the amendment \nI would offer. It is far too small. It doesn't begin to take care of \nthe problem. But I ask that you support the amendment and consider all \nof these things we have been saying. At least give some \ncounterarguments, if there are any counterarguments. When we do these \ncloture amendments which are designed to eliminate this amendment \nwithout a vote, I hope everybody will continue to oppose that too.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8708-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8708-S8710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, very shortly we will be back on the \nsubject of homeland security. As this debate on homeland security goes \non, I hope no one will forget that it is being held in the shadows of \nthe fallen towers of the World Trade Center.\n  The smoldering fires may have gone out, the acrid smell may no longer \nburn our nostrils, the strains of ``Amazing Grace'' from the bagpipes \nmay no longer fill the air, but, make no mistake about it, the need to \nprotect this country and prevent this from ever happening again is just \nas urgent.\n  How does the Senate meet this, one of the greatest challenges of our \ntime? I will tell you.\n  We talk and talk and talk. Then we pause to go out on the steps of \nthe Capitol to sing ``God Bless America'' with our best profile to the \ncamera. Then we come back inside and show our worst profile to the \ncountry.\n  I have not seen many cloture resolutions I did not like. I can't \nremember the last time I voted against one because I am almost always \nin favor of speeding things up around here.\n  Too often, the Senate reminds me of Will Shakespeare's words:\n\n       Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow\n       Creeps in this petty pace from day to day.\n\n  But the cloture vote that is before us now is one that I cannot \nsupport. We have wasted so many precious days, days that we could ill \nafford to waste, days that gave our enemies more time to plot their \nnext attack. And now, all of a sudden, we want to invoke cloture to \nstop the debate in its tracks.\n  Well, I will vote ``no.'' Because, make no mistake about it, invoking \ncloture will prevent this Senate from having a choice, a choice between \na bill the President will sign and one that he will veto.\n  We must give the President the flexibility to respond to terrorism on \na moment's notice. He has to be able to shift resources, including \npersonnel, at the blink of an eye.\n  So why do we hold so dear a personnel system that was created in 1883 \nand is as outdated as an ox-cart on an expressway?\n  I will tell you why. Because by keeping the status quo, there are \nvotes to be had and soft money to be pocketed. That is the dirty little \nsecret.\n  When the civil service was established well over a century ago, it \nhad a worthy goal--to create a professional work force that was free of \npolitical cronyism.\n  Back then, it was valid. But too often in government we pass laws to \nfix the problems of the moment and then we keep those laws on the books \nfor years and years without ever following up to see if they are still \nneeded.\n  The truth of the matter is that a solution from the 19th century is \nposing a problem in the 21st, especially when this country is \nthreatened in such a different and sinister way.\n  Presently, we are operating under a system of governmental gout and \npersonnel paralysis.\n  Despite its name, our civil service system has nothing to do with \ncivility. It offers little reward for good workers. It provides lots of \ncover for bad workers.\n  Hiring a new federal employee can take 5 months--5 months. Firing a \nbad worker takes more than a year--if it is even allowable--because of \nthe mountains of paper work, hearings, and appeals.\n  A Federal worker caught drunk on the job can't be fired for 30 days, \nand then he has the right to insist on endless appeals.\n  Productivity should be the name of the game. And we lose productivity \nwhen bad folks hold onto jobs forever or when jobs go unfilled for \nmonths.\n  It is no wonder there is resentment among out many good employees. I \nwould be resentful, too, if I watched bad workers kept on the payroll \nand given the same pay raises by managers who are intimidated by the \ncomplicated process of firing or even disciplining them.\n  A few years ago, there was a best selling book entitled, ``The Death \nof Common Sense,'' written by a man named Phillip Howard.\n  I liked it so well and thought it was so on target that I gave all my \nagency heads a copy and had them read it. Then, I had Mr. Howard come \nto Georgia and speak to all of them.\n  Its thesis was that ``universal requirements that leave no room for \njudgment are almost never fair, even when the sole point is to assure \nfairness,'' to use his very words. It is still very timely and even \nmore pertinent to the Federal Government than to State government.\n  President Bush has called his efforts to bring security to our Nation \nand justice to our enemies a ``relentless march.''\n  This Senator is ready to fall into formation with our President's \n``relentless march.''\n  Because when it comes to protecting the jobs of Federal workers or \nprotecting the lives of American citizens, I know where I stand.\n  This is a country with 8,500 miles of border; a country that 500 \nmillion people enter each year; a country where 16 million containers a \nyear enter our ports from foreign countries, and where more than 1.2 \nmillion international flights occur.\n  The daunting task of securing this country is almost \nincomprehensible. Let's not make it more difficult by tying this \nPresident's hands and the hands of every President who comes after him.\n  Why are some automatically assuming that the folks who will run this \nDepartment will abuse their positions and mistreat Federal employees?\n  Instead of assuming the worst, why aren't we seeking to create the \nstrongest, most efficient Department we can create?\n  And don't forget this: Many previous Presidents--beginning with \nPresident John F. Kennedy--have found it necessary to exempt agencies \nfrom unionization and collective bargaining systems when it was in the \ninterest of national security.\n  Dozens of Federal agencies are currently not covered by the Federal \nLabor Management Relations Act: the CIA, the FBI, the Secret Service, \nthe air marshals within the FAA, and the list goes on. And yet the tens \nof thousands of employees in these agencies have been treated fairly \nand well.\n  Today, there are some 800 pages in the Federal Code that already \ngenerously guarantee rights, benefits and protections for employees--\n800 pages worth.\n  Now, I respect and thank the many good, hard-working Federal \nemployees. And I have tried to imagine myself in these workers' places \nat this particular time in history.\n  I am an old believer in that line by that wonderful Georgia \nsongwriter, Joe South, ``Before you abuse, criticize or accuse, walk a \nmile in my shoes.''\n  But perhaps it is because I have worked for $3 a day and was glad to \nhave a job that I find their union bosses' refusal to budge for the \ngreater good of this country so surprising.\n  Union politics may be important, but it should never take the place \nof national security. We are at a most serious time in the history of \nthis land. Our country, our people are in mortal danger.\n  And as I look at what is transpiring around me, this old history \nteacher cannot help but think about what the timid and indecisive \nNeville Chamberlain was told by a Member of Parliament as he was being \ndismissed as\n\n[[Page S8709]]\n\nthe Prime Minister of Great Britain. ``You have sat too long for the \ngood that you have done,'' the Member told him. ``You have sat too long \nfor the good that you have done.''\n  I am sorry to say it, but on this question of homeland security, I \nbelieve that most Americans think that this Senate has sat too long for \nthe good that we have done.\n  And as Chamberlain slunk away that historic day, the crowd shouted \nafter him, ``Go, go, go.''\n  Then, you remember, Winston Churchill, who had been a voice in the \nwilderness warning for years about the threat of Hitler, became Prime \nMinister.\n  And in that famous speech to Parliament in May of 1940, he uttered \nthose famous words, ``I have nothing to offer but blood, tears, toil, \nand sweat.''\n  Madam President, what does this Senate have to offer? What do we have \nto offer in this time of crisis? How about a little bipartisanship, \nperhaps? That is not too much to ask, is it, compared to blood, tears, \ntoil, and sweat?\n  Because, as Churchill continued in that speech, ``We have before us \nan ordeal of the most grievous kind.'' We certainly have that today, an \nordeal of the most grievous kind.\n  Churchill went on:\n\n       We have before us many long months of struggle and of \n     suffering. You ask what is our policy?\n       I will say: It is to wage war, by sea, land and air with \n     all our might and with all the strength that God can give us; \n     to wage war against a monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in \n     the dark, lamentable catalogue of human crime. That is our \n     policy.\n       You ask what is our aim? I can answer in one word--\n     victory--victory at all costs, victory in spite of all \n     terror, however long and hard the road may be; for without \n     victory there is no survival. Without victory, there is no \n     survival.\n\n  And then Churchill said this:\n\n       At this time I feel entitled to claim the aid of all, and I \n     say ``Come, then let us go forward together with our united \n     strength.''\n\n  Then, Clement Attlee, the leader of the opposing Labor Party, joined \nwith Churchill as his Deputy Prime Minister and they worked together \nduring the course of the war.\n  Why can't we have something like that around here now? Is that too \nmuch to ask when we are in a death struggle for the soul of mankind?\n  So, Madam President, I have made my choice. When it comes to choosing \nbetween an aged, arthritic civil service system filled with stumbling \nblocks and booby traps, or an agile agency that is nimble and \nresponsive on the other, this American stands with his President.\n  I have made my choice. When it comes to choosing between real \nhomeland security that protects somebody's life or homebound insecurity \nthat protects somebody's job, this American stands with his President.\n  Deep down, I know that I am not the only one on my side of the aisle \nwho feels this way. And I hope that I will not be the only one on my \nside of the aisle who votes with the President.\n  Seldom has there been--on any issue--a greater need for united, \nbipartisan support to make that ``relentless march'' to bring security \nto our Nation and justice to our enemies.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I have been in Congress for 24 years, and \nI have never heard a better speech. I have never heard a clearer \nstatement of principle. I congratulate the Senator from Georgia.\n  Tomorrow, the Senator from Georgia and I will announce the completion \nof an effort we have had underway for several weeks. We will try to \nlook at concerns about the President's bill that have been raised in \nthe House, we will try to look at concerns that have been raised in the \nSenate, we will try to look at changes that were made in the House bill \nand the Senate bill, and even try to come up with a bill that addresses \nthose concerns, but does it in such a way as to protect the President's \nability to fight and to win this war on terrorism.\n  Also, Madam President, let me make it clear: When 9/11 happened and \nthe President decided he wanted to create a new independent agency by \ntaking parts of the Government that were not working together, that \nwere not communicating effectively, and putting them into a coherent \nwhole, I would have thought 100 Members of the Senate would have \nsupported that effort.\n  I was wrong. If anybody had told me that in light of 9/11, the death \nof thousands of our people and the imminent danger we face every day \nthat we would have an effort in the Senate to actually take power away \nfrom the President. This is power that President Carter had, power that \nPresident Reagan had, power that President Bush had, power that \nPresident Clinton had, and power that President Bush has today, I \nwouldn't have believed it.\n  Who would believe that a bill that could not have been passed before \n9/11, a bill that literally strips away the power of the President to \ndesignate a national emergency and in the process waive work rules that \nimpede efficiency and jeopardize lives? Who would have believed, after \nthousands of our citizens were dead, after millions of our citizens are \nin danger, that the Senate would come forward with a bill that says: \nWhat is our response to 9/11? Our response is the President has too \nmany national security powers.\n  That is exactly what the Lieberman bill does.\n  Incredibly, the President today has the power, in the name of \nnational security, to set aside union work rules.\n  The majority leader said yesterday:\n\n       Show me one time in history when the circumstances \n     threatening our country demanded we forgo the protections \n     built into laws for Federal workers.\n\n  Well, let me give you, very quickly, some concrete examples of \nexactly why, after 9/11, we need to preserve the powers the President \nhas today. Let me remind my colleagues, today, prior to 9/11, the \nPresident had used these powers, as President Clinton did, to set aside \nunion contracts in the FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the \nAir Marshals Office of the Federal Aviation Administration, the Office \nof Criminal Enforcement, and the Office of Enforcement and Intelligence \nat the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n  Workers in those offices today are working under the procedures the \nPresident has asked that he be allowed to continue to exercise.\n  What kinds of problems do you run into with these silly union work \nrules? Let me say to my colleagues, I don't see how anybody with a \nstraight face can stand on the floor of the Senate and defend the civil \nservice system as it exists today, when you are talking about threats \nto the lives of our children and our families. It is not as if we have \nnot been warned. The Grace Commission warned us. The Volcker Commission \nstated:\n\n       The current system is slow. It is legally trampled and \n     intellectually confused. It is impossible to explain to \n     potential candidates. It is almost certainly not fulfilling \n     the spirit of our mandate to hire the most meritorious \n     candidates.\n\n  That is Paul Volcker, and that is in 1989.\n  Our colleague, Senator Rudman headed the U.S. Commission on National \nSecurity. We all know Warren Rudman. We all know he is no union basher. \nWe all know he has good judgment and good sense. This is what he said:\n\n       Today's Civil Service system has become a drag on our \n     national security. The morass of rules, regulation and \n     bureaucracy prevent the government from hiring and retaining \n     the workforce that is required to combat the threats of the \n     future.\n\n  I could go on. For example, the Brookings Institution has shown study \nafter study that the system is broken.\n  Now, after giving President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, \nPresident Clinton, and the current President Bush the power to set \naside these union work rules for national security reasons, and after \nthe events of 9/11, the majority brings forth a bill that says: Well, \nwe gave this power to President Clinton and we gave the power to \nPresident Carter, but after 9/11, we are going to take away security \npowers of the President.\n\n  That is offensive and ludicrous on its face, and when the American \npeople discover it, they are going to go absolutely crazy. When they \ndiscover that we currently have eight agencies operating under these \nrules today, and the Congress, in its response to 9/11, wants to say: \nWell, we are going to take away powers from this President that \nPresident Clinton needed and President Carter needed--I don't think so. \nI don't think people are going to buy it.\n\n[[Page S8710]]\n\n  What kinds of impediments are we talking about? Well, let me touch a \nfew. These are actual cases. I am not talking about theoretical cases. \nThe majority leader says, show him examples of where these work rules \ninterfere with national security. Let me quickly give you a handful of \nthem.\n  We had an effort in Customs, in 1987, to change the makeup of our \ninspection center in the Customs office at Logan Airport. The idea was, \nchange the makeup of the office in order to make it more efficient in \nfulfilling the functions of Customs. Guess what? Customs tried to \nchange the configuration of the room. The public employee labor union, \nrepresenting Customs officials, appealed to the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority, and the power of the Administration to change the \nconfiguration of the inspection room was rejected.\n  Do we really want some work rule negotiated prior to 9/11 to prevent \nus from finding somebody who is carrying a bomb on a plane with your \nmomma? Have people gone completely crazy? What is going on here?\n  Let me touch on a couple of these. Union work rules prohibited an \nagency from working together to protect the border. Literally, as our \nformer drug czar Barry McCaffrey pointed out, the union work rules \nprohibited one of the agencies from opening trunks. The drug smugglers \nwere aware of it, had people at the border watching, and decided to \nmove drugs based on those work rules.\n  What if that is poisonous gas or biological weapons or a nuclear \nweapon coming into New York Harbor? We are going to go to the National \nLabor Relations Authority to renegotiate a union contract when millions \nof lives are at stake? I don't think so. And the idea that our \ncolleagues would believe such a thing is possible just shows you how \nout of touch some people are with their commitment to the status quo as \ncompared to their commitment to the job at hand.\n  Very quickly, because I am running out of time, there was a \nprohibition of agencies for increasing the number of immigration \ninspectors. We had an effort to increase the number of inspections of \nimmigration inspectors in 1990. And under union work rules, it was \nrejected because of a union contract.\n  Do people really think, in light of 9/11, we should allow a union \ncontract to stand in our way and spend months and months and months \nbefore the National Labor Relations Authority trying to change that \ncontract, rather than saying there is a clear and present danger to \nAmerica and we want to change it today?\n  Now, the President has that power. But under the Lieberman bill, that \npower would be taken away. I could go on and give you dozens of real-\nlife examples of how ridiculous these union work rules are. Look, if we \nwere not talking about people's lives, we could all play this game of \njust saying how sacred these union work rules are that make our Federal \nGovernment the laughingstock of the country and the world. But when we \nare talking about lives and talking about the powers that four \nPresidents have had, the idea that we are going to take that power away \nfrom this President, at this time, is totally unacceptable.\n  To add insult to injury, the President has asked for flexibility. He \nhas asked for the right to promote good people and put them in the \nright place, and not wait 5 months to hire somebody, and to fire \nincompetents. The President cannot promote the lady from the FBI who \nsent a memo to the home office saying: Hey, we have people with \nterrorist links who are learning to fly planes and not land them, and \nmaybe we ought to do something about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8710-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8710-S8711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 11:30 \na.m. having arrived, there will now be a period for the transaction of \nmorning business not to extend beyond the hour of 12:30 p.m. with \nSenators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I object. I ask if the Senator can complete in 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I can do it in 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, the President wanted the ability to do \nthings such as promote that FBI agent because, had we been able to get \nthrough that massive, incoherent system in which we are working, we \nmight have prevented the attacks.\n  I also think we might want to fire the people at INS who gave visas \nto the people who had flown a plane into the World Trade Center after \ntheir picture had been on every television in the world and on the \nfront page of every newspaper.\n  We have, as a Senate, approved those flexibilities, those powers, for \nthe Transportation Security Administration, the Internal Revenue \nService, the FAA, and we did that prior to 9/11. But after 9/11, we are \ntold that the President, under national security circumstances, with a \ndeclaration of a clear and present danger to our people, cannot have \nthe kind of flexibility in homeland security that we gave to a previous \nPresident for the Internal Revenue Service. To make the Internal \nRevenue Service more responsible, we gave President Bill Clinton, \npersonnel flexibility. But now, to protect the lives of our people in \nhomeland security, are we not willing to give the same flexibility to \nPresident Bush?\n  When the American people finally discover what is going on here, they \nare going to be outraged, and they are going to discover it because, \ndespite our best efforts of saying let's work together, let's do this \non a bipartisan effort, it is clear now that there is going to be a \nbattle. It is clear now that we are going to have to choose between the \nstatus quo, the old way of doing business, and the health, safety, and \nlives of our people.\n  The choice is as stark as a choice can be. The bill that is before us \nliterally takes power away from the President that every President \nsince Jimmy Carter has had to use national security waivers. It takes \nthat power away from the President in the aftermath of 9/11. The \nAmerican people will never understand that, and they will never accept \nit. They will never accept a compromise on it.\n  When the American people realize we were concerned enough about the \nInternal Revenue Service's operation that we gave President Clinton \npersonnel flexibility to hire and fire and promote, because we thought \nit was important, but we are not willing to give President Bush the \nsame flexibility to protect the lives of our people, I don't think they \nare going to take kindly to that.\n  The plain truth is that we have a bill before us that protects \neverything except national security. It protects every special interest \ngroup in the American Government. The plain truth is, the people who \nwork for the Government want these changes. An OPM poll looking at \naccountability in the Federal Government. By very large margins, two-\nthirds of the people who are Federal workers believe that Federal \nperformers are not adequately disciplined. Nearly half of all workers \nbelieve job performance has little or nothing to do with promotion and \nraises, and 99 percent of people who got bad evaluations last year in \nthe Federal Government got pay raises. When we are talking about \nnational security, when we are looking at the aftermath of 9/11, it is \ntime for change. It is not time for the same old special interests.\n  So what we are asking, in essence, is very simply--and I will \nconclude on this--let this President keep the power that every \nPresident since Jimmy Carter has had, which is to use national security \nwaivers. That hardly seems extreme given the attack on America and the \ndeaths of thousands of our people. Give this President the same \nflexibility in national security and homeland security that we gave \nBill Clinton with the Internal Revenue Service. If that sounds extreme, \nyou are looking at things differently than I.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we had a very good discussion this \nmorning with the President talking about national security in several \ncontexts--of course, the war on terror and the important challenges \nthis country faces in continuing to make this country and the world a \nsafer place in which to live. The arrests over the weekend and the \ncooperation we got from Pakistan ought to be particularly noted, and we \nought to thank the Government of Pakistan for their cooperation. We \ntalked about that this morning.\n  We talked about Iraq and the threat it poses to us. We talked about \nthe need for cooperation when dealing with the threats posed by Iraq, \nnot only within the Congress and the country, but in the international \ncommunity. So we had a very good discussion about national security, \nand I believe it ought to be uppermost in the minds of all people, and \ncertainly the Congress as we continue to complete our responsibilities \nin the second session of the 107th Congress.\n  Let me also say, just as we properly recognize the threat that exists \nin more traditional national security areas, we, as a country and \nparticularly as a government, would be remiss in our responsibilities \nwere we not to address economic security, were we not to recognize the \nperil this country is in economically, So, in addition to acknowledging \nthe importance of our defense activities, I also wanted to come to the \nChamber this morning to express my concern for the lack of attention \npaid to the state of economic security, to express the concern that \nmany of us have with regard to what has been a very unfortunate, some \nwould even say tragic, economic trend in this country over the course \nof the last 18 months.\n  I have a number of charts that reflect more graphically some of these \nconcerns, and I want, if I may, to walk through some of them at this \ntime.\n\n  If we look at the record of this administration over the past 18 \nmonths, perhaps it is best summarized in the very first chart: Record \njob losses; weak economic growth; declining business investment; \nfalling stock market; shrinking retirement accounts; eroding consumer \nconfidence; rising health care costs; escalating foreclosures; \nvanishing surpluses and higher resulting interest costs; raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund; record executive pay; and stagnating \nminimum wage.\n  If you were going to use the shortest list with the greatest concern, \nthis chart is it.\n  Let me go through many of these individual concerns a little more \nthoroughly. Over the last 2 years--actually\n\n[[Page S8712]]\n\nthe last 18 months--we have lost 2 million jobs--private sector jobs in \nthis country.\n  If there is any one criteria that would, more than any other, \nillustrate the health of the economy, it would be job growth. If the \neconomy is growing, jobs are going to be there. If it is contracting, \nif the economy is weak or contracting, the jobs will not be there. We \nhave lost 2 million jobs in 18 months.\n  People might say: Well, that just happens; other administrations have \nlost jobs.\n  If you wanted to go back and look at what other administrations have \nactually done, you would probably have to go all the way back to the \n1930s to see the last time in our Nation's history when we last \nwitnessed a loss in private sector jobs over the course of the life of \nan administration. Private sector jobs during this administration have \ndeclined by 1.2 percent on an average annual basis.\n  Over the last 50 years, in every administration since Dwight \nEisenhower, we have seen private sector job growth. It was not much in \nthe Eisenhower administration. It was even less under the first Bush \nadministration. And we have seen remarkable job growth on three other \noccasions--the Johnson administration in the 1960s, the Carter \nadministration in the 1970s, and the Clinton administration in the \n1990s.\n  What have we seen in the first few years of the current \nadministration? We have actually seen a decline in the number of \nprivate sector jobs for the first time in 50 years.\n  One can look at it another way. It is not only how many jobs are \nlost. It is also important to see how many people have been trying to \nfind jobs for long periods of time and have been unable to do so, those \nwho have been out of work for more than 6 months, the so-called long-\nterm unemployed. Some who lose their job are able to quickly find \nanother one. For those who are unable to do so, such as those who fall \ninto the category of long-term unemployed, we continue to come to this \nChamber and press for the passage of unemployment compensation \nextensions.\n  In January of 2001, the number of long-term unemployed was 648,000. \nIn August of this year, that number had more than doubled to 1,474,000 \npeople. That is also one of the most tragic figures. There is a human \nstory behind every one of those numbers. Not only is that individual \nunemployed, but most likely that person and perhaps their family are \nwithout income. Most likely it is a family trying to survive on what \nmeager unemployment compensation they have, looking for odd jobs, doing \nwhatever they can to make ends meet. And today you have more than 1.4 \nmillion people who have suffered as a result of this administration's \neconomic policies for the last 18 months.\n  The larger picture beyond employment that is frequently used to gauge \nthe performance of the economy is the change in our real gross domestic \nproduct. That is probably the most traditional economic indicator for \nassessing the strength of the economy. In the first 18 months of this \nadministration, the economy has grown by 1 percent. The rate of growth \nwas twice that figure under the first Bush administration. But those \nare the two lowest economic performances, the most meager economic \nperformances we have seen in the last 50 years. President Eisenhower \nhad economic growth of 2.4 percent; Kennedy, 5.4 percent; Johnson, 4.9 \npercent; the Clinton administration, 3.6 percent. We have seen growth, \nfortunately, in every administration.\n\n  But in all those administrations with all the economic ups and downs \nwe have seen, it is clear this administration has the worst performance \nin terms of real economic growth that we have seen in the last 50 \nyears. That anemic economic performance has had huge consequences in \nnational terms as well as in personal terms for American workers, \nAmerican businesses, American investors, and American pension holders.\n  This chart shows what has happened to the value of investments at the \nNew York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ stock market under this \nadministration. When this administration took office in January, 2001, \nthe overall market value, the market capitalization in those two \nmarkets alone, was $16.4 trillion. That was an all-time high. We had \nnever seen anything close to that level. Under the Clinton \nadministration, the markets had been booming. We saw growth in an \nunprecedented way.\n  We expected, everyone expected, that growth to continue. But that is \nnot what happened. What happened, instead, was over the last 18 months \nthat $16.4 trillion pie has now shrunk to $11.9 trillion. We have lost \n$4.5 trillion in market capitalization just in 18 months.\n  I defy anyone to find a record more abysmal when it comes to overall \nmarket valuation that is even comparable to the enormous loss we have \nseen in just the past 18 months.\n  It goes beyond that. If you look at an individual worker's retirement \nsavings--that is what we are talking about when we talk about the loss \nof market capitalization--the impact is profound. If that worker had a \n$100,000 retirement fund invested in the market in 2001 and kept it \nthere during the 18 months this administration has been in office, that \nloss in market capitalization would mean the worker saw the value of \nhis retirement savings decline by more than $31,000. In other words, \nthe worker in just 18 months has lost nearly a third of the nest egg he \nwas counting on for the balance of his retirement, all of their \nretiring years. One-third of his retirement savings meant for a life \ntime, gone in 18 months.\n  Not surprisingly, this shrinkage in market capitalization has had a \nprofound effect on pensioners. It is why, when I was home over both the \nFourth of July and August recesses, I was amazed to hear how frequently \npeople came up and said, Tom, you know, I just saw my latest statement \nregarding my retirement. I think there was a mistake. I cannot believe \nwhat has happened. The value of my pension has declined precipitously. \nThis is a shock to us all. You have to do something.\n  These large economic numbers have large financial consequences for \npeople in South Dakota and all over this country who believed if they \nregularly contributed to their retirement investment accounts, they \nwould have retirement security. That security is not there today, a \nmere 18 months after this administration took office.\n  Again, how does that compare? Some will say: Ups and downs in the \nmarket are just a way of life; those are cycles; accept the cycles; \nthat is the way it works. However, if you look at the average annual \nchange in the value of the market, you have to go back a long time to \nfind a period where the performance is as bad as what we are witnessing \nnow.\n  During the Nixon administration, we lost approximately 5 percent in \nthe S 500 account. You have to go all the way back to Herbert Hoover \nto see a performance in the Standard & Poors 500 equal to what we are \nexperiencing right now. We saw a 30 percent decline under Herbert \nHoover as compared to the 20 percent in the first 18 months of this \nadministration. And this administration's watch is still ticking; that \none is over.\n\n  But look at all the other years, all the other administrations, all \nthe other record performances, all the other economic strategies. It \ngrew 15 percent in the Clinton administration; it grew 14 percent in \nthe Ford administration; it even grew in the Coolidge administration. \nBut if I had to pick one chart that compares economic performance, I \ncannot think of a more graphic illustration of how terrible this \neconomy truly is and how poorly our markets are performing and how \nlittle confidence there is in the economic strategy of this \nadministration.\n  Again, I come back to what does this all really mean to the working \nfamily, to that rancher or farmer or small businessman, or to that \nhard-hat worker or blue-collar worker who comes to me in South Dakota? \nWe have seen that meager economic growth and a collapsing stock market \nmeans fewer jobs, more unemployment, and less retirement security. But \nwhat has happened to the costs of their basic goods and services?\n  Workers' payments for health insurance provides an excellent example \nof how strapped these people are. In just the past 18 months since this \nadministration took office, the cost of an average family's health \ninsurance coverage, a basic need for all families, has gone up 16 \npercent. Single coverage has gone up 27 percent. That is the kind of \nrecord we are talking about.\n\n[[Page S8713]]\n\n  We can move this to other aspects of health care. We see a similar \ntrend when we look at the rising cost of prescription drugs. While the \nConsumer Price Index has gone up 1.6 percent since this administration \ntook office, the cost of prescription drugs has grown by 5.7 percent, \nalmost four times greater than the overall inflation rate.\n  We also have seen something else we never thought we would see a \ndramatic increase in the number of foreclosures. A number of our \ncolleagues have followed this even more closely than I have and have \nnoted we are not just talking here about minimum wage workers when we \ntalk about foreclosures. We are not just talking about people at the \nlowest end of the economic scale. What has happened is a phenomena we \nhave not seen in a long time in this country. Middle-class workers, \npeople with good incomes when working, are watching their mortgages \nforeclose. The thousands of layoffs have caused an increasing number of \nthem to suffer in another way, the personal pain of losing their home. \nAt the end of last year, 1.15 percent of mortgage loans were in \nforeclosure. By the second quarter of this year, that number had grown \nto 1.63 percent, an increase that affects not only lower income workers \nbut workers across the economic scale.\n  Another tragic aspect of this administration's economic policies can \nbe seen when we look at its impact on our fiscal circumstances. We have \ntalked about market capitalization. We have talked about the loss of \njobs. We have talked about the economic pain our working families are \nfeeling as they see their own pension security come down. As they see \nunemployment rolls go up, as they see the long-term unemployed numbers \ncontinue to climb, as they see all of that on one side and higher costs \nfor health care and prescription drugs on the other, they ask why.\n  How in the world could all of this happen in such a short period of \ntime? There are a lot of answers to that question. But if I could point \nto one in particular, it would be this. If there is one reason we have \nseen the dramatic turn in such a short period of time, the historic \nturn in the economy, it is the unprecedented reversal in the federal \ngovernment's fiscal picture. When President Bush took office, the \nCongressional Budget Office projected a $5.6 trillion surplus. As a \nresult of what the President has signed into law or is currently \nproposing, the surplus projection becomes a $400 billion deficit. What \ndoes that do to economic confidence? What does that do to market \ncapitalization? What does that do to long-term projections? To long-\nterm interest rates? What does that do to the overall psychology in the \neconomy, to see this precipitous a decline?\n  I was talking to a journalist the other day, about what history will \nsay about the last 2 years. I hope to have something to say about the \nway it is written. I am excited about a project I am working on in that \nregard. But he said, as we consider all of the historic moments of the \nlast 2 years, the one that he believes has the greatest consequence for \nour country is the President's tax cut proposal. You know, a lot of \npeople would argue he was right. The tragic set of financial and \neconomic circumstances we are witnessing today, is directly connected \nto the tragic decline in our fiscal circumstance.\n  This can be illustrated another way. At the beginning of last year, \nCBO projected the publicly held debt would be $36 billion by the year \n2008. In fact, members actually came to the Senate floor to argue we \nwere paying down the debt too quickly, and we would pay a price for \nhaving done so. Let me say that problem is no longer a concern. There \nis no way we are going to have to worry about paying off anything too \nquickly because in the space of 18 months that projection has grown \nfrom $36 billion to the new projection issued last month of $3.8 \ntrillion. That is the record.\n  We have gone from a projected $5.6 trillion surplus to a $400 billion \ndeficit and from $36 billion in projected debt by 2008 to $3.8 \ntrillion. What a tragic, deplorable, abysmal set of circumstances for \nus to find ourselves in as we close out this session of Congress.\n  The Bush economic record could be also described in terms of what it \ncosts us. You can talk about deficits. You can talk about all the \neconomic impact that deficit may have, the accumulated debt. But \npractically speaking, what it really means is that we have to pay \nhundreds of billion in additional interest costs. It is thievery. It is \nrobbery. Increased interest payments steal from the very heart and soul \nof the commitments we have to make, as a country, to national defense, \nto education, to housing, to infrastructure, or to additional tax cuts. \nIn short, these costs take away resources from all of national \nsecurity, economic, and environmental priorities facing our nation \ntoday. They are all robbed by the fact that we have to pay $1.9 \ntrillion in interest costs over the next 10 years. When this \nadministration took office, we thought we were only going to have to \npay $620 billion. Since this administration took office, we have gone \nfrom $620 billion in interest costs to $1.9 trillion. And every dollar \nwas either going to be dedicated to Social Security or dealing with the \ninvestments we as a country must make, or in tax cuts, the need for \nwhich both sides have talked about.\n  When you talk about what the historic fiscal reversal means in real \nterms, it is higher interest costs, it is lack of an opportunity to \ninvest in national defense, education, and health.\n\n  But here is the real story. We all promised--I will bet there is not \na Senator in this Chamber who did not say: We are going to put Social \nSecurity first; who did not rise to the standards set by the past \nadministration in saying to the country: Whatever else we do, we are \ngoing to protect Social Security.\n  In fact, President Bush had a Web page. I haven't looked recently to \nsee if it is still there. But the President made a solemn pledge on \nthat Web page: I will never take a dollar of your Social Security trust \nfunds.\n  Here we are. We had a commitment in January of 2001 that we were \nnever going to touch those Social Security dollars. We find ourselves \nnow, in August of 2002, having already committed $2 trillion of the \nSocial Security trust fund--$2 trillion, and we are not finished yet. \nThat number is going to continue to grow. If current economic trends \ncontinue and we enact the President's tax and spending proposals, there \nis no doubt we will be spending even more of the Social Security trust \nfund. What is the President's solution? Mr. President, President Bush's \nsolution appears to be pretty clear. There is not any other solution I \nhave heard this administration talk about. They have one all-purpose, \neconomic antidote to everything, and that is tax cuts--tax cuts largely \ndedicated to those at the very top. The only thing I have seen the Bush \nadministration fail to suggest a tax cut for, so far, is the drought. \nExcept for the drought, I can't think of another serious problem this \ncountry faces where the administration has offered up a tax cut as the \nsolution.\n  Let's look a little bit at the tax cut proposed by this \nadministration. The Bush economic record already is very clear. This is \nalready on the books. This is what is going to happen. The tax cuts \nthat have been enacted so far favor the very wealthiest of Americans. \nIf you are in the lowest 20th percentile, with an average income of \n$9,300 a year, your average annual tax cut was $66. We have a lot of \nSouth Dakotans in that category.\n  If you are in the second 20 percent, with an average income of \n$20,000--and I would say that is the majority of South Dakotans, the \noverwhelming majority--you get $375 a year.\n  If you are in the upper brackets in my State, making somewhere around \n$40,000, your tax cut was $600 a year.\n  If you make $56,000--now we are getting into pretty rare air here in \nmy state--you get a tax cut of about $1,000. If you make about $100,000 \nyear, you get a tax cut of $2,000. If you make $210,000--there are not \nmany of those in South Dakota--you get a tax cut of $3,345.\n  If you make an average of $1.1 million a year and you are in that top \n1 percent, you get a tax cut of $53,000, an amount that is actually \ntwice the average income of the people in the State of the Presiding \nOfficer, South Dakota.\n  These are the beneficiaries. A lot of these people make a lot more \nthan $1 million a year. They make $700 million, $148 million, $127 \nmillion, down to $23 million a year. Look at all those names\n\n[[Page S8714]]\n\nand all that money, and you know where their friends are. You know who \ntheir defenders are.\n  (Mr. JOHNSON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question on that chart \nmomentarily?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If I understand this chart, if you are in the top 1 \npercent of the wealthiest Americans, under the President's proposal you \nwould receive a tax cut that would equal the income--not the tax cut--\nof approximately six earners in the lowest 20 percent of the income \nscale. In other words, the people in that income scale have an average \nincome of about $9,000 year, as I understand the chart. They would get \na tax cut of $66 a year. They get $9,000 in total income, while the \nupper 1 percent will get a tax cut just shy of $54,000. The tax cut \nalone is equal to the earnings of six people in the bottom 20 percent \nof the income scale.\n\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The chairman of the Banking Committee has put his finger \non exactly what it is we are trying to focus on here--the disparity and \nthe extraordinary maldistribution this tax cut represents. There is an \nunbelievable disconnect here between those at the lowest end who have \nalready seen cuts in education and health care, declines in their \nretirement accounts, and who are probably in many cases working three \nor four minimum wage jobs, attempting to make a living. They get a $66 \ntax cut. Those making an average of $1.1 million a year get a tax cut \nof more than $53,000. In fact, some in this category make more than \n$700 million a year and who knows the size of the tax cut these people \nwould get?\n  The sad thing is--and the Senator from Maryland makes such a good \npoint--that those people who have virtually no tax cut available to \nthem are the very ones who have seen their purchasing power decline.\n  Since 1997, we have seen the real earnings of full-time minimum wage \nworkers, over half of whom are women and heads of households, decline \nfrom $11,560 to $10,300. But can we get a minimum wage vote on this \nfloor? Can we get the kind of support on a bipartisan basis required to \ndeal with this situation? No. We can get the support for that $53,000 \ntax cut for the top 1 percent. But I can't find the Republican support \nnor the administration support and leadership required to deal with \nthis extraordinary and sad consequence of the government's inaction on \nthe minimum wage.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Did I hear the leader suggest that we are talking about \ntaking $2 trillion out of the Social Security trust fund to fund the \nother things that are going on with regard to economic policy? If I am \nnot mistaken, I think I saw a chart that projected $2 trillion and how \nwe would utilize the Social Security trust fund. I think those are \npayroll taxes from working Americans from all walks of life.\n  Then, if I am not mistaken, as I looked at your chart where the tax \ncuts are actually going, it would appear to me that we are using the \nSocial Security trust fund to fund tax cuts for those at the very high \nend of the marginal tax brackets.\n  Is my analysis from looking at your charts correct? Does the leader \nhave a comment on that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished Senator from New Jersey makes a very \ngood point. Probably no one can make that point with greater \ncredibility than can he.\n  Let me just simply compare this chart. You have seen an increase in \nthe draw down of the Social Security trust fund. We have actually spent \n$2 trillion of Social Security. We put those resources into this tax \ncut, providing $53,000 per year to the top 1 percent of income earners \nin this country. You have seen an income transfer from those paying \npayroll taxes--largely at the lower end of the income scale--to those \nat the upper end of the income scale. This represents an income \ntransfer in the opposite direction from poor working people to those at \nthe very top.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the leader will bear with me a second, if we look at \nthe table he has with regard to the second level, it looks as though \nsome of the individuals who will benefit the most from this tax cut--it \nis almost inconceivable that we are using payroll taxes for men and \nwomen at WorldCom and Enron. It is just hard to believe.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know the Senator from New Jersey remembers this. But I \nrecall the House passed their economic stimulus package, and part of \nthat package included a $254 million retroactive tax cut for Enron. The \nadministration saw no problem with that. Our Republican friends were \nanxious to vote for it. In fact, when we stopped it, we were called \nobstructionists. But that was the kind of obstructionism that stopped \nEnron from getting $254 million from their taxes.\n  To summarize, what ought to be going up is coming down and what ought \nto be going down is coming up. What ought to go down is the raid on the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is going up. What ought to go down are \ninterest costs, but they are going up. What ought to go down is the \nnational debt, but it is going up. What ought to go down are \nforeclosures, health care costs, and job losses, but they are going up. \nWhat ought to go up--economic growth--is going down. What ought to go \nup is business investment, the market, retirement accounts, consumer \nconfidence, and the minimum wage. They ought to go up. But in these \nlast 18 months, every single one of these factors has gone down.\n  This will be the subject of a lot more discussion, debate, and \nhopefully illumination over the course of the next several weeks and \nmonths. But we have to change these arrows. We have to ensure that \neconomic growth goes up. We have to ensure that the stock market, \nretirement accounts, pension funds, consumer confidence, and the \nminimum wage go up. We have to do what we did in the 1990s--have an \neconomic performance that gives people the sense that they can live in \ndignity and in confidence, knowing their retirement accounts and Social \nSecurity checks are going to be there.\n  We have to end the job loss, deal with health care costs, and make \nsure we reduce the raid on the Social Security trust fund.\n  I hope Republicans and Democrats can do for economic security what we \nare attempting now to for our national security--recognizing that this \nwon't change unless we do it together, and recognizing that while this \nnational security issue dealing with Iraq may be accomplished with one \nresolution, it is going to take a lot more than one resolution to turn \nour economy around. It is going to take the same kind of discipline we \ndemonstrated in the 1990s. It is going to take the same kind of \ncommitment on a bipartisan basis for these issues to be addressed, and \na lot more consequential.\n  As busy as we are and as important as the effort on Iraq is, I hope \nthis administration will dedicate some of its time this week to \neconomic security as well, to these declining numbers, to this \natrocious record, to a recognition that it takes leadership not only \nwith regard to international and foreign policy but leadership here at \nhome and economic policy as well. We haven't seen it to date, and the \ntime has come for leadership on this as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8714-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader for his excellent presentation with respect to the state of our \neconomy. He has described in very straightforward terms the serious \neconomic problems we confront: weak economic growth, rising job losses, \ndeclining business investment, a falling stock market, eroding consumer \nconfidence, and a deteriorating Federal Government fiscal position.\n\n[[Page S8715]]\n\n  Just this morning, the Wall Street Journal reported:\n\n       What looked like a brief dip in economic activity a month \n     ago looks increasingly like a protected slowdown. . . . The \n     Federal Reserve said Tuesday that industrial production \n     fell 0.3 percent in August from July, the first decline \n     since December, when the recession was ending.\n\n  The majority leader made a compelling case, in my view, for focusing \nthe attention of the Congress and the President on the urgent economic \nchallenges we confront at home, as well as the significant security and \nforeign policy challenges we confront abroad.\n  I wish to take a few moments to focus briefly on a very pressing \neconomic challenge that is before us right now and which ought to be \naddressed before the end of the year: the problem of the long-term \nunemployed and the need to extend unemployment insurance benefits. I \nurge the administration to submit to the Congress a proposal for the \nextension of unemployment insurance benefits.\n  On September 9, the New York Times ran a front page story entitled, \n``Long-Term Jobless Rose by 50 Percent Last Year.'' The article \nstated--and I now quote from it--\n\n       . . . the number of people who have been jobless for months \n     has climbed to a level more typical of a deep downturn. \n     Almost three million people nationwide have been out of work \n     for at least 15 weeks, up more than 50 percent from a year \n     ago. Half of them have not worked for at least 6 months. \n     Another million Americans appear to have dropped out of the \n     labor force in each of the past two years, no longer looking \n     for work or counted as unemployed. . . . Many people who have \n     not worked in months have begun spending retirement savings \n     that were already diminished by the stock market's fall. \n     Others are considering low-wage jobs at a fraction of their \n     old pay. In either case, their stretches of unemployment \n     could define their financial futures for years.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Many unemployed people . . . see little sign that companies \n     will soon begin hiring in large numbers. And some are growing \n     increasingly nervous because unemployment benefits that were \n     extended . . . will expire soon.\n\n  I want to make a very simple but important point in light of this \nrise in the long-term unemployed and the challenge that it presents. I \nstrongly urge the administration to address it and to send the proposal \nto the Congress.\n  We extended the unemployment compensation program earlier this year \nto provide an additional 13 weeks beyond the basic 26 weeks. But this \nprogram is scheduled to end on December 31 of this year, which means \nthat someone who is then in the 27th week of their benefits at the end \nof 2002 could receive no further unemployment benefits. This program is \nscheduled to end at the very time when the number of long-term \nunemployed is not coming down, but is increasing.\n  The projections on the unemployment front are not encouraging. The \nCBO predicts the unemployment rate will remain near 6 percent until the \nsecond half of next year. When we enacted the extension, it was at 5.7 \npercent. Unemployment is projected to stay high well into next year, \nwhile the extension is scheduled to expire on December 31 of this year.\n  Now, in previous recessions--and it is important to note this--we \nextended the increase in the time period to collect unemployment \nbenefits. Back in the recession of 1990-1991, unemployment benefits \nwere extended five separate times. In fact, not only were they \ninitially extended by 13 to 20 weeks but then the period was lengthened \nagain to between 52 and 59 weeks. I am very frank to tell you I think \nwe have to confront this situation.\n  States are reporting larger increases in the exhaustion of \nunemployment benefits during this recession than during the last \nrecession. So for those people who have been thrown out of work--and I \nam not going to go through the litany of it; much of it has hit the \ndot-com industry--they either have or are close to having exhausted \ntheir unemployment benefit payments. They are going to be in even \ndeeper trouble once they cross that threshold and exhaust their \nunemployment benefit payments.\n  I am not seeking anything that is out of the ordinary in terms of \npast experience, but I think these benefits must be extended.\n  Let me make one final point. The temporary provision of additional \nFederal benefits to the unemployed, in the wake of economic downturns, \nhas long served a dual purpose. Beyond providing needed income support \nto those whose spells of unemployment are lengthened by recessionary \nconditions, it is also very well designed to give the economy a boost.\n  Unemployment benefits are quickly injected into the economy. Benefits \ncan be paid immediately through the existing unemployment insurance \nsystem. They are targeted to areas where the downturn has hit the \nhardest. They go to areas with large concentrations of newly unemployed \nwho qualify for benefits. They stimulate demand where it has \ndeteriorated the most. They are very effective in boosting the economy. \nAnd, of course, they come to the rescue of people who have found \nthemselves out of work and are under extreme stress in order to meet \nthe financial demands of supporting themselves and often their family \nas well.\n  So we need to extend unemployment benefits. We need to fill in the \nweaknesses in the system. We need to give the people who have lost \ntheir jobs, and are now confronting a very severe situation, some \nsupport in these trying circumstances.\n  We have extended unemployment benefits before repeatedly. It has \nworked. It has been seen to work. We need to do so again. I very \nstrongly urge the administration to face this challenge and to send to \nthe Congress--promptly and immediately--a proposal with respect to \nunemployment insurance benefits that would help to assure that the \nmillions of people across the country, who already have or may in the \nfuture exhaust their unemployment benefits, will not find themselves \nwithout any income support at the same time that they are confronting \nan economy in which job restoration is not taking place.\n  If job restoration were taking place, and the economy was on the \nupswing, and one could reasonably say to people, well, opportunities \nare returning and, therefore, you can find work. But that is not what \nis happening. You have people facing an economy which is softening, as \nthe Wall Street Journal reported just this morning, as they said, \n``What looked like a brief dip in economic activity a month ago looks \nincreasingly like a protracted slowdown. . . .''\n  We must at a minimum provide this assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8715-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8715-S8718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID. I want to make sure the record is clear. I asked earlier, \nwhatever time Senator Daschle used be given to the Republican side in \nmorning business, so that their morning business time would be extended \nby whatever time we went over morning business, which had been a half \nhour, plus whatever extra time he used.\n  How much time would that be, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would require 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. OK. And then whatever time Senator Sarbanes used, that \nwould also be given to them to speak in morning business. Is it clear \nthe extra time used by Senator Daschle and the time used by Senator \nSarbanes would be given to the Republicans so they could speak in \nmorning business, and that would delay our going to the homeland \nsecurity bill for whatever additional time that is? I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I listened intently as the majority leader \nspoke. I remind my colleagues, we are debating homeland security and \nthat we are preparing for a debate and a vote on Iraq.\n  I don't think it ever does any harm, however, to talk about the fact \nthat the country has additional challenges. I guess I would express two \nsources of disappointment with the speech the majority leader gave. The \nfirst source of disappointment would have to do with the absence of a \nprogram to deal with a single one of these problems.\n  Anybody who goes back and listens to that long litany of woe would \nsay: What did the majority leader say we are supposed to do about it? \nOne would\n\n[[Page S8716]]\n\nsearch in vain, except for the hint of a program which I would have to \nsay is sort of modeled after the Peronist economic program in Argentina \ntoday, which is to increase taxes and to spend more money.\n  In fact, I remind my colleagues, if we are as concerned as we say \nabout the economy and about the security of our people, the logical \nplace to start doing something about it is in the Senate. The plain \ntruth is, if there has been one place where there has been inaction on \nissues relevant to the economy and relevant to the American people, it \nis the Senate.\n  In fact, the President proposed a budget in January. The House \nadopted a budget. The Senate not only has not adopted a budget, but we \nhave made it eminently clear that we have no intention of adopting a \nbudget.\n  I would have to say that if the majority is concerned about all these \nproblems and the majority leader has the ability to bring a budget to \nthe floor of the Senate tomorrow, a logical place to show that concern \nwould be to do something about it by adopting a budget.\n  The plain truth is, we have adopted no budget, and we have continued \nto spend as if we still had the surplus that existed prior to the \ndownturn and prior to the war.\n  In terms of prescription drugs for seniors under Medicare, the \nPresident has proposed a program. The House has adopted a program. But \nin the Senate, there is no program. The Finance Committee was never \nallowed to meet on the subject to put forward a bill. A hodgepodge of \nideas came to the floor of the Senate. No consensus was built. It \nbecame a partisan issue. There was no action.\n  One thing that we could clearly do to bring stability to the economy \nand to promote job creation and economic growth would be to make the \ntax cuts permanent. What is more destabilizing to investment and \neconomic growth than the fact that 9 years from today we will have the \nlargest tax increase in American history? And it will occur \nautomatically if we don't act.\n  In terms of homeland security, the President proposed a bill. The \nHouse acted. In the Senate, we have had inaction. We have had endless \ndebate. We have talked about working together. We have talked about \nbipartisanship, but there is no bipartisanship on this issue. In fact, \nthe Democrats have come forward with a bill that takes power away from \nthe Presidency and the national security powers that President Carter \nhad, President Reagan had, President Bush had, President Clinton had. \nBut now, in the wake of thousands of our people being killed in a \nterrorist attack, suddenly our Democrat brethren say the President has \ntoo much national security power and they want to take some of it away \nfrom him. The American people are going to go absolutely crazy when \nthey realize that this is the case.\n  In terms of welfare reform, the 1996 reforms were the greatest \nsuccess in public policy in the postwar period. Now, the President has \nproposed a welfare reform bill. The House has adopted a welfare reform \nbill. But there is no action on welfare reform in the Senate.\n  Finally, the President proposed appropriations. Not one \nappropriations bill in its final form has passed the Congress, and only \nthree have passed the Senate.\n  I would have to say there is a missing ingredient in the Majority \nLeader's speech when he talks about all the problems we face \neconomically. When you look at the record of the Senate, let's begin at \nhome. Let's begin to solve the problem where we live. That problem is \nin the Senate.\n  I will address two other issues because I know our Republican Leader \nwishes to speak. I would have to take exception, as I said last Tuesday \nthat I would, on the issue about deficits. I do not understand how our \nDemocrat colleagues can continue to stand up and moan and grown and cry \nabout deficits as if they come from heaven, as if somehow God just \nsaid: We are going to have deficits. Deficits don't come from heaven; \nthey are created right here on the floor of the Senate.\n  I would have to say that when we are talking about a commitment not \nto raid Social Security, when we are talking about concern about the \ndeficit, I remind my colleagues, last Tuesday I stood right at that \ndesk and raised a point of order that we were taking $6 billion right \nout of the Social Security Trust Fund. The Majority Leader led the \nfight to take it out.\n  Today, he is alarmed about the deficit. Today, he is upset about the \ndeficit. Today, he is bemoaning the deficit. But Tuesday he helped \ncreate the deficit.\n  You can't have it both ways. You can't keep spending as if there is \nno tomorrow and then complain about the deficit.\n  Let me remind my colleagues, lest they think that suddenly the \nGovernment has become so tightfisted we are hurting our people: Over \nthe last 5 years, inflation has been 1.8 percent on a year on average. \nAverage family income has risen by 4.5 percent. And yet the \ndiscretionary spending of the Federal Government, driven largely by \nactions in the Senate--I am not talking about Medicare and Social \nSecurity and mandatory programs; I am talking about discretionary \nspending, something every family understands--at the time when family \nincome was growing by 4.5 percent, discretionary spending, not counting \nthe September 11 emergency funding, was growing by almost 7 percent.\n  When you look at what that means by program, this is the inflation \nrate, this red line, and this, by parts of the Government, is how fast \nthe Government has grown as compared to inflation: six times as fast \nfor Labor-HHS; five times as fast for Interior, five times as fast for \nTreasury. It goes on and on.\n  Yet the Majority Leader comes to the floor of the Senate today and \nsays: We have a crisis. We need, in essence, to raise taxes--taxes are \ntoo low--so we can fund more spending.\n  Anybody who looks at the facts is going to conclude that not only \nhave higher taxes and higher spending never helped any economy \nanywhere, but that we already have the higher spending and that we are \ncreating these deficits as we go every day in the Senate.\n  Finally, I have to respond to this constant effort to try to pit \npeople against each other based on their income. Envy destroyed ancient \nAthens; it destroyed ancient Rome. It is a dangerous thing for \nAmericans to use, and it is outrageous, unfair, and unjustified.\n  Look at the people who make up the Senate and look at the families \nthey come from and give me an argument that somehow there is some kind \nof elitism in America. It won't hold water. And we hear all this talk \nthat these rich people are getting all these tax cuts--the top 1 \npercent. Senator Daschle reminds us they get the $50,000 tax cut. He \ndidn't bother to point out that they are paying $400,000 in taxes. And \nas far as the low-income people who are not getting tax cuts are \nconcerned, he didn't point out that they are not paying any taxes. \nIncome tax cuts are for taxpayers. We have already been funding \nprograms for nontaxpayers.\n\n  We had not had a real tax cut of any significance since 1981. And the \nreality is that our tax cut made the Tax Code more progressive and not \nless progressive. Under our tax cut, the top 1 percent of income \nearners will pay more taxes as a percentage than they pay now.\n  So I think what we are seeing here is that some of our colleagues are \nobviously embarrassed about the fact that we are not getting the job \ndone in the Senate, and that the American people want a homeland \nsecurity bill passed. I don't think changing the subject helps our \neffort.\n  In the end, if we are really concerned about those things--and we \nshould be--we ought to go back and adopt a budget. We need to address \nthese concerns the American public has. But it is never going to be \nenough to say that there is unhappiness in the country. Ultimately, you \nhave to say what your program is to deal with it. The only program I \nheard today is we need more spending.\n  When Alan Greenspan was asked before the House Banking Committee what \none thing we could do that would help the economy the most, he said: \n``Stop spending.'' Yet, last Thursday, we added $6 billion to the \ndeficit, led by the very people who, today--last Thursday, they were \nfor deficits; today, they are against deficits. But you cannot be for \nsomething on Tuesday and against it last Thursday and have any \ncredibility in that debate.\n\n[[Page S8717]]\n\n  So, in the end, we have work to do here. In my opinion, we need to \npass a homeland security bill. That is lives today. We have to deal \nwith the Iraq situation. And nothing would make me happier than to do \nsomething to help the economy. But that something is not spending and \nit is not tax increases. In fact, it would be exactly the opposite.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time do we have in the designated \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 30 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \nwill not take that much time, I am certain.\n  I feel a need to respond to Senator Daschle's comments a few minutes \nago.\n  Before he leaves the Chamber, I want to say how much I appreciate, \nand the Senate appreciates, the Senator from Texas. He is going to be \nleaving this year. Maybe that is one of the reasons he is even more \narticulate than usual. He is saying what he really feels and thinks and \nis holding nothing back.\n  As I have said before--and I mean it sincerely--I don't know what we \nwill do without him. We are going to have to create another one, \nalthough I am not sure it is possible. On behalf of the taxpayers of \nthis country, and even those who might disagree with him sometimes, I \nsay to the Senator that I appreciate him very much. He has certainly \nbecome a legend in this institution. We thank him for all he has done \nand all we know he is going to do. We hope he is very successful and \npays his fair share of the taxes, which we hope to cut as the years go \nby.\n  Let me come back to what was said earlier. I think it was summed up \nin a headline this morning about the fact that Senator Daschle was \ngoing to make this speech. It says: ``Daschle to Attack Bush Fiscal \nPolicies.'' Unfortunately, that is all it was. It was a litany of \ncomplaints, citing certain statistics or certain areas where there \nmight be a concern.\n  My first reaction is, even if you accept all of that as being a \nproblem--and a lot of it is--what is your plan? What do you plan to do \nabout it? What is the legislative agenda? What do you recommend we pass \nin the 3 weeks or so we have left here?\n  The President has had an agenda. The President sent a budget here, \nbut it was all foreordained that we would come to this point this year \nwhen we got no budget resolution on the floor and voted on. I asked, \nwhy did we not have a budget resolution? We had one for 27, 28 years in \na row. Now, all of a sudden, we will not have one. I was told, it is \ntoo hard when the Senate is this closely divided. In 2001, when the \nSenate was divided 50/50, we wound up passing a budget resolution by a \nwide margin, including, I think, a dozen Democrats who voted with most, \nif not all, Republicans.\n  So while every Senator has a right to point out concerns about the \neconomy and the country, I think they ought to be in a position of \nsaying, OK, what are you going to do about it? What is your plan or \nbudget? At the time we had no budget agreement, I made note of the fact \nthat we were going to have some sort of meltdown at the end of the \nfiscal year; we were not going to have endorsement mechanisms; it was \ngoing to be hard to get appropriations bills done because there was no \ncommon number agreed to on the total amount. That is what happened.\n  The other thing that really bothers me is, not only is there no real \nplan from the Senate, in instance after instance the House passed good \nlegislation and the Senate has not taken it up--over 50 bills. I am not \ntalking about bills to create a ``watermelon recognition day''; I am \ntalking about serious legislation, such as welfare reform. Surely we \nshould have taken the next step to help people get off welfare, \nget training and education, and get what they need to get into a real \njob and pay taxes. That is the way you help the people and the economy. \nBut welfare reform, the Senate is not going to act on that. We are \nstill now working on homeland security.\n\n  Part of what we need to do for our economy in America is to reassure \npeople that we are going to be safe and we are going to have the \nprotections they need at home. They need to know that life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness and the opportunity to make a decent \nliving are going to be protected.\n  We are into the third week. Senator Daschle filed cloture to cut off \na filibuster. Who is filibustering? It is not this side. There have \nbeen not more than three substantive amendments that have been given an \nopportunity to even be considered. Yet homeland security is languishing \nhere in the Senate. Hopefully, we will get it done this week, or next \nweek, or sometime, so we can get it before we go out.\n  We have not made the tax cut permanent. We should do that. The \nridiculousness of the uncertainty of not knowing whether the tax cuts \nare going to be applicable in the years to come--when I go around the \ncountry, people say: Explain this to me. How can you do such a thing, \nhave a tax cut and not know for sure whether it is going to be in place \ndown the road? We have not done that.\n  Prescription drugs: We could have had an agreement if we had gotten a \nprescription drug measure together and debated it and voted on it in \nthe Finance Committee. We could have reported out a bipartisan bill \nthat would have come to the floor and would have passed. We could have \na bill probably out of conference now that would help low-income \nelderly people who do need this help in the future.\n  So in instance after instance, as Senator Gramm pointed out, the \nSenate has not produced any results. There has been no plan. We have \ndone three appropriations bills. We are on the fourth one. Not one bill \nwill go to the President by the end of the fiscal year. I know it is \ntough because, as majority leader, year after year I had to wrestle \nwith the appropriations bills. We got them done; usually, one by one we \ngot them through the process. In 1996, we actually got them all done, \nand I think we got them done very close to the end of the fiscal year. \nIt was harder and harder after that.\n  But how can you complain about what is happening in the economy when \nyou have such uncertainty in the Government--what is going to be \navailable for transportation, education, health and housing? That is \nall out there with no result.\n  The only proposal I have heard from some Democrats as to what we \nshould do to be helpful within the economy is to spend more--always add \nmore money, no matter what the issue is. Whenever a proposal is made by \nthe President or by Republicans, Democrats say: We will double you or \ntriple you. They think that is the way you create jobs--more Government \nspending. The Government is what kills jobs in many instances because \nof the pressure of the tax burden, regulatory burdens, and all the \nother problems that come out of having these deficits.\n  So their only proposal is: Let's spend more. And they tip-toe around \nit, but they cannot quite bring themselves to say what they want to do \nis stop the tax cuts; they want tax increases.\n  We need to be giving more incentives for the economy to grow. Let me \ntalk a bit about what has been done. I will show my colleagues the \ndifference.\n\n  It has been very difficult, but we have gotten some of the \nPresident's very important agenda through both the Senate and the House \nor into conference.\n  One of the things we could do to help the economy and create more \njobs is to have increasing trade. We need to open trade. We need to \nmake sure our companies, our farmers, and ranchers have access to \nmarkets all over the world in a truly open and free trade arrangement. \nWe did get that through, although I think it took us 7 weeks to get the \ntrade bill done. It was a long stretch of time, once again, because of \nthe way it was brought up.\n  We also did get an energy bill through the Senate. It is still \npending in conference. I think that took us about 4 weeks.\n  We did pass effective tax relief to help Americans keep more of their \nmoney to buy what is needed for their children at the beginning of the \nschool year. In fact, while I had my doubts about it at the time, the \nrebate that was included in the tax cuts in 2001 started hitting in \nAugust, September, and October when we were feeling the effects of not \nonly a recession that started in 2000, but also the aftereffects of \nwhat happened on September 11. As\n\n[[Page S8718]]\n\nthat money got into consumers' hands, they continued to buy what was \nneeded for their families, and they have been the strongest part of the \neconomy during a critical time.\n  We also had passed--and this is a case where it was bipartisan--tough \ncorporate accountability legislation.\n  There are some other issues we still could do in the waning hours of \nthis session, but I think to just make speeches and be critical of \nfiscal policies without offering any alternatives is the height of what \nwe should not be doing in the Senate.\n  The emperor has no clothes, Mr. President. The leadership has not \npassed a budget. It has not passed appropriations bills. The Senate has \nnot passed the prescription drug bill. We have not been able to get any \ntraction on homeland security, and we have not even done pension \nreform. I would like people to know more about what they can count on \nwith regard to putting money in IRAs or maybe taking money out of IRAs \nfor education and what we are going to do in the future in terms of \nprotecting 401(k)s and how stock options are going to be done. But that \nhas not been brought up, and I am not sure it ever will be.\n  We have the opportunity in the next 3 weeks to do what must be done \nfor our country: We can pass the Defense and military construction \nappropriations bills to make sure our men and women have what they need \nto do the job to protect America at home and abroad. We can pass this \nhomeland security bill, create this Department that will bring some \nfocus to our homeland security, and we can help with economic security \nby controlling spending and by passing such bills out of conference as \nthe energy bill. If we do not deal with the energy needs of this \ncountry for the future, if we do not have an energy policy and someday \nwe have a real shortfall, that could have a quick negative effect on \nour economy.\n  Those are the issues on which we can work in the next 3 weeks. Of \ncourse, we are going to need to stand up to our responsibilities and \naddress the Iraq situation also. I think we will do that. We should \nfocus on those issues we can do, where we can find agreement, and quit \nbeing critical without offering any alternatives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the hour of 1 \no'clock having arrived, the Senate will now resume consideration of \nH.R. 5005, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       A bill (H.R. 5005) to establish the Department of Homeland \n     Security, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n       Lieberman amendment No. 4471, in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4644\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, for the information of my colleagues, I \nhave no intention of speaking at great length. I hope that other \nSenators will come to the floor and engage me--not necessarily engage \nme, but Senators will come to the floor and speak on the amendment \neither for or against.\n  I would like to see other Senators who, I am sure, are as concerned \nabout the pell-mell rush to ram the homeland security legislation \nthrough both Houses and put it on the President's desk before much time \nis to be had for debate and for a clear elucidation of the pros and \ncons with respect to my amendment. And there are other amendments by \nother Senators waiting. I also have some other amendments.\n  I do invite other Senators on both sides of the aisle to come to the \nfloor and participate with reference, hopefully, to my amendment.\n  Yesterday, the administration and the congressional Republican \nleadership again chastised the Senate for not acting quickly enough to \npass the President's homeland security measure.\n  Said the very able Senate minority leader:\n\n       I fear the Senate Democrats are fiddling while Rome has the \n     potential to burn.\n\n  ``It's being talked to death,'' added White House spokesman, Ari \nFleischer.\n  We are said to have been debating this bill for 3 weeks now, 10 days \nof debate--3 weeks.\n  Ten days of debate is not too long, something like 3 weeks. It takes \n3 weeks to hatch an egg. I believe the distinguished Senator from \nTennessee would agree with me; we are both from the hill country. He is \nfrom the hill country of Tennessee, and I am from the hill country of \nWest Virginia. It does not make any difference how much heat you apply \nto that egg, it still takes at least 3 weeks for that egg to hatch out. \nIf I am wrong in that, I would like my colleague from Tennessee to tell \nme.\n  We are talking about something that was hatched by four men, are we \nnot, in the dark subterranean caverns of the White House?\n  I think a bill of this importance should be debated long enough that \nthe Senate will know and the people will know what we are talking \nabout, what we are about to pass. This is no small piece of \nlegislation. It is not legislation of little moment. It is very \nimportant legislation. In my speaking on this measure thus far, I have \nmet with a great deal of apathy. I do not believe much attention is \nbeing paid to this bill. I had urged that we not act too fast to have \nthis bill on the President's desk before the August recess or by the \ntime the August recess began, and then there was the idea that we ought \nto pass it by September 11, the first anniversary of that tragic event \nwhich occurred in New York City. And I said, no, we need to take \nlonger. I hoped that Senators would read the bill and that Senators' \naides would read the bill and that the people over at the Congressional \nReference Service, the legislative people over in the Library of \nCongress, would have an opportunity to read this bill before we voted \non it.\n  We have been debating this now for a few days. We look ahead to the \nappropriations bills that must be passed before the end of the fiscal \nyear, the proposed adjournment date of October 6, and the November mid-\nterm elections. It seems to be a long time for deliberation on one \nbill, but merely having a bill on the floor or on the calendar and \nactually debating it are two different things. To have the bill before \nthe Senate and to be actually debating it are two different things.\n  I have my eye further ahead, years ahead, to future Congresses and \nfuture generations of Americans. I am trying to look ahead. To my way \nof thinking, the attention which this bill has received on this floor \nseems exceedingly brief. We are in the midst of an enormous \nundertaking. We are talking about enacting a massive reorganization of \nthe Federal bureaucracy, a radical overhaul of our border security and \nimmigration system, and a powerful new intelligence structure that may \nforever change the way Americans think about their own freedoms. It is \na mighty huge responsibility that we are taking on, and we are \nendeavoring to do it all in one fell swoop: do it now, do it here. We \nhave heard that advertisement on television: Do it now, do it here.\n  I understand the pressures to move quickly today. We live in an age \nof instant coffee, instant replays, and instant messages. I suppose the \ndrive for instant legislation is a natural outgrowth. But I prefer the \ntaste of slow brewed coffee. And I like to study the fine print in \nlegislation I am being asked to support.\n  I would like to know, for instance, just exactly how many Federal \nworkers will be employed at this new Department. I saw a recent article \nin The\n\n[[Page S8719]]\n\nWashington Post that mentioned that the new Transportation Security \nAdministration was slated to employ 28,000 Federal screeners when it \nwas first created by Congress just last November. But, its Inspector \nGeneral has determined that the agency will actually need 63,000 \nscreeners--37,000 employees more than was originally anticipated. Wow. \nIn less than a year, the size of that new agency has more than doubled.\n  I would like to know, since the Transportation Security \nAdministration is supposed to be moved  into the new Homeland Security \nDepartment, are these 63,000 screeners part of the 170,000 employees \nthat we keep hearing will make up the new Department?\n\n  I would like to know if any of them are from West Virginia, for \nexample. I would think that other Senators would want to know if these \nFederal employees will be from their States. After all, we are being \nasked to trim back their worker protections. As for that matter, I \nwould like to know just how many of the total number of affected \nFederal workers are from my State. Exactly how many are from each \nState? I think every Senator has a legitimate interest in knowing the \nanswer to that and many other questions.\n  Since we have seen the Transportation Security Agency employment \nfigures rise so rapidly, I would be interested in learning if we can \nbank on that figure of 170,000 employees in the new Department or if \nthat is just a rough ``guesstimate.''\n  While we are at it, I would like to know just exactly why these \nparticular 28 Federal agencies and offices were selected, out of the \nmore than 100 that have homeland security functions, to be part of this \ngrand new Department. The administration crafted its homeland security \nplan in secret, so the Congress has little knowledge of why the \nPresident chose these 28 agencies and offices to be transferred. Why \nthese offices? Why these agencies? Why not other agencies?\n  The Lieberman bill, like the House-passed bill, proposes to transfer \nto the Department the same 28 agencies and offices outlined in the \nPresident's plan. But the Governmental Affairs Committee has not \ndeveloped any sort of criteria for why these agencies were chosen to be \nmoved, other than the fact that they were identified in the President's \nproposal. Certainly, the Congress needs a better reason than that for \ntransferring 28 agencies and offices and 170,000 employees.\n  I considered the possibility that the answer to my question might lie \nin the definition of ``homeland security'' but then I do not believe I \nfound in the Lieberman substitute bill a definition of homeland \nsecurity. It may be there, but I am not sure. I have been studying this \nLieberman bill and the House bill. The Lieberman bill is an improvement \nover the House bill. It is leap years ahead of the House bill, but I \ncannot remember having found a definition of homeland security in the \nLieberman bill.\n  Thinking, by the way, that such a definition was a pretty important \nthing to have in a piece of landmark legislation intended to address \none of our Nation's most pressing challenges, I included a definition \nin my amendment.\n  I would be interested to know why some of the Assistant Secretaries \ncalled for in this bill have no defined functions. Under Title I, the \nLieberman bill creates five assistant secretary positions within the \nnew Department, all of whom would have to be confirmed by the Senate, \nbut grants the President the authority to define the functions and \nresponsibilities of these assistant secretary positions when the \nPresident submits his appointees to the Senate for confirmation. Once \nconfirmed by the Senate, the Lieberman plan authorizes the Homeland \nSecurity Secretary to assign those functions that the Secretary deems \nappropriate.\n  The Congress should understand how the President plans to utilize \nthese assistant secretaries before it creates their positions. What's \nmore, it should define those responsibilities and functions in statute. \nUnder the Lieberman plan, the President can broadly define the role of \nan assistant secretary, outside of the law, and, after the appointee \nhas been confirmed by the Senate, the Secretary can alter that role, \nwithout regard to the intent of the Congress.\n  I would like to inquire for workers in the chemical industry and the \ntrucking industry just exactly who is going to determine how they are \nsupposed to deal with hazardous materials. Will the Transportation \nDepartment still make rules for trucking hazardous cargo or will all \nthat now fall under the purview of the new Department? Are chemical \nplants to be subject to the powers at Homeland Security or the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency or will all of these regulatory matters \nbe sorted out in arm-wrestling matches?\n  I do not believe that we have taken enough care in this bill to \nclearly define what we are authorizing the executive to do, and that is \nexactly how the President would have it. The administration wants us to \nbe careless in our legislation so it can be reckless in its \nimplementation. The administration does not want to be constrained by a \nspecific plan, whether crafted in the White House or in the Congress, \nbecause the administration does not want to be pinned down on the \ndetails of its policies or the specifics of its actions.\n  A favorite piece of reading material for this administration \napparently is ``Gulliver's Travels,'' where we read about the \nLilliputians. That is a great piece of literature; I have liked it over \nthe years. But we have heard various Secretaries in this administration \nand other high officials in this administration indicate that they are \nvery fretful, they are very irritated by the fact they are being asked \nto abide by certain rules. These have been longstanding rules. So the \nadministration does not want to be tied down by any rules. We have \nheard them tell the story of the Lilliputians a number of times. So \nthey do not want to be pinned down. This administration does not want \nto be pinned down by any rules, not pinned down on the details of its \npolicies or the specifics of its actions.\n  President Bush has pressured Congress to act quickly on his proposal, \ninsisting that because homeland security has become his top priority \nfor the Federal Government, Congress must immediately provide him the \nresources and flexibility that he is demanding.\n  The House of Representatives passed legislation approving most of the \nproposal only 38 days after he submitted it to Congress. The House of \nRepresentatives passed the legislation in 2 days. Why, it would take \nlonger than that in some communities in this Congress, some cities in \nthis country. It would take longer than that to get a sewage permit. It \nwould take longer than 2 days to get a sewage permit in some parts of \nthe country. And perhaps for good reason. They passed a piece of \nlegislation such as this with its far-reaching ramifications in 2 days \nin the other body.\n  I cannot see how either House of Congress can properly consider the \nmerits of a new Department of Government and the transfer of 28 Federal \nagencies in 1 month's time, especially when the stakes are so high. But \nhere we are with a bill before us; the clock is ticking.\n  I know Chairman Lieberman and his committee have spent many hours on \nthis bill. They have far more expertise on the subject matter than I \nhave. I am not a member of that committee. I am not a member of any \ncommittee that has jurisdiction over this subject matter per se. \nSenator Stevens and I were very concerned about some of the language in \nthe House bill, certainly, in his administration proposal, about what \nwould happen to the legislative process, how the constitutional \nprocess, the power of the purse, was being changed by the proposed \nlegislation. So Senator Stevens and I wrote to Senator Lieberman and to \nSenator Thompson and asked that change be made in their legislation \nbefore they reported it to protect the legislative process as we have \nknown it for over two centuries.\n  They worked hard. Senator Lieberman and Senator Thompson worked very \nhard to craft the best bill they could craft under the circumstances. \nThey have made a number of important improvements to the bill passed by \nthe House. I thank the committee again, as I have thanked the committee \nbefore on several occasions, and its staff, for their efforts. But the \nstakes are so high and I believe we would be better off if we took \nfurther opportunities to look at the details, to study the details, to \ntalk about ways to fill in the details. Let us remember with this \nlegislation the Senate will be shaping not only the mission and the\n\n[[Page S8720]]\n\nstructure of the new Department but also the relationship that Congress \nwill have with the Department during its lengthy transition period and \nthroughout the process of making and implementing homeland security \npolicy.\n  This legislation is going to be around quite a long time, in all \nlikelihood, and the protections that I am interested in having in this \nlegislation are protections for the rainy day, as well as for the day \nof sunshine, protections for our vital processes. These are the details \nthat will be with us a long time. Whether it is a Democratic \nadministration or a Republican administration, I should think we would \nall want to see what is best for the country, what is best for our \nchildren and grandchildren. If we are going to pass something, let it \nbe well thought out, knowing, as I do know, that this legislation is \ngoing to be around for a long time.\n  We have heard that the war on terrorism is going to be a long time in \nits duration. I don't doubt that. We have spent nearly $20 billion in \nAfghanistan thus far, and we don't know whether Bin Laden is alive or \ndead. So this will be around for a long time.\n  This President and his administration, hurrying today to just have us \nturn this matter over to them, may not be around. Who knows. This \nPresident may be here 2 more years after this year or he may be here 6 \nmore years or he may be here 8 more years. Who knows. Only God knows. \nThere may be a Democratic President, a Democratic administration, there \nmay be a Democratic House at some point. So I think we should not act \nwith our blinders on and act only for partisan reasons because at the \nmoment there is a Republican administration in the White House. We must \nnot hurry this through just to get a bill through, to meet a certain \ndate.\n\n  As Senator Lieberman and I and others have said, we need to do it \nright. That is what I assume is the responsibility of every Senator, to \ndo what he can to improve this bill, if it can be improved. I have \nnever seen a bill that came to the Senate floor that couldn't be \nimproved. Every appropriations bill that was reported to the Senate \nfloor by my Appropriations Committee, of which I am the chairman, is \nalways subject to amendments, and many amendments are offered and acted \nupon favorably. So we have room for improvement.\n  I do not come here as an adversary of Senator Lieberman. I do not \nthink my amendment is adversarial to his bill. I think that, even \nthough his bill is a great improvement over the House bill, there is \nroom for further improvement. That is not saying anything I think \nanyone would be offended by on his committee. I have heard of no such \noffense.\n  That is our job here, to do the best we can to come out at the end of \nthe day with the finest product, the best product this Senate is \ncapable of. We are talking about homeland security, the security of the \npeople in this country. We must recognize that there is real work to be \ndone by the Senate to make sure that all of the agencies are moved into \nthe Department and that it is all done in a responsible way.\n  I understand the eagerness to pass a strong bill in order to make a \nstrong statement. We all want to assure the public that we are acting \ndecisively to secure the public's safety. No one wants to be portrayed \nas standing in the way of greater security on American soil. President \nBush would have us believe he can simply create this Department out of \nthin air, as if by magic. It wasn't too long ago that this President \nand the Director of Homeland Security, Mr. Ridge, were saying: We don't \nneed another Department. Why have another Department? Why have another \nDepartment?\n  Well, that is a long story. We went about, up the hill and down the \nhill, on the business of having the Director of Homeland Security, Mr. \nRidge, come up before the Senate Appropriations Committee and testify \non the budget. And of course the administration put its foot down hard. \nThey didn't want that done. So we have sought that in that \nAppropriations Committee, Mr. Stevens and I--we have on one occasion \nput language into an appropriations bill requiring the Director of \nHomeland Security to be confirmed by the Senate.\n  When the administration saw that Mack truck coming down the road--\nthat bill was brought to the Senate, and it passed by a majority, a \ngreat majority; 71 Senators voted for it. Not one Senator objected to \nthat language. Not one Senator offered an amendment to strike that \nlanguage. So the administration saw that Mack truck coming and, lo and \nbehold, the administration decided: Oh, we have to get in front of that \nwave. And then they came up with this marvelous piece of brainwork. It \ncame from just four men in the bowels of the White House. They came up \nwith this marvelous piece of magic. And now they want it passed in a \nhurry to create this Department of Homeland Security--which, not too \nlong ago, as I say, the President did not seem to want, to create a \nHomeland Security Department, nor did Mr. Ridge.\n  Well, a little wave of his magic wand, a few magic words to the \npress, and poof, the President pulls a new Department out of his hat.\n  That is the old vaudeville stunt, a new rabbit out of the hat. Don't \nwatch my right hand, watch my left hand. Watch what my left hand is \ndoing. Don't pay any attention to my right hand. All of a sudden, he \npulls a rabbit out of the hat.\n  The President pulls a new department out of his hat. But after the \nPresident's sleight of hand is over and the smoke clears from the \nstage, the task of replacing political magic with real management will \nbegin.\n  I have often urged my colleagues to look to history as a guide to the \nfuture. There is much to be learned from the successes and the failures \nof our forefathers and we would do well to take the countenance of the \npast. I realize that everybody shares my love of history or see the \npast's connection with today and I am disappointed. But I am \ndisconcerted when we fail to learn from our own experiences.\n  Last October, nearly half the Senate was thrown into disarray as the \nHart Building was closed due to anthrax contamination.\n  I was shut out of my office. My staff were shut out of my office in \nthe Hart Building. Many Senators were shut out of their offices, barred \nfrom our mainframes, our fax machines, our files. Our staffs were \nrelocated, with new phones, new computers, new fax machines. Staff \nmembers couldn't reach each other, let alone our constituents. We \nscrambled to find ways to ensure a continuation of constituent \nservices.\n  We saw how difficult it was to set up new quarters and make our \noffices functional again. But this bill before us is our anthrax \nexperience many times over. And this time, the work that will be \ninterrupted may be work that would prevent the loss of thousands more \nlives in another terrorist attack. I think it is worth the time to \nensure that this agency is formed in the right way, from the ground up. \nWe should take the time to work out the kinks before launching it.\n  Like so many government reorganizations before it, this legislation \nlumps together a number of disparate agencies and slaps a new sign \nacross them. It does nothing to fill in the details of a very sketchy \nplan. It does nothing to resolve the inevitable problems that lie \nahead. It is an opportunity to get off the hook easily. Pass something; \nclaim the credit for passing the legislation in the upcoming election. \nThat is probably part of the idea--claim credit for that. Go out to the \nAmerican people and say: The Senate acted. We worked out a new plan. \nBut it does nothing to resolve the inevitable problems that lie ahead. \nBut I, for one, think we owe more to the American people than that. I \nthink we owe more to them than that.\n\n  If the aim here is only to speed implementation of homeland security \nmatters, let us do something to ensure that this administration and the \nCongress are not allowed to let development of the Department languish.\n  Most agree that we should act now to set the wheels in motion for a \nnew Department, but we should not kid ourselves about what we are doing \nwith this legislation.\n  The President and the Secretary of Homeland Security--if we pass the \nHouse bill--certainly will have the whole kit and caboodle. Congress \nwill just walk off to the sideline. And, to a certain extent, the same \nis true with the bill that has been adopted by the committee chaired so \nably by Mr. Lieberman.\n\n[[Page S8721]]\n\n  The President and the Secretary of Homeland Security will have to \ntransfer 28 agencies--some say 22, some say 30--create 6 new \ndirectorates, and coordinate information and resources from countless \nFederal, State, and local agencies and private corporations. The \nadministration expects Congress to hand over a blank check. They may do \nthat in some States. Maybe the President is accustomed to having it \nthat way in Texas. I do not know. I suppose there have been Governors \nin West Virginia who believed they might be entitled to a blank check \non something. But we are not talking about something at the State \nlevel. This is the Federal level, and it is the Federal Constitution to \nwhich we have to pay very close attention.\n  The Administration expects Congress to hand over a blank check to \ncraft this Department without additional guidance during \nimplementation.\n  This expectation is not only unrealistic, it is irresponsible.\n  If the Senate adopts the President's proposal without making further \nefforts to improve it, we will have copped out! If this Senate is not \nwilling to put in the time and attention that this new Department \nundoubtedly requires, I have to wonder whether we are really serious \nabout investing responsibly in a long-term federal response to homeland \nsecurity threats at all. I hope this is not all just for show!\n  Is that what it is? Is it all for show? Just rush the bill through so \nthat we can say to the voters: Oh, the Senate has passed the homeland \nsecurity bill. I hope it is not all for show.\n  The Senate must take a responsible approach toward enacting the \nPresident's proposal. If the Department of Homeland Security is worth \ndoing, it is worth doing right, and both Houses of Congress must act \ndeliberately to see that this Department gets up and running properly \nand expeditiously.\n  To ensure that all of these agencies and Federal workers are being \nmoved to the right places for the right reasons, we will have to set \nthe stage for our work after this bill is enacted. If we give the \nPresident blanket authority to transfer and reorganize these agencies \nwithout further action by Congress, the Department's transition will \ncertainly suffer under a clumsy, trial-and-error approach that has been \nthe death knell for so many other important government efforts before \nit. It will take a lot of work to get this Department where it needs to \nbe, and Congress should not buy in to the empty promises of a one-time \nfix for all of the federal government's homeland security functions. We \nmust sign up for the long haul now.\n  Any good carpenter knows that he will save himself a lot of headaches \nif he takes the time to measure twice and cut once. But in the midst of \nthis enormous building project we have undertaken to construct a new \ndepartment of government, no one is bothering to make even a rough \nmeasure of the actions we are taking.\n\n  Even if we wanted to do so, we would have nothing to measure against, \nbecause the President has not given us any workable blueprints laying \nout the architectural details of the Homeland Security Department. The \nPresident just shouts at us to keep building, because he wants a home \nfor his secret war as soon as possible.\n  And by including all of these hurried agency transfers in his \nproposal, President Bush is trying to move in the furniture into this \nnew home before he has even finished putting a roof over the \nDepartment. Given his success in pushing through his proposal, this may \ntruly be the house that George built, and, if we don't hold our own \nfeet to the flames, Congress will spend years making repairs to this \nhastily designed and poorly built structure. If his commitment to \nprotecting homeland security is not strong enough to endure \ncongressional involvement and public scrutiny, then our security is in \nserious jeopardy. And if the President's policies are not sound enough \nto survive the constitutional process, then we would probably be more \nsecure without them.\n  Securing the safety of the American people in their own homeland will \nbe the most important challenge of our time, and it will require \nresponsible leadership both from the White House and from the Congress. \nSuch leadership does not consist of hollow political solutions and \npublic relations campaigns. When the lives of our citizens are on the \nline, we have a duty to rise above public approval polls and make the \nhard decisions about how best to protect the country's long-term \ninterests. The President is asking us to establish the Department of \nHomeland Security without making these decisions, and without any clear \nevidence from the White House that he is willing to make the hard \ndecisions under the processes required by the Constitution.\n  Congress must require of the President and of itself more than a \nsingle, open-ended plan for a new department with broad authority and a \nvague mission. Congress cannot allow the President to conceal his \nfailure to produce a comprehensive homeland security strategy behind \nthe smoke and mirrors of ``managerial flexibility.'' If we are serious \nabout formulating a real response to these new threats, we must press \nahead to fill in all the details.\n  The amendment that I will be offering provides a process by which the \nCongress remains involved in implementation of the Department.\n  With the Byrd amendment, the Lieberman bill would immediately create \nthe superstructure for a new Homeland Security Department, including \nthe executive positions and directorates outlined in Title I of the \nLieberman substitute but require additional legislation to transfer the \nagencies, functions, and employees to the new Department.\n  The amendment that I shall offer would establish a process that would \nallow the Congress to act within the same implementation time frame--13 \nmonths--outlined by the House-passed bill and the Lieberman substitute.\n  Beginning on February 3, 2003, the Homeland Security Secretary would \nsubmit recommendations for legislation to the Congress, which would be \nreferred to the Governmental Affairs Committee in the Senate and the \nGovernment Reform Committee in the House, to transfer agencies, \nfunctions, and employees to the Directorate of Border and \nTransportation Protection; 120 days later, the Homeland Security \nSecretary would submit recommendations for legislation to transfer \nfunctions and agencies into the Directorate of Intelligence and \nDirectorate of Critical Infrastructure Protection; 120 days later, the \nHomeland Security Secretary will submit recommendations for legislation \nto transfer agencies and functions to the Directorate of Emergency \nPreparedness and Response and the Directorate of Science and \nTechnology.\n  The Byrd amendment gives Congress additional opportunities to work \nthrough the details about worker protections, civil liberties, privacy, \nsecrecy, and about which agencies and functions should be transferred \nto the new Department.\n  Additionally, the Byrd amendment would give Congress the opportunity \nto gauge and modify how the new Department is being implemented, while \nit drafts legislation to transfer additional functions and agencies. \nThe Byrd amendment would provide Congress with additional means to head \noff problems that traditionally plague and delay massive \nreorganizations.\n  I have defined as well as I could in this time my amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia [Mr. Byrd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4644.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak against the amendment \nwhich the distinguished Senator from West Virginia has offered. I do \nso, of\n\n[[Page S8722]]\n\ncourse, with great respect for him personally, for his record of \nservice to our country, for his record of leadership in the Senate, and \nfor all that this Senator--and I would say every Senator--learns from \nhim just about every day here.\n  I rise to speak against the amendment. I am going to try to speak \nclearly about why I feel so strongly against this amendment, but I \ncertainly hope the Senator from West Virginia will understand, and \ncolleagues as well, that I do it with great respect.\n  Senator Byrd has been good enough to express his appreciation for \nmany parts of the amendment which is the proposal that emerged from the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee, which I am privileged to chair, \nby a 12-to-5 bipartisan vote at the end of July. I appreciate those \nkind words.\n  But I must say that though Senator Byrd has said his intentions are \nnot adversarial to the committee-reported proposal for a Department of \nHomeland Security, it seems to me that adoption of Senator Byrd's \namendment would eviscerate our proposal. It would, as he has described \nit, create a superstructure, a kind of house--create the exterior of \nthe house--but there would not be much in the house. There might be an \nattic, with the Secretary and some of the executives up there, but \nnothing underneath for at least a year, and probably well beyond that, \nto better protect the security of the American people here at home.\n  So this amendment, though it preserves the superstructure, strikes at \nthe heart of what the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has been \nworking to bring forth for well over a year now.\n\n  We began our investigations on the problem of homeland security \nbefore September 11 of last year. We held hearings on matters related \nto homeland security before September 11. In fact, we had a hearing \nscheduled for September 12 on one aspect of homeland security, and we \nwent forward with it as best we could. Half the witnesses could not \nmake it to Washington.\n  We labored, in the weeks and months after September 11, holding 18 \ndifferent hearings. In October, Senator Specter and I, introduced--in \nOctober of 2001, almost a year ago--legislation to create a Department \nof Homeland Security. In fairness, that legislation was based, in good \npart, on the work of a citizens' commission headed by our former \ncolleagues Gary Hart and Warren Rudman. And they had been working on it \nsince the early part of 2000.\n  In May of this year, our committee reported that bill that Senator \nSpecter and I had introduced, together with a companion bill Senator \nGraham had introduced, amended and approved by the committee itself by \na 9-to-7 vote--unfortunately, a vote on partisan lines. All the \nDemocratic members voted for the bill. All the Republican members, at \nthat time, voted against it.\n  In June of this year--June 6, I believe it was--President Bush, after \nall the months before then in which the President and his \nadministration had said an Office of Homeland Security, as filled by \nGovernor Ridge, was enough to deal with the new challenges of homeland \nsecurity--changed his mind. And I admire him for that, and I appreciate \nthat. And I think he reached a conclusion that it would take more than \nan office--without statutory power, without budget authority--to meet \nthe challenge that terrorists placed on his shoulders, and ours, to \nprotect the security of the American people.\n  My friend and distinguished colleague from West Virginia said the \nPresident pulled this bill out of a hat. Well, if he pulled it out of a \nhat, it was a hat that belonged to the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee because so much of the proposal that the President ultimately \nmade is exactly the same as the bill that was reported out of our \ncommittee in May.\n  That is why I have said, all along, that probably 90 percent of the \nvarious proposals here--the committee proposal, the President's \nproposal--are in agreement with one another. And we are arguing over a \nsmall number of issues, not insignificant issues, but relatively small \nin number compared to all we agree on. We worked to take some of the \nideas the President had and added them to our bill. Still, it is mostly \nthe same bill as our committee reported out at the end of May.\n  Then at the end of July--July 24 and 25--we had two very productive, \nextensive days of committee deliberation, a so-called markup, in which \nwe were quite open to suggestions that had been made by Members of the \nSenate. I myself consulted with the various chairmen of relevant \ncommittees. Senator Thompson spoke to the ranking minority members, \nranking Republicans on the committees. We built a better package and \nreported it out on July 25. Not perfect. As the Senator from West \nVirginia quite accurately says, no legislation that is brought before \nthis Senate is perfect; it always can stand amendment, including this \nproposal.\n  But I must say again, with all respect, that the Byrd amendment would \nbasically pull out of the bill most of the hard work our committee has \ndone. It would again frame questions that our committee has worked now \nalmost a year to answer and has presented to the Senate our best \nconsidered judgment about what the answers to those questions should \nbe. And the basic question is, How can we best protect the security of \nthe American people after September 11 against terrorism and threats to \ntheir security?\n\n  Senator Byrd's amendment reminds me of those board games I played as \na child, and sometimes occasionally still do with children or \ngrandchildren, where, when you hit a certain box, they tell you to go \nback to the beginning and start all over again. That is what adoption \nof this amendment would do. It would obviate all the work we have done. \nIt would essentially say that the answers we came up with were not \nadequate. And it would establish a system where the administration, \nover the next year, would basically try to fill a house that is now \nempty in the Byrd amendment. Underneath the attic, where the Secretary \nand a few of the executives are, there is nothing to protect the \nsecurity of the American people.\n  The administration would be required to submit--beginning early in \nFebruary of next year, and every 4 months thereafter--proposals for \nfilling in that structure. But the requirements of the Byrd amendment \nsay that not earlier than February 3 of next year, and succeeding 120 \ndays thereafter, would the administration be able to submit the inner \nworkings of the Department. And there is no clear time limit as to when \nthis Department would be up and running.\n  I gather that the Senator has modified or will modify his amendment \nto say that Congress must act on the administration's proposals for \nwhat will happen in five of the six divisions of the Department by 13 \nmonths after the effective date of the underlying legislation--\nthat date chosen, I presume, 13 months, because our legislation says \nthat the full Department must be up and running 13 months after the \neffective date.\n\n  The passage of the Byrd amendment would give the American people no \nguarantee that they would have a Department of Homeland Security, \nprotecting them better than we protected them on September 11, in any \ntime that is measurable.\n  I have a personal sense of urgency. Senator Byrd has spoken to it. We \nwant to better protect the security of the American people. This is an \nimportant assignment we have taken on to create this Department. But \nthis is an assignment that comes with a sense of urgency.\n  The terrorists are out there. We read every day about it, either \nabout apprehensions or arrests of terrorists in various parts of the \nworld. As I have said before on the floor, we defeated the Taliban in \nAfghanistan. We disrupted the al-Qaida bases there. But so many of them \nfled, and they are out there. They are not an army that we can see as a \nconventional army on battlefields. They are not in ships that we can \nobserve at sea. They are hiding in the shadows of this world, in \nforeign countries, in our country. That is why I say that every day we \ngo without a better organization of the various critical departments \nthat are supposed to be protecting the homeland security of the \nAmerican people is a day of greater danger for the people.\n  It is with that sense of urgency that our committee has brought \nforward our proposal. And this amendment, if passed, would take the \nheart out of the\n\n[[Page S8723]]\n\nproposal and delay its implementation to a day that cannot be measured. \nThat is wrong. I oppose the amendment with the greatest respect but \nwith the greatest sincerity and intensity.\n  I ask my colleagues, any of whom are thinking about voting for this \namendment, to explain on the floor and to their constituents how they \ncould support this amendment and still say they are committed to the \ncreation of a Department of Homeland Security with a sense of urgency \nthat the reality of the terrorist threat requires.\n  This amendment would establish a Department of Homeland Security and \na Secretary with the missions and responsibilities virtually untouched. \nIt would also retain the basic administrative structure of the \nDepartment, as the Governmental Affairs Committee proposal has \nproposed.\n  The amendment also creates the same six directorates as in our bill, \neach to be headed by an Under Secretary. But as I have said, there is \nnothing else in this amendment within five of those six directorates. \nThe one exception is the Immigration and Naturalization Service \ndirectorate. There are no responsibilities, no mission statements \neffectively, no transferred agencies.\n  The amendment does call, as I have said, for the Secretary of the new \nDepartment to submit to Congress, over the course of the next year, a \nseries of legislative proposals to further the mission of the \nDepartment, including recommendations for the transfer of \n``authorities, functions, personnel, assets, agencies, or entities into \nthe various directorates.''\n  These proposals to be provided to the Congress by the Secretary would \nbe responsible for filling in the house. That includes not only the \nprecise list of agencies and programs to be transferred to the new \nDepartment but an enumeration of all the responsibilities of the new \nDepartment, including the fundamental policy decisions about the \nDepartment's most basic missions.\n  I have talked about the deadline for Congress to act. It is unusual, \nI say with some humility, for one Congress to attempt to bind another \nCongress to act. Is it enforceable? Can we have any sense of assurance, \nif the Byrd amendment passed, that Congress would act on the various \nproposals of the President 13 months after the effective day, which \nwould probably take us to 2004? I don't see that in this amendment. \nRemember, in the underlying committee proposal, the Department is \ncreated. The effective date of the legislation begins 30 days after it \nis signed and becomes effective. The Department begins to take shape. \nThe administration then has 12 months after that to complete the full \nimplementation of the new Department, to bring all the 170,000 \nemployees together to get the Department up and running, to overcome \nthe inefficiencies, to bridge the gaps that exist, to create the new \ndivisions of this Department that we desperately need.\n  As to intelligence, for instance, there is still no place in our \nFederal Government where all the proverbial dots are connected from law \nenforcement and intelligence. That is an urgent need we have.\n  If the committee's proposal is adopted, the new Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity would be authorized to do that immediately. All we say is by \nthe expiration of 12 months from the effective date of the legislation; \ntherefore, 13 months after the President's signature, all of this would \nbe completed.\n  Set that aside from what would happen in the case of the Byrd \namendment, in which the only guarantee we have is essentially a hope \nthat Congress will have acted on the administration's proposals 13 \nmonths after the Department is created. That is just not enough.\n  This is no time for us to replace the carefully considered bipartisan \nlegislation that emerged from our committee with this structure without \ncontent that may never turn into a genuine Homeland Security \nDepartment, with the power, the personnel, and the resources it needs \nto protect the American people from terrorism.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I did not want to interrupt the \ndistinguished Senator. I will be happy to wait until he finishes his \nstatement, but whenever he is ready to be interrupted, I would like to \nget his attention.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I would like \nto complete my statement. Then I will be glad to respond to any \ncomments or questions he has.\n  Let me make three general points about what troubles me about the \namendment.\n  First, the amendment destroys what might be called the holistic \ndesign of a new Department. By that I mean the whole will be greater \nthan the sum of its parts. Indeed, since the very beginning, the entire \npurpose of formulating this Department has been to create a cohesive \nand unified organization in which all the pieces fit together tightly \nwith all the other pieces. We have strived to bring to our legislation \na global understanding of the capabilities our Government has and the \ncapabilities it currently lacks. We have thought carefully about the \ninterrelationships of the different agencies and directorates that will \nmake up the Department.\n  The result, I am confident, is a Department in which the six \nconstituent divisions strengthen one another such that the whole is \ngreater than the sum of the parts. Splitting this Department into a \nnumber of separate pieces that will be created in organizational \nisolation from each other will undercut the wide angle focus that is \nnecessary for us to best meet the terrorist threat.\n  We will revert to essentially creating a number of different \ndivisions that are linked to one another in name but not necessarily in \nfunction. In the process, I fear the Byrd amendment will threaten one \nof the core purposes of a single Department of Homeland Security under \na unified chain of command; that is, namely, to leverage the benefits \nof bringing together these 28 different agencies and programs in a \nsynergy, in a way that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.\n  Pulling the pieces apart and rebuilding them will lose that \nunderstanding of our capabilities. Just think about the pieces of the \nnew Department that will need to work together every day. I cite the \nintelligence directorate again. It is going to communicate with the \ndirectorate on critical infrastructure protection and on border \ntransportation security, and it is going to need to develop threat \nassessment and threat dissemination systems and protocols.\n  The directorate on science and technology will need to learn from the \ndirectorate on emergency preparedness and response precisely what \ntechnologies are required at the Federal and local level, and then we \nwill have to develop an action plan to deploy those technologies. Every \ndirectorate in the organization will have to draw on the science and \ntechnology directorate's expertise for critical analysis and \ndecisionmaking regarding scientific or technical issues.\n  This Department should work like a carefully crafted machine with \ninterlocking gears. If we conceive of it as six separate gears turning \nin isolation from one another, we are going to drastically diminish its \neffectiveness. I fear the process that the Byrd amendment would set up \nwill do just that.\n  Second, I know there was a concern expressed on the floor and off the \nfloor that the committee's proposal for a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity fails to put in place adequate checks and balances on \nexecutive authority. I disagree. Those checks and balances and the \ndesirability of them in our system of government were very much in our \nmind as we proceeded with this legislation. In fact, we gained great \ninsight and assistance from Members of the Senate as we crafted this \nlegislation, particularly the senior Senators from West Virginia and \nAlaska who brought not only their considerable experience but their \nlove for the Senate and devotion to the concept of checks and balances, \nwhich assisted us in crafting our amendment.\n  So we have gone to great lengths to ensure that the Congress will \nremain actively engaged in the life of this Department--not just in the \ntraditional way in which Congress, in some senses, always has the last \nword, which is through the appropriations process, but through the \ntransition process as this legislation becomes law. We have very \nimportant work to do with the executive branch and the transition \nprocess of this new Department. We have to make sure the reorganization \nis proceeding apace. We have to make further changes in law, if and \nwhen such changes are needed. We have to finance\n\n[[Page S8724]]\n\nthe new Department, consistent with its needs, as determined in the \nfirst instance by the Appropriations Committees of both bodies and, of \ncourse, by the membership of both bodies. And we have to make sure that \ncritical, nonhomeland security functions of the constituent agencies \ndon't fall through the bureaucratic cracks.\n  That is why we have specifically required that the administration \ncome back to Congress at least every 6 months during the reorganization \nprocess to update us and the American people on the progress being made \nand, if necessary, to request that we make additional amendments and \nimprovements. The committee members are well aware of the complexity \nand the enormity of what we are proposing. So these required reports \nduring the reorganization process should give Congress an opportunity--\nour committee first and then Congress--to assess the progress and make \nnecessary adjustments.\n  The important point here is to get started. No one--least of all me--\nthinks this is going to be a perfect proposal. It will be a work in \nprogress. To make it progress as rapidly and perfectly as we want, we \nare going to have to work together--Executive and Congress--in making \nthat so. Our interest in guaranteeing proactive congressional oversight \nis spelled out in even more detail in our proposal.\n\n  Contrary to the President's proposal, which originally sought to give \nthe executive branch unchecked authority to reorganize the constituent \nagencies within the new Department and unprecedented power to move \nbetween 3 and 5 percent of funds appropriated to the constituent \nagencies of this Department, we have taken a very different path and \nrejected those requests from the administration. We will insist on the \naccountability of the appropriations process. We understand the \nConstitution gives Congress--and only Congress--the responsibility to \nappropriate the expenditure of the public's money.\n  So we have specifically rejected the administration's calls for \nbroad, unchecked power to move public money around without the consent \nof Congress. We have said that while the administration can reorganize \nagencies within the new Department to the extent that it does not \nconflict with existing law, if the administration wants to change \nexisting law, contrary to its proposal originally, we require it to \ncome back to us for approval to do that. Congress cannot delegate to \nthe Executive the authority to obviate statutes that are on our books \nwithout the consent of Congress. That, of course, is an affirmation of \nthe importance of ongoing congressional involvement in an approval of \nthe reorganization process.\n  I know Senator Byrd is concerned about the speed with which this is \nmoving forward. I believe this is not moving forward near rapidly \nenough. I know he has a historic and proud concern about Congress \nyielding too much authority to the executive branch, and I share that \nconcern. My strong reassurance to him, and to the other Members of the \nSenate, is that the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee proposal does \nwhat Congress has done since its creation, since its beginning, which \nis to legislate, create a new Department, but not to give that \nDepartment unchecked authority to go forward but to require it to come \nback for appropriations and require it to live within the law. And if \nit decides, as it goes forward, that it needs to alter the law, then, \nof course, it must come back to us and not be allowed to waive laws and \nrepeal them on its own, as it originally asked to do. Congress will \nremain, under our proposal--a careful, measured proposal--an active and \naggressive board of directors overseeing this merger every step of the \nway.\n  Third, this amendment is based on the faulty assumption that we have \nwritten our legislation hastily, without due consideration of exactly \nhow the Department ought to be structured. As I said at the outset, the \nfact is we have been working for nearly a year and, in some cases more \nthan a year, to determine what this Department should look like, and to \ndo everything humanly possible to prevent another September 11-type \nattack.\n  We have studied these issues exhaustively. We have considered the \nimplications rigorously, and we have written this legislation \ncarefully. Now, any Member of the Senate has the right, of course, to \ncome out and say that a given part of our proposal is not quite right \nand not what it should be, and that is what the amendment process is \nall about.\n  Of course, there have been many amendments filed that go exactly to \nthat point. What Senator Byrd's amendment does is to remove the \nfruits--all the fruits pretty much--from the tree, except the very few \nat the top, that we have nourished and worked so hard to cultivate over \nthis year.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, long before September 11, our \ncommittee had been interested in homeland security. In July of 2001, we \nheld a hearing on FEMA's role on managing bioterrorist attacks. In July \n2001, we had been studying whether our Government was adequately \norganized to protect critical infrastructure and, unrelated to the \nattacks, had scheduled a hearing on that subject for September 12. The \nday after the planes crashed into the Pentagon, the World Trade Center \nTowers and the field in Pennsylvania, that hearing was held in a \ncontext we never could have imagined.\n  About a year ago, we began crafting the precursor of the legislation \nwe are now considering. On October 11 of last year, Senator Specter and \nI introduced our bill to create a Cabinet-level Homeland Security \nDepartment. In May, we merged it with strong legislation that had been \nproposed in September by Senator Graham of Florida. And on May 22, we \nreported that legislation out of committee by a vote of 9 to 7.\n  Since the President announced his support for a Department of \nHomeland Security on June 6, we have worked closely and collaboratively \nwith committee chairs and ranking members, with fellow members of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee without regard to party, with experts in \nthe field, and with the White House.\n  We have incorporated bipartisan proposals for restructuring the INS \nand reforming the civil service system--the first proposed by Senators \nKennedy and Brownback; the second proposed by Senators Akaka and \nVoinovich--drawing on years of effort to build a consensus on those key \nissues.\n  All told, we held in our committee 18 hearings and heard from 85 \nwitnesses on these issues. Every step of the way, we have been open to \nand accepted sensible compromises and incorporated new ideas \nrecommended by people inside and outside the committee based on merits, \nbased on the purpose of this legislation, based on the urgency post-\nSeptember 11 of protecting the security of the American people.\n  The bill that emerged from this process earned the strong bipartisan \nsupport of the Governmental Affairs Committee. In 2 days of work on \nJuly 24 and 25, we debated the legislation, we incorporated many \namendments, and we endorsed it by a bipartisan vote of 12 to 5.\n  In essence, this legislation--its core elements anyway--have now been \napproved twice by the Governmental Affairs Committee. That is not a \nhasty process. That is work that has been done by the committee over a \nlong period of time.\n  I must say, as I consider Senator Byrd's amendment, I am reacting as \na proud chairman, one who has worked very hard with members of both \nparties in committee to bring forth this legislation. It is not \nperfect. It is open to amendment. Let the body have its will. But I ask \nSenator Byrd and any other Member of the Senate, chairman or ranking \nmember, to think how they would react if, after having worked so hard \non a piece of legislation that they believe is urgently needed in the \ninterest of the security of the American people, they were faced with \nan amendment that took most of it out. It would be as if an \nappropriations subcommittee bill came to the floor and a Senator got up \nand kept the sum total but switched all the money around or, more \nrelevant, said: A little bit at the top can be spent; the rest cannot \nbe spent until the administration comes back next year and tells us how \nthey want to spend it.\n\n  If I am feeling deeply about this amendment, with all respect to its \nsponsor, it is because I feel deeply about the need for a Department of\n\n[[Page S8725]]\n\nHomeland Security as soon as possible. Each directorate has taken shape \nover time as we proposed them to respond to the best evidence of what \nwill work from experts and from colleagues.\n  We began with a model that closely resembled what was proposed in the \nHart-Rudman Commission on National Security in the 21st century, which \nitself was the product of 3 years of work and the insight of many of \nthe top national security minds in our Nation. That was our first \nframework.\n  Then in the months that followed, we drew on the lessons learned from \nour hearings and from countless other reports and hearings and from \nadditional hours of staff research on these issues to refine and \nimprove the initial vision of the Department. We collaborated closely \nwith our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. And since June, when \nPresident Bush announced his support for this Department, we have \nworked with the White House in incorporating parts of its ideas into \nthis proposal.\n  Each directorate evolved as we tried to bring together just the right \nagencies and offices needed to counter the terrorist threat at home. \nThat is why I say that the Byrd amendment is like a children's board \ngame: When you hit a certain box, it says: Go back to the beginning and \nstart again.\n  That is awfully frustrating for Senator Thompson and me and other \nmembers of our committee who have worked so hard to put these \ndirectorates together.\n  The directorate on border and transportation security, for example, \nstarted out with a blueprint very similar to that recommended by the \nHart-Rudman Commission. It included the Coast Guard, Customs, and the \nBorder Patrol. But over time, in our committee, we came to be educated \nand to a conclusion that the original proposal was not adequate, was \nnot complete.\n  We heard from experts that the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nServices, in the U.S. Department of Agriculture, had a critical role at \nports and borders and ought to be integrated with the other agencies. \nSo we moved APHIS into the directorate.\n  We were persuaded the entire INS should also be brought over to \nensure ongoing coordination with all immigration and border activities \nand between immigration enforcement and services. So we brought INS \ninto the new Department while subjecting it to the substantial \nbipartisan restructuring it desperately needed, according to the \nKennedy-Brownback legislation, and giving it accountability--because \nmost everybody agrees that the INS is an agency that is not functioning \nas we want it to--by placing it in its own directorate with direct \naccess to the Secretary and the Under Secretary of the new Department.\n  As another example, the directorate on emergency preparedness and \nresponse began, again, in accordance with the Hart-Rudman \nrecommendations, with FEMA at its core. But over time, the directorate \nwas expanded to include other vital offices with a central role in \npreparing for and responding to potential terrorist attacks: the Select \nAgent Registration Enforcement Program, which plays a central role in \nthe wake of public health emergencies; the Strategic National \nStockpile, the Office of Domestic Preparedness from the Department of \nJustice, the Office of Emergency Preparedness from the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, and so on. Each addition was carefully \nconsidered and made in specific response to concerns raised by experts \nin the field to fill a demonstrated need in the new Department.\n  Adoption of the Byrd amendment would extinguish all of that work and \nsay: Let's start again.\n  Consider the evolution of our new independent directorate of \nintelligence. We appreciated the attention paid to intelligence \ncapabilities in the President's initial proposal, but working together \nwith the chair and the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Graham of Florida and Senator Shelby of Alabama, and Senator \nSpecter of Pennsylvania, who made some very substantial contributions \nto this effort, we concluded we needed to go further to give the new \nDepartment the tools it needs to detect danger and prevent attacks \nagainst the homeland. Again, we were advised over and over again in our \nhearings that in this difficult, awful business of fighting terrorism, \nthe best defense really is an offense, and the offense is intelligence, \nto know through our considerable intelligence community effort and our \nlaw enforcement effort, nationally, and at State, county, and local \nlevels of government, to be able to gather all that information, put it \ntogether on that one proverbial board so the same sets of eyes see it \nand they have the capacity to see a pattern which will tell them a \nthreat is coming, and that they will act, therefore, to stop that \nthreat before it happens.\n\n  Our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee have come to a point in \ntheir investigations of September 11 where they--I have not heard the \nresults. Maybe they have not been published yet. There were some early \nsuggestions of reports in the morning papers, but this afternoon there \napparently has been a report on the gaps in the sharing of information, \nlimited by old and no-longer-acceptable bureaucratic barriers.\n  We created a division, a directorate of intelligence, not to collect \nmore intelligence but to receive it from everybody, so that those eyes, \nwhich are the public's protectors, can look at the information so they \nwill have the maximum opportunity to perceive threats before they occur \nand act offensively to stop them.\n  Our proposal has already grown and adapted, therefore, over time to \nthe best arguments and the best evidence. Of course, further refinement \nwill be necessary as we go down the road, but I am deeply convinced \nthat our committee has presented to the Senate a strong, workable \nstructure, which is full of exactly the kinds of agencies and \ncombinations the American people need to protect them.\n  The frightful facts of September 11 tell us that our Government was \nnot doing enough to protect the security of the American people, and \nthe terror- \nists took advantage of those vulnerabilities. It requires a Department \nof Homeland Security, up and running as quickly as possible, to close \nthose gaps and eliminate those as a result of those vulnerabilities.\n  A Member of the other body, Representative Thornberry, played a very \nactive and supportive role in similar legislation. To his credit, in \nearly 2001 he introduced his own legislation in the House creating a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, well before September 11, 2001. \nCongressman Thornberry testified before our committee on April 11 of \nthis year, and he said to us:\n\n       We must resist the temptation to study a problem, this \n     problem, to death.\n\n  I believe he is right. We have studied enough. We have deliberated \nenough. We have seen the consequences of our disorganization more \ngraphically and horrifically than we ever could have imagined. Now we \nmust turn our thoughts into action.\n  In fact, in response to the suggestion that we are going too fast, I \nsay just the opposite. We have already taken too long as a legislature \nto begin to fix these problems. We have been living with the threat of \nterrorism for years. The scale has never approached, of course, the \nhorror of September 11, but there were those who warned us that day, \nSeptember 11, was coming. We knew the collapse of the Soviet Union was \ncoinciding with the rise of other enemies, including subnational \nenemies; that advanced technology would too easily fall into their \nhands. We knew they were plotting. We suffered deadly attacks, both at \nhome and abroad.\n\n  It is time now to act. If we wait to attempt reform any longer, if we \ndelay, as this amendment would effectively do, I believe we will not \nhave fulfilled our responsibility to the American people. The threat is \nnot going to vanish overnight. It is not going to give us the time this \namendment would require to contemplate perfect reforms. We have no \nchoice but to balance this reorganization with the ongoing efforts to \nstrengthen our homeland defense capabilities.\n  The fact is the advances we have made since September 11 have been, \nin some senses, in spite of the system, not because of it, because the \nsystem remains terribly disorganized and inefficient. The fact is that \nwe need to act now. That is why I oppose this amendment.\n  We have taken a year to deliberate and made dozens of difficult \ndecisions about what kind of department we want to create. This debate \nhas been\n\n[[Page S8726]]\n\nproductive thus far on the committee's proposal overall. I am pleased \nthe majority leader filed a cloture petition yesterday which will ripen \ntomorrow, because it is time to begin to narrow the debate--not to \nclose it off but to narrow it--so we can see an end point by which this \nbody can act.\n  This amendment would force us to start again, forcing us to revisit \nevery arduous decision we have already made without a clear end date by \nwhich the American people could have some sense of security that a \nDepartment would be up and working to protect their security.\n  Last year, former Senator Hart, who worked with former Senator \nRudman, was so instrumental in our committee's proposal and the White \nHouse proposal. I heard Senator Byrd refer to those four men who were \nsitting in the basement of the White House secretly crafting the \nPresident's proposal. I apologize for the immodesty of this, but I do \nso on behalf of our committee. When one looks at the product of their \nlabor, the better part of it--that is to say volume, the larger part of \nit--is taken from the bipartisan work done by the Hart-Rudman \nCommission and then by our committee.\n  Senator Hart told our committee in a hearing we held:\n\n       This is a daunting task. But we owe it to our children to \n     begin. It would be a mistake of historic proportions to \n     believe that protection must await retribution, that \n     prevention of the next attack must await punishment for the \n     last. We can and must do both. For like death itself, no man \n     knoweth the day when he will be held accountable and none of \n     us knows how quickly the next blow will be delivered. I \n     believe it will be sooner rather than later. And we are still \n     not prepared.\n\n  I agree with every word. I say to the occupant of the chair, Senator \nHart's comments not only show he bears the marks of a good law school \neducation but he also went to Yale Divinity School for a period of \ntime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, the question to the Senator from \nConnecticut is on the issue of the timeliness of action by Congress. My \nquestion is: Does the Senator from Connecticut think it important to \nmove--even on an earlier day, when the Senator from Connecticut \nintroduced legislation last October for homeland security, which sat on \na back burner, having been resisted by the President, the issue having \nsat on the back burner until the President endorsed the concept of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security--but does the Senator from Connecticut \nbelieve that too much time has elapsed already?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator from Pennsylvania, this \nSenator does, indeed, believe too much time has elapsed already in \nbetter organizing the Federal Government to protect the security of the \nAmerican people at home.\n  In October of last year, I believe October 11, 2001, the \ndistinguished Senator from Pennsylvania and I introduced a proposal to \ncreate a Department of Homeland Security, very much similar to the \nproposal that is before the Senate, though it has been revised and \nimproved as it has gone along the way.\n  I have said it with some pride and gratitude that the President, when \nhe made his proposal on June 6, took a lot from the work that our \ncommittee had done; I don't begrudge that because the President's \nendorsement of this proposal, which had been our committee's proposal, \nin fact, put it on the road to passage.\n  I hope we can find a way to come to a consensus on the great majority \nof this bill which most Members agree on and get it passed and not let \nthe relatively small number of issues that divide us stop us from doing \nthat quickly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have one more question, if the Senator will yield, and \nthe question is on the issue of having under one umbrella the analysis \nof all of the intelligence branches--CIA, FBI, Defense Intelligence \nAgency, National Security Agency--on the issue that there were enough \ndots on the board prior to September 11, that had they been connected, \nthere might have been a veritable blueprint if you put together the \nJuly FBI report from Phoenix about the young man taking flight training \nwith Osama bin Laden's picture in his apartment, and the two al-Qaida \nmen who went to Kualai Lumpur, the hijackers known to the CIA and not \ntold to the FBI or INS or the NSA report, on September 10 that there \nwould be an attack the next day, not even translated until September \n12, and the information in the computers of Zacarias Moussaoui having \nbeen obtained with an appropriate warrant under the Intelligence \nSurveillance Act.\n  There was a veritable blueprint for what happened on September 11 and \nthere is urgency, urgency, urgency as we speak to get the intelligence \nagencies to act together and to coordinate the analysis so we may have \nas full a picture as possible.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator from Pennsylvania, the \nSenator is absolutely right. The Senator from Pennsylvania has been a \nleader in congressional involvement and oversight of intelligence, I \nbelieve serving as chairman of the Intelligence Committee for a period \nof time. Again here he was very constructive and helpful in this \ncommittee's creation of the directorate of intelligence as we have \ncreated it.\n  I have met, as have many Members of the Senate, as has the occupant \nof the chair, with families of people who were lost, who were killed on \nSeptember 11. They ask the gnawing question, which we would ask if we \nwere them, and we should ask ourselves: How could this have happened? \nHow could September 11 have happened? And one of the most painful \nanswers is that if we had our intelligence and law enforcement agencies \nbetter coordinated it might not have happened. The Senator from \nPennsylvania spoke eloquently to that.\n  The truth is, on September 11 there was no single place on which all \nthe information would be brought together, from the intelligence \ncommunity, from the law enforcement community. There is still no such \nplace. So we remain more vulnerable than we should. This Department \nwould create a director of intelligence that would do exactly that for \nthe first time in our history. If we did nothing else with the \nDepartment--and the proposal does a lot else--that would be a \nsubstantial step forward in the protection of security of the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Senator both for his questions and for his very \nconsequential contributions to this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                amendment no. 4673 to amendment no. 4644\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the establishment of the Department of \nHomeland Security, an orderly transfer of functions to the Directorates \nof the Department, and for other purposes)\n  Mr. REID. I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. REID] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4673 to Amendment No. 4644.\n\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe the clerk earlier read, when I offered the \namendment, the clerk misstated the number to be 4644. Has that now been \ncorrected? It was No. 4641, which I think the clerk stated, but the \namendment is numbered 4644.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, it is 4644.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I do not intend to take the floor long, but I had \nunderstood that Mr. Lieberman would allow me to address some questions \nto him at a point while he held the floor. He must have let that slip \nhis mind because he yielded to others, which is all right; I want him \nto do what he wants to if they have questions to ask, and now I have \nthe floor. I will address just a few of the points that the \ndistinguished Senator had.\n  Of course, the distinguished Senator has pride in the work of his \ncommittee, under his chairmanship and under the\n\n[[Page S8727]]\n\ncochairmanship of the ranking member, Mr. Thompson. Of course he has \npride. And he has great expertise, his committee does, certainly, with \nall the Members of it, great expertise in the subject matter of the \nlegislation.\n  I am not on that committee. I said that before. I come as just an \nordinary Senator. I am not a member of the committee. I am not an \nelected part of the leadership. I am President pro tempore by virtue of \nmy long service here in my party and in the Senate, but I am an upstart \nwhen it comes to this legislation. I just came in the house out of the \nrain. I can understand the distinguished Senator's pride in his work. \nWho wouldn't be proud after spending all these months? I know that he \nis proud. But are we supposed to accept a piece of legislation without \namending it because of the pride of authorship of a chairman of the \ncommittee, or any other Senator?\n  The distinguished Senator has asked me, as the chairman of my \ncommittee, how would I feel about bringing a piece of legislation--I \nthink my words are being spoken in the spirit of what I think the \nSenator was saying. Unlike most other Senators, I cannot write down \nrapidly, quickly, what Senators are saying. I have a little trouble \nremembering exactly what they said, and if I misstate the portent of \nhis question to me during his statement, I would be happy if I were \ncorrected. I understood the distinguished chairman of the committee \nwhich has jurisdiction over the pending matter, I understood him to ask \nme, as chairman, how would I like to bring a bill out of my committee \nto the floor that has a certain amount of moneys for this and for that \nand had funds, line items, for certain programs, certain projects, how \nwould I like it if someone offered an amendment to take all that away \nand change that to direct those funds to some other agencies.\n  I assure Members I would like for that work of my committee, along \nwith Senator Stevens and the other 13 Republican members and the other \n14 Democratic members, to be taken as something that did not, was not \nworthy of the attention of the Senator and to take all that and just \ngive a blank check. Instead of allocating the moneys the committee had \ndetermined in the ways that the committee had determined, the \nAppropriations Committee had determined, just change it all and say \nmake it a blank check. No, I wouldn't like that. And I don't like the \nblank check that we are about to give the administration in this bill.\n\n  The distinguished Senator says he has pride in the work of the \ncommittee and doesn't want to see it changed. He would hope it would \nnot be changed by my amendment, certainly, he says.\n  What did the distinguished Senator and his committee do? They wrote a \nblank check, as it were. They say to the administration: Here, we will \npass this bill, and we are going to turn it over to you, lock, stock, \nand barrel. We are going to move off to the sidelines, and you can do \nit as you will. Here are the bureaus. Here are the directorates. Here \nis the superstructure, they say. Now give to the administration, over \nthe next 13 months, without any further action by the Congress, the \ntransfer of these various agencies, functions, and employees into the \nnew Department. It is yours. We will have no further say in it.\n  Oh, you can come up. You can come before us and submit reports and \nall that. But by this law we are passing, that is all you can do, and \nit is all we will do. Here it is. Take it all. You have a blank check.\n  No, I wouldn't want to have someone take an appropriations bill that \ncame out of my committee and strike out all of the line items, all of \nthe provisions, all of the functions and money for functions, and so \non, and say just give them a blank check. No, I am not for that. But \nthat is what is being done by the bill of the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut. His is striking out the details which my amendment \nwould write in. My amendment would keep the Congress involved. Congress \nwould have oversight, and time and again we would require, in my \namendment, that the administration make its recommendations for \nlegislation and those recommendations would go back to the committee, \nchaired by Mr. Lieberman, and he would have an opportunity to take a \nnew look at it and review it. Congress could conduct oversight.\n  But he is not going to allow that under his proposal. He is going to \nsay: Here it is. Mr. President, we are not going to fill in the dots. \nWe leave all that to you. You have 13 months in which to do it. You \nhave 13 months to fill in the dots, fill in the details, determine \nwhich agencies will go into the Department, and there it is.\n  Also, the distinguished Senator talks about the agencies. Yet the \ndistinguished Senator and his committee, they don't determine the \nagencies, what agencies will go into the Department. They don't \ndetermine those. I don't know right now what agencies the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut is talking about.\n  Now the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, who is still on the \nfloor, I hope--I would love for him to stay, to remain so I can respond \nto the points he has made and the questions he has asked. He says the \nByrd amendment strikes at the heart of the Lieberman bill. I would like \nto know how it strikes at the heart of the Lieberman bill. It improves \nand strengthens the Lieberman bill.\n  He says the Byrd amendment would pull out of the bill most of the \nwork the committee has done.\n  Why, it doesn't do that at all. I will tell you what is pulled out of \nthe bill, a good bit of the work that was in the Lieberman bill. The \nThompson amendment struck titles II and III from the Lieberman bill. \nThat is what pulled a lot of the heart out of the bill. I didn't do \nthat. I didn't strike titles II and III. My amendment doesn't strike \ntitles II and III. They are already out of the bill. That was done by \nthe amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. \nThompson. That is what struck the heart out of the bill.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut--I am trying to read my \nown feeble handwriting--says there is a sense of urgency to get on with \nthis matter.\n  There have been some who have been referring to this bill as the \ngreatest reorganization since the National Security Act of 1947. \nSomeone just the other day, maybe it was the President--I might be \nwrong. If I am wrong, I hope someone will correct me--who was comparing \nthis reorganization with the reorganization of the Defense Department, \nof the military, the creation of the Defense Department in 1947, saying \nthat is the role model. Someone said that is the role model, the \ncreation of the National Security Act, pulling these various military \nagencies into one department, the Department of Defense.\n  If that was the role model, if that is the ideal, then how long did \nit take for the National Security Act to pull these agencies together? \nHow long did it take Congress to pull these agencies together, working \nwith the President and working, by the way, with the military in this \nGovernment? It took 4 years. There were many bills offered in Congress. \nCommittees did much work on that matter. It wasn't done overnight. It \nwasn't done in a week. It wasn't done in a month or 6 months. It took \nyears, 4 years.\n  I can't understand why someone would say: Oh, we have done all this \nwork. Of course, the committee has done a lot of work. I have already \nindicated to the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, I know his \ncommittee has put a lot of work in on this bill. But after he has laid \nout a litany of actions, a litany of hearings, and so on and so on, all \nof that doesn't really compare with the time that was put into the \ncreation of the National Security Act, the creation of the Defense \nDepartment.\n  So here I can't understand all of this talk about a sense of urgency \nin this bill because it wasn't too long ago that the President was \nsaying why do we need it? We don't need a new Department, and so was \nMr. Ridge saying the same thing.\n  The distinguished Senator from Connecticut says this is a work in \nprogress. So apparently the work in progress is going to be done by the \nadministration over the next 13 months.\n  My amendment seeks to flesh out the Department, flesh out the \ndirector- \nates, and do it in an orderly way and \nwith Congress conducting oversight throughout.\n  So I have listened with great interest to the distinguished Senator \nand his defense of this bill. But I say that any time a bill comes out \nof my committee\n\n[[Page S8728]]\n\non appropriations, I expect it to be amended. And it isn't because I \ntake pride in the authorship and the work of the committee that I fight \nanother amendment. I never oppose another amendment simply on that \nbasis, that my committee has conducted hearings. We conducted 5 days of \nhearings on the homeland security budget earlier this year.\n  But I am always expecting amendments to be offered. I don't oppose \nanother amendment just on that basis. After all, the idea here is to \nimprove the work product. That is why the Senate is one of the two \ngreatest upper bodies ever created. It is why the Senate is the premier \nupper body of the world today. It has unlimited debate, and it has the \nright to amend. But to hand it over to the administration, lock, stock, \nand barrel, and say, Here it is, here is the superstructure, here we \nprovide for some under secretaries, assistant secretaries, and deputy \nsecretaries--and, of course, it doesn't have title I or title II. That \nwas taken out by the fine Senator on the Republican side of the aisle. \nThose two titles have been eliminated. They were moved out of this \nbill, and I am so proud those two titles are gone. They are gone.\n  Here it is, lock, stock and barrel, and you take it and fill it out. \nYou have 13 months in which to do it. Here it is. Take it and fill it \nup. This is the Byrd amendment. I don't want that because that would \nfill in some of the details. Congress, the representatives of the \npeople, would fill in the details, some of the details with the \ndirectorates.\n  I am sorry the distinguished Senator from Connecticut is totally, I \nwould say, misapprehensive of my amendment. It plainly states what it \nwill do. I am sorry. He is a good lawyer. He can take the easy side of \nthe debate and make a different case. He can take an apple, shine it \nup, and make it so you would think it were an orange. He is a good \nlawyer. I don't speak disrespectfully of him. There are lots of good \nlawyers in this country. He is trying to tell the American people that \nthe Byrd amendment would rip the heart out of his amendment. It doesn't \ndo that. It makes his proposition better.\n  I think the Senator wonders about the 13-month deadline. I have said \nthat my amendment would complete the action in the Department and \ndirectorates, and the very agencies--although I don't know what \nagencies there are. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut hasn't \nyet told us what agencies are going to be put into the directorates.\n  Here is the legislation, my amendment that says, yes, the whole thing \nwill be completed in the same time period--namely, 13 months roughly--\nthat obtains in the case of the Lieberman proposal. Here is the \nlanguage. Subsection (e), ``Deadline for Congressional Action: Not \nlater than 13 months after the date of enactment of this act, the \nCongress shall complete action on all supporting and enabling \nlegislation described under subsection (a), (b), or (c).''\n  There it is. In the meantime, we would fill in the details. Congress \nwould have its hand on the throttle as we went forward in filling out \nin these various five directorates in title I.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. As I have heard the Senator read this last section \nfrom his amendment, it seems to me that what it requires is that \nCongress finish its action on proposals made by the administration, \nfill in the blanks in the five directorates within 13 months--not that \nthey would actually be up and running--whereas the underlying committee \nproposal requires that the full Department be implemented no later than \n13 months after the President signs. And presumably substantial chunks \nof it would be implemented before.\n  My fear, naturally, is that not only has the Senator, I repeat, taken \nthe heart out of our proposal but that there is no clear date in the \nSenator's amendment by which Members of the Senate or the American \npeople can have confidence that there will actually be a Department of \nHomeland Security.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, may I respond to the distinguished \nSenator? It is all going to be in the Senator's hands, under my \namendment. My amendment would require the Secretary to send up to the \nCongress his recommendations for implementing and filling in the \ndirectorates.\n  What will happen when those recommendations come to Congress? They \nwill be under the jurisdiction of the committee that is chaired so ably \nby the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. It is all going to be in \nthe Senator's hands. I will trust the Senator to work in his committee \nto get those details and recommendations, to weigh them, vote them up \nor down, amend them, and report to the Senate.\n  As I have indicated so many times, I am perfectly willing and will be \nglad to help work out some expedited procedures whereby this will be \ndone.\n  The whole matter will be in the Senator's hands. I would trust the \nSenator from Connecticut and his committee far more than I would trust \nthat crowd down on the other end of the avenue. I am talking about the \nOMB Director, and others. I trust the Senator. I take my hat off to \nthis Senator from Connecticut.\n  When we say that on February 3 something will happen, on June 3 \nsomething will happen, on October 1 something will happen, and in the \nmeantime these matters will go to the committee chaired by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, we trust that Senator to see that the work is done, \nthat it gets done. I don't trust those at the other end of the avenue \nwho will have the thing handed to them, lock, stock, and barrel--take \nit all; take it all.\n  I hope the Senator knows I trust him and I have great faith that he \nand his committee will expedite this action, that they will do a much \nbetter job, will keep the hand on the wheel, and the American people to \nwhom the distinguished Senator has so properly referred will be much \nbetter protected. I think they would much more trust the elected \nrepresentatives who are involved on that committee to do a good job and \nto see that the work is more expeditiously done.\n  Finally, I will say this: My amendment expedites the work of creating \nthis Department--expedites; doesn't delay but expedites. Read the \namendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, responding to the Senator from West \nVirginia, I thank him for his trust that we will be able to get the \nwork done next year. But the Senator from Connecticut believes that the \ncommittee I am privileged to chair has gotten the work done, and that \nis what we have presented to the Senate.\n  The Senator's amendment would not expedite our work. It would in fact \nblock it. It would stop it from implementation. It would extinguish all \nwe have done in these five areas.\n  I said in my earlier remarks that the committee and I certainly have \nno claim to perfection. Amendments are in order. As the Senator from \nWest Virginia has said, it is the greatness of this body. And the \nSenator obviously has a right to submit the amendment that he has, and \nI respect him. I have a responsibility to my constituents, to my \ncommittee, and to my conscience to describe it. With all respect, it \nappears to me to be an evisceration of what our committee has done. One \nmight just as well vote against the committee's proposal to support the \namendment of the Senator from West Virginia. That is how conclusive I \nthink it is.\n  As I have said, it sort of builds that structure and has a few people \nup in the attic but nobody underneath really working. A few people in \nthe attic are the Secretary and the Under Secretary, but nobody \nunderneath.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will Senator yield?\n  Who are the people underneath in the Senator's amendment? I will tell \nyou who the people are underneath. They are people I am afraid of. The \npeople underneath in the Senator's amendment--I am looking at that \nchart. I am going to ask to have a chart from my office brought up, \ntoo.\n\n  It is the people underneath I am afraid of. The people underneath are \ndowntown. They are the people who are saying: Let's get on with it. \nLet's pass this bill and give the President flexibility, and all this \nstuff.\n  I trust the people underneath, if it is Senator Lieberman's \ncommittee. I trust them, if they are underneath. That is why I put them \nfront and center in my amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, responding to the Senator from West Virginia, \nthe\n\n[[Page S8729]]\n\nauthority we would give to this administration if--and I hope when--we \nadopt a bill creating a Department of Homeland Security is no different \nthan Congress gave, I believe it was, the Carter administration during \nwhich the Department of Energy was created. It created the Department \nand gave President Carter and his administration the opportunity to \nadminister it. We maintain the power of appropriations and oversight.\n  That is exactly what we would be doing here as a result of \nsuggestions made by the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nAlaska to our committee and components we included at their suggestion \nin our committee proposal. We have rejected attempts by the \nadministration to have more authority over appropriations and \nreorganization.\n  So I wanted to just say--\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator. I thank the Senator for doing that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the \nsuggestions because I thought they had great merit.\n  I just want to say this is a chart which describes who is under \nthere. As I said in my remarks, we worked real hard on this. Under the \nDirectorate of Border and Transportation Protection, the Customs \nService; Animal, Plant and Health Inspection Service from the \nDepartment of Agriculture; the Transportation Security Administration; \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center--these are people we trust.\n  You and I agree these are people the administration seems to want to \ndeprive of some of their existing civil service protections.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. Let me ask the Senator a question. In what titles of \nthe bill does the Senator deal with this on the chart?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will come back and check the exact--\n  Mr. BYRD. He doesn't do it in title I, does he?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. No. Titles II and III, incidentally, are in the White \nHouse office.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know. These charts here, all this work the distinguished \nchairman is talking about, all these items, these agencies that he has \non these charts, these are not the people underneath that are created \nby title I, are they?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes. They are in fact created by title I. These are \nexisting agencies that are brought from where they are now to be \ncoordinated in the Department. The exception--\n  Mr. BYRD. How do we know those agencies are among the 28 agencies \nthat are going to be brought into the Department?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding to the Senator from West Virginia, they are \nquite literally transferred--I mean, literally--in the legislation that \nwe have put before you from our committee. Each one of these is spelled \nout and assigned to the particular directorate which the chart shows it \nis located under.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would the Senator from Connecticut show the Senator from \nWest Virginia and the Senate where my amendment takes those very \nagencies out?\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, as I read your amendment, in the Directorate of \nBorder and Transportation Protection, what your amendment would do is \nfirst remove the definition of the mission of that directorate, and \nthen it would eliminate all this underneath and say to the executive \nbranch: Come back--incidentally, not by February 3, but not before \nFebruary 3--and tell us what you want in this directorate. The same is \ntrue of the Critical Infrastructure Directorate or the Emergency \nPreparedness and Response Directorate.\n  So everything below what I have called the attic is eliminated, and \nbasically these are generals without soldiers. These are admirals \nwithout sailors. They are just the top executives, and they have to \nwait until the administration makes the recommendations--not before the \ndates which you have set, and until the Congress acts. And we know \nCongress has a lot of ways to not act, if it chooses not to.\n  So the Senator may disagree with the structure, obviously. That is \nnot only his right, I understand if he does, but this was our best \njudgment as to how to make homeland security work.\n  I just say that I do believe your amendment takes the heart out of \nour recommendation and delays drastically the date by which we would \nhave a Department of Homeland Security protecting the American people. \nThat is why I oppose it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I appreciate what the distinguished Senator says. We \nhave only to look at some of the--let's take the agency that was \ncreated, the Transportation Security Administration, to find how \nquickly the train left the track, how much in error, how many mistakes \nwere made, how that agency went awry.\n  It should teach us that under the proposals of the distinguished \nSenator from Connecticut there is liable to be much of that happen \nthroughout this whole Government when we are talking about 170,000 \nemployees and 28 agencies.\n  I don't know if anybody in the legislative branch is aware of what \nthe 28 agencies would be, what is the full number of the 28 agencies. \nThe Senator may be absolutely correct in that, but I think that under \nany legislation that is passed, it is going to take many a prayer to \nhave it come out right at the end of 13 months.\n  I have read recently that it is going to be impossible to meet the \ndeadline of December 31 with respect to some of the protections that \nare going to be provided to the traveling public in the air. They have \nalready said, well, that can't be met.\n  So I think at the end of the day we are going to find, under the \nproposal of the Senator from Connecticut, as well as under mine, if you \nwant to make it that way, we are going to be subject to finding that we \nhave heard that we did not provide enough time, that things are going \nwrong. And then when we increase the magnitude of what we have already \nseen go awry with reorganization proposals and find that here was \n170,000 employees, I think there is going to be a lot of extending \ndeadlines in the end.\n  But I am very sorry the Senator continues to believe that my \namendment is taking the heart out of his proposal.\n  Now here is a chart. May I suggest to the Senator that all kinds of \ncharts can be written, and all kinds of charts can be displayed.\n  Here, if anyone can read, with 20/20 vision, and getting up close, \nthe number of agencies that are affected by this homeland security \nproposal of the administration--this is the existing bureaucratic \nstructure we are talking about dealing with. This is the existing \nbureaucratic structure for all homeland security agencies. Here it is.\n  Well, my goodness, just to read the names of those would take even \nthe Senator, who has good eyesight, several minutes--several minutes, I \nmean, 15 minutes at least, from the top down.\n  Look at this. Look at this chart. And all I am saying to the Senator \nis that we leave in his hands, in the hands of his good committee, the \noversight of the creation of this Department, all of the directorates \nwhich his committee has proposed.\n\n  That is all I am saying. Let's leave it in the Senator's hands, not \nturn it over to the people in the executive department. I want the \npeople to have security, real security. That is why I want to trust his \ncommittee.\n  Does the Senator have anything further?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I want to say \nthat it is because of the complexity of that chart that refers to the \nvarious agencies that have something to do with homeland security or \nthe war against terrorism--you see the Department of State here, \nDirector of Central Intelligence, the Department of Defense, it goes \nbeyond just homeland security and security generally--it is that chart, \nwith all its unconnected pieces, that has motivated our work on this \nbill.\n  Take, for instance, all the agencies that have something to do with \nborder security. As we heard testimony in our committee, you go to a \npoint of entry into the United States of America, you have three or \nfour Federal agencies. Each one of them has their own office. Each has \ntheir own telephones. They cannot communicate rapidly with one another. \nThe same is true of critical infrastructure protection, of the capacity \nof Federal, State, and local agencies to work together on emergency \nresponse, if, God forbid, there is another terrorist attack. That is \nthe whole purpose of the Department we brought forward.\n\n[[Page S8730]]\n\n  As I have said, you mentioned my use of the word ``pride.'' It is not \nso much personal. It is both for the committee, and it is not to ask \ncolleagues to support our proposal because we reported it out. I think \nit is the best proposal we could make at this time. Therefore, it is \nthe most responsive to the threat of terrorism and insecurity here at \nhome.\n  Is it perfect? No way. Would it benefit from amendment on the floor? \nIt would and will. Will the Department, once it begins going, when we \npass this, still require the oversight of Congress, working with the \nexecutive branch to make it work better and better? Yes, it will.\n  My concern about the Senator's amendment is that it doesn't build on \nthe work we have done. It eliminates it. In that sense, it does set up \na procedure which really will delay the date by which we make--let me \ndescribe it this way--our first, best effort, which is what I believe \nour bipartisan committee proposal represents, to create a Department of \nHomeland Security which will close the vulnerabilities that those evil \nterrorists took advantage of on September 11. That is why I have my \nsense of urgency about it.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will yield the floor shortly. May I just \nsay two things. One, I respect deeply the right of the Senator from \nConnecticut to disagree. I respect very deeply his own deep feeling of \nconscience that his approach is the better. I respect that. I salute \nhim for it. But to say that the amendment I am offering does not build \non the work that he and his committee have done is borne of \nmisperception, misunderstanding possibly, of my amendment.\n  It builds precisely on that rock. It uses the same superstructure.\n  It was not my idea that we have five directorates in title I. It was \nnot my idea that there be six under secretaries or seven, that there be \nfive assistant secretaries. These were not my ideas. I took the product \nthat the distinguished Senator from Connecticut brought out from his \ncommittee, and I have attempted to build upon that good work, build \nupon that rock and improve it.\n\n  I shall yield the floor on that and say thank you to my friend and \nlet someone else have the floor.\n  I will shake hands with him so everybody will know that we are not \nreally angry with one another. We may use all these fighting words. We \nget out our oratorical knives and we flash them. And they glint in the \nSun. I am ready to sit down. I am not mad. I am not angry with the \nSenator at all.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. The truth is, \nthis was an important exchange, an important debate. It does put in \nclear focus and does give the Senate a decision to make about whether \nthey are prepared to go ahead and adopt the amendment, the proposal the \ncommittee has brought out, or whether they want to basically take the \nsuperstructure, if I may use your word respectfully, and then come back \nto fill it in next year or the year after.\n  It is not so bad to have a little emotion expressed on the floor of \nthe Senate because we both feel strongly about our points of view. \nHopefully, from that heat will come some light for all concerned.\n  I am honored to have participated. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor. Senator Thompson has been waiting so patiently \nduring this discussion. I regret he has left the floor. Pending his \nreturn, I yield the floor to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Thompson allowing \nme to speak for a few moments on this critical issue before he speaks. \nI have very much appreciated the exchange between my two friends and \ncolleagues.\n  I rise in support of the Byrd amendment to the homeland security \nbill. I stress that I very much support a Homeland Security Department. \nI commend Senator Lieberman, who is the first author. We speak of it \nnow in terms of the administration's proposal, but I think it is \nimportant that we continue to recognize that it was the bill of the \nSenator from Connecticut originally. He is the one who brought this \nforward to us, and I congratulate him. I tend to support a Department. \nI think it is very important we do that.\n  It is very important that Congress have a continuing say in the \ncreation of any Department of Homeland Security, precisely because it \nis so important. I believe the Byrd amendment does that.\n  Simply put, the mission of this new Department is just too important \nto be rushed into law. Senator Byrd has noted that in the past when we \nreorganized various military departments under one Department of \nDefense the planning took years. Clearly, we don't have years to create \na Department of Homeland Security. I would not suggest that. But that \ndoesn't mean we should not proceed in a thoughtful and deliberate \nmanner to make sure we get it right. This is so important.\n  In fact, if I could make a historical observation, it was September \n17, 1787, that our Constitution was signed by a majority of delegates \nto the Constitutional Convention.\n  When that first Congress under the new Constitution met in 1789, it \ntook months of on-and-off debate to create the first three Cabinet \nposts--the Department of State, the Department of the Treasury, and the \nDepartment of War. They even considered creating a Department of the \nInterior but rejected it at that time.\n  Before those Cabinet posts were created, George Washington and his \nVice President, John Adams, were pretty much the entire executive \nbranch of Government. But that first Congress wanted to take the time \nto get it right. I suggest that we need to do the same.\n  Many questions remain, and if the public is to have confidence in \nthis new Department, these questions must be answered. For instance, \nwhich agency should be transferred into the new Department, and why? \nWhat criteria is the administration using to determine which agencies \nshould be transferred?\n  Almost all of the agencies being transferred have other functions \nthat are unrelated to homeland security. How will those functions be \naffected?\n  In Michigan, there are concerns over whether or not the Coast Guard \nwill have sufficient resources to deter terrorists trying to sneak into \nour country from Canada by boat and still fulfill its crucial role in \nsearch and rescue operations and ship inspections. The Coast Guard is \ncritical to Michigan. These issues are very real for us.\n  In earlier discussions about a Homeland Security Department, the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Animal Plant Health Inspection System, \nAPHIS, would have been moved to the new Department.\n  While it is reasonable that the border inspection mission of this \nagency be a part of the new Homeland Security Department, it is \ncritical that the domestic mission of protecting animal and plant \nhealth and, ultimately, the health of American consumers, remain within \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture. If the transfer of APHIS to the \nHomeland Security Department were to be proposed again, I would like to \nhave the chance to debate that and vote, because I oppose that \ntransfer.\n  What about the workforce? Will our Federal employees lose the civil \nservice protections created to keep politics out of the Federal \nworkplace? How do we merge all of the different personnel and salary \nprocedures of these different organizations?\n  Mr. President, I suggest that Senator Byrd is correct. These are huge \ndecisions that will take time to have it done right. These are just a \nfew of the questions that need to be answered. There are many more.\n  By establishing a Department of Homeland Security in well-defined \nphases, we will ensure that the Secretary of the new Department will \nhave to return to the Congress and explain the rationale for the \nadministration's decisions as they proceed. I believe that makes sense.\n  Here is the rough timeframe and key events to create this new \nDepartment, as Senator Byrd has outlined before. First, if the \namendment passed, we could quickly pass a bill establishing the Office \nof the Secretary and outlining the superstructure of the new \nDepartment.\n  Then, early next year, the Secretary of Homeland Security will \nprovide Congress with details for the Directorate of Border and \nTransportation Protection. Then, in the summer, approximately 120 days \nafter the first presentation, the Secretary of Homeland Security would \nreturn to Congress and provide details for the Directorate of\n\n[[Page S8731]]\n\nIntelligence and the Directorate of Critical Infrastructure Protection. \nThen next fall--again, about 120 days after the second presentation--\nthe Secretary of Homeland Security would again return to Congress with \ndetails for the Directorate of Emergency Preparedness and Response and \nfor the Directorate of Science and Technology.\n  This more disciplined process will help us create a Department that \nis cohesive, responsible, and effective, with its duties and missions \nclearly defined.\n  I believe this is the best approach to make sure that an effective \nDepartment actually is created and is one that is in the best interest \nof our citizens. I strongly support the Byrd amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think the question before us is \nwhether we will move ahead with a comprehensive reorganization plan to \nreorganize in a way that will greater protect our country--a plan that \nis supported by the administration, a plan that was approved by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, or whether we go in another direction \nthat I believe Senator Lieberman is correct on, which would move us \naway and down the road toward delay. It would delay addressing the \ncrucial questions that I think are before the Senate and the country \nwith regard to how we best address our security in the future.\n  By nature, I tend to want to agree with the Senator from West \nVirginia when he says that we sometimes move too rapidly and without \ndue consideration with regard to certain important matters that come \nbefore this body. I agree with that. I agree with it as I watch \namendments to appropriations bills come forth that have not been \nconsidered by committees; that have not been subject to committee \nhearings; that have hardly been debated on the floor, and spend tens of \nbillions of dollars; that grant and take away broad ranges of \nauthority, as amendments and bills are passing through because they are \ndeemed to be convenient vehicles. We do that all the time, \nunfortunately.\n  So what we have done with regard to this homeland security bill, in \ncomparison to what we do on a regular basis, makes it look as if we are \nmoving at a snail's pace--not too fast, but at a snail's pace--compared \nto the short shrift we give and the rapidity with which we pass \nsweeping amendments to these appropriations bills and other bills that \ncome through here, circumventing the committee process as we do it.\n  I imagine my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, believes it \nsomewhat ironic that it is suggested he has been giving the \nadministration a blank check on the one hand, when so many have accused \nhis approach as being one of micromanaging what the administration is \ndoing. I must agree with him that the suggestion that this is broad and \nsweeping, and the implication that it is somewhat unprecedented power \nto the administration, is unjustified. I think he is right when he \ntalks about the creation of a new Department or the merging of \ndepartments or any other broad range of administration activity. The \nadministration is a part of a separate branch of Government, after all. \nAny time we do that we are granting authority, but it is hardly a blank \ncheck.\n  When we determine such things as there being a Secretary at the top \nwho is answerable--and, first of all, confirmable--to this body, and is \nanswerable under oversight, and creating under secretaries--there are, \nI believe, 17 individuals created by this legislation, if it passes, \nwhich are confirmable by this body, that is hardly granting broad, \nsweeping authority to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  As my friends from West Virginia and Connecticut were talking about \nwhich end of the avenue they trusted the most, I was beginning to fear \nthat they were going to come to agreement on an important part of this \ndebate, but it didn't quite happen. So I feel better about that.\n  We have 17 confirmed positions in this bill, 6 directorates, pulling \n22 agencies together, agencies that have already been created by this \nCongress, with their duties delineated. We give permission, as it were, \nfor those to be brought together. We delineated in this bill the \nresponsibilities of these directorates, the duties of these positions \nthat we create.\n  We are certainly not going to lose our oversight duties and \nresponsibilities, if we choose to exercise them. We are certainly not \ngoing to circumvent the annual appropriations process.\n  This bill does get into the details of our intelligence operations. \nGoodness knows we need improvement in that regard, and we can have a \ngood debate as to how best to improve it. But when Congress in a bill \ngets down to the business of saying this particular information shall \ngo here and this particular officer shall have the right to this \nofficer's information and this particular information, and the \nPresident can step in here but he cannot step in there, that is hardly \ngranting a blank check.\n  One could argue we need to do more of that and get into the weeds \neven in more detail, but one can hardly argue we are creating a blank \ncheck and certainly one that is inconsistent with what we have done, I \nthink, as a Congress many times in setting forth other important \nDepartments.\n  Reference has been made to the National Security Act, which was \ncreated in 1947. Congress acted then after due deliberation. I presume \nmost folks think we went through the proper process and deliberated \nsufficiently before we created that agency in 1947.\n  As I understand it, Congress has subsequently acted 43 times since \nthen. So we should make no pretense whether we do it today or tomorrow \nor next year or 2 years from now that that is going to be the end of \nit. It is going to be the beginning of a process to do the best we can. \nSenator Lieberman said it well when he said: Our first best effort.\n  The question gets back to one I posed in the beginning: Do we do it \nnow or do we do it later? I have some difficulty with certain parts of \nthe bill that came out of committee. I certainly cannot argue with the \ndetail which addresses the seriousness of the component parts of this \nnew agency that is being created. It is a 347-page bill. There is some \nother historic legislation that has been passed by this body that is a \nfraction of that amount.\n  In sum and substance on that particular point, I will simply conclude \nthat we are at least in the middle of the road in exercising our \ncongressional authority in setting up a new Department as to whether or \nnot we are having our say about how it is to be done versus just \nhanding it over to the executive branch and saying: You fill in all the \nblanks. I respectfully submit the Congress has not done that.\n  We get down to the practical proposition that this Congress has \nrelatively few days remaining in this year. We all know we are not \ngoing to stay around here too much longer. It is an election year. We \nmay be in the first week of next month; we may be in the second week of \nnext month. Nobody knows exactly how much longer we have. We have \nseveral important pieces of legislation still pending which we have to \naddress one way or another--appropriations bills, Defense \nappropriations. We are going to be considering an Iraq resolution. \nThese are important issues, eminent issues that we cannot avoid, must \nnot avoid, and we will not avoid. We will take up those issues.\n  The question becomes, again, with regard to homeland security: Do we \ngo ahead and consider these amendments and get on about our business, \nhave a debate on these amendments and let everybody have their say on \nthese amendments, fashioned the best we can, or do we put it over to \nnext year and take it up again next year? Do we really want to go into \nnext year, after having set aside the time to consider this, after \nabout a year, since the start of hearings? Do we really want to \nconclude we want to put this bill off, in many respects, until next \nyear?\n  I do not think we want to conclude that, and that is what the \nadoption of the amendment that is the business before the Senate will \ndo.\n  We started the hearings process in the Governmental Affairs Committee \non September 20 of last year. From September until June of this year, \nthe committee held 18 hearings. So it is almost a year ago we started \nthe hearing process with regard to this bill.\n  It was almost a year before that very important commissions started \ntelling us facts we did not really want to hear, and that was that we \nwere in danger;\n\n[[Page S8732]]\n\nthat our country was vulnerable; that we needed to address the issue of \nterrorism; and that a part of the way we must address it had to do with \nthe way our Government was organized.\n  In December of 2000, the Gilmore Commission released its report. In \nFebruary of 2001, the Hart-Rudman Commission released its report. Of \nall the many positive aspects of this body, the most disturbing aspect \nis how many reports and warnings and how much information we have to \nget sometimes before it gets our attention. We could not get in this \nroom all the GAO reports and commission reports and other similar \nreports and comments over the past few years telling us and warning us, \ngenerally speaking, of what was coming and what was looming out there, \nnot to mention intelligence information, about which we might or might \nnot be able to talk.\n  Public bipartisan independent reports were coming in at least a year \nbefore we even started our hearings. So we have had the benefit of \nthose reports.\n  Would that we took that much time on other important issues facing \nour Nation as we pass amendments to appropriations bills left and right \nand hardly know on what we are voting, issues on which we have had no \nhearings, on which we have had no committee action, and we do it \nhelter-skelter sometimes. Compare that to the process we have been \nthrough with regard to this issue. So we are here at the end of that \ntime and we are on the bill. We are facing important issues with regard \nto this bill.\n  We have considered one of them: the question of whether or not the \nperson who is going to be in the White House is going to be Senate \nconfirmed or not. We had a vote on that. The Senate expressed its \nopinion, expressed its will on that issue in a pretty convincing \nfashion, in essentially a bipartisan vote. We decided that would not be \na position subject to Senate confirmation because we were creating a \nnew Secretary who was going to be subject to Senate confirmation, and \nwe did not need that duality.\n  The President deserved counsel inside the White House separate and \napart from the Senate-confirmed position. We decided that, but we took \nit up early last week. We only got a vote on it yesterday.\n  We have issues concerning the President's national security \nauthority. This bill would actually take away authority that the \nPresident has traditionally had with regard to the exercise of his \npower in instances concerning national security. That is a portion of \nthe bill with which I disagree, and in one form or another I want to \ndebate that issue on the floor of this body.\n  We have the issue of management flexibility, whether we want to adopt \nthe same old management tactics and techniques and laws that were \npassed back in the 1950s in the paper age where we have all of these \nmultisteps that people go through in their careers. They go into the \nGovernment at a certain level and work their way up and stay with the \nGovernment 20 years and then they are out. That is a totally different \nera than we live in today.\n  Do we want to adopt those practices to homeland security or do we \nwant to do it a different way? This is an extremely important issue. \nHow are they going to be able to get anyone to take that job, without \nthe tools that are necessary to do that job, under a system that can \ntake years in the resolving of disputes over worker competence and \nthings of that nature? The chance over the last 5 years of a person \nbeing dismissed and actually removed from Government because of \nincompetency is three-tenths of 1 percent. Government workers \nthemselves, the overwhelming number of which are good, competent \npeople, would like some opportunity to make better pay and have some \nincentive pay and to move around easily and to get hired sooner. \nSurveys will tell us there is more than three-tenths of 1 percent who \nmight want to find another line of work. Do we want to address that \nnow? We all know it is a problem.\n  Go down to the Brookings Institution and they will tell you--we all \nknow it--that it is an outdated system. Do we want to address that? Do \nwe want to address the issue of intelligence?\n  At the heart of all the problems we have seen, before and since \nSeptember 11, is the problem we have had with the collection, analysis, \nand dissemination of intelligence material. What could be more \nimportant to this country than that? We have a provision in this bill \nthat has to do with that, and we need to discuss it. What is the best \nthing to do about that?\n  These are important issues facing the country and this body at the \nheart of this bill. Are we going to put all of that off until a later \ntime because we have only had a year since we have started the process \nin this body? I do not think we can do that.\n  The problem is that we have not had the opportunity to consider those \nissues. After we considered the issue of whether the White House person \nis going to be confirmed by the Senate, I stated that I wanted to ask \nfor the yeas and nays, get a vote on it and move to the next amendment. \nWe have not been able to move, since that time, until today. Senators \nhave exercised their rights under the rules of the Senate, and as we \ncame to address this issue yesterday none of those issues--national \nsecurity authority of the President, management flexibility, what kind \nof intelligence operation we are going to have, the reorganization \nauthority of the President--have been brought up.\n\n  I had not had the opportunity, and my colleagues have not had the \nopportunity, to address those issues at all, when everyone knows they \nare at the heart of this bill and they have to be addressed. What \nhappened? Cloture was filed on the bill, which if passed would cut off \na vote on all of those amendments.\n  So on the one hand, we are saying we want due deliberation, we have \nnot had enough time to consider all of these important issues, and then \non the other hand we want to have cloture so consideration of those \nissues are cut off, at least for the foreseeable future. That is the \ndilemma we have now.\n  I do not think my colleagues can have it both ways. I could not agree \nmore that we need to take an appropriate amount of time, but simply \nwaiting and watching the clock tick-tock, tick-tock does not make us \nany wiser. We need to consider the substance of these issues. That \nmight make us a little bit wiser. We need to get on with it, in other \nwords. That is why cloture is so inappropriate on something such as \nthis. That is why we need to discuss and consider these amendments, \ninstead of cutting off debate and washing our hands of it. We certainly \nshould not be putting it off until another year.\n  How long has it been now since we have known we have had intelligence \ndeficiencies with regard to human intelligence, with regard to our \nability to penetrate these foreign cells that wish us so much harm? How \nlong has it been since we have known we have had problems in that area? \nA long time. A long time. This is not news to us. We do not have to \nstudy that problem any longer. We know we have it.\n  How long has it been since we have known we have had problems at the \nborder? A long time. How long has it been since we have known we have \nhad problems at the IRS--INS? Well, IRS, too, especially, but the INS. \nWe have known of those problems for a long time. They still exist. It \nis time we did something about it. I do not think the American people \nwant us to wait until next year.\n  We have spent considerable time in these 18 hearings, and dozens more \nin the Senate and House committees. Congress and the President have had \nthe benefit of inclusions and recommendations of several commissions, \nsuch as the Gilmore Commission and the Hart Commission, that have \nstudied this problem extensively.\n  Frankly, it is going to be years before this Department is \nfunctioning, as it is, and certainly longer if we do not fix the \nflexibility problems I referred to earlier. If creating this new \nDepartment is really the right thing to do, the last thing we need to \ndo is to put off its implementation.\n  Some would have us wait and deliberate until we get it perfect, but I \nsubmit that day will never come. Reorganization of this size is clearly \ngoing to require further action by Congress in the future.\n  The National Security Act of 1947 was not perfect. According to CRS, \nwe have had to amend it 43 times since it was passed. Continuous \noversight and\n\n[[Page S8733]]\n\nlegislative action is a part of the process of governing, which we \nshould be prepared to do.\n  I think it is instructive to look at the chronology over the last \ncouple of years. I mentioned the Gilmore Commission, December 2000; \nHart-Rudman, February 2001; September 11, of course, our country was \nattacked. From September through June, our committee held 18 hearings. \nOther committees did the same. In October of 2001, the President \nestablished the Office of Homeland Security and charged it with \ncreating a national strategy. In October of that year, Senator \nLieberman introduced S. 1534, a bill creating the Homeland Security \nDepartment. In May of 2002, Senator Lieberman introduced S. 2453, a \nbill creating a Homeland Security Department and a White House office. \nIn May of 2002, there was a markup in Governmental Affairs. I did not \nsupport the marking up of that bill at that time. I probably said some \nof the same things the Senator from West Virginia said at that time. \nThe thing that I was most concerned about at that time was that we did \nnot have a national strategy. I thought a strategy as to how to \napproach a problem should proceed a bill that dealt with the problem. I \nstill feel that way.\n\n  In July of this year, the President released a national strategy. \nAlso, in July of this year, the Governmental Affairs Committee received \nrecommendation from several other Senate authorizing committees \nregarding the homeland security bill. This was a composite of the \nstudied considerations and recommendations of other authorizing \ncommittees. It may be true that not many Members in terms of a \npercentage of the whole body know a great deal about the details of \nthis bill, but there are Members and there are other committees who do \nand have been a part of this process.\n  If there is truly a structural problem with the House bill or the \nsubstitute, we ought to consider it. We ought to take it up. We ought \nto talk about it. See what it is. See if we can do better. See if we \nneed to set it aside. See if we need to amend it. We can do that. But \nso far, with the disagreements that we have on management flexibility \nand national security authority and things of that nature, most Members \nwho have looked at it are in the same structural ballpark. And the \nparts we have a problem with, we are trying to deal with on the floor. \nSo it comes down to the question of whether or not we want the \nDepartment right now. I believe it is the right thing to do and the \nresponsible course is to act while we have the momentum.\n  There are a couple of points that are properly characterized as \n``lesser'' that I think are worth noting. This amendment also strikes \nlanguage that allows the Department some flexibility in the procurement \nof temporary services of experts and consultants. This language was a \ncompromise offered by Senator Lieberman in committee. It is important \nlanguage that allows the Secretary access to the full panoply of \nexperts he will undoubtedly need. Even under the limited structure \nenvisioned by this amendment, he may need consultants to help determine \nthe Department's needs for the legislative proposals or for the INS \nDirectorate, which is not limited by the amendment we are now \nconsidering.\n  In addition, the amendment strikes the visa issuance force of the \nsubstitute. This is a provision that was also in the President's \nproposal. It provides the Secretary of Homeland Security authority to \nissue visas which would be exercised through the Secretary of State. \nAll 19 of the 9/11 hijackers came to the United States with legal \nvisas; 3 of these obtained their visas through their travel agents \nthrough the State Department's visa express office. Many people who \ncome to this country obtain their visas through the State Department. \nStriking this provision takes away the ability of the Secretary to \ncoordinate the visa issuance with the rest of the Department, \nmaintaining consistent rules and policies.\n  With all due respect, I hope we will not adopt this amendment. I hope \nwe can proceed with the important issues we have before the Senate that \nwe have not had a chance to get before cloture was filed: The issues of \nwhether the President's national security authority will be reduced; \nthe issues of whether the new Secretary who is going to be taking on \nthis broad responsibility will have the management tools with which to \nget the job done; the important issue of what kind of intelligence \napparatus do we want within this Department; the issue of \nreorganization. All of these issues have been discussed in committee \nand have been discussed in some detail, many of them, by various \ncommissions for some time. It is time for the Senate to discuss these \nissues.\n  I continue to mention them in passing as we are considering other \namendments, but we have not had the opportunity to discuss these \nthings. If we want more time to discuss these important issues, these \naspects of the bill, I suggest we take that time. We have it. We have \nit right now. These are all issues that need to be debated and \ndiscussed before this body. I don't know why we would want to wait any \nlonger with regard to that which we know is so deficient.\n  I suggest we get on about that and we be allowed to consider them in \nhowever much length or detail we want, with everyone exercising their \nfull rights but talking about the substance of these issues that are \nbefore the Senate, that are staring us in the face, and are begging for \nour consideration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield before he yields the floor?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I see other Senators wish to speak. I compliment the \ndistinguished Senator on his statement. I say again, he is an excellent \nlawyer, I believe. Yes, he is.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. The lawyer part, anyway.\n  Mr. BYRD. He is an excellent lawyer. I think he has made from his \npoint of view, certainly, an excellent statement in support of a bill \nthat he does not like. He does not like this bill. He did not vote for \nthis bill when it was in the committee. That is what I call a good \nlawyer. Here he is on the floor making an impassioned speech.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. It will get better.\n  Mr. BYRD. A very careful speech. It is thoughtful and I like that \nabout him.\n  I think there was one item; the Senator, I believe, asked the \nrhetorical question, Do we want to wait until next year? Let me just \nsay right here that the people who are providing security for our \ncountry, and are on the job for all of us, are on the job right now. \nThey are out there when we are sleeping, and they are good people. They \nare very dedicated people. They are at the ports of entry; they are at \nthe airports; they are at the river ports; they are on the 75,000 miles \nof northern and southern borders in this country. They are on the job.\n  I believe they arranged for the arrest of six persons in New York \njust a few days ago. We did not have a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Those people are on the job right now. They are doing the \nwork.\n  So I think we have time to think this thing through and try to do the \njob right.\n  Again, I compliment the distinguished Senator. There are other \nSenators who wish to speak. Senator Gramm from Texas is here. May I \njust say I know that Senators Boxer, Cantwell, Dorgan, Jeffords, \nSchumer, and others want to speak on this amendment--not necessarily \ntonight but maybe in the morning. I thank the distinguished Senator \nagain.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I spoke earlier today under our time limit \nand I was grateful for the opportunity and said much of what I wanted \nto say on this subject today. But I wanted to come over this afternoon \nto talk a little bit about the Byrd amendment and to focus in on where \nI think our problem is, in coming to what I believe should be a \nbipartisan consensus.\n  Let me, first, say that Senator Byrd has spoken at great length on \nthis issue. On Friday I was running on a treadmill--coming as close to \nrunning on a treadmill as an old man comes , to exercise my mind as \nwell as my body--I listened to Senator Byrd speak for almost an hour. I \nhad, on two occasions, listened before. I want to make the following \nobservations.\n  First, there is one point that I am convinced on by Senator Byrd and \nthat\n\n[[Page S8734]]\n\nis the point about appropriations. Senator Byrd has talked about the \nConstitution and talked about our responsibility as an independent and \nequal branch of the Government. I think nowhere has his argument been \nstronger and more to the point than on the issue of the power of the \npurse. I want to make it clear that tomorrow Senator Zell Miller and I \nwill be presenting a substitute. Maybe not on the floor. I don't know \nwhere we will be, in terms of ability to offer an amendment on the \nfloor, but in the morning we are going to put out a substitute that we \nhave been working on intensively for some 3 weeks.\n  One of the changes we have made is we have eliminated this 5-percent \nflexibility in appropriations. I believe that for every one problem \nthat we have in trying to deal with homeland security and deal with a \nmassive new Government agency, for every one problem we have where the \nPresident would want to reprogram funds unilaterally, we are probably \ngoing to have 500 problems with administrative flexibility and with the \nability to put the right person in the right place at the right time.\n  So in listening to Senator Byrd and working with Senator Stevens, at \nleast in terms of what we are offering as an alternative that we \nbelieve has some bipartisan appeal, that takes much of what is done in \nthis bill and in the House bill, we have been convinced that Senator \nByrd is correct in noting that a fundamental power of Congress is the \npower of the purse. It is a power that the Congress has to be very \njealous about relinquishing, and it is something that should not be \ndone.\n  I am also convinced, as we begin the process of making this new \nDepartment work, that we can come up with a process whereby efforts to \nreprogram funds can be dealt with on an expedited basis. I had the \nprivilege of being a subcommittee chairman for 2 years at the Commerce, \nJustice, State Appropriations subcommittee. I do not think there was \never a time where any of those agencies asked for reprogramming of \nfunds that we ended up denying them. So I think that is something that \ncan be worked out.\n  I think the points that were raised were strong points. It is an area \nwhere I find myself in agreement with Senator Byrd, and it is something \nthat I believe we can and will fix. And the administration does support \nthis substitute.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a moment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator for what he has said. I \nappreciate so much his good work on the Appropriations Committee when \nhe was a member of the committee. And our loss is the Senate Finance \nCommittee's--I believe--the Senate Finance Committee's gain. I thank \nthe Senator. I am flattered by his remarks. But he and I both know that \nhe agreed with the Constitution on the power of the purse more so than \nwith Senator Byrd. I thank him. That was part of his statement, but it \nwas part of the Constitution that we both revere and respect, not only \nto that matter but certainly to that matter. And the Senator has ably \naddressed himself to that. I thank him.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I thank the Senator for his kind comments. I will say, in \nmy 6 years on the Appropriations Committee I learned more about how \nGovernment really works than in any other of my service. Some of which \nI liked, how it worked. In some cases I didn't like how it worked.\n  Let me now turn to the other issues. I want to begin with the \nfollowing point that I think in a reasoned way we all agree with. One \nof the interesting things about public life and public service, and \nserving the greatest country in the history of the world, is that it \nconstantly comes home to me that good people with the same facts, as \nThomas Jefferson observed, are prone to come to different conclusions. \nThere are several areas where I have come to a very different \nconclusion than Senator Byrd, and a very different conclusion than \nSenator Lieberman. I would like to try to explain why I have reached \nthe conclusions I have reached. These areas have to do with what I \nthink goes to the heart of homeland security.\n  I think it is very instructive to note that there have been areas \nwhere the Congress has already decided that the civil service system, \nin those critical areas, needed to be changed. It is not as if we have \nnot had many warnings about the inadequacy of the civil service system.\n  The other day I was using some facts and there was an extra part to \nthe story, but I want to repeat them with the rest of the story in it. \nI think they bring home the point.\n  In 2001, we had 1.8 million people working for the Federal \nGovernment. Based on the performance of those 1.8 million, we \nimmediately terminated 3 people. Under the previous administration, \n64,340 Federal workers were estimated, or at least judged by that \nadministration, to be poor performers. Of those 64,340 out of 1.8 \nmillion, we went through the process of removal with only 434. And that \nprocess takes up to 18 months.\n  Currently, in OPM polls of Federal employees, the very people who \nmany of our colleagues and many of the unions which oppose the \nPresident's bill claim to be representing, in opinion polls taken of \nGovernment employees, two-thirds of Federal workers today believe that \npoor performers are not adequately disciplined by the current system. \nThat is two-thirds of the people who work for the Federal Government in \nrandom sample polling believe that job performance has little or \nnothing to do with their chances of promotion.\n  So, first, I think it is important, in looking at what we are asking \nin terms of powers to promote national security and to protect it, to \nnote that the current civil service system is far from perfect.\n  Second, we have had study after study conclude that we needed a \ndramatic change in the civil service system--the Grace Commission \nreport in 1983 and the Volcker Commission report. As we are all aware, \nPaul Volcker, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, certainly no \nunion basher in the political phrase of our era and of this bill, \nconcluded:\n  The current system is slow. It is legally trampled and intellectually \nconfused. It is impossible to explain to potential candidates. It is \nalmost certainly not fulfilling the spirit of our mandate to hire the \nmost meritorious candidates.\n  Our own colleague, Senator Warren Rudman, headed up the U.S. \nCommission on National Security. We all know Warren Rudman. We know he \nis a serious person. We know he did not enter that Commission with any \nax to grind. Yet he concluded that ``today's civil service system has \nbecome a drag on our national security. The morass of rules, \nregulations, and bureaucracy prevent the Government from hiring and \nretaining the workforce that is required to combat the threats we will \nface in the future.''\n  Not only are people in the system registering their unhappiness, but \nwe have consistently had commissions headed by Democrats and headed by \nRepublicans that have called for a dramatic reform of the system. \nInterestingly enough, we have responded.\n  When we decided to federalize inspectors at airports, in that bill we \ngave the President power in terms of personnel flexibility to hire and \nfire. We gave him the ability to get around the normal procedure that \nrequires up to 6 months to hire somebody. We gave him the ability to \nfire for incompetence and to promote, to some degree, on merit.\n  We have done the same thing in the past with the Federal Aviation \nAdministration. But, interestingly enough, in one area we have granted \na tremendous amount of flexibility, when we decided to reform the \nInternal Revenue Service, we gave the executive branch of Government \ntremendous flexibility in hiring, firing, pay and promotion, because we \nwere so concerned about the inefficiency and the potential corruption \nin the Internal Revenue Service.\n  I ask my colleagues: If we believed that the current system was \nfailing us in the Internal Revenue Service and that we had a problem \nwhich required a different approach and more flexibility with regard to \nour sensitivity at the Internal Revenue Service with people who know \nour intimate financial information and who look at our tax returns. If \nwe believed that flexibility to administer that Department was \nnecessary--and we did, and we adopted it and it is the law of the land \ntoday--I wonder what people back home would\n\n[[Page S8735]]\n\nthink when we said we thought flexibility was required at the Internal \nRevenue Service in terms of personnel because of its sensitivity and \nbecause of the lack of efficiency, but we don't think similar or \ngreater flexibility should be provided to the President and to the \nSecretary of Homeland Security.\n  If we thought the problems at IRS justified a new approach, a new \nflexibility, the ability to hire and fire and promote based on merit \noutside the Civil service system in terms of special procedures, how, \nafter 9/11 and after terrorist attacks that killed thousands of our \ncitizens, can we not believe that homeland security is at least as \nimportant as the Internal Revenue Service?\n  When we granted flexibility for the Transportation Security \nAdministration in the hiring, firing, and promotion of people who \ninspect your carry-on bags at the airport and helping to provide \nsecurity, does anybody believe it made sense to give flexibility to the \nTransportation Security Administration but it doesn't make sense to \ngive even more flexibility to the Department of Homeland Security?\n  I don't think 1 American in 100 would agree with the thesis that the \nIRS is more important and that we are more concerned about its ability \nto do its job than we are concerned about the ability of the Coast \nGuard to keep a nuclear explosive from being brought into New York \nHarbor.\n  But, incredibly, I think we got off into the ditch on this bill was \nthat, while the Congress has already granted some flexibility to the \nPresident in the Transportation Security Administration, Internal \nRevenue Service, and Federal Aviation Administration, for some \nremarkable reason--even after the terrorist attack in New York--in this \nbill, a decision was made that the President should have less \nflexibility in managing the Department of Homeland Security than he \ndoes in managing the Internal Revenue Service. I think the American \npeople will find that virtually incomprehensible, and I think they will \nfind they are unable to accept it.\n\n  Another place that I think we got off into the ditch on this bill was \ntaking away power that the President now has. If you went out and did a \npoll, and if you asked people: Do you believe, in light of the attacks \non September 11, we should give the President more power in the ability \nto run the Departments of Government that have to do with homeland \nsecurity after the attacks than he had before?--if you posed that \nquestion, I don't believe there would be 1 American in 1,000 who would \nhave said: No, let us take national security power away from the \nPresident. Not 1 in 1,000 would have said : No, why don't we just leave \nit like it is? I think probably over 900 out of 1,000 would have said: \nYes, we ought to give the President more power.\n  But, for some remarkable, unexplainable reason, the bill that is \nbefore us actually takes power away from the President which he has \ntoday.\n  I remind my colleagues, when the President is asking for the ability, \nfor national security purposes, to override union contracts in terms of \nwork rules, that is a power the President has today--unabated in those \nareas that deal with intelligence and national security. The President \nhas that power today. The current and previous Presidents have used \nthat power, and that power is currently in effect. The waiver of \ncollective bargaining agreements has occurred in eight Government \nagencies as we debate this issue about whether the President should \nhave this power. Every President since Jimmy Carter has had this power, \nand they have used the power. Currently, in the following agencies, \ncollective bargaining agreements of one form or another have been \nwaived: The FBI, the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Secret \nService, the Air Marshals Offices of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, the Criminal Investigation Division at the IRS, the \nOffice of Criminal Enforcement at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms, and the Office of Enforcement and Intelligence at the Drug \nEnforcement Agency. In those eight Government agencies today, we are \noperating under rules that the President has asked for power to use in \nthe new Department of Homeland Security.\n  I would have to say that never once in the Carter administration, in \nthe Reagan administration, in the first Bush administration, in the \nClinton administration--never in any of those administrations, so far \nas I am aware, did anybody propose taking away those national security \npowers.\n  As I have said, these powers are currently in force in eight \ndifferent Government agencies. Yet, remarkably, after the attack on 9/\n11, and in a bill we wrote to respond to it, this bill takes away power \nthat President Carter had, that President Reagan had, that Bush 41 had, \nthat Clinton had. I just would like to note that I do not remember--and \nI have served in Congress since the last 2 years of the Carter \nadministration - but I do not remember, in any of those \nadministrations: That is too much power for the President to have. He \nought not to have that power, and we ought to take it away from him.\n  But yet, remarkably, in a bill we have written to respond to the \ncrisis we face, and the mortal risk we face, and in a follow-on to \nthousands of our citizens being killed in a terrorist attack, for some \nunexplainable and incomprehensible reason, the bill that is before us \nsays we are actually going to take power away from the President to \nhave a national security waiver of work rules under this new law and in \nthis new Department.\n  I do not believe, if the American people really understood that is \nwhat the bill is trying to do, there would be 1 American in 100 who \nwould be for this bill. And the President has said he is not for it, \nand he will veto it.\n  Let me explain what we are talking about in terms of these waivers. \nWe are not talking about waiving worker protections in terms of the \nbasic rights of people and their constitutional rights. We are talking \nabout work rules that have been negotiated as part of union contracts \nthat interfere with our ability to do the job in the new Department.\n  Let me, very briefly, go through a few of those work rules that have \nimpeded our ability to do things similar to the things we would like to \ndo in the name of homeland security. Let me do a couple of them in \ndetail, and then I will just mention the others.\n  In 1987, the Customs Service in Boston decided they wanted to \nreorganize the inspection room. They concluded they could be more \nefficient in inspecting things coming into the country. So they set \nabout the process of remodeling the inspection space.\n  The Treasury Employee Labor Union filed a complaint with the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority claiming that to reorganize that work space, \nto reconfigure it, without renegotiating the union contract, violated \nthe union contract. It ended up going to the Federal Labor Relations \nAuthority, and--guess what--they ruled that it violated the union \ncontract and the Customs Service could not restructure the inspection \narea.\n  Now, look, after 3,000 people died in downtown New York, if we \nconclude, with this new Department, that we need to change the \ninspection area at the airport, are we going to go through 18 months of \nnegotiating with the National Labor Relations Authority as to whether \nwe can do it, when the lives of our people are at stake? Absolutely \nnot. Nor would anybody in their right mind suggest that we should. That \nis the kind of waiver authority for which the President is asking.\n  I will give you another example.\n  Under the work rules that govern border inspection, Barry McCaffrey--\nyou all will remember Barry McCaffrey, the good general who was the \ndrug czar during the Clinton administration--he observed, in the San \nFrancisco Examiner that under these work rules for Customs and INS, \nthere were some things they each could and could not do under these \ncontracts. He observed officials at one agency were actually forbidden \nto open the trunks of cars, a policy well known among the drug \ndealers. Then he talks about how actually knowing these work rules \nallowed the drug dealers to game the system.\n\n  Now, let me switch to the Coast Guard. Are we willing to let work \nrules and what some people will and will not do prevent us from \nsearching a barge that might bring a nuclear device into New York \nHarbor? Does anybody really believe, in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the President should not have the power to waive those work \nrules when people's lives are at stake? Nobody believes that. But that \nis what we are debating here. That is what this debate is about.\n\n[[Page S8736]]\n\n  Let me give you another example. In 1990, INS wanted to add an extra \nshift at the Honolulu Airport to deal with a surge in international \nflights in the afternoon. They had a backlog and had people waiting in \nline, so they wanted to add another shift in the afternoon to do their \ninspections.\n  But there was only one problem. The American Federation of Government \nEmployees said: No, you are not going to add that shift because we have \na union contract that says we get a say in whether more personnel come \non board to do part of our job. And you have already guessed it: The \nunion took the case to the Federal Labor Relations Authority and, they \nruled that the INS could not add the shift.\n  Now fast forward through 9/11. Take into account that people died at \nthe Pentagon and the World Trade Center. Are we really going to allow a \nunion agreement that would make us go back and renegotiate the contract \nbefore we could put more INS agents in an area where we believe there \nis a clear and present danger to the lives of our citizens? Obviously, \nsome people think we should. That is what the debate is about. But I \ncannot believe most Americans would think the President should not have \nthe power to say: Now look, this is no Sunday picnic we are going \nthrough here. People's lives are at stake. We need more people here, \nand we need them today, and we are putting them here. And if you don't \nlike it, go work somewhere else.\n  Now, that may seem extreme to some people, but I don't see it as \nextreme. If somebody is coming through Customs in Savannah, and they \nmight kill my mother, I feel pretty strongly about it. And when we are \ndealing with homeland security, these kinds of issues have to be taken \non and addressed.\n  Now, I have gone through enough of them in detail. Let me just touch \nbriefly on a few of others: Prohibitions against special task forces \noperating in the Border Patrol. Listen to this, we have union \nagreements that prohibit us from stationing Border Patrol agents, for \nany period of time, where there are not suitable eating places, drug \nstores, barbershops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and \nsimilar places necessary for the sustenance and comfort and health of \nemployees. And I generally agree with that. We have a lot of great \npeople who work in the Border Patrol. But when lives are at stake, when \nyou have extraordinary circumstances, we cannot be required to go back \nand renegotiate a union work rule because an area where terrorists \nmight cross the border does not have a dry cleaner. Dry cleaning is \nimportant, but it isn't that important.\n\n  You get the idea, in listening to some of our colleagues, that when \nthe President is asking for the right to suspend these work rules, it \nis just willy-nilly, wholesale, we don't like your looks, you are out \nof work.\n  We are talking about being able to put a Border Patrol agent where \nthere is no dry cleaner in an emergency; not that we want him to go off \nand live in a tent. But if he has to live in a tent for a few weeks or \na few months to protect our citizens from being killed, I think they \nwould willingly do it. I don't think it is asking too much to ask \npeople to do it.\n  I will touch very briefly on the others. Body searches of detainees: \nYou would think we would have the right to determine, in terms of our \nBorder Patrol and our INS, what the body search policy would be based \non the threat. But we really don't have that right because, under a \nunion work agreement, the union has to sign off on a change in policy. \nAnd in 1995, when we tried to change the policy, the Federal Labor \nRelations Authority overruled the Department and set aside the new \nsearch policy.\n  We have had similar things happen with firearms. We have had similar \nthings happen with what offices could be opened and closed.\n  This is not some idle concern. This is not some theoretical power the \nPresident wants. This is something that is a real-world problem today. \nIt is something that the Congress gave the President in the \nTransportation Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, \nand the Federal Aviation Administration. But yet, remarkably, in the \nbill before us the majority in the committee decided that, you don't \nwant to give the President the same flexibility with regard to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security where you are talking about lives. I \ndon't think people understand that, and I don't think they accept it.\n  As another example of how out of focus with reality the current bill \nis, you might ask yourself, when we have had the Federal Government put \nup tens of billions of dollars to pay for what happened in New York to \ntry to comfort the people who were hurt, to rebuild the Pentagon, to \nindemnify people, and as we begin the rebuilding process, you might ask \nyourself, in light of the new reality after 9/11, should Congress \nartificially make it more expensive for Government to help people \nrebuild something that is destroyed? Should they leave it the way it \nis, or should they make it less expensive?\n  I think if you ask the American people, in light of 9/11, do you \nthink Congress should add a provision that will raise construction \ncosts for FEMA for emergency assistance to people who have had their \nproperty destroyed, their lives uprooted, should we pass a law that \nrequires the Government to pay an artificially high wage to people \nworking in those areas, or should we rebuild those things competitively \nso we can help more people, I think if you ask the American people, \nthey would say, why should we pay a premium when we are trying to help \npeople?\n  Yet remarkably, almost unbelievably, in a bill that is supposed to be \nresponding to 9/11, there is a provision which says that on any \nconstruction that we undertake in responding to a disaster, we have to \npay an artificially high wage that numerous outside groups and groups \nwithin the Government have estimated would raise the cost of that \nconstruction in emergency assistance by 20 percent. Why in the world \nwould you have a provision such as that in this bill? Why would you \napply this provision called Davis-Bacon?\n  It is explained in one way; it operates in another. The way it \noperates is, you look at the highest wage paid anywhere in that region, \nwhich can be a huge swath of the country, and then anything that the \nGovernment does in emergency construction in that area, it has to pay \nthat wage, whether there are good people willing to work for less or \nnot, whether everybody else is paying less or not.\n  Why in the world would you put that provision in this bill? How could \nit possibly make any sense? The obvious answer is it doesn't make any \nsense. Nor are you going to hear people stand up and defend it.\n  I have talked longer than I meant to talk. Let me conclude by simply \nmaking a couple points.\n  A bill that is supposed to respond to an attack on our country and \nthe great vulnerability we have as a result of that threat, that \nactually takes power away from the President to provide security and \ntakes power away in the name of security concerns, is totally \nunacceptable. That is what this bill does.\n  The President of the United States, if this bill became law, would \nhave less power to use national security waivers to promote homeland \nsecurity than Jimmy Carter had or than Ronald Reagan had or than Bill \nClinton had and that Bill Clinton used. Eight Government agencies today \nare operating under those rules. Yet in a bill that is supposed to be \npromoting homeland security, we say: It was all right for Bill Clinton \nto do it prior to 9/11, but now we are going to take that power away \nfrom George Bush.\n  No, you are not. That is not going to happen--not in this life. That \nis just not going to happen. And there is not going to be a deal cut on \nit. We are not going to adopt a bill that gives the President less \npower to respond to 9/11 than he had the day before it happened. It is \njust inconceivable and totally unacceptable.\n  No. 2, the President has asked for some flexibility in putting the \nright person in the right place at the right time. He doesn't want to \nhave to wait 6 months to hire somebody.\n  The FBI agent, Colleen Rawley, who sent the cable into the home \noffice of the FBI saying, we have people with terrorist links taking \nflight training and maybe somebody ought to look at it. Don't you think \nthat maybe the President ought to be able to go back and promote that \nagent and give her a good pay raise? Also, I would have to\n\n[[Page S8737]]\n\nsay that after the picture of these people who flew these planes in the \nWorld Trade Center was on every television set in America with their \nnames, for the INS to turn around several weeks later and grant them a \nvisa to come into the United States, I think the President should have \nhad the power to say: Look, guys, we can't live with that, and you are \nfired.\n  Now, you may think you should have those powers. I do. You may think \nyou should not. But how do you justify that we gave similar powers to \nthe Internal Revenue Service and to President Clinton but we will not \ngive at least the same powers to the Department of Homeland Security \nunder President Bush?\n  Finally, there is just a lot of piling on in this bill. This Davis-\nBacon provision is piracy; it is just piracy. When we are spending more \nmoney on emergencies than we have ever spent, the idea that we are \ngoing to make the Government pay a 20 percent premium--something we \ndidn't have to do before this bill passed but now we are going to make \nthem do it--it is absolute piracy. I think people ought to be ashamed \nthat it is in there. I haven't heard many people bragging about it \nbeing there, but sure enough, there it is.\n  I wonder if we could not have had a bipartisan bill, if we had just \nstarted out with a set of principles: No. 1, whatever power the \nPresident had before 9/11 he would still have when this bill was \nwritten; No. 2, any flexibility we have ever given the President with \nregard to the Internal Revenue Service and its operation, the President \nought to have, at a minimum, that flexibility, and No. 3, provisions \nthat actually make the job harder ought to be debated another day. I \nbelieve if we had started with a set of principles--those 3--we would \nhave had a bipartisan bill and 95 Members of the Senate would have \nvoted for it. But for some reason, which I do not understand and cannot \ncomprehend, we now have an issue which has become largely partisan. It \nall revolves around an effort to take away from the President powers he \nhad before 9/11.\n  The real stumbling blocks on this bill boil down to three things: An \neffort to take power from the President in terms of national security \nwaivers, which is not going to happen; then, a refusal to give the \nPresident personnel flexibility greater but similar to what we have \nalready done in the IRS; finally, gratuitous provisions, I guess, in \nthis piling-on mentality such as putting Davis-Bacon requirements onto \nFEMA something we have never done before.\n  Those things represent our problem, and I think as people understand \nthem, I don't believe the provisions of this bill can be sustained. I \ndo not believe that, if the public really understood what was going on \nhere, they would put up with it.\n  I am hopeful that we can have an opportunity to vote on these issues. \nI think we will have a substitute that will try to deal with them. I am \nsure the vote is going to be very close. But I think it is important \nthat people understand the issues. Something is really wrong when we \ncannot even get an amendment accepted that says the President cannot \nhave less power than he has today. I mean, that is almost unimaginable, \nbut this bill does that. I think when people understand it, they are \ngoing to be very unhappy about it.\n  I think the President's position is not perfect. I think he went a \nlittle too far on appropriations, but I think that can be fixed. I \nthink on the key elements we are talking about now, the President is on \nthe side of the angels. It is clear to me he is not going to budge, and \nso if we are unwilling to let the President have the power that every \nPresident since Jimmy Carter has had, then I guess we will have an \nopportunity to explain it to people, and I am sure they will ask for \nthe explanation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. First of all, the discourse of the Senator from Texas has \nreally pointed out the primary problems here. They are both political \nand substantive. The political problem is that there are those who have \na different agenda than the President of the United States, who is \nsimply trying to reorganize Government to deal with the threat of \nterrorism, to create homeland security for the American people.\n  Instead of cooperating in that effort, there are those who would \nsettle old scores, create new agendas, or add new things. Everybody's \nmotives are pure in this. The problem is that by getting the \nlegislation so complicated, so convoluted, and so loaded down with \nother things, they are going to destroy the original intent, which was \nto streamline the process and make it easier to deal with the threat of \nterrorists.\n  My grandmother had great sayings, and one was: Too many cooks spoil \nthe broth. It is not that we all should not have a hand in the drafting \nof the legislation, but I do think when you are trying to create \nsomething such as a new Homeland Security Department, you have to give \nsome deference to the people in the executive branch who have \npainstakingly put this together, who have experience with making \nexecutive offices work, and to the President who has an idea of what he \nwants to do here. Instead, we have a lot of extraneous ideas floating \naround that I think, in the end, complicate it and add extraneous \nmatters that don't have to be in there, such as Davis-Bacon \nrequirements, which will add costs to construction.\n  Ironically, they have the effect--I cannot believe this is the intent \nof the authors, but it has the effect of giving the President less \npower to deal with these problems than he has today. Right now, the \nPresident would be better off with the agencies as they exist, coupled \nwith his authority, from an administrative or executive point of view, \nto move people around within those agencies; he would be better able to \nachieve his goals than by adopting the legislation that is before us.\n  Let me point out a couple of other examples of why this is true. \nSenator Gramm had several examples in areas of the bill he was looking \nat. Let me refer to another area. For some time, there has been an \nappreciation of the fact that in dealing with border and immigration \nissues, we really have two separate types of issues, and while both are \ndealt with as a part of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, \nwhich is under the Justice Department, I think some consensus has been \ndeveloping that, in some way, we need to separate the border control \nfunction, which includes entities such as the Border Patrol, and the \ninvestigative services, and so on.\n  To separate those out--those are sort of law enforcement, border \nprotection functions--to separate those from the more customer-\noriented--I don't like that word, but that is the word in vogue now--\ncustomer-oriented services of immigration visas, student visas, and the \nlegal immigration into the country, in other words--there is some sense \nto that division of responsibility.\n  This is something the President had offered. Initially, it looked as \nif the legislation that would be written here contained a version of \nthat division of authority. But as it turns out, under the Lieberman \nproposal, it gets a lot more complicated than that. I don't know \nwhether this is really intended, and there doesn't seem to be any \nparticular rhyme or reason why it is done this way, but it ends up \nbeing convoluted, very complicated, unnecessarily bureaucratic, \nineffective, and confusing at end of the day.\n  Let me describe precisely what I am talking about. Division B of the \nLieberman bill creates the Immigration Affairs Directorate. That \nincludes all immigration functions of the U.S. Government. So far so \ngood.\n  Division A of the bill creates, among other things, the Border and \nTransportation Affairs Directorate. So far so good. That is supposed to \nbe the entity that deals with the Border Patrol--basically controlling \nillegal immigration and terrorism threats on our border.\n  Under the Lieberman bill, it goes off track right after that because \nthis Immigration Affairs Directorate is supposed to handle the visas, \ncitizenships--all immigration functions, including all immigration \nenforcement functions, intelligence, investigations, detention, Border \nPatrol, and border inspections. All of those are moved into this \nimmigration affairs box.\n  One might say: What is left in the other box? I cannot find much that \nis left there.\n  The problem is, we thought we had a solution to a problem. I thought \neverybody agreed to it. Now we are going\n\n[[Page S8738]]\n\nright back to the problem we had in the first instance by putting all \nof the law enforcement, antiterrorism, Border Patrol, investigations, \ndetention, inspections--all of that--right back into the Immigration \nAffairs Directorate.\n  One of the biggest priorities of the President, in addition to \ndealing with terrorism, in the homeland security bill is to streamline \nthe process at the border. Coming from a border State, I can tell my \ncolleagues this is critical, and it goes all the way from Customs, \nwhich has a significant responsibility here, to INS and all the related \nagencies.\n  We have two somewhat contradictory needs that come together at the \nborder. We have a big security need. We want to make sure no illegal \nimmigrants, no illegal contraband, drugs, weapons, and the like are \nsmuggled into the country. We saw recently how we were able to check \nout a ship that we suspected had cargo that was radioactive. It checked \nout OK, but we were able to have it stand offshore until we had an \nopportunity to run the equipment over it to make sure there was not a \nbomb or something radioactive on board. That happens every day at our \nland borders, at our seaports, and at our airports many hundreds of \ntimes--in fact, thousands of times. There is specialized equipment to \nmake sure nothing is brought in that should not come into this country. \nThat is critical to both the security of the country from a terrorism \nstandpoint, as well as a law enforcement standpoint.\n  At the same time, we want to enhance commerce. We do not enhance \ncommerce by having long lines of trucks or cars or people waiting to be \nchecked out before they can come into the country.\n  On my border in Arizona, we have a huge problem with long lines, with \ntrucks having to literally park on the Mexican side of the border and \nwait overnight to come through customs. That is detrimental to trade, \ncommerce, to people and their lives.\n  I was reacquainted with a former staffer from Tucson, AZ, whose \nfamily lives in both Nogales, AZ, and Nogales, Mexico--two towns on \neither side of the border. She told me how hard it was going back and \nforth visiting family and friends. She had to wait in line literally \nhours. Therefore, we have these two competing needs, and we have to \nstreamline the process.\n  Kudos to the Bush administration. They were coming up with a lot of \ngood ideas about how to expedite the process of crossing for family and \ntrade, while also making sure that we protect against contraband, \nillegal immigration, and terrorists entering the country.\n  The Lieberman bill, by contrast, gets us all the way back to where we \nstarted by refusing to move the enforcement function out of the \nimmigration affairs box and into the Border Affairs Directorate where \nit belongs. Instead of streamlining our activity at the border, I fear \nit will be the same mess it has been in the past. I hate to describe it \nthat way, but that is exactly the way it is.\n\n  The administration's proposal, by contrast, created this separate \nBorder Transportation Protection Directorate, and that is where all of \nthe Border Patrol activity, investigations, and the like, is embodied. \nAs I said, under the Lieberman bill, all of that has been put into this \nimmigration affairs box.\n  At the very least, it seems to me the Border Patrol and border \ninspections functions should be included in the border and \ntransportation affairs box. One might ask: Can't reasonable adults work \non this and get this straight? We have tried.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is there will be a substitute \noffered. Senator Gramm has mentioned this, as has Senator Thompson. The \nsubstitute is a compromise of what the President proposed and features \nof the Lieberman bill and, I suspect, also features of the Byrd \namendment. I believe this issue is pretty well straightened out in this \ncompromise substitute that is going to be offered. It puts most of \nthese functions that are law-enforcement-related functions, the \nantiterrorism-related functions back into the right box.\n  If we do not do this, the bottom line is security is going to be \ncompromised. This is not something that is irrelevant and unimportant. \nIt is very important to the whole purpose of developing the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  One might ask why this border transportation affairs box was created. \nWhat is left in it? The primary function that is left is Customs. Yet \nit describes the Customs Service still as a separate entity. So I am \nnot exactly sure how that is going to work. Presumably, Customs will \ncontinue to operate almost independently from the Under Secretary of \nthe Border and Transportation Directorate, which is not what was \nintended. It has the Coast Guard. Again, that is deemed a distinct \nentity. And it has the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, but the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center trains what? Border Patrol agents. We have \na division there that does not make sense at all.\n  This is very confusing, it is unnecessarily complicated, and it is \njust another example of what Senator Gramm was talking about.\n  Let's get back to the simple, direct approach that has been presented \nby the administration. That is a much wiser approach. It moves all the \nimmigration affairs, with an emphasis on the importance of immigration \nservices, to the Border and Transportation Protection Directorate, and \nit sends a message that we are serious about streamlining all of our \nactivity at the border, whether it be the immigration-related activity \nor the law enforcement activity, and still effectively fights \nterrorism.\n  Let me mention one other problem before I finish. It is a related \nproblem with this division B, the immigration affairs. It has language \nincluded which would abolish the Executive Office for Immigration \nReview and create within the Department of Justice what amounts to an \nindependent agency for immigration judges.\n  Immigration law is complicated enough. There are a whole series of \nprecedents. There is a process by which you have a decision made, a \nreview of that decision, and eventually the final review all the way up \nthe chain in the Department of Justice by the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. There is a body of case law built around this. There are \nprocedures that are built around it. As far as I know, those procedures \nare working. I do not know of any reason, for homeland security, why we \nwould want to change that. This legislation fundamentally alters the \nINS administrative process.\n  It seems at the very least the language, which designates when and \nhow this new Executive Office for Immigration Review operates, needs to \nbe changed so the checks and balances that exist today in the \nDepartment of Justice will either continue to exist there or in the new \nHomeland Security Department.\n  Unfortunately, this simply has not been written in a way that will \nguarantee we have the same kind of review and fairness and justice in \nthe immigration process.\n  There are other things. I have a 5 o'clock engagement, so I am not \ngoing to go into more detail at this time. As I said, I do not question \nat all the motives of those who come up with different ideas on how to \ndo different functions.\n  The problem is we all have our own wonderful ideas about how \neverything should be fixed, and if we try to do that all in the \nhomeland security bill, we may be biting off more than we really need \nto chew. We may need to get back to the basic task, which is to ensure \nwe can protect against terrorism and have real homeland security and \nhave a reorganization of Government that enables us to do that and not \ntake on every other issue that people have that they have wanted to \ndeal with and settle up over the years and use this bill for the \nopportunity to do that.\n  Those things that work well enough the way they are, leave well \nenough alone. But with respect to this question of border security, I \nthink we have to pay a lot of attention to the experts who have \nsuggested it is critical the emphasis on border security be recognized \nand that we understand what happens when we put the group of people who \ndo that work in a box or a division or directorate which has other \nresponsibilities.\n  This is arguably one of the most critical functions of the \nreorganization of homeland security, and we have to get it right. I am \nhoping my colleagues will consider, when we offer the substitute that I \nbelieve fixes this and gets\n\n[[Page S8739]]\n\nit back more to the original intention, that whatever else they may \nthink about aspects of the Byrd amendment or the Lieberman bill, they \nwill recognize this is an improvement and support that feature of the \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, earlier I spoke at some length \nexpressing my opposition to the amendment introduced by Senator Byrd. \nMembers have come to the floor and have spoken not so much on the \namendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia as they have on \nanother question which engages some considerable debate among Members \nof the Senate, and that is the question of civil service and management \nflexibility. I want to respond to the statements of the Senator from \nTexas and the Senator from Arizona and, to some extent, my friend, the \nSenator from Tennessee.\n  I have been disturbed and disappointed by the criticisms of the \nlegislation that came out of our Governmental Affairs Committee, which \nare based on the claim that it fails to give the President and the new \nSecretary of Homeland Security the authority they need to manage an \neffective Department. That is a serious charge and one that I \nrespectfully say is simply not right.\n  Those who have followed the development of this proposal through our \ncommittee know my intention since the beginning has, in fact, been the \nopposite, which is to give the President and the Secretary all the \npower they need to build a strong, efficient, and effective Department; \nin fact, more power to do so than this President wanted for some period \nof months. Ever since last October, along with other Members of the \nSenate, I have been asking for a Cabinet Department with authority and \naccountability precisely because I was convinced the President's \ninitial creation of an Office of Homeland Security, headed by Governor \nRidge, without statutory authority or budget authority, was too weak to \nget the job done.\n\n  It seems ironic to me now that the President, who for months resisted \nthe idea of a Department of Homeland Security and said that the Office \nof Homeland Security, headed by a coordinator, was all we needed to \nsafeguard the Nation, now says that the Department we would create \ngives him inadequate authority. I think this debate is really a detour \nfrom what should be our urgent common cause, and that is the creation \nof a new Department that will protect the security of the American \npeople, about which we agree on the majority of its components.\n  This is a debate that is being conducted in a kind of inside-the-\nbeltway vocabulary and not in good old, plain spoken English.\n  On civil service rights, union rights, appropriations, and transition \nauthority, the President claims he deserves flexibility and that our \nlegislation denies him flexibility by threatening to handcuff him and \nthe Secretary from exercising their rightful authority, but the \nPresident's pleas for flexibility are, in fact, a request, in my view, \nfor broad and unchecked authority in this regard. If we in the Congress \ndo not provide that broad and unchecked and, in my opinion, often \nunprecedented authority to this President and Secretary, we are being \nbranded as inflexible.\n  Congress has a duty to the American people in this case to write the \ncivil service laws. If we in the Senate turn over all that \nresponsibility and authority to the executive branch, simply because \nthe President urged us to do so, I suppose one could say it might \nstreamline things somewhat but we would be very much like a board of \ndirectors yielding all authority to the management--and we have seen in \nrecent times what can happen when boards of directors do that.\n  President Bush and Governor Ridge suggest our legislation will create \nan ineffective Department of Homeland Security because we decided not \nto give them the authority they requested in the President's bill to \nunilaterally waive and rewrite civil service law. That is what they \nwant. Extraordinary new powers. And they claim that without that \nauthority this Department is somehow not even worth creating, and they \nare threatening a veto if they do not get exactly their way on these \nprovisions. That, in my opinion, is a distortion of the facts and a \nconfusion of priorities.\n\n  The fact is, the Department of Homeland Security our legislation \nenvisions will be a modern, performance-driven Federal agency, one that \nthe Secretary and the President will have extensive authority to \nmanage. The committee-endorsed bill contains flexible civil service \nprovisions, including a broad, bipartisan civil service reform package, \nprovisions that strengthen the administration's hand when it comes to \nmanaging the new Department.\n  But we have incorporated these reforms responsibly, not haphazardly, \npreserving the central idea of the civil service system, which is \naccountability in the workplace. That is at the core of the civil \nservice system that was codified in law more than 20 years ago. It \nwould preserve the appropriate authority in the legislature to write \nthose laws.\n  I ask my colleagues to look carefully and honestly at what the civil \nservice system is, what kinds of reforms we provide in our legislation, \nand what the amendments being discussed to alter the civil service and \ncollective bargaining rights of Federal employees, as protected in our \ncommittee's work, would do.\n  The civil service system, first, is often derided, but rather than \ntaking the road of caricature, let's try to understand what it does and \nwhy it was developed. Once upon a time in government the rule used to \nbe to the victor goes the spoils--all the spoils. Most of us know about \nthe age of the spoils system officially ushered in by Andrew Jackson, \nin which elected officials used the Federal payroll to reward their \nfriends and supporters who, not surprisingly, were not always the most \nprepared people to fulfill those particular functions. That may have \nbeen good for the politicians of their day, but it wasn't good for the \nAmerican people because it produced a government with minimal \ninstitutional memory, minimal incentive for meritorious employees to \nwork hard, to rise through the ranks, and with both of those, minimal \npublic trust.\n  The civil service system changed that, moving the executive branch \nfrom a spoil system to a merit system with limits on favoritism and \ncronyism and to a transparent framework for attracting and retaining \nthe most talented public servants. That system has evolved over time, \nbut at the core it is still designed to shield most public servants and \nthe public they serve--us--from the forces of partisanship and \nfavoritism and special interest influence that can erode the merit-\nbased workplace in any administration. When the opponents of this \nlegislation deride the civil service system, these are the principles \nthey deride. When they mock the system, these are the values they mock.\n  Today, the top echelons of Departments are subject to political \nappointment, as they should be, to allow a President to select the \nloyal agency leadership he needs and deserves. But the bulk of public \nemployees are protected against the whims of changing political \nclimates. We now understand that effective Departments are made up of \nboth types of employees, working closely together and depending on one \nanother. Career civil servants who develop expertise, know the ins and \nouts of Government, and carry on the vital work of our Government from \none administration to the next, on the one hand; and \npolitical appointees who lead the Departments, set high-level policy \nand advance the agenda of the President's administration.\n\n  I will not stand here and defend every phase or clause of the civil \nservice system, just as I doubt anyone would stand and defend every \nclause of the Tax Code. At times the system has been too slow or too \nrigid to adapt to the changing workplace, to recognize and reward \nexcellence and to root out failure. Some of the flaws have been\n\n[[Page S8740]]\n\nfixed over time. Others have not and remain challenges.\n  I strongly support the system's fundamental principle which is to \nprovide a check on the politicalization and patronage to which \nGovernment agencies will otherwise be susceptible in any \nadministration. Civil service laws not only assert that personnel \ndecisions should be based on considerations of merit, but they provide \nprocedures and remedies if those principles are violated.\n  Think for a moment what it could mean to lose the public \naccountability assured by the civil service system. Talented senior \nmanagers, who dedicated their careers to public service, could be \npushed out and replaced with patronage appointees. Potential \nwhistleblowers at all levels of the organization would know they have \nlittle or no real protection against retaliation. Remember, we all \npraised Colleen Rowley when, in the courageous memo, she exposed the \nFBI's weaknesses so we could repair them. Those who would dismantle the \ncivil service system make it more likely that the Colleen Rowleys of \ntomorrow and the Department of Homeland Security would be silenced, not \nheard.\n  There was an actual case following exactly that pattern that occurred \nwith a Federal employee who became a whistleblower after September 11, \ncrying out that there was inadequate protection on our northern border. \nIn fact, he was suspended by his Department. His union came to his \ndefense and he was given back his job because a suspension for blowing \na whistle in pursuit of the public interest was irrational, unfair.\n  Employees' union representatives, if allowed at all, could be \nstripped of much of their ability to protect rank-and-file workers \nagainst abusive or self-protective political appointees.\n  Veterans and minorities under the proposals made by the President for \nso-called management flexibility can see their statutory rights ignored \nor left with insufficient remedies. That is why our committee did not \njust deride the system. We tried to fix it, and I think made some real \nprogress. Rather than just handing the President the authority to \neliminate whole chunks of existing civil service protections, we \ndeveloped the details for the key reforms we need to make this new \nDepartment work well.\n  I believe existing laws also give the President and Secretary far \nmore authority and flexibility to run an efficient, effective, and \nperformance-based Department of Homeland Security than the President \nand Governor Ridge have acknowledged. The administration says that the \nnew Department cannot function without ripping up the civil service \nsystem and starting from scratch. That is a myth. The General \nAccounting Office reported a few years ago describing the civil service \nlaw as codified in title 5 of the United States Code:\n\n       We found that, over the years, Title 5 has evolved to give \n     federal agencies more flexibility than they once had--and \n     often, more than they realize--to tailor their personnel \n     approaches to their missions and needs.\n\n  In a similar vein, last year the Bush administration's own Office of \nPersonnel Management issued a handbook entitled ``Human Resources \nFlexibilities and Authorities in the Federal Government.'' That \nhandbook painted a much different picture of the civil service law than \nwe are now hearing from the administration:\n\n       We have designed this handbook to communicate with you \n     about the myriad human resources (HR) flexibilities and \n     authorities currently available and how they can be used to \n     manage your human capital challenges. We serve as a resource \n     for you as you use existing HR flexibilities to strategically \n     align human resources management systems with your mission. \n     Through this handbook, you may be surprised to discover how \n     flexible Title 5 is in meeting your organizational needs.\n\n  I respectfully suggest to the White House that perhaps, if they \nlooked at this handbook put out by their own Office of Personnel \nManagement, they, to use the words of the handbook, would be:\n\n     . . . surprised to discover how flexible title 5 is in \n     meeting your organizational needs.\n\n  If we in Congress were to believe the administration's recent claims \nthat the civil service system is a hidebound anachronism, we, too, \nmight be surprised to discover how flexible title 5 actually is.\n  There is substantial flexibility in existing law, as I have said. But \nto rise to the challenge of the war against terrorism, we wanted our \nlegislation to go further. So we have incorporated sensible consensus \nreforms to improve the way Government manages personnel. We have \nupdated the civil service system to give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity and the President all the tools they could conceivably need to \nbuild the most effective Department of Homeland Security without \ncompromising the underlying values of the civil service system. In \nfact, if our legislation, as currently before the Senate from our \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, is adopted, the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity will literally have more management flexibility than any \nSecretary has today.\n  Incidentally, I want to give special credit to Senators Voinovich and \nAkaka, who worked together over a long period of time to develop the \nreforms in our bill. We have adopted these significant and \ngovernmentwide improvements in the civil service system.\n  To support research and development, we also authorized the Secretary \nto use innovative techniques to hire personnel in the new Science and \nTechnology Directorate, for instance. Taken together, this package \ngives the Secretary the ability to speed up staffing of new employees, \nto recruit and retain top science and technology talent, to reshape the \nFederal workforce, to procure temporary services outside the civil \nservice system when there is a critical need, to provide more effective \nbonuses for exemplary service, and to make other valuable changes to \nhelp the new Department attract, maintain, and motivate the best \nemployees.\n  Senator Voinovich has been a tireless advocate on behalf of a \nprinciple and a reality that does not get much attention around here \nbut is critically important to the functioning of the Federal \nGovernment and that, again, is described in a Washington beltway term, \n``human capital management.''\n  The point is, how do we get the best people to come to work for the \nFederal Government and then get them to have the widest latitude for \ntheir talents and encouragement to continue in Federal service? Part of \nthat clearly is the protections offered by the civil service system.\n  I cannot emphasize enough that the provisions contained in our \nlegislation have been hammered out over time with many contentious \nissues being carefully and, I might say, cooperatively resolved in a \nbipartisan fashion. We all know how detailed this can be and how much \ncare rewriting the law demands. The reforms we have incorporated, the \nVoinovich-Akaka reforms, reflect collaboration, consensus building, and \nthe input of countless experts.\n  I want to say particularly that Senator Akaka, our distinguished \ncolleague from Hawaii who is chair of the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security Proliferation and Federal \nServices, has now been working hard for 3 full years, with Senator \nVoinovich of Ohio and others, to adapt the civil service system to the \ndemands of the modern workforce and contemporary Government. They are \nunsung heroes in bringing human capital management into the 21st \ncentury. Out of their collaboration has emerged this bipartisan package \nof bold but sensible civil service reforms that are incorporated in the \nbill that came out of the Governmental Affairs Committee.\n\n  Now, on the other hand, the administration wants to throw everything \nout. Our bill has done, I think, the difficult work--but the work that \nCongress has an obligation to do--of separating the good from the bad, \ndiscarding the chaff and keeping the wheat. In fact, our reforms do \nmore to constructively change what is commonly viewed as one of the \nmost inflexible areas of civil service law--namely, the ability to \nswiftly hire top-flight talent--than any other proposal I have seen, \nand certainly any other that is on the table.\n  The President would wreak havoc on the current framework and put \nnothing in its place. I hope critics of the approach the committee has \ntaken will look carefully at these flexibilities I have described, \nwhich are substantial indeed. Let me elaborate just a bit more on what \nsome of those authorities are.\n  First, we give the administration the power to put the right people \nin the\n\n[[Page S8741]]\n\nright place at the right time. Existing law allows the Secretary to \nmove employees around in the Department, either by permanent \nreassignment or temporary detail. I would guess that most Members do \nnot appreciate that. Existing law allows the Secretary to move \nemployees around the Department, either by permanent reassignment or \ntemporary detail. Collective bargaining agreements may not affect the \nauthority of a manager to assign employees and to assign work. Again, \nin all the discussion about collective bargaining and national \nsecurity, this is a fact that is being overlooked. It reminds us how \nlimited are collective bargaining rights of Federal employees. They \ncan't strike--that is prohibited by law. But collective bargaining \nagreements actually may not deal with the authority of a manager to \nassign employees and to assign work. Any employee who refuses to be \nreassigned can be fired, and existing law allows managers to offer \nrecruitment bonuses, special salary rates, and even high critical pay \nlevels to attract high-quality employees.\n  New provisions in our legislation significantly simplify hiring so \nthat employees can be hired with little or no red tape. A government-\nwide amendment offered by the aforementioned Senators Voinovich and \nAkaka allows for the direct appointment of candidates to positions that \nhave been publicly noticed when it has been determined by OPM that \nthere is a severe shortage of candidates and a critical hiring need.\n  A second Voinovich-Akaka amendment will allow agencies to select \nemployees without applying the rule of three, under which agencies may \nnot look beyond the three top-scoring candidates for a competitive \nposition.\n  To accommodate special needs of the Department, the Secretary may \nprocure personnel services whenever necessary, due to an urgent \nhomeland security need, for periods of not more than a year, without \nregard to the usual pay caps. Let me go back. Our legislation says to \nthe Secretary of the new Department of Homeland Security: You can \nactually enter into a contract with people for services for not more \nthan a year without regard to the usual pay caps when you say there is \nan urgent homeland security need to do that.\n  Finally, in this regard, to support research and development, the \nSecretary, as I mentioned, is authorized to use innovative techniques \nto recruit top science and technology talent.\n  In fact, the bipartisan package of flexibilities in our legislation \noffers more in the area of hiring than does even the bill that passed \nthe House, which does not include the direct hire authority in cases of \ncritical need.\n  Second, the Governmental Affairs Committee legislation amendment \nbefore the Senate gives the Secretary new authority to reward good \nperformance so we can create a Department that encourages excellence \namong all its employees. Starting under existing law, the civil service \nlaw provides managers numerous avenues for providing incentives and \nrewards for good performance. Managers can decide, for instance, \nwhether employees have earned raises known as step increases based on \nperformance, and can award further ``quality step increases'' for \nexceptional performance. Managers can also grant incentive awards for \noverall high performance or for exceptional work on a particular \nassignment.\n\n  Managers can pay special bonuses to help with retention or relocation \nof particularly desirable employees.\n  Contrary to what some in the Administration have been saying, civil \nservice rules impose no cumbersome process for managers to gain \napproval of a pay raise. President Bush and the new Secretary will be \nfree to fashion as streamlined a process for giving merit raises as \nthey can.\n  The bipartisan Voinovich/Akaka amendments included in our legislation \nstrengthen performance bonuses for senior managers, by revising \noutdated rules that had required that bonuses for senior employees be \nspread over two years.\n  Finally, it is critical to recognize that under existing law, the \nadministration has the power it needs to discipline and remove poor \nperformers.\n  Under civil service law, during the first year of employment, a \nFederal worker may be fired for virtually any reason without notice. \nFollowing the one-year probationary period, under civil service \nstatutes, an agency must grant the employee a reasonable time to \nimprove performance, after which the agency owes the employee 30 days' \nnotice of a decision to demote or fire. And contrary to stereotype, \noutside appeals are handled after an employee is off the payroll.\n  If a manager is sufficiently concerned about an employee's poor \nperformance or misconduct, the employee can be pulled from duty \nimmediately, without hesitation or red tape. If necessary for national \nsecurity, the employee may be suspended without pay immediately. After \ninvestigation and review, if necessary, the employee can then be fired \nwithout appeal. The President can authorize any agency head to suspend \nand fire where necessary for national security, and the President is \nfree to give this power to the new Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The allegations which have been made on the floor that we will limit \nthe powers of the President regarding national security just do not \ntake into consideration this provision in the law. The President can \nauthorize any agency head to suspend and fire where necessary for \nnational security immediately and without pay.\n  I have seen some opponents of our approach contend that under our \nlegislation, incompetent, irresponsible, or even intoxicated employees \ncouldn't be removed from duty. This is simply wrong. And I regret that \nthis myth is being stated as fact occasionally by one or another \nrepresentative of the administration. The truth is, under current law, \nsuch an employee can be removed from duty immediately, without \nhesitation or red tape. And the employee can be taken immediately off \nthe payroll if the Secretary determines that he or she might endanger \nnational security.\n  But that is not all. We understand the Secretary may need more \nauthority down the road. That is why we explicitly leave the door open \nfor the executive branch to get more power, as needed--because neither \nwe, nor, I believe, the administration, yet knows what the experience \nof assembling this big new Department will teach its managers about the \nspecific modifications to the Department's personnel system that may \nprove necessary. We want to give the Congress and the administration \nthe opportunity to tailor additional authorities and flexibilities to \nthe specific circumstances we face.\n  And they are free to come back and make that case to us. During the \ninitial 18-month startup period for the new Department, our legislation \nspecifically requires the Secretary to submit to Congress semi-annual \nlegislative recommendations that will help integrate the disparate \npersonnel systems in the new Department and will provide any further \npersonnel authority that is necessary to meet the needs of the new \nDepartment.\n  All we ask is that these requests are based on some experience, not \non ideology or assumption. We want them to be specific, not hopelessly \nbroad. And we want the process to respect the proper role of Congress \nto consider the proposals and write that law.\n  It is not appropriate for Congress--it has a familiar ring to it, I \nsay to Senator Byrd--to write a blank check for a new Department \nregarding the civil service law allowing them to disregard that law--no \nmore appropriate than it would be for us to write a blank check for it \nto give a new Department blanket exemption, for instance, from \nenvironmental law, civil rights law, or protection of the rights of the \ndisabled. Rather, what we should do--and what we do do in our bill--is \nto provide a swift and acceptable mechanism to provide more authorities \nif and when the administration makes the case that they need them.\n  In developing the provisions of our bill that invite the Secretary to \ncome back to Congress with requests for further personnel flexibility \nif he deems it necessary, our committee was influenced by my experience \nworking with the Comptroller General when he asked a couple of years \nago for additional personnel authority at GAO. He advised the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee that the legislative flexibilities he \nreceived might not be appropriate for other Federal agencies, but that \nthe process he and Congress undertook to\n\n[[Page S8742]]\n\njustify that legislation would be appropriate. I would like to read an \nexcerpt from Mr. Walker's testimony on that subject:\n\n       Congress can play a defining role in determining the scope \n     and appropriateness of additional human capital flexibilities \n     agencies may seek through legislation. For agencies that \n     request legislative exceptions from current civil service \n     constraints, Congress can require that they make a sound \n     business case based on rational and fact-based analyses of \n     their needs, the constraints under which they presently \n     operate, and the flexibilities available to them. For \n     example, before we submitted human capital legislative \n     proposals for GAO last year, we applied the due diligence \n     needed not only to identify in our own minds the \n     flexibilities we need to better manage our human capital, but \n     also to give Congress a clear indication of our needs, our \n     rationale, and the steps we were committed to taking in order \n     to maximize the benefits while managing the risks. The \n     process we followed included a thorough analysis of our human \n     capital needs and flexibilities, clear standards of \n     implementation, and multiple opportunities for employee \n     involvement and feedback.\n\n  GAO's advice on this subject was even clearer in another submission \nto the committee, which said, ``agencies should be required to prepare \na business case and take steps to address their challenges within \nexisting law before being granted any additional legislative \nflexibility.''\n  In other words, Comptroller General Walker laid out the case for what \nreforms he needed. He asked for specific authorities--not for a blanket \nexemption. We considered his request, and we gave him what he wanted.\n  That is the way it ought to work. That is the way our committee's \nproposal regarding civil service would have it work.\n  Some of my colleagues have claimed that in our bill, we gave less \npersonnel flexibility and authority to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity than we in Congress gave to the heads of the FAA, the IRS, and \nthe TSA. That is just wrong. It is not true that Congress simply \ngranted personnel flexibility to the heads of those agencies. To the \ncontrary, the personnel flexibilities that Congress provided for those \nagencies is shared through a collective bargaining process between \nagency managers and the Federal employee unions at those agencies.\n  And in the best companies in our country today, following modern \nmanagement techniques, the old labor-management divisions have ended. \nPeople are working together in a cooperative fashion.\n  I visited an automobile parts company in Ypsilanti, MI, a couple of \nyears ago. There are remarkable changes. The workers on the floor elect \nthe foreman for a set period of time. They can reelect him or not. The \nexecutives moved out of their offices and turned their office space \ninto a fitness center for all employees. Management moved their desks \nright out on the floor where they are working together.\n  That is the standard for modern management practice. That is what we \nadopted for the IRS. For example, we granted several authorities that \ncan be applied to unionized employees. There is real management \nflexibility--where there is a written agreement between the union and \nthe IRS.\n  I have heard references from some of our colleagues who say they are \nupset about our civil service provisions which basically protect \nexisting law and ask for more reforms. They have cited the IRS as an \nexample of what good can be done when an agency is given authority.\n\n  But, again, we gave the IRS authority to carry out management \nflexibilities with the written agreement of their employees' union, and \nit has worked. At the FAA, for instance, agency managers must bargain \nwith Federal employee unions over wages, and also must negotiate with \nthe unions in developing and making any changes to the agency's \npersonnel management system.\n  So in some ways the IRS and the FAA follow much more of a private \nsector model today, which is very progressive, with lessening of civil \nservice controls in certain areas, and with a corresponding increase of \nthe role of unions and collective bargaining in establishing the terms \nand conditions of employment.\n  It is true that our legislation does not in fact go down that road, \nbut of course neither does the administration's proposal for the \nDepartment of Homeland Security. Some of the proposals I have seen, \nfrom the White House and elsewhere, including from colleagues in the \nSenate, would empower the Secretary to cut back on the rights and roles \nthat Federal employees and their unions would have at this new \nDepartment.\n  I have not seen a proposal from the administration for the Department \nthat would replace civil service protections with an enhanced statutory \nrole for collective bargaining and the unions. So I ask, why do \nadministration supporters, on the floor in this debate, keep referring \nto the IRS and FAA precedents as though they were advocating anything \nlike them now? If they were really advocating something like them, I \nthink we might have the basis of a bipartisan agreement.\n  Let's give the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security broad \nauthority to enact further civil service reforms with the written \nagreement of the unions representing his or her employees. It has \nworked at the IRS and the FAA, and it might well work at the Department \nof Homeland Security.\n  As I said, President Bush does not seek to seriously reform the civil \nservice system or make a solid business case for any new authorities. \nInstead, he really seeks to rip out big chunks of civil service law and \nto push that change through in the context of this urgent common cause \nof creating a new Department of Homeland Security.\n  Though the House, in its bill, has done a bit more homework, it still \nfails the test. The House bill states that several fundamental civil \nservice provisions will apply to the new Department. Those include \nrequirements to provide a preference in hiring and retention of \nveterans, which the President's proposal would eliminate; the \nprotection of whistleblowers, which the President's proposal would \neliminate; it prohibits nepotism, favoritism, and other forms of \ndiscrimination, which the President's proposal would eliminate; and it \nprotects the right to unionize, which the President's proposal would \nalso eliminate.\n  However, almost all of these rights are provided in name only in the \nHouse bill, unfortunately. In major areas, the House bill would then \nturn over, again, a blank check to this administration to waive or \nrewrite civil service protections and procedures, with the \nadministration having given us no indication of how they will use this \nextraordinary power.\n  Second, the House bill states that employees would be able to join \nunions, but then allows the administration to unilaterally rewrite all \nthe statutory rules of collective bargaining that give unionization \nwhatever significance it has under existing Federal law.\n  Third, the House bill would also turn over power to \nthe administration to rewrite other central elements of the civil \nservice system, including performance appraisal, discipline, and job \nclassification and pay. These aspects of civil service provide for \nfairness across Government, avoid destructive bidding wars among \nagencies, and provide employees protection, most importantly, against \nunfair, arbitrary, or discriminatory decisions. The House bill \nessentially throws out all of those.\n\n  Finally, under the House bill, as the proposed new rules are \ndeveloped for the Department, the bill relegates union representatives \nto the role of receiving notice and making recommendations for the \nSecretary's consideration. This is far more constrained than the \ntraditional function of unions, limited as they are under Federal law, \nwhich is to bargain over matters where management has discretion.\n  When Congress enacted legislation, again, allowing the FAA and IRS to \ndevelop alternative personnel rules, we specified that the unions would \nhave a place at the bargaining table regarding those rules. That is \nfair, that is progressive, that is productive, and that is modern. The \nHouse provision limiting the role of employees and their \nrepresentatives is unfair and unacceptable.\n  Finally, the choice before us on civil service is simple: Improve it \nor remove it. Make it better or rip it up. While our legislation lives \nup, in my view, to Congress's responsibility to improve the civil \nservice system, the alternatives proposed by the administration and in \nthe House bill don't meet that responsibility. They, to use a word \nfamiliar to us during this season, punt. They leave it all to the \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S8743]]\n\nThey would have Congress leave it all to the administration to rewrite \nthe law.\n  That would be problematic in just about any realm, but it is \nparticularly problematic here, as the administration represents \nmanagement, one of the parties directly affected by the law.\n  Powers are strictly separated in our constitutional system for a \nreason. I have not hesitated to make clear that I believe the \nPresident, in his role as Commander in Chief, for instance, should have \nsubstantial powers to determine when and how we take military action to \nprotect national security. But rewriting laws is the job of Congress, \nthe responsibility of Congress. Indeed, the separation of powers is \nespecially important in the case of civil service law, again, for the \nreason I have stated: Because the administration is the management, it \nis one of the two parties directly affected by the law. Congress, in \neffect, must play the role of a fair and honest mediator, broker, and \nlegislator. Only Congress should change the law.\n  So we have two choices here: To embrace significant reforms, as \nincluded in our bill, and leave additional changes that may seem to be \nnecessary, after some experience, for consideration in the future, \nbased on a solid business case made by the Secretary is one choice. On \nthe other hand, we can simply abdicate and give the administration the \nright to rewrite the current civil service system by administrative \nfiat. That, of course, is an easy choice for me.\n  Also, I would state, in response to the underlying amendment the \nSenator from West Virginia has proposed, what we have done here in \ncivil service is very much similar to what we have done in most of the \nrest of the bill; that is, we have tried to dispatch Congress's \nresponsibility to write the law, not to give the administration a blank \ncheck in any area, to respect the executive branch and the need for \nauthority in the executive branch, but to understand that \nconstitutionally we have the responsibility to legislate. That is \nexactly what we have done in a progressive fashion with regard to the \ncivil service laws for our Federal workers.\n  I had not intended to speak on this this afternoon, but those of our \ncolleagues who have come to speak not on the Byrd amendment but against \nthe civil service provisions in the committee's proposal required a \nresponse on this day.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                  unanimous consent request--h.r. 5093\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today we have tried to come up with some \ntype of resolution of the fire suppression amendment that has been \nholding up this Interior appropriations bill for some time. We have \nbeen unable to do that. As a result of that--and I have spoken with \nSenator Byrd--I do not think the Interior appropriations bill is going \nto move forward.\n  Until there is some way to resolve that amendment, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the order with respect to consideration of the Interior \nappropriations bill be modified so that the bill may be temporarily \nlaid aside and that it recur upon the disposition of the homeland \nsecurity bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I appreciate the frustration the assistant \nleader is going through at this moment trying to resolve an issue on \nthe Interior appropriations bill about which he and I are concerned and \nmove it forward and at the same time move homeland security forward.\n  Today we have worked to facilitate both of those bills, and I have \nencouraged the majority leader and the assistant leader to allow a vote \non my amendment, which is pending on the Interior appropriations bill \nor, if not, a stand-alone vote, and then to allow a side by side, with \ntheir alternative, by a majority vote of either. That is not what they \napparently want to do at this moment.\n  I do not want to see the Interior appropriations bill laid aside. We \nhave critical fire money in the bill. We have critical drought money in \nthe bill for agriculture. The Interior appropriations bill is very key \nto my State.\n  At the same time, we must bring this Senate together on some way of \ndealing with the crisis in our forests today that has resulted in \ndevastating fires across the West. I feel very strongly about that. At \nthe same time, I know the leader has worked hard to facilitate homeland \nsecurity. Certainly it is very evident this side is not holding up that \nbill at this moment. We want the votes. We want to move the issue, deal \nwith it, and get it to the President's desk before we adjourn or recess \nfor the November elections. Under those considerations, dual track is \nimportant.\n  I say to the leader, give me a vote. Give me a vote on the Craig-\nDomenici amendment up or down--however. But I do believe we deserve a \nvote. I do believe it is critically important that the Senate of the \nUnited States express its will on a 6.5-million-acre loss to wildfire \nthis year and thousands of homes and well over 25 lives. We must deal \nwith the issue.\n  This situation has cost us--and I think Senator Reid will agree--$800 \nmillion extra in this budget, to fight fires or to pay the debt of the \nfires that have already been fought. We will spend well over $1 billion \nof extra money this year. With that, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am disappointed in that I believe we need \nto move forward with homeland security and stop treading water on this \nInterior appropriations bill. The Interior appropriations bill is as \nimportant to Nevada as any appropriations bill we do. There are many \nprovisions in this bill that will help Nevada, and other issues that \nare waiting to be approved by the two managers. I would love to have \nthe Interior appropriations bill done.\n  For my friend, the distinguished Senator from Idaho, to say he wants \na vote on his amendment, we agreed, more than a week ago, to have side-\nby-side amendments: their amendment, our amendment. There would have to \nbe a 60-vote threshold because, whether we like it or not, the rules of \nthe Senate are here, and on matters of importance--I should not say of \nimportance. We have a lot of matters that are important that do not \nrequire 60 votes. Matters that are in controversy take 60 votes. This \nis one of those matters that are in controversy. We simply have to go \nforward on that basis. That is why we are unable to have a simple \nmajority vote on their amendment or our amendment, because we cannot \nget 60 votes on our amendment and they cannot get 60 votes on their \namendment.\n  It is hard for me to comprehend why, when just a few days ago we \napproved money for drought assistance, which received 79 votes. As we \nspeak, ranchers and farmers throughout America are in deep need of \nthese moneys, and until this legislation passes, they are not going to \nget that money. So those people who voted for that drought assistance \nare now preventing us from going forward.\n  That does not mean, Mr. President, if we get off this bill, we will \nnot somehow be able to do the Interior appropriations bill. Maybe we \ncan. Also, what it does not mean is, if we do not do the fire \namendment, as my friend from Idaho thinks it should be done this year \nin this bill, that it will not be done in some other form, some other \nbill. I hope that as time goes on, we are going to be able to spend \nfull time on homeland security. If we do not, it is going to be hard to \nfinish that bill, especially if on the Interior appropriations bill we \nare treading water and accomplishing nothing. We have all these other \nappropriations bills we need to do.\n  I, frankly, see the picture very clearly. It seems to me the minority \ndoes not want us to pass any appropriations bills. They are looking \nforward to a continuing resolution. That may be what it comes to. That \nwill be the decision of the two leaders. At least, if\n\n[[Page S8744]]\n\nthey do not want to complete any appropriations bills, let us finish \nhomeland security. We will not dual-track anything else if we do not \nwant it. We will stay off the appropriations bills at least until we \nfinish homeland security. If we have to spend a half a day every day \ndoing nothing, it is going to be extremely hard to finish homeland \nsecurity.\n  I spoke with the two managers of the bill yesterday. Both sides have \namendments they want to offer. They are credible amendments. No one at \nthis stage is trying to stall the bill. I think we would be well \nadvised to do what the majority leader has indicated and vote to invoke \ncloture on this bill tomorrow. From the word I have received, that does \nnot appear to be what the minority is going to let us do. Again, it \nrequires 60 votes. We would take a simple majority vote on that. But \nthat will not happen. Things do not work that way here. We require 60 \nvotes on matters of controversy.\n  So unless my friend has more to say, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 4554, 4599, 4623, 4552, 4588, And 4563, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to report that Senator \nThompson and I have been working with various other Members of the \nSenate, and we have reached agreement on a series of amendments that \nboth sides have cleared.\n  Before I make the actual motion, I will indicate what they are. The \nfirst is amendment No. 4554 on behalf of Senators Sarbanes, Mikulski, \nWarner, and Allen, which would create within the Department of Homeland \nSecurity an office for national capital region coordination which would \nprovide a single Federal point of contact to help integrate the plans \nand preparedness activities of the Federal agencies and entities in the \nDistrict of Columbia with the efforts of State, local, and regional \nauthorities in the Greater Washington area.\n  The second amendment is No. 4599 on behalf of Senators Harkin and \nLugar. This amendment more effectively transfers the border inspection \nfunctions of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to the new \nDepartment.\n  Next is amendment No. 4623, which would, on behalf of Senator \nThompson and myself, add the E-Government Act of 2002 to this \nlegislation. This would give the Federal Government the tools and \nstructure to reform its information technology systems, one of the \ngreatest vulnerabilities of agencies now tasked with homeland security \nmissions. This E-Government Act, I note for the record, was originally \ncosponsored by Senator Burns and many others. It is the result of \nmonths of productive negotiations with Senator Thompson and the \nadministration.\n  Next is amendment No. 4552 on behalf of Senators Clinton and Specter. \nThis would require the Directorate of Critical Infrastructure \nProtection to assess the vulnerabilities of, identify priorities and \nsupport protective measures for and develop a comprehensive national \nplan to secure not only the critical infrastructure in the United \nStates but also its key resources. This is an attempt to make clear \nthat key resources include National Park sites identified by the \nSecretary of the Interior that are so universally recognized as symbols \nof the United States that they would likely or might possibly be \nidentified as targets of terrorist attacks.\n  Also, amendment No. 4588, on behalf of Senator Rockefeller, which \nconsists of a series of technical changes to existing law to ensure \nthat the Coast Guard members retain all of the benefits they are now \nentitled to under the Montgomery GI bill, once the Coast Guard is moved \nto the new Department.\n  And finally, amendment No. 4563, on behalf of Senators Bayh, Shelby, \nand others, which would improve the protection of the Department of \nDefense storage depots for lethal chemical agents and munitions by \nstrengthening temporary flight restrictions on the airspace near these \ndepots.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that it be in order to consider \nthe following amendments: 4554, 4599, 4623, 4552, 4588, and 4563, and \nthat Senator Thompson be added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 4623; \nthat these amendments be considered and agreed to, and that the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                             amendment 4554\n\n (Purpose: To create an Office of National Capital Region Coordination \n              within the Department of Homeland Security)\n\n       On page 114, between lines 20 and 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 141.

Mr. President, I would like to make some additional \ncomments regarding the inclusion of amendment number 4623 in this \nlegislation.\n  The E-Government Act of 2002 is vitally needed to enhance our \nhomeland security, and is directly relevant to the goal of ensuring \nimproved homeland security. The bipartisan bill, originally cosponsored \nby Senator Burns, is the result of months of productive negotiations \nwith Senator Thompson and the administration. It passed the Senate as \nS. 803 by unanimous consent in June. The Committee on Governmental \nAffairs produced an extensive report, Report No. 107-174, to which I \nrefer my colleagues for more information about the bill.\n  The E-Government Act will give the Federal Government the tools and \nstructure to transform its IT systems, one of the greatest \nvulnerabilities of agencies now tasked with homeland security missions. \nAs we've seen through dozens of depressing revelations over the last \nyear, we have a desperate need for more effective and systematic \ninformation sharing between agencies like the FBI, CIA, Department of \nState, the INS, and state and local authorities. The E-Government Act \nwill help the federal government get that job done, by establishing \nmore effective IT management, establishing mandates for action, and \nauthorizing funding.\n  The bill will also substantially enhance the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to quickly provide information and services to citizens to \nhelp them prepare for, and respond to, terrorism, natural disasters, \nand other homeland threats. In the hours and days after the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, Americans flooded Government's websites in \nrecord numbers, seeking information more targeted than what the media \nwas providing: what was happening; how they should respond to protect \nthemselves from possible future attacks; how they could help victims; \nand how people who were victims themselves could seek assistance. The \nE-Government Act will substantially enhance the ability of the Federal \nGovernment to quickly provide information and services to citizens to \nhelp them prepare for, and respond to, terrorism, natural disasters, \nand other homeland threats.\n  Finally, the bill will make permanent the Thompson-Lieberman \nGovernment Information Security Reform Act, which is about to expire. \nWeak computer security has been a widespread problem in the Federal \nGovernment, with potentially devastating consequences. In response, the \nSenate passed this important information security legislation last \nCongress, but that legislation is scheduled to expire in November.\n  I thank the Chair, Senator Thompson, staff, and all others who have \ncooperated to allow us to move forward with these amendments. Noting my \nfriend and colleague on the floor whom we all welcome back to \nWashington after some surgery, he looks younger and more knowledgeable \nthan ever, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to commend my chairman, Senator \nLieberman, for his outstanding work and his extraordinary leadership in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8746]]\n\ncommittee, and to mention that it was after Senator Lieberman began his \ninitiative to create such a Department that it began to pick up, not \nonly in the Senate but with the administration, too. He has crafted, I \nbelieve, a strong piece of legislation for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  This evening I rise to express my strong support for Senator \nLieberman's substitute. I have strong respect for the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia but I will vote against his amendment. Senator \nLieberman has done a great service to his country by holding hearings \nand debating extensively the structure of a Department of Homeland \nSecurity. Without his determined effort, the President might never have \nconceded the need for such a department. As Senator Thompson has noted, \nthe Governmental Affairs Committee debated in great deal the structure \nof such a department. Numerous changes were made to the President's \nproposal which have substantially improved it.\n  I rise to discuss the flexibilities available at the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the Internal Revenue Service. My colleagues have \ncriticized the legislation before us for not providing the same \nflexibilities available to the FAA and the IRS. The most important \nfactor in the personnel systems at these two agencies is the \ninvolvement of federal employee unions.\n  In April 1996, at Congressional direction, FAA was allowed to develop \nits own personnel and compensation systems, to give the agency more \nflexibility because of its daily interaction with the fast-paced and \nrapidly-growing aviation industry. The Secretary of Transportation \nargued strongly that the agency needed flexibility to pay people what \nthe job required and to move them where the work was needed, without \nthe restrictions of standard government personnel procedures.\n  While the FAA was given wide authority to develop their personnel \nsystem, the FAA still must negotiate with its federal employee unions \nin developing and making changes to the personnel management system. \nThe FAA system contains provisions protecting a large portion of the \nrights of federal workers. These include whistleblower protections, \nincluding the provisions for investigation and enforcement; veterans' \npreference; anti-discrimination; compensation for work injury; \nretirement, unemployment compensation, and insurance coverage; and \nreview of employee matters by the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n  In addition, employees subject to major adverse personnel actions may \ncontest the action through any contractual grievance procedure.\n  And because the FAA is not subject to federal pay rate regulations, \nthe federal employee unions are allowed to bargain over wages at the \nFAA as they do in the private sector.\n  Such bargaining rights are not provided in the President's original \nHomeland Security bill or the House passed bill. In fact, both bills \nwould allow even current collective bargaining rights to be waived.\n  Despite this praise of FAA flexibility, just last year, the \nRepublican-led House Appropriations Committee concluded that FAA's \npersonnel reform has been a failure. At that time, the most recent FAA \nemployee attitude survey showed severe levels of employee \ndissatisfaction, even as compensation levels rose to make DOT the \nhighest-paid cabinet level agency in the Federal Government.\n  Fewer than one in ten employees felt that personnel reform had been \nsuccessful at eliminating bureaucracy or helping accomplish FAA's \nmission. Fewer than one in five felt the agency rewards creativity and \ninnovation--even though personnel reform allows the agency great \nflexibility in this area.\n  A review of staffing at air traffic control facilities indicates that \nreform has not been used to place employees where they are needed. \nThese findings were supported by an independent study conducted by the \nNational Academy of Public Administration, which found that FAA hasn't \nmet many of the key goals of personnel reform.\n  In addition, the House Committee believed that Congress should \ncarefully review the effects of personnel reform leading up to \nreauthorization of AIR 21 in fiscal year 2004 to gauge whether the \nexperiment should be continued.\n  According to the GAO, the decentralized personnel structure that \nresulted from FAA's reform has caused moral problems, communication \ngaps and inconsistencies in technical advice and leadership within FAA \norganizations, and insufficient understanding throughout the workforce \nabout the intent of reforms. As a result of these problems, FAA lacks a \nbroad base of support and accountability for reform initiatives among \nemployees below the highest management levels.\n  More recently, TSA, which uses the FAA's pay banding system, has \ncaused great concern with the high salaries given to federal law \nenforcement officers that are higher than those currently earned at \nother federal agencies. Such a system has contributed to the loss of \nlaw enforcement officers at the Capitol Police, the U.S. Park Police \nand the U.S. Secret Service.\n  The IRS was granted additional flexibilities to address its unique \nworkforce as well. The IRS personnel flexibilities include: critical \npay authority; enhanced recruitment, retention, and relocation \nauthority; enhanced authority for performance awards to senior \nexecutives; and exceptions to Title 5 rules in filling Senior Executive \nService positions which are reserved for career employees.\n  Additional flexibilities are granted to the IRS which can only be \napplied to union represented employees subject to a written agreement \nbetween the union and the IRS. This includes streamlined demonstration \nproject authority; variations to the performance appraisal and awards \nsections of Title 5; variations from Title 5 pay and classification \nsystems for pay banding; and variations from Title 5 hiring rules.\n  However, the IRS' progress on reform seems welcome to all but those \nwho work inside the agency. In response to the agency's 2001 employee \nclimate survey, 42 percent of employees said the organizational changes \nhave had a negative effect on them, compared with 24 percent who \nreported positive effects and 34 percent who reported no effect. Such \ndissatisfaction does nothing to help retain employees when the federal \ngovernment is facing a human capital crisis.\n  While there has been an increase in customer satisfaction with the \nIRS, the widespread personnel reshuffling has yet to guarantee that the \nIRS is matching its workforce to its workload appropriately. Over the \npast four years, the backlog of taxpayer requests for compromise \nsettlements with the IRS on the amount of back taxes they owe tripled, \neven though the staff devoted to the backlog has doubled. A General \nAccounting Office review found that putting staff on the compromise \nprogram may be hurting other collection programs. The large percentage \nof bad information given to taxpayers by IRS employees also shows that \nthe right people with the right skills are not in place in customer \nservice jobs--though the IRS is retraining customer service \nrepresentatives to improve accuracy.\n  As we are debating the creation of a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity, we must make sure that providing new flexibilities does not \ncompromise the mission of the agency. In providing the agency with the \ntools to effectively manage their workforce, we must make sure that \nagencies have a strategy in place to meet their missions and keep \nemployees satisfied. If our dedicated workers do not feel valuable to \nthe agency, the mission will fail. Without sufficient union \nparticipation and civil service protections, our homeland will not be \nsecure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 13, \n2002 in Temecula, CA. Two black women were assaulted in a restaurant \nparking lot. The assailants, described as a group of drunken white men, \nsurrounded the victims' car, pounded dents into it, taunted the women \nwith racial slurs, and attacked one of them physically, ripping her \nclothing.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8747-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8747-S8749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NEW ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS TO CUT SERVICES TO VETERANS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nlatest action by the Administration to cut services to veterans.\n  For years when we looked at the health care budget, we focused on the \ndeclining veteran population and declining demand. We are in a totally \ndifferent predicament today. More veterans are turning to the VA health \ncare system, and that is a success story. In recent months, however, \nunacceptably long waiting times for care have materialized. Cutting \nservices to veterans who now depend more upon VA, is a perverse \nreaction to the problem.\n  In 1996, Congress enacted eligibility reform which allowed all \nveterans to come to the VA health care system. At the time, I spoke \nabout the dilemma that we would face in opening up the doors and \nproviding a rich benefit package and how, down the road, we would have \nto face the consequences.\n  In my view, the administration has a choice: Either own up to the \ndemand for health care services and provide funding--my preference--or \nmanage enrollment. The administration has chosen a completely different \ncourse.\n  In its budget request, the administration proposed charging a $1,500 \ndeductible to higher-income veterans as a means to ``reduce demand.'' \nIn July, VA issued a mandate prohibiting all enrollment-generating \nactivities, such as health fairs. Yesterday, regulations\n\n[[Page S8748]]\n\nwere issued to require VA to give priority for health care services to \nveterans with service-connected conditions. No veteran who is enrolled \nwith VA for health care should have to endure long waiting times for \ncare.\n  The administration's latest action changes the way veterans access \nhealth care services, and in doing so, not only circumvents current law \nregarding eligibility for care, but will also create serious hardship \nfor hundreds of thousands of veterans who depend upon VA. These \nregulations should be rescinded. Today, several other Senators and I \nwrote to the President and asked that he do so.\n  These regulations will almost certainly increase--rather than \ndecrease--the waiting times facing hundreds of thousands of veterans. \nLet me repeat that: The recent regulations will do nothing for the more \nthan 300,000 veterans waiting to be seen by VA clinicians, and in fact, \nthe new priority system could more than double the time they are forced \nto wait for care. I ask unanimous consent that VA's list of waiting \ntimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Survey conducted July 1, 2002.\n       Data was gathered from multiple clinics at all VA \n     facilities. The data sources included Excel spreadsheets and \n     manual lists as well as the scheduling package for those \n     waiting 6 months or greater for an appointment. Because the \n     survey was derived primarily from manual data collection, \n     patients waiting at more than one site may be counted more \n     than once; the data could also reflect the same patient \n     waiting for multiple clinics at one specific site. Therefore, \n     the data should be viewed as an indicator of an overall \n     problem. We are working on automating the wait list to ensure \n     more accurate reporting.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                       B Number of established\n                                                                                       patients waiting to be\n                                                                                       scheduled for follow-up\n                                                        A Number of new enrollees     primary care or specialty\n         Veterans integrated service network            waiting for first clinic    care clinic appointments and\n                                                       appointment to be scheduled  new and established patients\n                                                                                     with appointments scheduled\n                                                                                    electronically, although the\n                                                                                     wait is 6 months or greater\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1...................................................                         9,891                        12,130\n2...................................................                           460                         1,844\n3...................................................                            82                         2,448\n4...................................................                        18,535                         8,061\n5...................................................                             0                           217\n6...................................................                             0                        29,124\n7...................................................                         4,662                         3,299\n8...................................................                        31,469                        22,474\n9...................................................                        11,093                         7,887\n10..................................................                            13                         1,239\n11..................................................                         1,172                         2,562\n12..................................................                         8,922                         9,424\n15..................................................                         1,283                         6,616\n16..................................................                         5,490                         8,126\n17..................................................                         1,874                        17,444\n18..................................................                             0                         4,471\n19..................................................                         8,230                         9,342\n20..................................................                         8,891                        15,702\n21..................................................                         1,013                         5,015\n22..................................................                             0                         3,810\n23..................................................                        19,198                         6,471\n                                                     -----------------------------------------------------------\n      Totals........................................                       132,278                       177,976\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Col A: Number of new enrollees waiting for first \n     appointment where an appointment has not been scheduled. \n     Represents a manual count of Veterans who have enrolled and \n     requested an appointment but the Veteran's preferred site of \n     care cannot schedule the appointment within six months. \n     Therefore, the veteran is placed on a wait list.

The Paralyzed Veterans of America, too, is very \nconcerned about these new regulations, as the new system ``completely \nignore[s] the other key missions of the VA health care system to care \nfor the poor and medically indigent and those veterans with special \ndisabilities such as spinal cord dysfunction, blindness, and mental \nillness.'' I ask unanimous consent that the full text of PVA's letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2002.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller, IV,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Rockefeller: On behalf of the Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America (PVA), I am writing to express our grave \n     concerns over the attempts by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA) to move forward with an interim final rule that \n     has insufficient statutory grounding.\n       VA Secretary Anthony Principi has proposed an interim final \n     rule dispensing with notice-and-comment requirements under \n     the Administrative Procedures Act. These fast track \n     regulations dramatically alter existing eligibility for VA \n     health care services. Faced with woefully inadequate funding \n     requests from the Bush Administration and the Congress for \n     the veterans' health care system, the new regulations would \n     give hospital administrators the authority to ration care by \n     establishing a priority for treatment for certain veterans \n     with service connected disabilities. Veterans with service \n     connected disabilities rated 50 percent and above and \n     veterans seeking care for their service connected \n     disabilities would get access to treatment before any other \n     veteran is served. No one can argue that service-connected \n     disabled veterans do not deserve the highest priority for \n     veterans benefits and services. However, by allowing \n     admitting clerks to give them front-of-the-line access, the \n     regulations inherently give these same clerks the authority \n     to deny care to veterans in other categories when budgets \n     remain tight. This is the real intent of the proposed \n     regulations, and we believe, contrary to VA opinions, that \n     the VA lacks the statutory authority to deny care to higher-\n     priority veterans in lieu of the Secretary's granted \n     authority to disenroll lower-priority veterans.\n       PVA, along with every other major veterans service \n     organization worked for nearly a decade to enact legislation \n     that would standardize veterans' eligibility for health care \n     services. Prior to enactment of eligibility reform \n     legislation in 1996, access to health care services was \n     governed by a fragmented bureaucratic tangle of regulations \n     governed primarily by fiscal considerations. Some veterans \n     could get some services; some veterans could get others but \n     only under certain circumstances and under certain conditions \n     governed in part by veteran status, not health care need. The \n     veterans organizations argued that such a system was unfair, \n     did not provide the optimal health care services needed by \n     veterans, was a bureaucratic nightmare and, more importantly, \n     was medically unethical.\n       Eligibility reform legislation brought simplicity to the \n     process. Veterans would be enrolled in the system based on \n     veterans status and economic need in seven categories. Once \n     enrolled, each veteran was entitled to the complete VA health \n     benefits package on an\n\n[[Page S8749]]\n\n     equal basis. This was not only good policy; it was good \n     medicine. Veterans with service-connected disabilities were \n     included in the highest enrollment categories to ensure \n     complete and speedy access to the system. In fact, because of \n     their service-connected disabilities they were even exempted \n     from enrollment requirements. If these high-priority veterans \n     are having difficulty accessing VA health care now, as the \n     Secretary has stated, then the problem lies in the inability \n     of the Administration to fund the VA properly and the \n     incompetence of VA admitting clerks who ignore current \n     eligibility law and the high priority these veterans already \n     have. Both of these problems should be rectified without the \n     institution of new regulations. The $275 million in emergency \n     supplemental funding that the White House refused to allocate \n     to the VA last month could have gone a long way to ease the \n     burden on the system. The re-characterization of health care \n     access in the proposed regulations is a major step backward \n     toward the chaos that existed in the pre-eligibility reform \n     days.\n       There is no question that the VA is grossly overburdened. A \n     product of its own success, the system, because of the \n     quality and accessibility of the health care services it \n     provides, has attracted unprecedented numbers of new veteran \n     users. While eligibility reform has been blamed for opening \n     the gates to the system, the real cause of this influx of \n     patients are the new health care markets VA has established \n     by opening 800 outpatient clinics across the country. Among \n     other factors are a private health insurance system that is \n     pricing itself out of reach of most Americans and a Medicare \n     plan that ignores the need for a quality prescription drug \n     benefit for seniors and people with disabilities.\n       VA is pulling in the reins, attempting to ration care and \n     dissuade veterans from coming into the system. These new \n     regulations are only one attempt. We are certain to see other \n     proposals in the months ahead. But if we go down the road of \n     pitting one group of veterans in the health care queue \n     against other groups of veterans where does it stop? These \n     regulations completely ignore the other key missions of the \n     VA health care system to care for the poor and medically \n     indigent and those veterans with special disabilities such as \n     spinal cord dysfunction, blindness and mental illness. With \n     these regulations in place a hospital administrator could \n     logically ignore these responsibilities as well in \n     contravention of direct statutory requirements.\n       Finally, we seriously question the VA's opinion that is has \n     sufficient authority under existing statutes to move forward \n     with these interim final rules. The VA's sophistical argument \n     ignores the plain language of the statute providing the VA \n     limited flexibility in managing the enrollment system \n     established by Congress in 1996.\n       All in all, we do not see why veterans should be denied an \n     accessible, quality health care product just because it is \n     unattainable or unaffordable elsewhere, and the \n     Administration and the Congress do not want to come up with \n     the dollars to fund it adequately.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Delatorro L. McNeil,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Finally, Mr. President, we have seen a rush by the \nAdministration to implement these new regulations, without the normal \ncomment period for Congress, veterans, or veterans advocates to make \ntheir views known. I believe VA's finding, that it has ``good cause'' \nto dispense with a normal notice-and-comment period, is without factual \nmerit. If an emergency situation exists, the Administration could have \nsurely provided the $270 million in additional funds which Congress \nalready appropriated to deal with the unacceptably long waiting times.\n  We must work together to find a better solution for veterans and \nthese regulations must be rescinded to protect access to care for all \nveterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8749-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RESCUE OF MINEWORKERS BY FMC\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr President, I know all of us in this Chamber shared in \nthe profound sense of relief and elation which accompanied the heroic \nrescue of nine mineworkers from the Quecreek Mine near Somerset \nPennsylvania earlier this summer. It was truly a remarkable story which \ncombined the very best of the human spirit with the most modern mine \nsafety and rescue technologies and produced nothing short of a miracle.\n  Somewhat lost in the press accounts after the rescue was the role \nplayed by the Mine Safety and Health Administration which sent 70 of \nits own employees to Somerset to assist in the rescue. One of MSHA's \nimportant missions is to prepare mineworkers and local health and \nsafety officials for responding to the sort of near disaster that we \nwitnessed last month. The rescue in Pennsylvania was no accident. It \nwas the result of thousands of man-hours dedicated to salvaging the \nbest from the worst. We all saw firsthand how it works.\n  I am very proud to be able today to recognize that a group of \nindividuals from my own state has won this year's National and \nInternational Mine Rescue Contest. The Mine rescue competitions are \ndesigned to test the knowledge of miners who might be called upon to \nrespond to a real mine emergency. The contest requires six-member teams \nto solve a hypothetical mine emergency problem--such as a fire, \nexplosion or cave in--while judges rate them on their adherence to mine \nrescue procedures and how quickly they complete specific tasks.\n  This year a team from Green River Wyoming, representing FMC \nCorporation, which operates a mine in my state, won this prestigious \ncompetition. I would like to recognize the individuals who are part of \nthis number 1 team: Bob Knott, Alan Jones, Rick Owens, Leroy \nHutchinson, Glen Weinmaster, Dave Thomas, Melvin Lovato, Robert Pope, \nBill Oleson, Bob Robison, Tony Herrera, John Key, Rod Knight, Mike \nPadilla and David Hutchinson.\n  We pray that this outstanding team will never have to put into \npractice what it has trained to do over countless hours. However, it is \nalso encouraging to know that such teams are deployed throughout mining \ncountry and stand ready to perform the sorts of heroic feats that we \nall witnessed a few weeks ago in Pennsylvania and coal country.\n  All of us in Wyoming are very proud of the accomplishments of the FMC \nMine Rescue Team and salute all of those involved in the mining \nindustry for their dedication to safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8749-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8749-S8750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO BRADY HOWELL\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the terrorism of September 11 \nchanged America forever, and it profoundly changed Americans, as well. \nThe people we lost left behind legacies, the compilation of the \nmeaningful things they accomplished throughout their lives, actions and \nwords that still touch their friends and families after their deaths. \nThose legacies inspire all of us with the bravery and courage of the \nhuman spirit, and also remind us of the precious frailty of life.\n  Brady Howell lost his life in the attack on the Pentagon. This \nletter, written by Brady's brother Carson Howell to commemorate the one \nyear anniversary of that terrible event, articulates the legacy Brady \nleft behind. I would like to enter this letter into the Congressional \nRecord so all my colleagues can remember the great example these \nAmericans are to us. In the words of Carson Howell, ``The men and women \nwho perished that day are not heroes because of how they died; they are \nheroes because of how they lived.''\n  Let me read the letter in its entirety:\n\n       Today is a sad day for our family. Not just our family, but \n     also families just like the Vauk family, the Conaty family, \n     the Andrews family, and thousands of others. It's a sad day \n     for our American family as we all remember and pay tribute to \n     the thousands of friends, family, and fellow Americans that \n     lost their lives one year ago today. It's a day that many \n     will remember as the day we learned that heroes aren't found \n     only in comic books. No, there are heroes greater than \n     Superman and my brother is one of them.\n       Brady Kay Howell loved this country. He was an Eagle Scout. \n     He loved children and taught the youth in Sunday School \n     classes while living in New York and later Virginia. He loved \n     his family and actually had plans to return to Idaho that \n     following weekend for a welcome home party for my parents and \n     for my wedding reception. He loved his wife, Liz, to whom \n     he'd been married for only five short years.\n       Brady was working in naval intelligence as an intern. \n     Shortly before his death, he and I had a telephone \n     conversation. In it he told me that one of his goals in his \n     life was to have top-secret clearance. I'm proud to say that \n     he accomplished that goal.\n       I could go on and on about how great my brother was. But, \n     if it were he speaking here today, he wouldn't use this \n     opportunity to speak of his accomplishments. I believe that \n     he would talk about service. He would talk about what a great \n     country this is that we live in and how proud he was to serve \n     and protect all of us.\n       The work that Brady and many others did that died that day \n     was for all of us. Brady prepared briefings for the Chief of \n     Naval Intelligence and other high-ranking officials so\n\n[[Page S8750]]\n\n     that they could best be informed of how to protect us the \n     American public. Everyday he was protecting our country. \n     Everyday he was fighting for our freedoms that we enjoy. To \n     Brady, it didn't matter how much money you had, it didn't \n     matter what the color of your skin was, it didn't matter \n     which religion you believed. To Brady, what mattered were the \n     people.\n       Ongoing community service initiatives to commemorate \n     Brady's commitment to public service are being conducted in \n     the Washington, DC area and there are plans for at least one \n     such initiative in Utah. Generous contributions from all over \n     the country have allowed us to create an endowed memory in \n     Brady's name to continue the influence of his story. These \n     contributions will also support an endowed lecture series in \n     Brady's name that has been established and now approved by \n     the BYU-Idaho Board of Trustees.\n       I miss Brady very much. I remember with fondness building \n     bases and battling with our G.I. Joe action figures, waking \n     up early Saturday morning to watch the Bugs Bunny and Tweety \n     Show together, and climbing trees together. I always looked \n     up to Brady and for me, he was always a hero. As his story is \n     told, others are hearing about the hero whom I was privileged \n     enough to call ``brother''.\n       September 11th wasn't the first day that this country has \n     known heroes, nor has it been the last. We should take this \n     time to pay tribute not only to the heroes of September 11th, \n     but all of the heroes that have fought for freedom. Thousands \n     of men and women are working today to protect us from evil. \n     The men and women who perished that day are not heroes \n     because of how they died; they are heroes because of how they \n     lived. Heroes are the men and women who have put themselves \n     in harms way for the cause of democracy and freedom since \n     long before September 11, 2001. Heroes are the men and women \n     who serve each day to protect people they will never know. \n     Heroes are the men and women who spend more waking hours \n     caring for and about others than they do for themselves. Let \n     us remember the heroes of September 11th 2001, along with the \n     heroes who stood before, who stand now, and who are preparing \n     to stand against evil. Because it is to all of you who have \n     served this country, have given your children for the service \n     of America, and are currently serving that we, the American \n     people, pay tribute this day; the fire fighters, the police \n     officers, the emergency medical crews, and the soldiers of \n     freedom.\n       If the mark of a hero is one that cares about and fights \n     for others, I hope that the destruction of September 11th has \n     facilitated the construction of tomorrow's heroes. Wouldn't \n     the greatest honor that we could pay to those that perished \n     be if we could follow their example and give of ourselves as \n     they did? We may not be called upon to die for this country, \n     but we are all called upon to live for it. This country \n     doesn't need more martyrs, but this country could use more \n     doers.\n       Tens of thousands have given their time and tens of \n     thousands have given their lives for America; this ``one \n     nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for \n     all.'' To be ``one nation'', we need to be one state, one \n     neighborhood, one home. Let us rededicate ourselves as we did \n     after September 11th, to being Americans. Never in my life \n     before September 11th, had I seen such a display and attitude \n     of patriotism. We were friendlier, we were more patient, and \n     we looked out for each other. I wish that those who died that \n     day could have seen the America that we became. We became \n     strong and united. We showed forth the America that we always \n     should have been; the America that those men and women \n     sacrificed their lives for. Let us honor all of the heroes of \n     America by not letting their sacrifices be in vain. Let us \n     continue their legacies. Let us live for what they died for \n     The United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8750-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNITION OF THE ENTERPRISE FOUNDATION'S 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize The \nEnterprise Foundation as it celebrates its 20th year of rebuilding \nAmerica's communities and creating opportunities for low-income people \nacross America.\n  The Enterprise Foundation was founded in 1982 by renowned developer \nJames Rouse and his wife, Patty, who were inspired by the commitment of \nmembers of the Church of the Saviour in Washington, D.C. to create safe \nhousing in one of the most challenged neighborhoods in the District.\n  More than 65,000 hours of volunteer time and $500,000 in grants were \ninvested to clean out rats and garbage and to repair, paint and correct \nmore than 940 housing code violations to create those first 90 \napartments affordable to low-income families.\n  Since that humble start, Enterprise has grown to become a national \nnonprofit with offices in 16 cities, five subsidiaries and a staff of \nmore than 450. Enterprise works with private sector and public partners \nthrough a network of more than 2,200 community-based organizations in \n820 U.S. locations to provide affordable housing, safer streets and \naccess to jobs and quality child care.\n  Since 1982, The Enterprise Foundation has raised and committed more \nthan $3.9 billion in equity, loans and grants to build or renovate more \nthan 132,000 homes affordable to low- and very low-income people. Since \nits creation in 1985, Enterprise Homes has completed more than 4,000 \nhomes for low- and moderate-income families totaling more than $350 \nmillion in total development. Enterprise has partnered with more than \n170 corporate investors and more than 580 nonprofit and for-profit \ndevelopers to provide affordable homes for families, the elderly and \npeople with special needs.\n  Enterprise's job training and placement programs have helped more \nthan 32,000 low-income residents qualify for work and retain \nemployment. More than 4,500 children have benefited from the Home-Based \nChild Care Program. Enterprise Child Care has awarded more than $4.5 \nmillion in grants and loans since 1999.\n  My own State of Maryland has benefited greatly from the work of the \nEnterprise Foundation. I have personally seen the results of the \nEnterprise Foundation's work in the Druid Heights, Lauraville and \nGarrison/Forest Park neighborhoods in Baltimore. Their comprehensive \napproach to neighborhood redevelopment is what makes Enterprise an \nasset in Maryland, and in the Nation.\n  Today I ask that we pay tribute to Mr. Rouse's legacy and to the \nprofound impact that The Enterprise Foundation has had on the lives of \nthousands of low-income Americans and their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8750-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8750-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/18/senate-section/article/S8750-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8750-S8751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one if its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 1834.

I rise \ntoday, with my colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, to introduce \nlegislation that recognizes the importance of these events by adding \nthe Falls of the Ohio, in Clarksville, IN and Louisville, KY, to the \nsites honored and preserved by inclusion on the Lewis and Clark \nNational Historic Trail.\n  Many historians have detailed the fact that it was the Falls of the \nOhio, in Clarksville, IN, that Meriwether Lewis and William Clark met \nand formed their famous partnership. It was there that they spent 12 \ndays recruiting and enlisting members for their Western expedition in \nLouisville and southern Indiana for the Corps of Discovery. Ultimately \nthey selected nine men from the area. After establishing their crew, \nLewis and Clark set out for the West on the Ohio River from Clarksville \non October 26, 1803.\n  One of the many accounts of the formation of the Corps of Discovery \nis included in historian Stephen E. Ambrose's work on the expedition, \nUndaunted Courage. Mr. Ambrose writes that: ``At the foot of the \nrapids, on the north bank, was Clarksville, Indiana Territory. . . . On \nOctober 15, Lewis hired local pilots, who took the boat and pirogues \ninto the dangerous but passable passage on the north bank. Safely \nthrough, Lewis tied up at Clarksville and set off to meet his \npartner.''\n  ``When they shook hands, the Lewis and Clark expedition began.''\n  And Ambrose continues: ``Word has spread up and down the Ohio, and \ninland, and young men longing for adventure and ambitious for a piece \nof land of their own set out for Clarksville to sign up . . . Those \nselected were sworn into the army in solemn ceremony, in the presence \nof General Clark, and the Corps of Discovery was born.''\n  The National Park Service agreed with Mr. Ambrose and other \nhistorical sources that the events at the Falls of the Ohio are of \nimportant historical significance. The National Park Service certified \nthe Falls of the Ohio State Park as an official site associated with \nthe Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail.\n  My legislation would simply reiterate the Park Service's conclusion \nthat the events at the Falls of the Ohio are a significant part of the \nhistory of the Lewis and Clark expedition and would include the Falls \nof the Ohio among the areas designated for recognition on the Lewis and \nClark National Historic Trail.\n\n[[Page S8756]]\n\n  The National Council of the Lewis and Clark Bicentennial designated \nthe Falls of the Ohio as the second signature event of the \nbicentennial, which will be held in October 2003.\n  The Falls of the Ohio is an integral part of the Lewis and Clark \nstory, which will be uniquely celebrated next year. It is my hope that \nwe can move quickly to pass this legislation to insure that the \nrecognition occurs in time for the much anticipated 200th anniversary \nof the trail. That way the citizens of Clarksville and Louisville can \nhonor and preserve their local heritage and all students of history can \nfully follow in the footsteps of Lewis and Clark and experience the \nbirth of the Corps of Discovery at the Falls of the Ohio.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2953. A bill to redesignate the Colonnade Center in Denver, \nColorado, as the ``Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building''; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nname the Federal building located at 1244 Speer Boulevard, Denver, CO., \nas the ``Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building.''\n  Cesar E. Chavez was an ordinary American who left behind an \nextraordinary legacy of commitment and accomplishment.\n  Born on March 31, 1927 in Yuma Arizona on a farm his grandfather \nhomesteaded in the 1880's, he began his life as a migrant farm worker \nat the age of 10 when the family lost the farm during the Great \nDepression. Those were desperate years for the Chavez family as they \njoined the thousands of displaced people who were forced to migrate \nthroughout the country to labor in the fields and vineyards.\n  Motivated by the poverty and harsh working conditions, he began to \nfollow his dream of establishing an organization dedicated to helping \nthese farm workers. In 1962 he founded the National Farm Workers \nAssociation which would eventually evolve into the United Farm Workers \nof America.\n  Over the next three decades with an unwavering commitment to \ndemocratic principals and a philosophy of non-violence he struggled to \nsecure a living wage, health benefits and safe working conditions for \narguably the most exploited work force in our country, that they might \nenjoy the basic protections and workers right to which all Americans \naspire.\n  In 1945, at the age of 18 Cesar Chavez joined the U.S. Navy and \nserved his country for two years. He was the recipient of the Martin \nLuther King Jr. Peace Prize as well as the Presidential medal of \nFreedom, the highest award this country can bestow upon a civilian.\n  Chavez's efforts brought dignity and respect to this country's farm \nworkers and in doing so became a hero, role model and inspiration to \npeople engaged in human rights struggles throughout the world.\n  The naming of this building will keep alive the memory of his \nsacrifice and commitment for the millions of people whose lives he \ntouched.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2953\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF CESAR E. CHAVEZ MEMORIAL BUILDING.\n\n       The building known as the Colonnade Center, located at 1244 \n     Speer Boulevard, Denver, Colorado, shall be known and \n     designated as the ``Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the building referred \n     to in section 1 shall be deemed to be a reference to the \n     Cesar E. Chavez Memorial Building.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Leahy, and Mr. Dayton):\n  S. 2954. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to permit States and local educational agencies to decide the \nfrequency of using high quality assessments to measure and increase \nstudent academic achievement, to permit States and local educational \nagencies to obtain a waiver of certain testing requirements, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as millions of public school students \nand teachers around the country settle into the new school year, I am \nintroducing a bill that would help to return a measure of local control \nthat was taken from school districts and State educational agencies \nwith the enactment of the No Child Left Behind Act earlier this year.\n  I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators Jeffords, \nWellstone, Leahy, and Dayton.\n  I strongly support maintaining local control over decisions affecting \nour children's day-to-day classroom experiences. I also believe that \nthe Federal Government has an important role to play in supporting our \nState educational agencies and local school districts as they carry out \none of their most important responsibilities, the education of our \nchildren.\n  I voted against the recently-enacted No Child Left Behind Act in \nlarge part because of the new annual testing mandate for students in \ngrades 3-8. While I agree that there should be a strong accountability \nsystem in place to ensure that public school students are making \nprogress, I strongly oppose over-testing students in our public \nschools. I agree that some tests are needed to ensure that our children \nare keeping pace, but taking time to test students has to take a back \nseat to taking the time to teach students in the first place.\n  I have heard a lot about these new annual tests from the people of \nWisconsin, and their response has been almost universally negative. My \nconstituents are concerned about this additional layer of testing for \nmany reasons, including the cost of developing and implementing these \ntests, the loss of teaching time every year to prepare for and take the \ntests, and the extra pressure that the tests will place on students, \nteachers, schools, and school districts.\n  I share my constituents' concerns about this new Federal mandate. I \nfind it interesting that proponents of the No Child Left Behind Act say \nthat it will return more control to the States and local school \ndistricts. In my view, however, this massive new Federal testing \nmandate runs counter to the idea of local control.\n  Many States and local school districts around the country, including \nWisconsin, already have comprehensive testing programs in place. The \nFederal Government should leave decisions about the frequency of using \nhigh quality assessments to measure and increase student academic \nachievement up to the States and local school districts that bear the \nresponsibility for educating our children. Every State and every school \ndistrict is different. A uniform testing policy may not be the best \napproach.\n  I have heard from many education professionals in my state that this \nnew testing requirement is a waste of money and a waste of time. These \npeople are dedicated professionals who are committed to educating \nWisconsin's children, and they don't oppose testing. I think we can all \nagree that testing has its place. What they oppose is the magnitude of \ntesting that is required by this law.\n  Beginning in the 2005-2006 school year, the No Child Left Behind Act \nwill pile more tests on our Nation's public school students. And of \ncourse, when those tests are piled on students, they burden our \nteachers as well, because teachers must spend more and more time \npreparing students to take these exams.\n  This kind of teaching, sometimes called ``teaching to the test,'' is \nbecoming more and more prevalent in our schools as testing has become \nincreasingly common. The dedicated teachers in our classrooms will now \nbe constrained by teaching to yet more tests, instead of being able to \nuse their own judgment about what subject areas the class needs to \nspend extra time studying. This additional testing time could also \nreduce the opportunity for teachers to create and implement innovative \nlearning experiences for their students.\n  Teachers in my State are concerned about the amount of time that they \nwill have to spend preparing their students to take the tests and \nadministering the tests. They are concerned that these additional tests \nwill disrupt\n\n[[Page S8757]]\n\nthe flow of education in their classrooms. One teacher said the \npreparation for the tests Wisconsin already requires in grades 3, 4, 8, \nand 10 can take up to a month, and the administration of the test takes \nanother week. That is five weeks out of the school year. And now the \nFederal Government is requiring teachers to take a huge chunk out of \ninstruction time each year in grades 3-8. In my view, and in the view \nof the people of my State, this time can be better spent on regular \nclassroom instruction.\n  The legislation that I introduce today, the Student Testing \nFlexibility Act of 2002, would give State educational agencies, SEAs, \nand local educational agencies, LEAs, that have demonstrated academic \nsuccess the flexibility to apply to waive the new annual testing \nrequirements in the No Child Left Behind Act. SEAs and LEAs with \nwaivers would still be required to administer high quality tests to \nstudents in, at a minimum, reading or language arts and mathematics at \nleast once in grades 3-5, 6-9, and 10-12 as required under the law.\n  This bill would allow SEAs and LEAs that meet the same specific \naccountability criteria outlined for school-level excellence under the \nState Academic Achievement Award Program to apply to the Secretary of \nEducation for a waiver from the new annual reading or language arts and \nmathematics tests for students in grades 3-8. The waiver would be for a \nperiod of three years and would be renewable, so long as the SEA or LEA \nmet the criteria.\n  To qualify for the waiver, the SEA or LEA must have significantly \nclosed the achievement gap between a number of subgroups of students as \nrequired under Title I, or must have exceeded their adequate yearly \nprogress, AYP, goals for two or more consecutive years. The bill would \nrequire the Secretary to grant waivers to SEAs or LEAs that meet these \ncriteria and apply for the waiver. LEAs in states that have waivers \nwould not be required to apply for a separate waiver.\n  The Federal Government should not impose an additional layer of \ntesting on states that are succeeding in meeting or exceeding their AYP \ngoals or on closing the achievement gap. Instead, we should allow those \nStates that have demonstrated academic success to use their share of \nFederal testing money to help those schools that need it the most.\n  The bill I introduce today would do just that by allowing States with \nwaivers to retain their share of the Federal funding appropriated to \ndevelop and implement the new annual tests. These important dollars \nwould be used for activities that these states deem appropriate for \nimproving student achievement at individual public elementary and \nsecondary schools that have failed to make AYP.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by the National PTA, \nthe National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National \nAssociation of Secondary School Principals, the Wisconsin Department of \nPublic Instruction, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the \nWisconsin Association of School Boards, the Milwaukee Teachers' \nEducation Association, and the Wisconsin School Administrators \nAlliance, which includes the Association of Wisconsin School \nAdministrators, the Wisconsin Association of School District \nAdministrators, the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials, \nand the Wisconsin Council for Administrators of Special Services.\n  While this bill focuses on the over-testing of students in our public \nschools, I would like to note that my constituents have raised a number \nof other concerns about the No Child Left Behind Act that I hope will \nbe addressed by Congress. In particular, many of my constituents are \nconcerned about the new adequate yearly progress requirements and about \nfinding the funding necessary to implement all of the provisions of \nthis new law. I hope that my bill, the Student Testing Flexibility Act, \nwill help to focus attention on the perhaps unintended consequences \nthat the ongoing implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act will \nhave for States, school districts, and individual schools, teachers, \nand students.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2954\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Student Testing Flexibility \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) State and local governments bear the majority of the \n     cost and responsibility of educating public elementary school \n     and secondary school students;\n       (2) State and local governments often struggle to find \n     adequate funding to provide basic educational services;\n       (3) the Federal Government has not provided its share of \n     funding for numerous federally mandated elementary and \n     secondary education programs;\n       (4) underfunded Federal education mandates increase \n     existing financial pressures on States and local educational \n     agencies;\n       (5) the cost to States and local educational agencies to \n     implement the annual student academic assessments required \n     under section 1111(b)(3)(C)(vii) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     6311(b)(3)(C)(vii)) remains uncertain;\n       (6) public elementary school and secondary school students \n     take numerous tests each year, from classroom quizzes and \n     exams to standardized and other tests required by the Federal \n     Government, State educational agencies, or local educational \n     agencies;\n       (7) multiple measures of student academic achievement \n     provide a more accurate picture of a student's strengths and \n     weaknesses than does a single score on a high-stakes test; \n     and\n       (8) the frequency of the use of high quality assessments as \n     a tool to measure and increase student achievement should be \n     decided by State educational agencies and local educational \n     agencies.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to improve data collection and dissemination, \ntreatment, and research relating to cancer, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join with the \nranking member of the Senate HELP Committee in introducing and the \nNational Cancer Act of 2002. We believe that this is the proverbial \nfirst step of the thousand mile journey toward the\n\n[[Page S8758]]\n\ngoal of making cancer death rare by the year 2015.\n  First, I would be remiss if I failed to point out that we are not the \nfirst in the Senate to drop a cancer bill. Indeed, fired the first \nsalvo in our Nation's conflict with cancer with the passage of the \nNational Cancer Institute Act back in 1937. This law, established the \nNational Cancer Institute, (NCI), within the public health service and \ndirected the Surgeon General to promote cancer research.\n  In 1971, responding to the call of President Nixon, Congress \nofficially declared war on cancer with the passage of the National \nCancer Act of 1971. This law established the Director of the National \nCancer Institute as one of two Presidentially appointment posts within \nall of the National Institutes of Health. In addition, the '71 Act gave \nthe Director the ability to bypass the normal budget process and submit \nthe NCI budget directly to the President, a privilege that is entirely \nunique throughout the Executive Branch. With our declaration of war our \nNation saw the establishment of the President's Cancer Panel, the \nNational Cancer Advisory Board, the International Cancer Research Data \nBank and the first cancer center. The stated goal of the country that \nhad just landed a man on the moon was to cure cancer within a decade.\n  Since 1971, we have seen 31 years pass, six Presidents sworn in, 15 \nsessions of Congress, and ten different bills signed into law with the \ngoal of ending the prolonged war on cancer. This year over half a \nmillion Americans will die from cancer. It is for them, and for the 1.2 \nmillion Americans who will be diagnosed with cancer, and for the \nmillions of cancer survivors who are living beyond this disease that we \nintroduce this bill today.\n  Ours is the time is history when we must reinvigorate the battle. \nThanks to advances in treatment and increased screening and early \ndetection, between 1990 and 1997, for the first time in history, the \nnumber of cancer deaths and diagnoses have declined. However, to whom \nmuch is given, much is expected. The National Cancer Act of 2002, \nanswers the call and lays out a battle plan for the next, and hopefully \nfinal attack in the war on cancer.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am very pleased this morning to introduce \nthis bill with my good friend Senator Brownback. Our bill, the National \nCancer Act of 2002, is an important step forward in making survivorship \nof cancer the rule in this Nation and cancer mortality the rare \nexception. I want to thank our good friends in the cancer and pain care \ncommunities who have provided critical feedback during the development \nof the Act. Our bill will: Enhance coordination between State \nregistries and between those registries and Federal cancer control and \nresearch efforts, with a focus on developing interoperability and \ncompatible hardware/software infrastructure. Reauthorize the successful \nCDC Breast and Cervical Cancer screening program, with expansion \nencouraged for colorectal cancer screening. Improve NIH efforts in the \narea of pain and palliative care research and dissemination of \ninformation to patients and providers. Expand access for patients to \nexperimental therapies, both in NIH-funded clinical trials, privately-\nfunded manufacturer trials and access for terminal patients to \ntherapies that have not yet been approved by FBA. Encourage Congress \nand the Administration to address several of the most significant \ncancer-related problems in the Medicare system.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the HELP Committee to \nmove this important piece of legislation this year. I know that we all \nshare the agenda of combating this public health problem facing so many \nAmericans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2956. A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nsubmit a semi-annual report to Congress regarding the effectiveness \nwith which information is exchanged between the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and State and local law \nenforcement authorities; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, first let me commend the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Governmental Affairs Committee for all of their \nefforts in crafting the Homeland Security measure before the Senate \ntoday.\n  As I have listened to the various proposals to create a Department of \nHomeland Security one of my primary concerns is what are we going to do \nto improve the role of the FBI as an intelligence gathering agency. I \nrise today to introduce legislation on this matter, and I send a copy \nof this legislation to the desk.\n  I also rise to offer the same legislation as an amendment to the \nHomeland Security bill, and I send a copy of the amendment to the desk.\n  The need for this amendment is clear. We have heard, over and over \nagain, that one of the chief purposes of the new Department is to \nenable one agency to serve as a central clearinghouse for all terrorism \nrelated information, regardless of the source. For the consumers of \nintelligence information, like the Department of Homeland Security, it \nshould not matter whether the information comes from a CIA agent in the \nMiddle East, an FBI agent listening to a wire-tap from overseas or a \ncop on a street corner in New York City.\n  I am concerned that we have not done enough to insure that the \nrelevant information gathered by the FBI is passed on to those who can \nanalyze it and evaluate a potential threat against our Nation's safety. \nSimply put, I wonder about what type of information the FBI will be \nproviding to the new Department and what the new Department will do \nwith the information. I am concerned about the lack of policies and \nprocedures in place for the new Department to request follow-up \ninvestigation from the FBI and local law enforcement.\n  I have offered this amendment, entitled the Intelligence Analysis \nReporting Act of 2002, to assist Congress in determining if the \ndivision of investigative responsibilities between the Department of \nHomeland Security and the FBI is working effectively. This amendment \nwill provide Congress with the information necessary to determine if \nthe FBI is taking competent steps to provide information to the new \nDepartment and to respond to intelligence requests in a useful manner.\n  Presently, the FBI does not have the technological nor personnel \ncapacity to provide information to the Department of Homeland Security \nor to any other intelligence agency in a highly useful form. This is \nbecause criminal investigations, which involve grand jury testimony, \nwitness interviews and wire-taps, are not conducive to the standards of \nintelligence gathering which require some sifting of the material \nbefore it is disseminated to consumers like a Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  This amendment would require the new Department to report to Congress \non policies and procedures implemented to insure that it can adequately \nrequest information and investigation from the FBI and local law \nenforcement. In addition, it requires the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to report on what types of intelligence information have been \nturned over such as summary interviews, transcripts and warrants from \nthe FBI and other law enforcement agencies.\n  I firmly believe that no matter how many agencies are moved into a \nDepartment of Homeland Security or how much money we spend on putting \nup a new building, the only test of our success will be how effective \nwe are in protecting ourselves against future threats. This amendment \nwill allow us to determine if the critical intelligence information we \nneed to prevent a possible attack is being provided to people at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security who can act on it promptly and \neffectively.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON:\n  S. 2963: A bill to reform the United States Army Corps of Engineers; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2963\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S8759]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I would like to express my strong \nsupport for the National Acquatic Invasive Species Act of 2002 (NAISA)\n  Last year, I introduced S. 1034, the Great Lakes Ecology Protection \nAct which sought to curb the influx of invasive species into the Great \nLakes. This is an immense task, as more than 87 nonindigenous aquatic \nspecies have been accidentally introduced into the Great Lakes in the \npast century. I am proud to say that this bill had strong bipartisan \nsupport with 12 Great Lakes Senators as original cosponsors.\n  Today, I am proud to join Senator Levin as an original cosponsor of \nNAISA which will provide a national strategy for preventing invasive \nspecies from being introduced in the Great Lakes and our Nation's \nwaters. I am also pleased that NAISA incorporates many of the ideas \nfrom the Great Lakes Ecology Protection Act in formulating a national \nstandard.\n  Invasive species have had a devastating economic and ecological \nimpact on the U.S. They have already damaged the Great Lakes in a \nnumber of ways. They have destroyed thousands of fish and threatened \nour clean drinking water.\n  For example, Lake Michigan once housed the largest self-reproducing \nlake trout fishery in the entire world. The invasive sea lamprey, which \nwas introduced from ballast water almost 80 years ago, has contributed \ngreatly to the decline of trout and whitefish in the Great Lakes by \nfeeding on and killing native trout species.\n  Today, lake trout must be stocked because they cannot naturally \nreproduce in the lake. Many Great Lakes States have had to place severe \nrestrictions on catching yellow perch because invasive species such as \nthe zebra mussel disrupt the Great Lakes' ecosystem and compete with \nyellow perch for food. The zebra mussel's filtration also increase \nwater clarity, which may be making it easier for predators to prey upon \nthe yellow perch. Moreover, tiny organisms like zooplankton that help \nfrom the base of the Great Lakes food chain, have declined due to \nconsumption by exploding populations of zebra mussels.\n  We have made progress on preventing the spread of invasive species, \nbut we have not yet solved this problem. NAISA will create a mandatory \nnational ballast water management program to prevent the introduction \nof invasive species into our waters, as well as, encourage the \ndevelopment of new ballast treatment technology to eliminate invasive \nspecies. NAISA also will greatly increase research funding for these \ntreatment and prevention technologies, and provide necessary funding \nand resources for invasive species rapid response plans. In addition, \nthe bill will increase outreach and education to recreational boaters \nand the general public on how to prevent the spread of invasive \nspecies.\n\n[[Page S8761]]\n\n  As Members of the U.S. Congress, we have a responsibility to share in \nthe stewardship of our Nation's natural resources. As a Great Lakes \nSenator, I feel a particularly strong responsibility to protect a \nresource that is not only a source of clean drinking water for more \nthan 30 million people in the Great Lakes, but is vital to Michigan's \neconomy and environment. I am proud to support a bill that will provide \ninnovative solutions and necessary resources to this long-standing \nenvironmental problem, and will also protect water resources for the \nenjoyment and benefit of future generations of Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Frist, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Collins, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bond, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mr. Reid, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Hollings, and Mr. Edwards):\n  S. 2965. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nquality of care for cancer, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Frist, Harkin, Hutchison, Biden, Landrieu, Reid, \nBingaman, Dodd, Clinton, Hollings, and Edwards in introducing the \n``Quality of Care for Individuals with Cancer Act.''\n  The goal of this important bipartisan legislation is to help close \nthe gap between what modern medicine can do today to reduce cancer \ndeaths, and the actual medical care that cancer patients receive.\n  In the past two decades, the nation has made extraordinary progress \nin treating and curing cancer. In fact, we have made so much progress \nthat our greatest challenges in health care today is taking the \nscientific breakthroughs in the laboratory and bringing them to the \nbedside of the patient.\n  Too often, we cannot say that American cancer patients are receiving \nthe best possible care. Our goal is to match the nation's excellence in \ncancer research with state-of-the-art excellence in cancer care.\n  The reward will be seeing a young mother with breast cancer live to \nbe a grandmother, enable a toddler with leukemia grow up to be \nPresident, or a father win the Tour de France for a fourth time.\n  Many examples of inadequate care could be cited. For example, only a \nthird of all Americans over age fifty have had proper colorectal cancer \nscreenings in the last two years. Clearly, there are far too many \nneedless and correctable failures in our current system of cancer care.\n  By creating uniform ways to measure the quality of cancer care, and \nestablishing new, improved and better coordinated ways to monitor care, \nwe can do more to see that cancer patients receive state-of-the-art \ncare, no matter where they live.\n  In response to the needs of cancer survivors, and with the help of \nthe Lance Armstrong Foundation, this bipartisan bill will also \nestablish new survivorship programs to facilitate the delivery of \nservices to cancer patients and their families.\n  Just as importantly, we want to make the best cancer care easier for \npatients to obtain. Our bill will improve the networking of the doctors \nand other providers to whom patients go for their care.\n  Many of us know family members and friends suffering from cancer. We \nare all to familiar with the feelings of shock, denial, hope, fear, and \nvulnerability that comes when a loved one, especially a child, is found \nto have cancer.\n  Dealing with the challenges is never an easy task for any family. But \nthe continuing breakthoughs in medical research make clear that much \nmore can be done to save and enhance the lives of cancer patients. We \nneed to do all we can to make this care available and affordable to all \npatients.\n  Make no mistake about it, we have come a long way. But much more must \nbe done to improve the lives of cancer patients.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, \nHutchison, and others in introducing the ``Quality of Care for \nIndividuals with Cancer Act''. This bill represents our next step in \nthe battle against cancer. It is critical to increasing access to \ntimely, quality health care.\n  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Americans, claiming \none life each minute. Most of us know someone who has cancer, or who \nhas died from cancer. One out of every 4 Americans will die from this \nterrible disease. We have done a tremendous job investing in cancer \nresearch in this country. We must now make sure the knowledge gained \nfrom those investments is being applied, and that research advancements \nare translated into improved patient care.\n  If you have cancer, the quality of care you receive should not be \naffected by where you live, where you get your care, or whether you \nhave health insurance coverage. You should have access to quality care \nwhether you have just been diagnosed with cancer, are a cancer \nsurvivor, or are dying from this disease. The care given should take \nthe patient's values and concerns into account and should be provided \nin a culturally competent manner.\n  Based on a recent Institute of Medicine's report, ``Ensuring Quality \nCancer Care'', this bill would coordinate the development and \ncollection of information on quality cancer care using quality measures \nthat examine care from diagnosis through the end-of-life. Clearly, a \nbetter system is needed to rapidly identify the results of ongoing \nresearch with quality implications and ensure that this is transferred \ninto daily medical practice.\n  Individuals with cancer receive care from a number of specialists \nduring the course of their cancer, and the responsibility for \nnavigating through the system often rests on the individual. \nComprehensible and ongoing communication among providers, patients and \ncaregivers is essential to coordinated care. There are two \ndemonstration projects authorized by this legislation to help improve \nthe coordination of care. One demonstration project provides individual \ncase managers to better coordinate care within the health care system \nor to help get patients into the system. The second attempts to improve \ncoordination between providers and hospitals so that individuals with \ncancer receive seamless care throughout their course of treatment.\n  While receiving care, some individuals with cancer do not receive \ncare known to be effective for their condition, such as the delivery of \npalliative care. Much of the suffering from symptoms associated with \ncancer and its treatment could be alleviated if currently available \nsymptom control measures and other aspects of palliative care were more \nwidely used. This bill authorizes demonstration projects which will \nprovide palliative care at any stage of cancer care and train health \ncare providers in symptom management. The legislation also seeks to \nhelp provide better pain and other symptom relief so that individuals \nwith cancer do not suffer the consequences of their disease or \ntreatment.\n  For the nine million Americans living with cancer, this bill provide \nhope in improving the quality of life for individuals with cancer by \ntranslating what is already known to be effective care to all \nindividuals with cancer. For those areas in which we need to \ninvestigate, demonstration projects will further our knowledge.\n  I am pleased to introduce this important legislation, and I look \nforward to its ultimate enactment into law. I want to thank my \ncolleagues, Senators Kennedy, Hutchison, and others, for their work on \nthis bill. I ask that the summary, section-by-section, and list of \nsupporting organizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n     Quality of Care for Individuals With Cancer Act--Kennedy-Frist\n\n       Cancer is a dreaded disease and the second leading cause of \n     death. Over the preceding decades much progress has been made \n     on how to detect, treat and cure individuals who have cancer \n     and those who are affected. But too often, the typical \n     standards of care fall short of the best standards of care.\n       Unfortunately, many cancer patients are getting \n     inappropriate care--too little care, too much care in the \n     form of unnecessary procedures, or the wrong care. Simple \n     screening procedures are underutilized and radical \n     interventions are often needlessly performed. Receiving \n     quality care should not be determined by where a patient \n     lives, where they get their care, or whether or not they have \n     health insurance. Unfortunately\n\n[[Page S8762]]\n\n     this is not the case, and variations in quality of care can \n     have dire outcomes. A recent study found that women on \n     Medicaid are likely to be diagnosed with cancer at a later \n     stage and are three times more likely to die of breast cancer \n     than women not on Medicaid.\n       The problem: Even with tremendous advancements in treatment \n     and diagnosis, individuals with cancer are still not \n     receiving quality care. Due to lack of data, the magnitude of \n     the problem of inadequate care is not known. Comprehensive \n     data systems do not currently exist with which to measure \n     quality and there is no national cancer care program or \n     system of care within the United States.\n       Our solution: Collect better information to discover where \n     problems exist and create statewide plans to address the \n     problems. The bill will draw together Federal agencies and \n     private entities to coordinate the development and collection \n     of information on quality of care. States will receive funds \n     to expand state cancer registries to collect information on \n     quality of care and develop and improve state-wide cancer \n     control programs that address particular needs for each \n     state.\n       The Problem: Individuals with cancer often have \n     difficulties negotiating through a complex system of care. \n     Like other chronic illnesses, efforts to diagnose and treat \n     cancer are centered on a variety of individual physicians and \n     can be in multiple settings. Coordination between these \n     entities is often lacking, and the responsibility for \n     navigating through the system often rests on the individual \n     with cancer. Improving coordination can save lives. Research \n     has shown that cooperation among pediatric oncologists has \n     resulted in cure rate increases of 30 percent even in the \n     absence of new therapeutics to treat disease.\n       Our Solution: Provide case-managers to guide patients \n     during treatment and improve the coordination of care. Two \n     programs will be developed to help individuals with cancer \n     receive coordinated cancer care. The first provides \n     individual case-managers to help get patients into the system \n     or to act as contacts throughout their care and assist with \n     information, referrals, and care coordination within the \n     system. The second improves coordination between doctors, \n     hospitals, and other health care professionals so that \n     individuals with cancer receive seamless care throughout \n     their treatment.\n       The Problem: While research has produced new insights into \n     the causes and cures of cancer, efforts to manage the \n     symptoms of the disease and its treatments have not kept \n     pace. Palliative care, which includes pain and symptom \n     management and psychosocial care, is an area where \n     individuals with cancer have traditionally received \n     relatively poor quality care. For example, less than half of \n     individuals with cancer who suffer from pain receive adequate \n     relief of their pain, and only a very small percentage of \n     cancer patients are offered referrals for palliative care.\n       Our Solution: Improve palliative care. The bill will \n     develop programs to provide palliative care and train \n     professionals to provide better palliative care for both \n     adults and children with cancer.\n       The Problem: Cancer survivors continue to need quality care \n     while living with, through, and beyond cancer. Although 1,500 \n     people die each day from cancer, increasingly, individuals \n     with cancer survive their disease. The more than nine million \n     cancer survivors in the United States face unique care needs, \n     including post-treatment programs and support, which are \n     often inadequately addressed by a system focused on diagnosis \n     and disease treatment.\n       Our Solution: Initiate programs to address the unique needs \n     of survivors. The bill develops post-treatment programs \n     including follow-up care and monitoring to improve the long-\n     term quality of life for cancer survivors, including \n     children.\n       The Problem: Insufficient attention is being paid to \n     individuals with cancer in the final stages of their disease. \n     One-half of those diagnosed with cancer die of the disease. \n     Unfortunately, appropriate end-of-life medical and social \n     support, which would help maximize the quality of life for \n     these individuals and their families, is often unavailable. \n     This is particularly true for children. Most physicians do \n     not receive adequate training on the provision of appropriate \n     end-of-life care. A 1998 study found that 100 percent of \n     residents and 90 percent of attending physicians wanted more \n     support in dealing with issues surrounding the death of a \n     patient.\n       Our Solution: Avoid needless pain and suffering by \n     improving end-of-life care. The bill provides grants to \n     coordinate end-of-life cancer care and train health care \n     providers in end-of-life care. Pilot programs will also be \n     developed to address the special needs of children.\n                                  ____\n\n\n    Quality of Care for Individuals With Cancer Act--Kennedy-Frist, \n                       Section-By-Section Summary\n\n\n             title i--measuring the quality of cancer care\n\n       Seeks to facilitate a contract to a national consensus \n     organization to investigate the validity of existing quality \n     measures and to then establish recommendations for core sets \n     of quality cancer measures. These recommendations would be \n     published within AHRQ's annual report and, after four years, \n     the General Accounting Office will evaluate the extent to \n     which Federal and private sector health care delivery \n     programs have incorporated these quality measures.\n\n\n                  title ii--enhancing data collection\n\n       Serves to reauthorize the CDC's National Program of Cancer \n     Registries, including new provisions to monitor and evaluate \n     quality cancer care and to increase linkages with various \n     entities to examine disparities in quality cancer care. It \n     also authorizes the CDC's National Program of Cancer \n     Registries--Cancer Surveillance System to advance the \n     development, expansion, and evaluation of State registries \n     and encourages CDC to work with states to meet North American \n     Association of Cancer Registries certification.\n\n\n  title iii--monitoring and evaluating the quality of cancer care and \n                                outcomes\n\n       Supports research to measure, evaluate, and improve the \n     quality of cancer care, and funds private/public partnerships \n     to enhance the usefulness of such information, including \n     fostering the development or adoption of model systems of \n     care or speeding the pace of improvement in quality of cancer \n     care.\n\n\n          title iv--strengthening comprehensive cancer control\n\n       Authorizes the CDC's Comprehensive Cancer Control Program \n     to develop an integrated and coordinated approach to cancer. \n     The Program will establish guidelines regarding the design \n     and implementation of state comprehensive cancer control \n     plans, and awards grants to develop, update, implement, and \n     evaluate such plans.\n\n\n         title v--improving navigation and system coordination\n\n       Provides grants to develop, implement, and evaluate case \n     management programs to enhance the quality of cancer through \n     improved access and navigation.

Con. Res. 141\n\n       Whereas the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was \n     established in 1952 as part of the University of California \n     Radiation Laboratory to augment the efforts of the Los Alamos \n     National Laboratory to meet an urgent national security need \n     and has since made important advances in nuclear weapons \n     science and technology to keep the Nation at peace and \n     secure;\n       Whereas advances by the Laboratory in nuclear weapons \n     technology strengthened the ability of NATO to deter \n     aggression in Europe during the Cold War and have ensured the \n     continuing safety, security, and reliability of our Nation's \n     nuclear weapons stockpile in the absence of nuclear testing;\n       Whereas the Laboratory has provided technical support to \n     arms control negotiations and treaty implementation, \n     including negotiations and treaties to reduce the size of \n     nuclear arsenals, prevent the proliferation of nuclear \n     weapons and technologies, and limit nuclear weapons testing;\n       Whereas the Laboratory has greatly contributed to efforts \n     of the United States intelligence community to understand \n     nuclear-weapons related activities worldwide, as well as to \n     respond to nuclear emergencies through its participation in \n     the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, its development of the \n     National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center, and its other \n     emergency response capabilities, which are now contributing \n     to the war against terrorism;\n       Whereas Laboratory researchers have made many scientific \n     advances, including work that won a Nobel Prize for Physics \n     in 1998 and numerous advances in astrophysics, such as \n     contributions to understanding supernovas, high resolution \n     mapping of the moon, the search for dark matter in the \n     universe, and the development of advanced technologies to \n     improve the performance of terrestrially-based telescopes;\n       Whereas technology development of the Laboratory has \n     broadly contributed to the Nation's technical prowess and the \n     competitiveness of United States industry, as evidenced by \n     the winning of 85 prestigious R 100 awards, the most by any \n     institution, as well as by very effective long-term \n     partnerships with the computer industry and laser and \n     electro-optics industries;\n       Whereas the Laboratory has contributed to the development \n     of technologies that offer the promise of providing energy \n     security in the long term, including technology development \n     for coal gasification, significant advances in fusion energy \n     science, and international leadership in inertial confinement \n     fusion research, and construction of large intertial \n     confinement fusion lasers including ongoing work on the \n     National Ignition Facility;\n       Whereas the Laboratory has developed novel environmental \n     restoration technologies that are being used to rapidly clean \n     up groundwater contamination at Superfund sites and is at the \n     forefront of the development of simulation capabilities to \n     better understand the Earth's climate and how it may change;\n       Whereas technologies developed at the Laboratory \n     contributed to the Department of Energy's decision to launch \n     its Human Genome Initiative in 1987, which evolved into the \n     international Human Genome Project, the Laboratory \n     participated in the project by mapping and sequencing \n     chromosome 16, and continuing genetics work at the Laboratory \n     is leading to the identification of the source of genetic \n     diseases and to the development of improved detectors of \n     biological agents;\n       Whereas the Laboratory is a valuable part of the University \n     of California, working cooperatively with its many campuses \n     to further higher education, contributing broadly to \n     elementary and secondary educational efforts throughout \n     Northern California and educational outreach directed at \n     minority groups nationwide;

NATIONAL DEFENSE RAIL CONNECTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) A comprehensive rail transportation network is a key \n     element of an integrated transportation system for the North \n     American continent, and federal leadership is required to \n     address the needs of a reliable, safe, and secure rail \n     network, and to connect all areas of the United States for \n     national defense and economic development, as previously done \n     for the interstate highway system, the Federal aviation \n     network, and the transcontinental railroad;\n       (2) The creation and use of joint use corridors for rail \n     transportation, fiber optics, pipelines, and utilities are an \n     efficient and appropriate approach to optimizing the nation's \n     interconnectivity and national security;\n       (3) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the transcontinental rail system successfully \n     led to the growth of economically strong and socially stable \n     communities throughout the western United States;\n       (4) Government assistance and encouragement in the \n     development of the Alaska Railroad between Seward, Alaska and \n     Fairbanks, Alaska successfully led to the growth of \n     economically strong and socially stable communities along the \n     route, which today provide homes for over 70% of Alaska's \n     total population;\n       (5) While alaska and the remainder of the continential \n     United States has been connected by highway and air \n     transportation, no rail connection exists despite the fact \n     that Alaska is accessible by land routes and is a logical \n     destination for the North American rail system;\n       (6) Rail transportation in otherwise isolated areas is an \n     appropriate means of providing controlled areas, reducing \n     overall impacts to environmentally sensitive areas over other \n     methods of land-based access;\n       (7) Because Congress originally authorized 1,000 miles of \n     rail line to be built in Alaska, and because of the system \n     today covers only approximately half that distance, \n     substantially limiting its beneficial effect on the economy \n     of Alaska and the nation, it is appropriate to support the \n     expansion of the Alaska system to ensure that the originally \n     planned benefits are achieved;\n       (8) Alaska has an abundance of natural resources, both \n     material and aesthetic, access to which would significantly \n     increase Alaska's contribution to the national economy;\n       (9) Alaska contains many key national defense \n     installations, including sites chosen for the construction of \n     the first phase of the National Missile Defense system, the \n     cost of which could be significantly reduced if rail \n     transportation were available for the movement of materials \n     necessary for construction and for the secure movement of \n     launch vehicles, fuel and other operational supplies;\n       (10) The 106th Congress recognized the potential benefits \n     of establishing a rail connection to Alaska by enacting \n     legislation to authorize a U.S.--Canada bilaterail commission \n     to study the feasibility of linking the rail system in Alaska \n     to the nearest appropriate point in Canada of the North \n     American rail network; and\n       (11) In support of pending bilaterial activities between \n     the United States and Canada, it is appropriate for the \n     United States to undertake activities relating to elements \n     within the United States.\n       (b) Identification of National Defense Railroad-Utility \n     Corridor.--\n       (1) Within one year from the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Transportation, the State of Alaska and the \n     Alaska Railroad Corporation, shall identify a proposed \n     national defense railroad-utility corridor linking the \n     existing corridor of the Alaska Railroad to the vicinity of \n     the proposed National Missile Defense facilities at Fort \n     Greely, Alaska. The corridor shall be at least 500 feet wide \n     and shall also identify land for such terminals, stations, \n     maintenance facilities, switching yards, and material sites \n     as are considered necessary.\n       (2) The identification of the corridor under paragraph (1) \n     shall include information providing a complete legal \n     description for and\n\n[[Page S8777]]\n\n     noting the current ownership of the proposed corridor and \n     associated land.\n       (3) In identifying the corridor under paragraph (1), the \n     secretary shall consider, at a minimum, the following \n     factors:\n       (A) The proximity of national defense installations and \n     national defense considerations;\n       (B) The location of and access to natural resources that \n     could contribute to economic development of the region;\n       (C) Grade and alignment standards that are commensurate \n     with rail and utility construction standards and that \n     minimize the prospect of at-grade railroad and highway \n     crossings;\n       (D) Availability of construction materials;\n       (E) Safety;\n       (F) Effects on and service to adjacent communities and \n     potential intermodal transportation connections;\n       (G) Environmental concerns;\n       (H) Use of public land to the maximum degree possible;\n       (I) Minimization of probable construction costs;\n       (J) An estimate of probable construction costs and methods \n     of financing such costs through a combination of private, \n     state, and federal sources; and\n       (K) Appropriate utility elements for the corridor, \n     including but not limited to petroleum product pipelines, \n     fiber-optic telecommunication facilities, and electrical \n     power transmission lines, and\n       (L) Prior and established traditional uses.\n       (4) The Secretary may, as part of the corridor \n     identification, include issues related to the further \n     extension of such corridor to a connection with the nearest \n     appropriate terminus of the North American rail network in \n     Canada.\n       (c) Negotiation and Land Transfer.--\n       (1) The Secretary of the Interior shall--\n       (A) upon completion of the corridor identification in \n     subsection (b), negotiate the acquisition of any lands in the \n     corridor which are not federally owned through an exchange \n     for lands of equal or greater value held by the federal \n     government elsewhere in Alaska; and\n       (B) upon completion of the acquisition of lands under \n     paragraph (A), the Secretary shall convey to the Alaska \n     Railroad Corporation, subject to valid existing rights, title \n     to the lands identified under subsection (b) as necessary to \n     complete the national defense railroad-utility corridor, on \n     condition that the Alaska Railroad Corporation construct in \n     the corridor an extension of the railroad system to the \n     vicinity of the proposed national missile defense \n     installation at Fort Greely, Alaska, together with such other \n     utilities, including but not limited to fiber-optic \n     transmission lines and electrical transmission lines, as it \n     considers necessary and appropriate. The Federal interest in \n     lands conveyed to the Alaska Railroad Corporation under this \n     Act shall be the same as in lands conveyed pursuant to the \n     Alaska Railroad Transfer Act (45 USC 1201 et seq.).\n       (d) Applicability of Other Laws.--\n       Actions authorized in this Act shall proceed immediately \n     and to conclusion not withstanding the land-use planning \n     provisions of Section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976, P.L. 94-579.\n       (E) Authorization of appropriations.--\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4580.

FOOD AND DRINKING WATER SUPPLY SECURITY PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) section 413 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \n     and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5180) authorizes the \n     purchase of food commodities to provide adequate supplies of \n     food for use in any area of the United States in the event of \n     a major disaster or emergency in the area;\n       (2) the current terrorist threat was not envisioned when \n     that Act was enacted, and the Act does not specifically \n     require prepositioning of food supplies;\n       (3) the maintenance of safe food and drinking water \n     supplies is essential;\n       (4) stored food supplies for major cities are minimal;\n       (5) if terrorist activity were to disrupt the \n     transportation system, affect food supplies directly, or \n     create a situation in which a quarantine would have to be \n     declared, it would require a considerable period of time to \n     ensure delivery of safe food supplies;\n       (6) terrorist activity could also disrupt drinking water \n     supplies; and\n       (7) accordingly, emergency food and drinking water \n     repositories should be established at such locations as will \n     ensure the availability of food and drinking water to \n     populations in area that are vulnerable to terrorist \n     activity.\n       (b) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to Congress a report with information necessary \n     to the establishment of secure prepositioned emergency \n     supplies of food and drinking water for major population \n     centers for use in the event of a breakdown in the food \n     supply and delivery chain.\n       (2) Considerations.--The report shall consider the \n     likelihood of such breakdowns occurring from accidents and \n     natural disasters as well as terrorist activity.\n       (3) Contents.--The report shall--\n       (A) identify the 20 most vulnerable metropolitan areas or \n     population concentrations in the United States; and\n       (B) make recommendations regarding the appropriate number \n     of days' supply of food to be maintained to ensure the \n     security of the population in each such area.\n       (c) Repositories.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall establish secure repositories for food and drinking \n     water in each of the 20 areas identified in the report.\n       (2) Accessibility.--The repositories shall be locally \n     accessible without special equipment in the event of a major \n     transportation breakdown.\n       (d) Purchase of Supplies.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     purchase and maintain food and water stock for each \n     repository, consistent with determinations made by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security.\n       (2) Phasing in.--Purchases and full stocking of \n     repositories may be phased in over a period of not more than \n     3 years.\n       (2) Products of the United States.--The Secretary of \n     Agriculture shall purchase for the repositories food and \n     water supplies produced, processed, and packaged exclusively \n     in the United States.\n       (4) Selection.--Food and water supplies for the \n     repositories shall be selected and managed so as to provide--\n       (A) quantities and packaging suitable for immediate \n     distribution to individuals and families;\n       (B) forms of food products suitable for immediate \n     consumption in an emergency without heating and without \n     further preparation;\n       (C) packaging that ensures that food products are maximally \n     resistant to postproduction contamination or adulteration;\n       (D) packaging and preservation technology to ensure that \n     the quality of stored food and\n\n[[Page S8778]]\n\n     water is maintained for a minimum of 4 years at ambient \n     temperatures;\n       (E) a range of food products, including meats, seafood, \n     dairy, and vegetable (including fruit and grain) products, \n     emphasizing, insofar as practicable--\n       (i) food products that meet multiple nutritional needs, \n     such as those composed primarily of high-quality protein in \n     combination with essential minerals; and\n       (ii) food products with a high ratio of nutrient value to \n     cost;\n       (F) rotation of stock, in repositories on a regular basis \n     at intervals of not longer than 3 years; and\n       (G) use of stocks of food being rotated out of repositories \n     for other suitable purposes.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4583.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of computers and the Internet is rapidly \n     transforming societal interactions and the relationships \n     among citizens, private businesses, and the Government.\n       (2) The Federal Government has had uneven success in \n     applying advances in information technology to enhance \n     governmental functions and services, achieve more efficient \n     performance, increase access to Government information, and \n     increase citizen participation in Government.\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\n       (3) Most Internet-based services of the Federal Government \n     are developed and presented separately, according to the \n     jurisdictional boundaries of an individual department or \n     agency, rather than being integrated cooperatively according \n     to function or topic.\n       (4) Internet-based Government services involving \n     interagency cooperation are especially difficult to develop \n     and promote, in part because of a lack of sufficient funding \n     mechanisms to support such interagency cooperation.\n       (5) Electronic Government has its impact through improved \n     Government performance and outcomes within and across \n     agencies.\n       (6) Electronic Government is a critical element in the \n     management of Government, to be implemented as part of a \n     management framework that also addresses finance, \n     procurement, human capital, and other challenges to improve \n     the performance of Government.\n       (7) To take full advantage of the improved Government \n     performance that can be achieved through the use of Internet-\n     based technology requires strong leadership, better \n     organization, improved interagency collaboration, and more \n     focused oversight of agency compliance with statutes related \n     to information resource management.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this division are the \n     following:\n       (1) To provide effective leadership of Federal Government \n     efforts to develop and promote electronic Government services \n     and processes by establishing an Administrator of a new \n     Office of Electronic Government within the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       (2) To promote use of the Internet and other information \n     technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen \n     participation in Government.\n       (3) To promote interagency collaboration in providing \n     electronic Government services, where this collaboration \n     would improve the service to citizens by integrating related \n     functions, and in the use of internal electronic Government \n     processes, where this collaboration would improve the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of the processes.\n       (4) To improve the ability of the Government to achieve \n     agency missions and program performance goals.\n       (5) To promote the use of the Internet and emerging \n     technologies within and across Government agencies to provide \n     citizen-centric Government information and services.\n       (6) To reduce costs and burdens for businesses and other \n     Government entities.\n       (7) To promote better informed decisionmaking by policy \n     makers.\n       (8) To promote access to high quality Government \n     information and services across multiple channels.\n       (9) To make the Federal Government more transparent and \n     accountable.\n       (10) To transform agency operations by utilizing, where \n     appropriate, best practices from public and private sector \n     organizations.\n       (11) To provide enhanced access to Government information \n     and services in a manner consistent with laws regarding \n     protection of personal privacy, national security, records \n     retention, access for persons with disabilities, and other \n     relevant laws.\n\n   TITLE XXXI--OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT \n                                SERVICES\n\n     SEC. 3101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Homeland Security \n     Information Sharing Act''.\n\n     SEC. __02. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Federal Government is required by the Constitution \n     to provide for the common defense, which includes terrorist \n     attack.\n       (2) The Federal Government relies on State and local \n     personnel to protect against terrorist attack.\n       (3) The Federal Government collects, creates, manages, and \n     protects classified and sensitive but unclassified \n     information to enhance homeland security.\n       (4) Some homeland security information is needed by the \n     State and local personnel to prevent and prepare for \n     terrorist attack.\n       (5) The needs of State and local personnel to have access \n     to relevant homeland security information to combat terrorism \n     must be reconciled with the need to preserve the protected \n     status of such information and to protect the sources and \n     methods used to acquire such information.\n       (6) Granting security clearances to certain State and local \n     personnel is one way to facilitate the sharing of information \n     regarding specific terrorist threats among Federal, State, \n     and local levels of government.\n       (7) Methods exist to declassify, redact, or otherwise adapt \n     classified information so it may be shared with State and \n     local personnel without the need for granting additional \n     security clearances.\n       (8) State and local personnel have capabilities and \n     opportunities to gather information on suspicious activities \n     and terrorist threats not possessed by Federal agencies.\n       (9) The Federal Government and State and local governments \n     and agencies in other jurisdictions may benefit from such \n     information.\n       (10) Federal, State, and local governments and \n     intelligence, law enforcement, and other emergency \n     preparation and response agencies must act in partnership to \n     maximize the benefits of information gathering and analysis \n     to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\n       (11) Information systems, including the National Law \n     Enforcement Telecommunications System and the Terrorist \n     Threat Warning System, have been established for rapid \n     sharing of classified and sensitive but unclassified \n     information among Federal, State, and local entities.\n       (12) Increased efforts to share homeland security \n     information should avoid duplicating existing information \n     systems.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Federal, State, and local entities should share homeland \n     security information to the maximum extent practicable, with \n     special emphasis on hard-to-reach urban and rural \n     communities.\n\n     SEC. __03. FACILITATING HOMELAND SECURITY INFORMATION SHARING \n                   PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Presidential Procedures for Determining Extent of \n     Sharing of Homeland Security Information.--(1) The President \n     shall prescribe procedures under which relevant Federal \n     agencies determine--\n       (A) whether, how, and to what extent homeland security \n     information may be shared with appropriate State and local \n     personnel, and with which such personnel it may be shared;\n       (B) how to identify and safeguard homeland security \n     information that is sensitive but unclassified; and\n       (C) to the extent such information is in classified form, \n     whether, how, and to what extent to remove classified \n     information, as appropriate, and with which such personnel it \n     may be shared after such information is removed.\n       (2) The President shall ensure that such procedures apply \n     to all agencies of the Federal Government.\n       (3) Such procedures shall not change the substantive \n     requirements for the classification and safeguarding of \n     classified information.\n       (4) Such procedures shall not change the requirements and \n     authorities to protect sources and methods.\n       (b) Procedures for Sharing of Homeland Security \n     Information.--(1) Under procedures prescribed by the \n     President, all appropriate agencies, including the \n     intelligence community, shall, through information sharing \n     systems, share homeland security information with appropriate \n     State and local personnel to the extent such information may \n     be shared, as determined in accordance with subsection (a), \n     together with assessments of the credibility of such \n     information.\n       (2) Each information sharing system through which \n     information is shared under paragraph (1) shall--\n       (A) have the capability to transmit unclassified or \n     classified information, though the procedures and recipients \n     for each capability may differ;\n       (B) have the capability to restrict delivery of information \n     to specified subgroups by geographic location, type of \n     organization, position of a recipient within an organization, \n     or a recipient's need to know such information;\n       (C) be configured to allow the efficient and effective \n     sharing of information;

and\n       (D) to provide data integrity through the timely removal \n     and destruction of obsolete or erroneous names and \n     information.\n       (4) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the \n     information sharing system through which information is \n     shared under such paragraph include existing information \n     sharing systems, including, but not limited to, the National \n     Law Enforcement Telecommunications System, the Regional \n     Information Sharing System, and the Terrorist Threat Warning \n     System of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       (5) Each appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the \n     President, shall have access to each information sharing \n     system through which information is shared under paragraph \n     (1), and shall therefore have access to all information, as \n     appropriate, shared under such paragraph.\n       (6) The procedures prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     ensure that appropriate State and local personnel are \n     authorized to use such information sharing systems--\n       (A) to access information shared with such personnel; and\n       (B) to share, with others who have access to such \n     information sharing systems, the homeland security \n     information of their own jurisdictions, which shall be marked \n     appropriately as pertaining to potential terrorist activity.\n       (7) Under procedures prescribed jointly by the Director of \n     Central Intelligence and the Attorney General, each \n     appropriate Federal agency, as determined by the President, \n     shall review and assess the information shared under \n     paragraph (6) and integrate such information with existing \n     intelligence.\n       (c) Sharing of Classified Information and Sensitive but \n     Unclassified Information With State and Local Personnel.--(1) \n     The President shall prescribe procedures under which Federal \n     agencies may, to the extent the President considers \n     necessary, share with appropriate State and local personnel \n     homeland security information that remains classified or \n     otherwise protected after the determinations prescribed under \n     the procedures set forth in subsection (a).\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that such procedures may \n     include one or more of the following means:\n       (A) Carrying out security clearance investigations with \n     respect to appropriate State and local personnel.\n       (B) With respect to information that is sensitive but \n     unclassified, entering into nondisclosure agreements with \n     appropriate State and local personnel.\n       (C) Increased use of information-sharing partnerships that \n     include appropriate State and local personnel, such as the \n     Joint Terrorism Task Forces of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, the Anti-Terrorism Task Forces of the \n     Department of Justice, and regional Terrorism Early Warning \n     Groups.\n       (d) Responsible Officials.--For each affected Federal \n     agency, the head of such agency shall designate an official \n     to administer this title with respect to such agency.\n       (e) Federal Control of Information.--Under procedures \n     prescribed under this section, information obtained by a \n     State or local government from a Federal agency under this \n     section shall remain under the control of the Federal agency, \n     and a State or local law authorizing or requiring such a \n     government to disclose information shall not apply to such \n     information.\n       (f) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``homeland security information'' means any \n     information possessed by a Federal, State, or local agency \n     that--\n       (A) relates to the threat of terrorist activity;\n       (B) relates to the ability to prevent, interdict, or \n     disrupt terrorist activity;\n       (C) would improve the identification or investigation of a \n     suspected terrorist or terrorist organization;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist \n     attacks on our country, communities all across American now \n     find themselves on the front lines in the war against \n     terrorism on United States soil.\n       (2) We recognize that these communities will be forced to \n     shoulder a significant portion of the burden that goes along \n     with that responsibility. We believe that local governments \n     should not have to bear that responsibility alone.\n       (3) Our homeland defense will only be as strong as the \n     weakest link at the State and local level. By providing our \n     communities with the resources and tools they need to bolster \n     emergency response efforts and provide for other emergency \n     response initiatives, we will have a better-prepared home \n     front and a stronger America.\n\n     SEC. __03.

The Director shall, in order to \n     compensate for the discrepancy between the total of the \n     amounts to be allocated under this paragraph and the total of \n     the amounts available under such paragraph, make a pro rata \n     reduction of each amount allocated to the nonqualifying \n     communities in each State under such paragraph so that the \n     nonqualifying communities in each State will receive an \n     amount that represents the same percentage of the total \n     amount available under such paragraph as the percentage which \n     the nonqualifying areas of the same State would have received \n     under such paragraph if the total amount available under such \n     paragraph had equaled the total amount which was allocated \n     under such paragraph.\n       (2) Distribution.--(A) Amounts allocated under paragraph \n     (1) shall be distributed to units of general local government \n     located in nonqualifying areas of the State to carry out \n     activities in accordance with the provisions of this title--\n       (i) by a State that has elected, in such manner and at such \n     time as the Director shall prescribe, to distribute such \n     amounts consistent with the statement submitted under section \n     __05(a); or\n       (ii) by the Director, in any case described in subparagraph \n     (B), for use by units of general local government in \n     accordance with paragraph (3)(B).\n       (B) The Director shall distribute amounts allocated under \n     paragraph (1) if the State has not elected to distribute such \n     amounts.\n       (C) To receive and distribute amounts allocated under \n     paragraph (1), the State must certify that it, with respect \n     to units of general local government in nonqualifying areas--\n       (i) provides or will provide technical assistance to units \n     of general local government in connection with homeland \n     security initiatives;\n       (ii) will not refuse to distribute such amounts to any unit \n     of general local government on the basis of the particular \n     eligible activity selected by such unit of general local \n     government to meet its homeland security objectives, except \n     that this clause may not be considered to prevent a State \n     from establishing priorities in distributing such amounts on \n     the basis of the activities selected; and\n       (iii) has consulted with local elected officials from among \n     units of general local government located in nonqualifying \n     areas of that State in determining the method of distribution \n     of funds required by subparagraph (A).\n       (D) To receive and distribute amounts allocated under \n     paragraph (1), the State shall certify that each unit of \n     general local government to be distributed funds will be \n     required to identify its homeland security objectives, and \n     the activities to be undertaken to meet such objectives.\n       (3) Minimum amount.--\n       (A) In general.--Each State (other than the District of \n     Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n     Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) \n     shall receive for each fiscal year a base amount of \n     $18,000,000 of the total amount appropriated for each fiscal \n     year for grants made available to States under this section.\n       (B) District of columbia and territories.--The District of \n     Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American \n     Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n     shall each receive for each fiscal year $3,000,000 of the \n     total amount appropriated for each fiscal year for grants \n     made available to States under this section.\n       (4) Administration.--(A) If the State receives and \n     distributes such amounts, it shall be responsible for the \n     administration of funds so distributed.
