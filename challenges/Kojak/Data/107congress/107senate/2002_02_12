My own wisdom, and that of all about me, seemed \ninsufficient for that day.'' When asked whether the Lord was on his \nside, he responded, ``I am not at all concerned about that, for I know \nthat the Lord is always on the side of the right. But it is my constant \nanxiety and prayer that I--and this Nation--should be on the Lord's \nside.''\n  Let us pray.\n  Holy, righteous God, so often we sense that same longing to be in \nprofound communion with You because we need vision, wisdom, and courage \nno one else can give. We long for our prayers to be affirmations that \nwe want to be on Your side rather than appeals for You to join our \ncauses. Forgive us when we act like we have a corner on the truth, and \nour prayers reach no further than the ceiling. In humility, we spread \nour concerns before You and ask for Your marching orders and the \ncourage to follow the cadence of Your drumbeat. Through Jesus who \ntaught us to pray, ``Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.'' \nAmen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S597-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Debbie Stabenow led the Pledge of Allegiance, as \nfollows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S597-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 40 minutes of debate, equally divided, on the Grassley \namendment No. 2837.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Grassley has arrived now, so debate can begin.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I wish to make a very short statement \ntoday. I would refer my colleagues to a lengthier statement I made \nwhen----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  If the Senator will suspend, we are on the amendment. The Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley, has time. The Senator controls 20 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield the Senator from Iowa, my \ncolleague, 3 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator for yielding. I did not think we were \non the amendment yet.\n  Madam President, I will make a statement. I made a lengthier \nstatement on Friday when I offered the second-degree amendment for my \ncolleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  Farmers and ranchers have long sought a ban on a packer's ability to \nown livestock. The reasons are simple: When packers own livestock, it \ngives them a greater ability to manipulate the market because they \ncontrol the supply, and packer ownership shuts out farmers from the \nmarket because the packer fills its plant with company-owned animals.\n  This past December, the Senate responded to these problems by \nadopting the Johnson-Grassley amendment by a 51-to-46 margin. That \namendment prohibited packers from owning, feeding, or controlling \nlivestock for more than 14 days before processing.\n  After that amendment was adopted, the packers created a firestorm \nwith a lot of smoke and mirrors about the word ``control.'' They \nsomehow argued that the amendment would affect forward contracting and \nmarketing agreements, even though the amendment did not affect these \ntypes of arrangements. Nevertheless, the packers gained some traction \nby the pure repetition of this argument.\n  So Senator Grassley, Senator Johnson, myself, and others worked with \ninterested groups, such as the American Farm Bureau, to further define \n``control'' so the packers could not even pretend to make the argument \nthat the amendment affects marketing contracts.\n  This is what the Grassley second-degree amendment does. It makes it \nclear that farmers may still contract for the sale of their livestock. \nThe amendment does this by stating that it does not affect \nrelationships where the producer ``materially participates in the \nmanagement of the operation with respect to the production of \nlivestock.'' We use these words because they are familiar terms to \nfarmers and agricultural lawyers. This phrase draws a clear legal line.\n  Now about the study. Farmers do not want another study that concludes \nthere is a strong correlation between captive supplies and lower \nprices. The USDA has told us this a number of times before. A report, \nreleased on January 18 of this year, included a 15-page appendix of all \nthe previous studies dealing with packer ownership and captive supply. \nIn summary, all these reports basically said: As the packer's use of \ncaptive supplies increases, the farmer's price for livestock decreases.\n  So we know the facts. We have had study after study. We know what is \ngood for our farmers. The National Farmers Union, the American Farm \nBureau, and over 100 other farm, commodity, and rural groups are \nsupporting the Grassley amendment. They do not want another study to \ntell us what the other studies have already told us. They want to limit \nthe packer's ability to manipulate the market; they want a ban on \npacker ownership; and that is what the Grassley amendment does. That is \nwhy I strongly support it and urge our colleagues to support the \nGrassley amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding me this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, in a moment the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho, Mr. Craig, will seek recognition on behalf of the \nopposition to the amendment. I ask Senator Craig to control the time on \nour side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I understand the time on the Grassley \nsecond degree was 40 minutes, 20 to each side equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  I will be brief in the beginning because we have now heard from the \nchairman of the authorizing committee. I share with the chairman the \nkind of frustration to which he has just spoken as it relates to \nlivestock prices and transparency and reportability and ownership. \nThere is no question that there is concern in the livestock industry.\n  I come from a large beef-producing State. I was once a rancher. I am \nvery close to the livestock industry of my State. They have spoken to \nme about this. We have talked about the issue.\n  Let me take the Senate back before today to December, when I voted \nfor the Johnson-Harkin-Grassley amendment. I voted for it because I was \ntold these were the words that would deal with concentration or packer \nownership. I was concerned at that time, but I was also concerned about \nthe myriad new tools being used in the marketplace of sales and \nprocessing and distribution and horizontal and vertical integration and \nregional differences and operational capacities. All of these things \nhave really not been talked about by the chairman or by Senator \nGrassley or by Senator Johnson. And all of a sudden a variety of very \nskilled attorneys began to arise and say: Wait a moment. We think there \nis a very real problem, a very real definitional problem as it relates \nto the kinds of concerns that are very real in the marketplace today.\n  The chairman talked about a firestorm of concern erupting. You bet \nthere was. All of a sudden, what about brand name relationships? What \nabout what we call operational capacity in livestock deficit areas, \nwhere contracting and relationship keeps what we call the throughput of \na slaughter operation so that we can sustain it and its employees? Had \nthat been dealt a fatal blow? Were we really dealing with something \nthat maybe we hadn't effectively thought through?\n  The firestorm produced a real concern. I worked with Senator Grassley \nin good faith. He has worked in good faith. Out of that, he has \nproduced a second-degree amendment to mine.\n  My amendment says, let's spend a couple of hundred days, put the \nexperts together. Don't tread on ice so thin that we could collapse the \nway the livestock marketing operations work today, the way the new \nrelationships that are building dynamics in the marketplace are \nworking. They went ahead. Over the weekend a second-degree amendment \nwas produced in an effort to try to define what control is, because \nthat really is part of the fundamental issue. I could read it. I think \nit has already been read. It will be discussed.\n  I believe this, in part, is a rush to judgment to correct a problem \nthat is yet not effectively studied and/or defined. I am not talking \nabout a study that goes on for year after year. I am talking about us \ncoming back next year, having directed USDA in 200-plus days to look at \nthe full ramifications of the livestock industry and the slaughter \noperations, the packers, the marketers, the wholesalers, the retailers, \nthe brand names, the carcass quality, all of those kinds of things that \nare an integrated relationship in a new market today that producers are \ndeveloping with packers that we are now deciding--or at least some \nare--is a wrong relationship, and somehow we ought to legislatively \nstep in and, by law, fix it.\n\n  I am not opposed to fixing something that is broken, but I am not at \nall convinced that it is yet broken. It may be influenced. It might be \ntampered with. I don't know that yet. I think an effective study could \ndo that.\n  I will agree that a study a few years ago indicated there was \nmanipulation\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nin the market place, there was a minority record that said that captive \nherd and packer concentration in that regard was a problem. At the same \ntime, I don't think we rush to judgment here and collapse a marketing \nsystem that is now growing and creating stability--maybe not the price \nwanted but clearly stability and brand name and quality to the \nconsumers of our country that is in reality strengthening the market.\n  That is with what we have to deal. I don't believe the second degree \ngets us there. It has not been effectively studied. It is in the eye of \nthe legal mind that created it last weekend--not months ago, not with \nhearings, just this last weekend.\n  Why don't we take a breather, timeout, 200 days? Examine this \namendment against the reality of control and market relationships and \ncontract relationships, and see if this is where this country wants to \ndirect its livestock industry. I would hope not. I hope my colleagues \nwill join with me in opposing this second degree and, as a result, \npassing the study dealing with this issue.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nIdaho.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nJohnson.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I thank my friend, Senator Grassley, my \ncolleague from Iowa.\n  I come to the Chamber to make one final stand for my bipartisan \namendment that restores fair competition and access in the livestock \nmarkets. Fifty-one Senators already voted for this provision which \nprevents meatpacker ownership of livestock.\n  I greatly respect the right of my colleagues to demand a second vote \non this issue. That is what we will wind up having today. To clear up \nany question about the intent of our provision, Senators Grassley and \nHarkin have offered a second-degree amendment to the Craig language \nmaking it clear that forward contracts can be used as a marketing tool \nfor both packers and producers under the underlying amendment that was \npassed with 51 votes earlier.\n  I don't think there has ever been a serious issue about whether \nforward contracting is permitted under the amendment which we passed \nlast December. The leading agricultural experts in the world have \nexamined that legislation and have all concluded that, in fact, there \nis no prohibition on forward contracting on the underlying amendment.\n  However, this issue has come up. There have been people who have \nraised issues. I think it is a red herring for those who simply do not \nwant to roll back the right of packers to own livestock outright, but, \nnonetheless, this additional language is now being offered, and we will \nhave this debate this morning and vote on this issue.\n  With this additional clarification, we have the support of most major \nfarm groups: the American Farm Bureau Federation, National Farmers \nUnion, plus many more. However, our colleague from Idaho, who I greatly \nrespect, proposes to strike my amendment in exchange for a study on \nthese issues. It seems to me that we have had studies enough. The \nSenate Agriculture Committee has held three hearings on concentration \nof livestock markets, packer ownership, and other issues--in June of \n1998, May of 1999, and April of 2000. The problems are clear, and I \nbelieve they have been demonstrated.\n  This amendment applies to hogs, cattle, and sheep. A lot of the most \nrecent controversy has been relative to hogs. The percentage of hogs \nowned by packers rose from a modest 6.4 percent only in 1994 to a \nwhopping 27 percent only 7 years later in 2001, according to the \nUniversity of Missouri. This increase in packer-owned hogs means that \npackers prefer to buy their own hogs instead of paying farmers a fair \nprice. When packers own their own farms and their own livestock, they \ndon't make purchases from farmers who otherwise provide economic \ncontributions to our rural communities--to main street businesses, \nschool districts' tax base, banks, car dealerships, feed stores, and so \non.\n  Frankly, those opposed to my amendment prohibiting packer ownership \nof livestock simply have a profoundly different vision of what rural \nAmerica ought to be about. I believe we ought to have independent \nlivestock producers in a position where there is competition, and they \ncan leverage a decent price for their animals. I don't believe the \nfuture of livestock production in our Nation ought to be a series of \nlow-paid employees of the packers on their own land bearing all the \nrisk and little of the profit for the production of their animals. That \nis not the direction I wanted livestock production in America to go.\n  We had strong bipartisan support for this amendment last December \nwhen it was brought up. I am hopeful we can retain that support so that \nthose of us who have a more optimistic vision of a competitive free \nenterprise and free market economy for livestock producers can in fact \nenvision them having more choices and options about how to sell their \nanimals and where to sell them.\n  History demonstrates that USDA studies simply won't do the work. A \ncase in point: USDA failed to take action on a petition with regard to \npacker ownership and captive supply. This petition was submitted in \nOctober of 1996, initially published in the Federal Register for \ncomment in January 1997, hearings were held on September 21, 2001, and \nUSDA still has done nothing on this petition.\n  Additionally, USDA has failed to hire attorneys to lead \ninvestigations on competition cases despite the fact that GAO made a \nrecommendation and Congress appropriated increased money for this \npurpose.\n  USDA has done a lot of studies in the past. They have found a strong \ncorrelation between increased captive supplies and price.\n  However, the studies conducted by USDA have not made a conclusion. \nRather, they have been indecisive as to action, this is why policy and \nlegislation must clarify and strengthen existing law.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the Grassley-Harkin second-\ndegree amendment.\n  Should we vote on Senator Craig's amendment, I urge my colleagues to \noppose it and put a stop to concentration in the livestock industry.\n  Have no doubt about it, this is our opportunity to address the issue. \nTalk is fine. We can do this in 200 days or a year or so down the road. \nThe fact is, this is the farm bill. The likelihood of passing this \nlegislation as a freestanding bill, with all the controversies and \nlobbying that come into play, is very slight. This is the opportunity. \nWe either act in the context of this farm bill or I fear that years \nwill go by before we have another opportunity to address the \nintegration crisis we have in American agriculture--livestock in \nparticular. We will find that the horse is long out of the barn before \nwe have another opportunity to address this issue.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues to support the underlying amendment \nprohibiting packer ownership of livestock, to support the clarification \nas it applies to forward contracting, and to support Senator Grassley's \namendment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, it is with deep regret that I must rise \ntoday in opposition to the second-degree amendment offered by my good \nfriend from Iowa.\n  His intentions are good, but I sincerely believe his amendment will \nhave unintended effects that will hurt producers in the long run and \nthat could have an unfortunate effect on the livestock industry in the \nUnited States-- particularly the beef industry in Kansas.\n  Kansans are proud of the beef industry and the history it has played \nin our state. From the days of the cattle drives that stretched from \nTexas to Abilene and Ellsworth it has been one of our top industries.\n  I have always argued that we need to give our producers every tool \nnecessary to compete and that we should carry a big stick to ensure the \npacking industry treats producers fairly.\n  Coming from Dodge City, I fully understand the concerns of those who \nare worried about the largest packers having control over the market. \nPrior to a devastating fire in late 2000 at the ConAgra beef division \nplant in Garden City, KS we had all four of the major\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\nmeat packers doing business within a 100 mile radius of Dodge City.\n  While some argue that the packers have a crippling effect on the \ncattle market, I can tell you that the economy of western Kansas would \nnot survive without the beef industry--individual producers, feeders, \nand packers.\n  How important is this industry to Kansas?\n  Cattle represented 62.6 percent of the 2000 Kansas agricultural cash \nreceipts.\n  Cattle generated $4.95 billion in cash receipts in 2000. More than \ndouble that generated by our second largest commodity--wheat.\n  Kansas processed 8.21 million head in 2000; grazes 1.5 million \nstockers annually; and, had 1.52 milliion beef cattle in the State on \nJanuary 1, 2002.\n  Kansas ranked first in commercial cattle processed in 2000.\n  Kansas ranks second in the value of live animals and meat exported to \nother countries at $969.7 million in 2000.\n  Kansas ranked second in fed cattle marketed with 5.37 million in \n2000, representing 22.3 percent of all cattle fed in the United States.\n  Kansas ranks second, with 6.34 billion pounds of meat produced in \n2000.\n  These numbers extend simply beyond the number of cattle we have and \nthe producers who raise and feed them. These numbers also represent \njobs that are the linchpin of many of our western Kansas communities.\n  As a couple of examples:\n  Farmland Industries employees 5260 people in Kansas in its beef \npacking sector and 850 in pork packing. Most of those jobs are in Dodge \nCity and Liberal, Kansas.\n  Cargill employees approximately 4500 people. 3600 of these people \nwork in its meat and livestock businesses in Leoti, Dodge City, and \nWichita.\n  If those promoting this amendment are wrong, and it indeed does cause \na restructuring in the industry or forces packers to move from the \ncountry, the economic impact and ripple effects it could cause would be \ndevastating to the Kansas economy.\n  Farmland has informed me that it is the legal opinion of their \nlawyers that this amendment would put them out of the beef and pork \npacking businesses. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  I am also deeply concerned that this amendment appears to severely \ncurtail the ability of producers to enter into producer alliances and \nmarketing agreements that allow them to gain additional dollars for the \nlivestock they produce.\n  Several of these alliances already exist, or are being formed, in \nKansas. And I have been told that no fewer than 80 are in some stage of \ndevelopment throughout the United States.\n  One of the most successful of these alliances has been U.S. Premium \nBeef.\n  This producer owned cooperative has become one of the most successful \nproducer initiated businesses I have ever seen.\n  Last year 13,300 head were marketed through USPB each week.\n  In fiscal year 2001, USPB cattle earned an average of $18.95 per head \nin premiums over the cash market. The top 25 percent earned a $46 per \nhead average over the cash market, the top 50 percent $35 per head, and \nthe top 75 percent $27 per head more than selling on the cash market.\n  U.S. Premium Beef has informed me that despite the best intentions of \nthe authors of this amendment to exempt them from this amendment, USPB \nwould also be put out of business.\n  I understand the concerns of the supporters of this amendment and \nmany producers who argue for its passage. But I also have many \nproducers in Kansas who argue against its passage, and I cannot in good \nconscious vote for an amendment that I believe ties the hands of \nproducers to compete against the large meat packers and that I believe \ncould devastate the beef industry in Kansas.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the second-degree amendment \noffered by Mr. Grassley and to vote for the amendment offered by Mr. \nCraig.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I withhold instead of my yielding time \nback and forth. Rather than using all of my time, the other side will \nhave the last 10 minutes of debate.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirteen minutes, forty-five \nseconds.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me take just a couple of minutes and then return it to \nSenator Grassley.\n  The Senator from South Dakota said studies have languished. Action \nhas languished. Action needs to be taken if the studies yield what he \nsays they might yield. This is a directive from the Congress to USDA to \noperate in 270 days. It would then not be incumbent upon USDA to act. \nIt would be incumbent upon the Congress to act.\n  What does my amendment do? It directs that there should be an \nexamination of the relationship of livestock as it relates to 14 days \nprior to slaughter, livestock producers that market under contract \ngrid, base contracts, forward contracts, rural communities, employees \nof commercial feedlots, livestock producers, and market feeder \nlivestock, and feedlot owners controlled by packers, market price for \nlivestock--both cash and futures--and the ability of the livestock \nproducers to obtain credit from commercial sources.\n  What is occurring today under these new relationships with contracts \nis that the producer can take the contract to the bank and get \nfinancing. That has become an important and valuable tool as it relates \nto a lot of these new relationships. Studies that have been done talk \nabout cooperatives and the relationship they now have with marketers. \nThey talk about how we deal with brand name products and quality \ncontrol. Those are new relationships that have added value to a \nproduct. No, it isn't just a simple matter of concentration so defined \nby control. We are talking about a new world in the livestock industry \nand industry planning and adjustments to it.\n  Do I like it as a traditional cattleman? Probably not. Do some \nproducers? No. Other producers do because they decided to make some \nadjustments and changes. All of that needs to be studied. There has not \nbeen one hearing on this issue. There has been some study but a limited \namount of study.\n  I think that is really the issue. It is not about USDA not acting. It \nis about the Senate acting when it is properly informed and when we \nhave not rushed to judgment over the weekend by trying to define \nsomething that only one attorney, to my knowledge, has had the ability \nto craft with limited review from anyone else.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes, forty-four seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First of all, if you read the history of the Packers and Stockyards \nAct passed roughly around 1920, I believe you will find a lot of the \nsame arguments being used against the passage of the original act at \nthat particular time as you are now finding used against our efforts to \nmodify the act to a small extent.\n  We have had a good Packers and Stockyards Act for 80 years. We are \ntrying to bring it up to date. It didn't anticipate the control that a \nfew packers would have over the livestock industry. We are adjusting it \nto take into consideration new ways of marketing.\n  Also, I would ask just my Republican colleagues, not my Democrat \ncolleagues--I am not sure exactly which ones I am talking about, but \nthere was a group of us who met with the new Secretary of Agriculture \nabout a year ago--there were probably 8 to 10 Republican Senators \npresent--to give our views on certain issues for her, an incoming new \nSecretary of Agriculture. I don't take notes on these meetings, but I \nremember, to my astonishment, the number of my colleagues who told the \nSecretary of Agriculture as they reflected on the grassroots opinions \nwhich they received from their constituents that one of the greatest \nconcerns was about concentration in agriculture. I will bet the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, the Presiding Officer, hears that \nfrom family farmers in Michigan.\n  This was not in reference to what I am trying to do today. I don't \nimply that at all. My amendment is not a result of that meeting. But my \namendment has something to do with the opinion that my Republican \nSenators expressed to the Secretary of Agriculture--that we have to do \nsomething\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nto make sure we have more competition in agriculture because of this \nconcern about less competition, and particularly because a few packers \nhave the vast majority of the slaughter of livestock. That is one \nthing. But it is compounded by their ownership of livestock which they \ncan dump on the market on a day they choose to dump it on the market. \nThat depresses the market, and the marketplace just does not work.\n  I want my Republican colleagues--I do not know who they were, but \nthey were from the Midwest and the West--to think of that meeting we \nhad with Ann Veneman and the opinions they expressed. I hope they will \nfind my amendment in tune with their points of view.\n  The other thing I want to make a comment on is the insinuation in the \nMidwest newspapers and by Smithfield's CEO that if this amendment went \nthrough, they were not going to build any new plants in certain States \nin the Midwest.\n  I had an opportunity to have a long conversation maybe about 18 \nmonths ago with Mr. Luter about competition in agriculture. I had never \nmet him before. He is obviously a very good entrepreneur and has \ndeveloped Smithfield Foods. Out of that meeting I remember two very \ndistinct things he said. He said, first of all, he wanted me to know \nthat his view was that family farmers for the most part are not good \nbusinesspeople and are not very sophisticated. Second, he told me \nsomething to the effect he--again, I didn't take notes at those \nmeetings; this is a recollection. I hope I am not doing him an \ninjustice. I am sure Mr. Luter would say that I am. But the second \npoint he made was he thinks there should be a lot of pork producers \nacross the United States. It is just that they should all work for him \nby feeding his pigs. He has such an arrangement with a lot of pork \nproducers.\n  That is how he controls the market. He would argue that is how he \ncontrols the quality. That is how he satisfies the consumer. I am not \ninsinuating bad motives that he has as a quality producer of pork. I am \njust saying his attitude is very different from that of the family \nfarmer in the United States. Consequently, I hope that is why we can \nget this amendment adopted, because we want to help the family farmers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator has used his time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Chair please tell me when 5 minutes remains on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me speak to what Senator Grassley has \ntalked to in general because I share his concern. I attended one of \nthose meetings with him some time ago and I, as many others, have \nexpressed that. My effort today is not to stop what is going on here \nbut to better inform us if we are in fact making the right decision. I \nwant the family farmer to prosper, and for any packer to suggest that \nfamily farmers today are less than sophisticated, they don't know the \nfamily farmer of Idaho, or Iowa for that matter. They are highly \nskilled, professional business men and women--some small, some quite \nlarge. But they are family farmers who produce the food and fiber of \nour country.\n  Here is what I think all of us fail to address, and that is not \ncompetition in this country as much as competition from foreign \ncountries, where we see livestock production and packing increasing \nvery rapidly and entering the market both here and around the world. \nThe pork industries both in Canada and Brazil, for example, had an \nannual growth rate of 6.5 percent from 1995 to 2000, according to the \nUSDA. Both countries already are cost competitive pork suppliers. \nCanada has excess packing capacity and both countries have space for \nexpansion.\n  Canada, Argentina, and Australia stand to benefit from a less \ncompetitive United States beef industry. What we are talking about are \nefficiencies and competitiveness, and that is really a part of what we \nhave to look at and what my study directs. Are we simply handicapping \nthe family farmers? Or should we be working with them to assure that \nthey have greater tools of integration, so they can share in the profit \nline instead of simply standing for the highest or the lowest bidder, \nif you will, to take their product?\n\n  Those are fundamental issues that the Grassley amendment does not \naddress. He would like to think it does. But to simply arbitrarily \nsuggest there is only one problem in the livestock industry today--and \nthat is captive herds--is to suggest almost that we ignore all of the \nrest of the tools of integration that are beginning to develop out \nthere. I want my cattle men and women and my pork men and women--I have \nlittle to no poultry in my State--to be as competitive and as \nprofitable as possible. But I do know one thing: If you deny these \nefficiencies and the vertical integration to the beef and pork \nindustries--there is one industry out there that is vertically \nintegrated, and that is the poultry industry--those two industries \nbecome less competitive while the poultry industry becomes more \ncompetitive. That is the reality of what we are facing.\n  Shouldn't we know about that in detail and shouldn't a study be done \nbefore we act instead of collapsing the industry after we have acted?\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I worked on this proposition, of course, \nlast week. Our purpose, and our goal, is to try to make the marketplace \nmore responsive. Our cattlemen take their cattle into a marketplace, \ninto an auction market, hopefully, to sell at the best price available. \nYet we believe sometimes because packers can have their own cattle and \ntheir own feedlots prior to the time of the market, it affects that \nmarket, and they can adjust it. We only now have about three packers \nthat have 80 percent of the control over this market. This is one of \nthe areas that we believe ought to be remedied. We have it in the \npackage now, and I certainly support Senator Grassley's amendment. I \nurge our Members to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume. It is my understanding I have 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I also want to take this opportunity \nto, hopefully, get some people who represent big population States to \nlook at our amendment. I think it is very much oriented toward helping \nconsumers. We have more competition in the processing of livestock, as \nwell as helping the family farmer.\n  I am offering this second-degree amendment to the Craig amendment to \nclear up any concerns raised by the opposition regarding the word \n``control''. The new language reads that a packer may not own or feed \nhogs or cattle, ``through a subsidiary, or through an arrangement that \ngives the packer operational, managerial, or supervisory control over \nthe livestock, or over the farming operation that produces the \nlivestock, so such an extent that the producer is no longer materially \nparticipating in the management of the operation with respect to the \nproduction of livestock.''\n  The new test established to clear up the question of what control \nmeans is found in the phrase ``materially participating.'' A farmer who \nmaterially participates in the farming operation must pay self-\nemployment taxes. Those who do not materially participate, do not have \nto pay self employment taxes. The phrase has appeared in the IRS Code, \nsection 1402(a) since 1956 and there is a full hopper of case law \nclarifying the definition.\n  I came to the floor yesterday and explained that all the talk about \nthis generating excess litigation, or bureaucracy, or limiting farmers \nrisk management options is just talk. It's all blue smoke.\n  Some of the packers' allies are already trying to complain that this \nonly adds another layer of confusion. That's an absolute lie. What this \namendment does is crystalize the issue, and this issue is whether \npackers should be packers, or packers should be producers.\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\n  Let me make this clear. The vote this morning is a vote on whether \npackers should own livestock, nothing more and nothing less. If you \noppose my amendment you support packer ownership. If you oppose my \namendment you must believe that independent livestock producers should \ncompete on an even playing field with corporations that can generate \nhundreds of millions of dollars to compete with farmers. If you oppose \nmy amendment you are supporting packer greed versus the independent \nproducer's need.\n  Ask any independent producer in the United States. If we were able to \nask them if they think packers should be able to compete with them \ndollar for dollar, who benefits? I realize that AMI has been arguing \nthat ``the sky is falling'' is this passes, but what would your \nindependent producers really want you to do?\n  The revised Grassley amendment will inject greater competition, \naccess, transparency and fairness into the livestock marketplace. Small \nand medium sized livestock operations will gain greater access to \nmarkets that will have greater volume and be subject to less \nmanipulation.\n  The revised bill clarifies that arrangements that do not impose \ncontrol over the producer can still provide all the benefits of \ncoordination and product specification that many ``grid'' marketing \narrangements desire. We are not limiting independent producers at all, \nonly packers.\n  I've got letters and endorsements from possibly every group \ninterested in this issue that doesn't allow packers to be included in \ntheir membership. These endorsements come from state pork producer and \ncattlemen groups, to the American Farm Bureau. I have well over 135 \norganizations that signed a letter in support of my second degree \namendment. Just a few of those groups are the: Livestock Marketing \nAssociation (who stated they would like to voice their strongest \npossible support), National Farmers Union, R-CALF USA, Ranchers-\nCattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America, National \nCatholic Rural Life Conference, and the Organization for Competitive \nMarkets.\n  The packers are an important piece in the rural economy, but only a \npiece, not the whole pie. They think they are the whole pie. The \nquestion we need to ask ourselves is whether packers should be packers \nor packers should also be producers. Is it our intent to let packers \ncompete with producers on an even playing field? Once again, is there \nany question who will lose this competition?\n  The reason we keep sows in farrowing stalls is to protect the \npiglets. Sows are extremely important for the health and well-being of \nthe piglets, but if we let the sow out of the crate we stand the chance \nof getting the piglets crushed by the sheer weight of the sow, or \nworse, and watch the sow grow fatter. Let's build a strong farrowing \nstall for the packers and facilitate the health and well being of our \nindependent producers.\n  Support the Grassley second-degree, your independent producers would.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, Senator Grassley and I have worked on a \nlot of agricultural issues together and a lot of farm issues together, \nand we are in agreement about 99.9 percent of the time. Today, we \ndiffer slightly, only in that I want to make sure the step Senator \nGrassley, Senator Harkin, and Senator Johnson are asking the Senate to \ntake, which has a direct impact on the livestock marketing industries \nof our country, is the right step.\n  They took a step in December only to have a lot of different legal \nminds say: Wait a minute. We think you are wrong or we think it could \nbe misinterpreted or we think it could be very destructive to a lot of \npositive relationships that are now building in the marketing between \nthe producer and the processor.\n  I have read his amendment. It was read yesterday. I am not quite sure \nit achieves what he wants it to achieve as it relates to control. It \ntalks about a variety of controls, managerial supervision, control of \nlivestock, to such an extent the producer is no longer materially \nparticipating in the management of the operation ``with respect to, and \nthe following.''\n  I received a report in the last few days from the Purdue University \nDepartment of Agricultural Economics. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthat report printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the report was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Implications of Banning Packer Ownership of Livestock\n\n            (By Allan Gray, Ken Foster, and Michael Boehlje)\n\n       The goal of this paper is to address some of the issues \n     surrounding Senator Johnson's (D-SD) amendment to the Senate \n     Farm Bill (S. 1731, The Agricultural, Conservation, and Rural \n     Enhancement Act of 2001) that would make it illegal for meat \n     packers to own, feed, or control livestock more than 14 days \n     before slaughter. There has been much debate of this \n     amendment in the press, and much of the debate centers on the \n     word ``control'' and its likely interpretation in a court of \n     law. These comments address the underlying issues for the \n     motivation and the likely impacts of this proposed amendment \n     for the structure of the livestock industries.\n     Is defining control important?\n       The word ``control'' regardless of its interpretation in a \n     court of law, generates serious concerns. While Fuez, et. al. \n     make arguments that this word could eliminate marketing \n     contracts, Harl, et. al. argue that, in a court of law, \n     control would be interpreted as ownership and would not ban \n     marketing contracts. The issue at hand seems to be that the \n     concept of ``control'' is, in fact, subject to \n     interpretation. The degree of uncertainty surrounding the \n     interpretation of the word ``control'' will lead to increased \n     uncertainty about legal business structures and likely \n     increased litigation. These factors will increase \n     transactions costs in livestock industries making them less \n     competitive against other protein sources in both domestic \n     and export markets. If the natural economic tendency is \n     toward tighter alignment of the livestock value/supply chain, \n     as will be argued later in this paper, then packers will move \n     toward tighter vertical linkages without actual ownership if \n     the amendment is enacted. This tendency to push for tighter \n     alignment may be interpreted as control without a more \n     explicit definition and will most assuredly lead to \n     litigation. Thus, the word ``control'' should be defined more \n     explicitly in the legislation or eliminated to avoid the \n     uncertainty and the increased litigation that would follow if \n     it is not defined.\n       Having addressed the issue of defining control, there are \n     three other factors that should be explored regarding the \n     impacts of this amendment and whether it can be expected to \n     achieve its intended goals. First, the motivation of packer \n     ownership of livestock should be explored to determine \n     whether it is a demand driven issue or a market power issue. \n     Second, whether this amendment would result in producers \n     maintaining their independence or if some other, more tightly \n     aligned interdependent, governance structure would result \n     needs to be examined. Finally, the impacts of this bill on \n     producers and packers that are located in isolated or \n     ``fringe'' regions should be considered.\n     Is packer ownership of livestock (vertical integration) \n         driven by packers trying to respond to market demand and \n         economic forces, or is it driven by packers exercising \n         market power?\n       The U.S. livestock industry is a mature industry that \n     delivers products to a set of customers with rising incomes \n     who demand a more differentiated, higher-value set of choices \n     in their proteins. In addition, the marketplace is \n     increasingly concerned about food safety and the ability to \n     trace any contamination to the root source. This argument \n     suggests that the market pressures placed on the industry to \n     deliver more differentiated, higher-value, traceable protein \n     products is a key driver in the development of tighter \n     vertical linkages in the livestock industry.\n       A more tightly aligned livestock supply chain allows the \n     industry to be more responsive to consumer needs, providing \n     growth for its products in mature markets and increasing \n     efficiency. By increasing vertical coordination (whether \n     through vertical ownership or contracting), the industry \n     increases the ability of information to flow quickly and \n     unambiguously along the supply chain (in essence through \n     quantity and quality purchase orders), allowing for quick \n     responses to changes in consumer preferences through new \n     requirements and specifications rather than trying to attract \n     change through price incentives alone. In addition, the \n     packing industry has large investments in fixed assets that \n     are most economical when operated at full capacity. The best \n     way to assure full capacity and better flow scheduling, and \n     better match consumer or retailer quantity and quality \n     requirements, is to develop tighter vertical coordination. \n     Thus, the industry can improve its competitive position \n     through better inventory management that arises from vertical \n     control. Finally, the shared information, learning capacity, \n     and financial gains from vertical coordination may lead to \n     more rapid technological adoption and enhanced efficiencies \n     for the industry, which leads to more affordable and/or \n     desirable products for consumers over time.\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\n       Risk in the livestock industry is another important driver \n     of increased vertical coordination. When markets are less \n     coordinated, the market signals and production activities may \n     be less aligned. This misalignment can lead to wide savings \n     in inventories and prices creating a higher degree of \n     variability in income for farmers and packers. Increasing \n     vertical coordination can reduce misalignments that lead to \n     higher variability. In addition, the sharing of risks and \n     rewards in coordinated systems may be different than in an \n     ``open'' market. Research has shown that producers producing \n     under production contracts (a form of packer ownership) \n     receive lower returns on average than their ``open'' market \n     counterparts. However, this same research indicates that the \n     variability of returns for producers in production contracts \n     is substantially lower than the variability of their \n     counterpart's returns. This reduction in risk could be a \n     substantial benefit to some producers--these risk reduction \n     benefits would be reduced by the proposed amendment if it \n     prohibits production (not marketing) contracts, which is \n     likely.\n       An alternative argument for the increase in vertical \n     coordination is that packers are exercising their ability to \n     control the price of live animals. This argument contends \n     that packers have market power in the industry and thus \n     can squeeze producer's margins when they are more \n     vertically aligned. Most studies have found little \n     evidence that packers are exercising pure market power in \n     the live animal markets. However, there is some research \n     suggesting that packers might strategically use captured \n     supplies (company owned or contract produced animals) to \n     reduce the number of animals that they purchase from the \n     open market without risking capacity utilization \n     shortfalls; the result of this behavior is lower live \n     animal prices, than would have otherwise prevailed, on the \n     open market. However, if packers have this so-called \n     monopsony power, it is unlikely to disappear under the \n     terms of the proposed amendment. If there exists \n     substantial market power, then packers will likely find \n     ways to exercise it via exploitative marketing contracts \n     that fit within the bounds of the proposed amendment. If \n     the problem in the livestock industry is one of market \n     power, and it can be documented, then it is an issue of \n     anti-trust and not one of industry structure. Furthermore, \n     the market power of packers is unlikely to be \n     significantly impacted by banning packer ownership of \n     cattle.\n       In summary, there is a sound argument that vertical \n     coordination in the livestock industries is driven by changes \n     in consumer demand to deliver high-quality, differentiated \n     products to the market place, and to improve the risk/reward \n     sharing between producers and packers in the industry. This \n     amendment would simply eliminate one form of vertical \n     coordination for delivering products to consumers and would \n     be unlikely to impact the market power of packers. In fact, \n     the amendment could, at the margin, increase the packers \n     market power since it would likely lead to an increase in \n     contracting, placing more of the ownership of specific assets \n     in the hands of producers where they are more likely to be \n     exploited by packers. The new market would be one for \n     contracts rather than for live animals, and with more \n     producers seeking those contracts the potential for packers \n     to extract price discriminating rents from the producers is \n     not likely to decrease.\n     Would this amendment have an open access market with \n         production through independent producers, or would it \n         lead to some other form of supply/value chain governance \n         structure?\n       The argument above is that tighter vertical alignment \n     through ownership and/or contractual arrangements is \n     primarily driven by the need to meet consumer demands and \n     lower cost. If this is the case, it is unlikely that this \n     (assuming control is not defined as amendment eliminating \n     detailed quality and quantity specified procurement/marketing \n     contracts) would curtail the industry's move towards tighter \n     vertical alignment. That is, this amendment is unlikely to \n     preserve the ``independence'' of the livestock producers.\n       The benefits of tighter vertical alignment can be obtained \n     through two forms of supply/value chain governance. The first \n     form would be through vertical integration or ownership. This \n     has been the primary choice of the poultry industry, which is \n     widely credited with being more responsive to customer's \n     needs that has led to increases in the demand for poultry \n     products at the expense of beef and pork. Packer vertical \n     integration in the pork and beef industries is relatively \n     small when compared to the broiler industry. The latest \n     statistics show packer ownership in beef to be between 5 \n     and 7 percent while pork is closer to 20 to 25 percent. \n     However, more than 74 percent of hogs were marketed \n     through some form of vertical coordination in 2000. Thus, \n     while this amendment would eliminate vertical integration \n     in its purest form (i.e., ownership of livestock raw \n     materials), it is unlikely to reverse the trend toward \n     tighter alignment in the livestock supply chain and re-\n     establish the dominance of independent producers of \n     livestock and open access market coordination between \n     producers and packers.\n       Since this amendment would eliminate the possibility of \n     vertical integration (at least, backward integration by \n     packers), the other choice of governance structure to obtain \n     some of the benefits of vertical alignment is through \n     contracts. However, the economic pressure will likely be to \n     create very tightly controlled contracts with a limited set \n     of ``preferred suppliers.'' This limited set of preferred \n     suppliers would consist of producers with the ability to \n     deliver the quality and quantity of livestock needed by the \n     packer to take advantage of the economic forces in the market \n     place. This set of ``preferred'' suppliers would have an \n     extremely close relationship with the packer and would, in \n     effect, act as an agent or franchisee for the packer, more or \n     less imitating the vertical integration structure.\n       This change in the structure of the livestock industry is \n     at best a marginal change from the currently emerging \n     structure. While it is likely that this amendment would shift \n     some of the margins in the industry towards producers, it is \n     likely that these margins would be collected by relatively \n     few select producers ``hand chosen'' by packers. This leaves \n     most other producers in an unchanged situation with limited \n     access to markets and the necessity to sign contracts (albeit \n     with production companies rather than packers) that more or \n     less specify their production practices and who may own the \n     livestock.\n     Would packers and producers in areas with limited livestock \n         production and only one or two packing facilities suffer?\n       It seems likely that livestock production in fringe areas \n     could suffer under this amendment. As stated previously, the \n     fixed cost nature of the packing industry requires a high \n     degree of capacity utilization to achieve profitability. In \n     ``fringe'' areas where livestock production is limited, \n     packers may need to own a portion of the livestock production \n     to maintain an economically feasible throughput in their \n     plants. By eliminating ownership, these plants may have no \n     alternative but to shut down or be sold at a loss. Because of \n     the limited production and packing capacity in these regions, \n     farmers would likely have to cease operations as well. Thus, \n     it would appear that this bill might favor the regions where \n     production is most concentrated, at the expense of less \n     concentrated areas of production.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. They say the definition of control is in the eye of the \nbeholder and ultimately in the eye of the court, and that is where I \nbelieve this relationship will go if it is a mandate of Federal law. We \nmust know where we are going. Is it only an updating of the Packers and \nStockyards Act? I think not. I think it is an entirely different \nrelationship of which we need to be clearly aware. When we are talking \ncompetitiveness, I want ranchers of Idaho to be as competitive as \npossible.\n  What I am frustrated about, and the Purdue University study says it, \nwhat about the fringe area where there is only one packinghouse? If \nthis goes through, are we assuming packers are going to go out and \nbuild new plants around the West? The West is a fringe area.\n  We have heard from my colleagues from Idaho. Idaho and Wyoming fit \nthat definition. Our livestock must move elsewhere, or at least to the \nedge of our borders, to be processed and ultimately to be marketed. \nThat is why capacity, throughput, all of those kinds of things, through \ncontract relationships and owner relationships, has built stability \nwithin that market--and competition, and I hope pricing. If I am wrong, \nthe study will prove it.\n  This is the first time we have directed USDA to look straight at this \nissue, not around the issue, not about market manipulation but the \nreality of the current market and changing those relationships, and the \nimpact those changes would have on the profitability of the livestock \nindustry, primarily the beef and the pork industry. The poultry \nindustry is already fully integrated, and we compete, if one is a beef \nproducer or a pork producer, directly with that industry. Therefore, \nefficiencies must be such to create the profitabilities for a kind of \neffective competition. That is the reality of the issue we face.\n  I hope my colleagues vote down the Grassley amendment and recognize \nthat my amendment is not ad infinitum. It is 270 days directed \nspecifically at USDA, with specifics for that study, and then we come \nback to Congress and the next year the Senators from Idaho, Wyoming, \nand South Dakota can stand in this Chamber and say here are the facts; \nhere is what we know we are doing; here is a designer amendment to fit \nthe reality of the marketplace, instead of what we believe might be \ntrue based on what we think exists today.\n  I do not want to collapse the livestock industry built on maybes and\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\nmights and possibilities. That is the value of the study.\n  I move to table the second-degree amendment, and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2533\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Crapo amendment No. 2533.\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I will take a moment and then yield the \nremainder of my time to Senator Thomas from Wyoming.\n  This amendment is simple. It strikes section 215 from the farm bill. \nSection 215 contains provisions that would require a landowner who \nseeks to participate in a portion of the acreage of the CRP to give up \nhis or her water rights either temporarily or permanently. Those kinds \nof efforts to increase Federal intrusion and Federal control over water \nmanagement are simply unnecessary and inappropriate. Under the law as \nwe now have it, this very successful conservation program would be \nhooked not only to the Endangered Species Act, which is something that \nhas never been done before under the farm bill, but also to a \nrequirement that landowners must yield their water rights to the \nFederal Government in return for the right to participate in this very \npopular and successful conservation program.\n  This is an unnecessary intrusion of Federal law into the arena of \ninserting the Endangered Species Act into the farm bill and is an \nunnecessary intrusion of Federal law into management of State water \nrights. For that reason, I encourage the support for this amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of our time to Senator Thomas from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Idaho for the \nwork he has done in this area. His background--as a matter of fact his \nlegal background--much of it is in the water rights area. So he \ncertainly brings to this Chamber a good deal of not only interest but \nalso knowledge and insight, and I thank him for that.\n  I rise to support the Crapo amendment in this instance. I think it \nhas a great deal to do with the West, a great deal to do with our \ntraditional use of water. There are, I believe, major concerns behind \nthis idea of the water conservation program. It could result in \npermanent acquisition of water rights. It preempts State water rights. \nIt extends authority over endangered species to USDA which, of course, \nis a different operation than we have had.\n  Endangered species is a very interesting and important aspect to land \nand water management in the West. It proposes a radical change to the \nCRP, the conservation reserve, without addressing reforms to ESA, the \nEndangered Species Act. Interestingly enough, the concept was never \ndiscussed in our committee, and I think it makes it more difficult and \nless practical to bring it up for debate that way.\n  I am a member of the Agriculture Committee and can attest to the fact \nit was never debated there. I am quite sure had it been, there are \nseveral members of the committee who represent States that experience \nreal problems with how this would impact our lands, and we would have \nvigorously fought to keep it out.\n  The allocation of water in the West is done by the States. This is a \nreal tradition and an important States rights issue to us. This is a \nprecious commodity a producer has, and the States vigorously defend any \neffort that would reduce their rights to make the water \nallocation. This new water conservation idea is another example of the \nFederal Government treading on State water rights. For my constituents, \nthe compromise reached allowing the Governors to opt in is certainly \nnot enough.\n\n  One of the real difficulties is the possibility that it could result \nin permanent acquisition of water rights. Program enrollment language \ndoes not mention what happens to water upon termination. That is very \nimportant.\n  A provision claims it is not intended to preempt State water. \nHowever, if that is the intention, safeguards need to be made. They are \nnot there.\n  The involvement with the Endangered Species Act, without addressing \nreform of ESA is very important to those in the West. The jurisdiction \nover endangered species is under the Department of the Interior. \nChanging this, then, places a new provision under the Secretary of \nAgriculture. Obviously that is a conflict.\n  Certainly those in the West--and I just returned from home over the \nweekend--have strong points of view about it. Many say if this Reid \namendment is included, they do not want a farm bill. That would be a \nshame.\n  I yield to my friend from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I raise two points. Members on this side \nof the issue spend a lot of time talking about ``shadows.''\n  Senators have to ask themselves, why is this in this bill, No. 1; \nand, No. 2, why is it important? What is the reason for it? Have we \nbeen given a reason why this was in this legislation when it was \noffered as a stand-alone bill? It did not even gain enough recognition \nto have a hearing in committee and now we are going to put it into law. \nI want the other side to defend why they want this piece of \nlegislation. Why do they want this section? I don't want Members to go \nback to the cloakroom or offices and turn off the TV and not listen to \nthis. I have not heard one reason why it is important to anything that \nhas to do with the production of food and fiber.\n  It is in there to leave us to fight it. What are we fighting? We \ndon't know. I have not heard anybody come down here and do that. I was \ngone yesterday and they probably did discuss it and I probably missed \nit, but nonetheless these ears and these eyes have not heard or seen \nthe reason for this legislation or this section to be in this piece of \nlegislation and what it has to do with food and fiber production and \nthe security of the American people to have their grocery stores full.\n  That does not make a lot of sense to me. We are going to vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time controlled by the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2842, As Modified\n\n     (Purpose: To promote water conservation on agricultural land)\n\n  Mr. REID. Under the agreement from last night, I send a modification \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment will be so modified.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I have spent a great deal of time in the \nlast several days speaking to my friend from the State of Idaho, \nSenator Crapo, who is a water expert. He was a water attorney before he \ncame here. We have had some fruitful discussions. I have spoken to many \nother people in an effort to try to alleviate some of the fears people \nhave. They are fears.\n  I have come to this Chamber on several occasions to explain to people \nwe have a new West. Nevada is an example. Seventy percent of the people \nlive in Las Vegas, 20 percent live in the metropolitan Reno area, with \nonly 10 percent of the people living outside those two metropolitan \nareas. The land is no longer controlled by the miners and ranchers. I \nhave great respect for them. My father was a miner. I know how much the \nranchers have contributed to the welfare reform of the State of Nevada. \nI am doing everything I can to help them, but there is a new reality \nout there.\n  When we start talking about changing grazing--I have been here before \nand talked about doing that--as I discussed on Friday, people have \nserious fears. But they are hearing and talking about things that do \nnot exist. This is an effort to alleviate some of the fears people \nhave. That is what the modification is about. It applies to the States \nof California, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Maine, and New \nHampshire. It is too bad it does not apply to everybody else, but there \nare fears people have. By the time it comes around\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\nnext time, they will see that the other States will be fighting to get \nin it.\n  With all due respect to the Farm Bureau, they are the ones in \nopposition. Every environmental group in America supports this \nlegislation. It is legislation that explicitly prohibits the Federal \nGovernment from holding or buying or leasing water rights. A farmer \ndoesn't have to sell water in order to participate. This amendment is \nnot only supported by the environmental community but the International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. For those Members who are in \nfavor of shooting, hunting, and fishing, this association represents \nall State fish and game departments across the country. They support \nthis effort.\n  The League of Conservation Voters will score this amendment. Everyone \nshould understand they score very few amendments, very few votes during \nthe year. They are scoring this one. Everyone be aware of that. They \nsupport this amendment because it helps States and farmers ease water \nconflicts by getting farmers income support in drought years and water \nto endangered fish in other years.\n  A colleague last week said my water program reminded him of Mark \nTwain. Mark Twain once said of the West: Whiskey is for drinking and \nwater is for fighting. If they succeed in striking my language, they \nwill be responsible for making sure that is the way things remain. It \nshould not be. A vote to support my motion to table Crapo is a vote to \nrelieve conflict, not create it.\n\n  The modified amendment replaces the existing program with pilots. The \npilot programs use conservation money and it puts this money into the \nhands of States and gives them discretion in how to spend it to solve \ntheir water conservation problems. It takes nothing away from the \nStates as far as water. The first pilot expands a successful \npartnership with the Department of Agriculture's Conservation Reserve \nProgram and the State of Oregon to restore habitat and to lease water \nto help the fish. Under the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program, \nStates can submit plans to the Department of Agriculture to target \nresources for restoration.\n  The Department of Agriculture brings CRP funds to the table and \nStates or nonprofits bring additional funds to get the work done. \nToday, 17 States have the programs to better target Department of \nAgriculture funds to resources of State concern. This amendment \ncodifies a plan in existence in the State of Oregon. Under that plan, \nUSDA can pay farmers irrigated rental rates if they transfer water to \nthe State under the plan. But farmers can enroll in the plan even if \nthey do not want to transfer water. This provision reserves 500,000 \nacres of land for this purpose.\n  The second provision creates a new water benefits program under this \nprogram. The State could help farmers and ranchers fund irrigation \nefficiency measures, willing farmers could convert from water-intensive \ncrops to less water-intensive crops--I repeat, willingly; no one forces \nthem to do anything--and to lease/sell options or sell water.\n  Most Western States already have programs similar to this but this \nFederal money will bolster these programs. We have included language to \nmake certain Eastern States are eligible for these programs as well.\n\n  There was concern by my friend from Wyoming that the Endangered \nSpecies Act would raise its ugly head. The Federal Government has never \nconfiscated CRP land from endangered species. There is no reason to \nthink they would do so now.\n  But, if a farmer is concerned about it, he has two choices: A farmer \ncould say I am not going to participate or he can get a safe harbor \nagreement from the State and the Interior Department. It has been done \nbefore. These assurances tell landowners who enter into agreements if \nthey help us restore habitat, whether by dedicating land for a time \nperiod or transferring water, at the end of that period they get the \nland or the water back. It is an established program that has existed \nfor almost 3 years. It gives the good-guy participants in programs such \nas these the assurance that they will not be penalized under the \nEndangered Species Act for helping fish and wildlife for a time.\n  Remember, my amendment prohibits the Federal Government in any way \nfrom holding, buying, or leasing water rights. How many times do I need \nto say that? People keep coming in and saying the Federal Government is \ngoing to steal water thus. I repeat, my amendment says the Federal \nGovernment will not hold, buy, or lease water rights; No. 2, farmers \nwho want to participate in these program do not have to sell their \nwater to do so; No. 3, States are given the lead role in deciding what \nwater conservation options they want help funding, and this farmer \nparticipation is voluntary.\n  Finally, these programs provide a substantial amount of funding to \nhelp support farmer income in drought years and get water to the fish \nin those years.\n  Has my time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. It has expired. When all time has expired, I want to move \nto table.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Parliamentary inquiry: The author of the amendment has \njust modified his amendment. Is it my understanding the Crapo amendment \nto strike still pertains to the modified amendment or is it to the \noriginal? What will be the circumstance of this vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Crapo motion to strike still applies to \nthe underlying section of the substitute, which is now subject, as \nwell, to the modification.\n  Mr. CRAIG. So the amendment to strike covers all action including the \nsubstitute language the Senator from Nevada has just offered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Idaho, it is my understanding--I am \ngoing to move to table Senator Crapo's striking amendment--how that is \ndecided will determine what language remains.\n  I think all time has expired. I move to table the Crapo motion to \nstrike. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my full support for \nthe amendment by Senator Crapo, which I have cosponsored. The purpose \nof this amendment is to strike section 215 of the farm bill, which we \nare considering today in the Senate. This section would create a \nprogram allowing the Federal Government to purchase the water rights of \nfarmers and others for the purpose of protecting the habitat of certain \nendangered or threatened species.\n  While protecting the habitat of threatened species is a worthy goal, \none which I have supported, this amendment has the unacceptable \nconsequence of putting in jeopardy our system of State water rights. \nLet me elaborate. Under this program, private landowners, tribal \ngroups, farmers and other organizations who participate would be \nrequired to sell or lease their water rights to the Federal Government. \nI strongly oppose using federal dollars to establish an incentive for \nprivate entities to give up their water rights. The Federal Government \nhas tremendous financial resources and, given free reign, could buy up \nunlimited acre-feet of precious water in the West. As some of my \ncolleagues already know, Utah is the second driest State in the Union. \nWater is the lifeblood of Utah, and it is in short supply.\n  It was only a matter of hours after the first pioneers entered the \nSalt Lake Valley that they began to break up the dry desert, plant \nseeds, and dig irrigation canals, bringing the precious water from \nUtah's snowy mountains to their thirsty lands. It was these farmers--my \nancestors--who made Utah blossom like a rose. The families of those \noriginal pioneers and their limited water resources have continued to \nkeep Utah's agricultural industry strong. But it has not been easy. \nThis program will create an incentive to strip Utah's farmers of the \nvery thing that makes their livelihood possible.\n  Although the program is said to be voluntary, even farmers who choose \nnot to participate in it could experience a number of adverse effects \nbecause of the participation of a neighbor. Erosion or additional weeds \nand dust resulting from the disuse of adjoining land--because of this \nprogram--or the introduction of species listed\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\nunder the Endangered Species Act to these program lands could have a \nnegative impact on the livelihood of neighboring farmers.\n  I am also concerned that section 215 makes considerable changes to \nexisting programs without a proper discussion of those changes in the \nrelevant committees. For example, it creates an unprecedented link \nbetween the Endangered Species Act and farm programs. From what I have \nseen, when the goals of the Endangered Species Act and the needs of \nfarmers come into conflict, the species wins and the farmer loses. I am \nalso concerned with the language of this provision that appears to \ncreate a new ``sensitive species'' category for protecting wildlife. \nFinally, I am concerned that this language gives powers to the \nSecretary of Agriculture that have previously only been held by the \nSecretary of the Interior. This is yet another major policy shift. \nChanges of this magnitude should not be acted on by the full Senate \nwithout the benefit of committee hearings. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport Senator Crapo's amendment to strike this section 215 from the \nFarm Bill until such time that further light can be shed on its \nimplication for farmers. And I remind my colleagues that the Farm Bill \nis meant to help our farmers, not hurt them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2839\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 15 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the Baucus amendment No. 2839. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with \ntime to be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to again discuss an \namendment that would provide desperately needed disaster assistance for \nAmerica's farmers and ranchers.\n  I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues, Senators Enzi, Reid, \nBurns, Landrieu, Dorgan, Johnson, Conrad, Carnahan, Dayton, Stabenow, \nLincoln, Levin, Murray, and Cantwell, for cosponsoring this measure.\n  This amendment extends to the 2001 crop the same agricultural \ndisaster programs that have proven crucial to American farmers in \nrecent years.\n  The amendment provides $1.8 billion for the Crop Disaster Program and \nis intended to cover quality loss due to army worms, $500 million to \nthe Livestock Assistance Program, with $12 million directed to the \nNative American Livestock Feed Program and $100 million toward the \napple market loss assistance program.\n  Agricultural producers desperately need these disaster programs. \nAdverse weather conditions have pushed farmers, ranchers, and rural \ncommunities to the brink of economic disaster.\n  These adverse weather conditions came on the heels of sharply \nescalating operating costs due to higher energy and fertilizer prices.\n  With weather problems continuing, costs rising, and no time to \nrecover from the drop in farm operating income, it is incumbent on us \nto take action today.\n  President Bush understands the crucial role that agriculture plays in \nAmerica's economy. In a speech delivered to the National Cattlemen's \nBeef Association's Annual Convention and Trade Show in Denver, He said:\n\n       Our farm economy, our ranchers and farmers provide an \n     incredible part of the nation's economic vitality. If the \n     agricultural economy is not vital, the nation's economy will \n     suffer.''\n\n  We must give rural America the chance to have a vital economy.\n  Closer to home, farmers in my State of Montana have compared current \ndrought conditions to the dust bowl years of the 1930s. Many have not \ntaken out their combine in over a year. When there is no harvest, there \nis no income. And the strain on these rural communities is beginning to \nmount.\n  According to Dale Schuler, past president of Montana Grain Growers \nand a farmer in Choteau County, Montana, nearly 2,000 square miles of \ncrop in his area of central Montana have gone unharvested. That is an \narea the size of Delaware. And the impact has been horrendous.\n  To quote Mr. Schuler:\n\n       Farmers and our families haven't had the means to repay our \n     operating loans, let alone buy inputs to plant the crop for \n     the coming year. I believe that we're set to see a mass \n     exodus from Montana not seen since the Great Depression of \n     the 1930s.\n\n  Chouteau County, the largest farming county in Montana, the last farm \nequipment dealer had no choice but to close his doors, the local co-op \nclosed its tire shop, one farm fuel supplier quit, and the fertilizer \ndealers and grain elevators are laying off workers.\n  Another farmer from the area, Darin Arganbright, told me that \nenrollment in local schools has decreased by 50 percent in the past few \nyears. So we are not only losing our current farmers but our future \nfarmers.\n  A final point. We need to act now--on the farm bill. Producers are \nmaking their planting decisions for next year right now. But, without \nthese disaster payments, many banks will refuse to provide operating \nloans to producers for this upcoming crop year.\n  In Montana, it is anticipated that 40 percent of producers seeking \noperating loans this year will be denied if we fail to provide this \nassistance. Without these loans, many farmers will simply be unable to \nplant, giving up any hope of economic recovery in the near future.\n  This would devastate my State's economy and that of the West. Rural \nAmerica needs a boost. And I believe our amendment does just that.\n  This measure will provide stimulus our rural communities need to \nsurvive by extending the disaster relief programs that have been \ncritical to shoring up farm income over the last 3 years. This relief \nwill allow farmers--and the rural communities that depend upon them--to \nget back on their feet.\n  In conclusion, I would like to note that the letters of support for \nthis amendment continue to pour in. These include: The National \nAssociation of Wheat Growers; the National Cattlemen's Beef \nAssociation; the National Farmers Union; the National Cotton Council; \nthe American Farm Bureau; the United Stockgrowers of America; the \nNational Barley Growers Association; the U.S. Canola Association; the \nAmerican Soybean Association; the National Sunflower Association; and \nthe Northwest Farm Credit Services.\n  Our Nation depends on agricultural producers for an abundant, \naffordable, safe food supply.\n  Today our Nation's producers depend on us to provide them with much \nneeded and overdue assistance. Let's get the job done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition? The Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nthat is now in effect be modified to allow 2 minutes equally divided \nbetween each vote and that the latter two votes of the three votes that \nwill take place be 10-minute votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield myself 2 minutes in opposition.\n  I bring to the attention of Senators that, whatever the merits of \nthis emergency legislation, the cost of these provisions is \napproximately $2.4 billion. That $2.4 billion would be in addition to \nthe $73.5 billion over a 10-year period of time, which is already the \napproximate cost of the bill to say nothing about the so-called \nbaseline expenditures--namely, the farm programs which continue, to \nwhich in the event this legislation passes $73.5 billion would be \nadded.\n  I think Senators must weigh the fact that the Senate and the House \nvoted approximately $5.5 billion last year for emergencies. This is in \naddition to that.\n  Members must at some point weigh the consequences of the spending of\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\nwhich we are involved. This Senator has suggested ways in which this \nbill ought to come in for less than $73.5 billion.\n  I simply note that if the passage of the amendment occurs, we will be \nadding approximately $2.4 billion to the tab.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent the time \nbe charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield time to the distinguished Senator \nfor whatever he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I wish to ask when this body is going to exercise \nsome restraint and some discipline. I hear a lot about the deficit and \nhow we have to be careful to not spend so much that we go into deficit \nthis year. Every time I come to the Chamber, we are voting on yet \nanother amendment to spend more money. This amendment would authorize \n$2.4 billion in addition to the $73 billion that already is in the farm \nbill. That is in addition to the $23 billion in emergency ad hoc \nspending that we have spent during the last 4 years. Last year alone we \nauthorized $5.5 billion in emergency spending.\n  It doesn't seem to me that we have any restraint or any discipline, \nor that we are willing to set any kind of priorities. We seem to be out \nof control with respect to spending. I just ask when we are going to \nsay no.\n  I want to give my colleagues notice. I am going to tally up all the \nspending that they propose, and when they come to the floor and talk \nabout the deficit, I am going to confront them with the spending that \nthey proposed.\n  Obviously, some things have to be voted on. We, obviously, have to \nsupport the war on terrorism, and there are a lot of other issues, but \nwhen we keep adding emergency upon emergency upon emergency spending to \na farm bill that is already $73 billion, clearly we are not exercising \nrestraint.\n  I want my colleagues to know what I am going to be doing. If they \ntalk about deficit, I am going to talk about the spending they proposed \nabove and beyond what is already in this appropriations bill and the \nauthorizing legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will vote not to support this amendment for $2.4 \nbillion in additional spending.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that would \nallocate $500 million in emergency spending for the Livestock \nAssistance Program.\n  The Livestock Assistance Program, LAP, is an ad hoc program \nadministered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, through the \nFarm Service Agency. It is available to livestock producers in counties \nthat have been declared disaster areas by the President or Secretary of \nAgriculture. It provides financial relief to livestock producers that \nare experiencing livestock production loss due to drought and other \ndisasters. Livestock producers in my State of Wyoming have been hard \nhit by drought and the drought outlook for this year isn't optimistic.\n  Recently, Wyoming's State climatologist reported that a third year of \ndrought is possible. After Wyoming's warmest summer in 107 years, a \nnormal year would be a relief, but it wouldn't be enough. Unless rains \nof 125 to 175 percent of normal fall on my State, my ranchers will be \nfacing a third year of drought.\n  You may not know that in drought, producers usually suffer the loss \nof grazing sources. The Livestock Assistance Program commonly provides \nthe means to buy supplemental feed for their livestock. Livestock \nusually require supplemental feeding in the winter.\n  The program was not funded in fiscal year 2002 in either the \nemergency agriculture supplemental fiscal year 2002 or the Agricultural \nappropriations fiscal year 2002 bill. This program should be funded \nevery year that disaster occurs. For 2001, the funding is long overdue. \nThis is a situation where there is no light, just an endless tunnel.\n  I believe this program funding is critical to the continuing \nviability of ranches in Wyoming. This amendment would provide short-\nterm, immediate economic stimulus to Wyoming's agricultural population. \nThe program is appropriate for this bill because it upholds the basic \npurpose of the Farm bill: to support American agriculture. This money \nwill be spent immediately to support purchases of winter feed for \nlivestock.\n  In my own State, 2002 is shaping up to be the third year of \ncontinuous drought. In these conditions, the State's natural resources \nhave been unable to recover. In order to conserve these resources, the \nState and Federal Government have evicted ranchers from State and \nFederal leased lands. Producers have been forced to find alternative \ngrazing arrangements where pastureland is limited. Many producers \ngrazed hay fields last summer and fall that had been slotted to provide \nwinter feed. Virtually every indicator, precipitation, snow pack, and \nreservoir levels, show the drought may get worse.\n  The Secretary of Agriculture designated counties in my State as \ndrought disaster areas months ago, but my producers still haven't seen \nthe assistance that should accompany that designation. This amendment \nprovides assistance. I urge my colleagues to pass this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would like to say a couple of words \nwith respect to my friend from Arizona saying that he is not going to \nvote for $2.4 billion because $5 billion was already spent for \nemergencies.\n  A couple of points: Implied in his remarks was that we should support \nemergencies. He mentioned terrorism. He didn't mention al-Qaida, but he \nimplied it. That is correct. We have an emergency. We need additional \nnational security dollars to confront that emergency.\n  I say to my good friend that we have another emergency. The emergency \nis the drought. It is crop losses due to weather conditions. It is an \nemergency. You can't predict it. It happens. The $5 billion my good \nfriend referred to is in every category. That was added on because \nfarmers are losing their shirts under ``freedom to fail.'' That had \nnothing to do with disaster or weather conditions. It had nothing to do \nwith an emergency, a national security emergency, or a weather-related \nagricultural emergency.\n  We need to take care of and support people who are adversely affected \nby emergencies.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield myself time in opposition.\n  Let me respond to the Senator from Montana. To equate the national \nemergency this country faces in its war against terrorism and al-Qaida \nand an agricultural emergency is to stretch things quite a bit. I \nunderstand the desire of colleagues to send money to farmers and \nranchers around the country. I would simply point out that in this \nparticular calendar year agricultural income is a positive $59 billion \nin this country. It was, in fact, higher than it has been for several \nyears. The net worth of farms in this country increased this year as it \nhas at least for the last 3 or 4 years as land values increased \nsubstantially.\n  Let me point out that there may be reasons for specific tailoring of \nvarious projects in various areas, but agriculture in America does not \nface an emergency. Agriculture in America faces at least a point in \nwhich our legislation might create problems. I have suggested the \nproblems that will be created are incentives for overproduction, almost \na guarantee of lower prices, and almost a guarantee that Members of the \nSenate will come here reflecting on the lower prices and wonder why \nthat happened but suggest that we spend more money in order to \ncounteract our own policies.\n  I appreciate that Senators vote generally on the merits of all the \nelements of the bill, but the particular area in\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\nwhich we are dealing--that of agricultural payments--leaves us very \nvulnerable, I believe, to fiscal mismanagement, to lower prices, and to \na trust that has been betrayed with regard to good judgment in farm \npolicy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we have a little time, so we can have a \nlittle more debate.\n  Farmers across America strongly support additional aid to our \nmilitary to protect our national security. That is a given. It is \nabsolute, automatic. But there are also farmers who have suffered \ntremendous losses.\n  I ask my good friend from Indiana to visit, at least Montana and he \nwill see thousands of square miles of dust. That is a disaster. There \nare no combines, nothing. I have walked through those fields. It \nhappens in other parts of the country, too, whether it is from storms \nor floods or pest diseases.\n  The Senator's problem is with the farm bill; it is not with disaster \nassistance payments. We are now focused and voting on a disaster \nassistance payment. That is entirely separate from the farm bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to step up and do what is right and support \nthe farmers who are facing these emergencies. I tell you, they are in \ndire circumstances. We are losing people in our State of Montana. We \nare a special State, granted. We do not have a lot of other industries. \nBut other farmers in other States are also facing the same problems, \nbut sometimes from different kinds of disasters, not necessarily always \nfrom a drought.\n  I must say to my good friend, 50, 75, 80 percent of the States in \nthis country are suffering from a drought, let alone other disasters.\n  I urge my colleagues to just give farmers a chance. If they have a \nproblem with the farm bill, then they should offer amendments to the \nfarm bill, not the disaster assistance program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator from Indiana yield me another 2 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 50 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I yield the Senator the 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator.\n  Later on I am going to offer an amendment--a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment--to express ourselves on the question of the permanent repeal \nof the death tax. I daresay most farmers and ranchers in this country \nwould rather see the absolute permanent end of the death tax than they \nwould another handout from the U.S. Government.\n  So I ask my colleagues to stop and think for a minute about whom they \nare really helping. If they are willing to support their constituents, \ntheir ranchers and farmers, then I think they will want to support me \nin the repeal of the death tax far more than to vote for yet one more \nannual subsidy for emergency relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 2837\n\n  Under the previous order, the question is on agreeing to the motion \nto table the Grassley amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate adopt the Grassley \namendment. It is my understanding that would be the next thing in \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2837.\n  The amendment (No. 2837) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2835, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 2835), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2842, as further modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the manager of this \nlegislation, Senator Lugar. I have spoken to Senator Crapo. I want to \nadd the word ``only,'' to make clear eligible States under this program \nshall include only--and then it lists the States. The word ``only'' is \nadded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Nevada to restate \nhis request. I could not hear him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object, I note I was not here \nyesterday, nor was I in the Senate this morning. So I did not get to \nwork on the amendment that my good friend from Nevada is offering in \nwhich he wants to change one word. I note all States similar to New \nMexico have been exempt. I do not understand why Senator Bingaman went \nalong with the amendment. States in similar water situations--New \nMexico, Idaho, California, Oregon, and Washington--are all excluded. \nSenator Bingaman has concurred that we be in it and that is why he is \ngoing to be for the amendment. I think that is a mistake for New \nMexico. I wish I had more time to try to convince him and the Senate, \nbut we are now going to vote to include New Mexico while the other \nRocky Mountain States made a deal to be excluded, and our Senator is \ngoing along with them, without my understanding because I just arrived \nthis morning.\n  I have no further reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. So that Senator Helms could understand, I am adding the \nword ``only'' so it is very specific. Senator Kyl and others wanted me \nto add that language, and I have done that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n       Eligible States under this program shall include only \n     Nevada, California, New Mexico, Washington, Oregon, Maine, \n     and New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2533\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided for debate prior to the vote on the motion to table the \nCrapo amendment. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to strike section 215 \nfrom the bill. I encourage all Senators not to support the motion to \ntable. The issue is very simple. We have very important and strong \nconservation programs that have been historic parts of the farm bill. \nThey are critical to our environment and to the conservation in our \ncountry. This amendment seeks to attach to that an effort to manage \nwater under the Endangered Species Act in a way which would give \nfurther\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\nFederal control over what has traditionally been a State prerogative: \nThe management, allocation, and use of water. It is critical we not \nstart mixing our domestic farm policy with issues of Endangered Species \nAct management and with issues of States water rights management, \nallocation and use.\n  I encourage all Senators to oppose the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The motion to table is something that is wanted by the \nconservation communities throughout America. Every environmental group \nsupports this effort. The organization that represents all of the State \nfish and game departments across the country, the International \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, supports this effort. It is \ngood legislation. It takes nothing, I repeat nothing, away from the \nStates.\n  My State is supportive of my effort here. Nevada's former water \nengineer and now the head of our conservation agency helped me write \nthis language; he is one of the most conservative people in the State \nof Nevada. This is something that is good for the States. It is good \nfor the farm communities. It will allow them to do things they have \nnever been able to do before, and the States have programs they could \nafford. This will allow them to do that. This is good legislation. The \nmotion to table the Crapo amendment would be for a better farm program, \nand I believe it will lead to passage of this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the Crapo amendment. This is a 10-minute vote. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On the next question----\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I urge the Chair to insist on order in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be order.\n  Senators will clear the well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope this is not being charged against the \n2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is not charged.\n  There are 2 minutes equally divided prior to the vote in relation to \nthe Baucus amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would mention that emergency programs are \nnot new to agriculture. From 1989, that fiscal year, to the present \ntime, over $40 billion has been expended in this way.\n  During the last 3 years, we have had expenditures of $26.62 billion, \n$14.99 billion, and $11.17 billion. There appears to be a very strong \ntrend to try to get outside the so-called baseline, plus whatever else \noccurs in the farm bill for additional expenditures.\n  The Baucus amendment calls for $2.4 billion outside the $73.5 billion \nfor the 10 years of additional spending in the farm bill or the \nbaseline. For that reason, I oppose it. At the proper time I will raise \na point of order under section 205, but I will wait until we have had \nthe 2 minutes expire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, people can always use figures. It is true \nthat over the entire period of the farm bill that number of dollars has \nbeen spent. It is also true that some disaster assistance has been \nprovided to farmers in the past. But it is not true that we spent $11 \nbillion this prior year on disasters. Frankly, the last payment was \nonly $5 billion, and it was not disaster payments; it was supplemental \npayments because Freedom to Farm was failing.\n  This is the first time it applies only to 2001. It would be disaster \nassistance to farmers who suffered disasters in 2001. It is only fair. \nIt is only appropriate.\n  I might add, there is an $80,000 payment limitation--you can't get \ndisaster payments of more than $80,000--which is very low, I might add, \ncompared to a lot of disasters that occurred across our country. It is \nonly disasters, and very small in comparison to the problems we have \nbeen facing.\n  I urge Senators to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). All time has expired.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the Baucus amendment contains an emergency \ndesignation. Under section 2035 of H. Con. Res. 290, the fiscal year \n2000 budget resolution, I raise a point of order against the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the purposes of the pending amendment, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

Mr. President, this amendment is being looked at on \nthe other side, and I am optimistic it will be agreed to and thereby \nhopefully not require a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. President, we have made progress in the Food Stamp Program during \nthis debate and I rise today to propose two further improvements to \nthat worthwhile program.\n  President Bush has called for the standard deduction in the Food \nStamp Program to reach 10 percent of the poverty level in his new \nbudget proposal. In other words, if the 10-percent deduction were in \neffect for 2002 a family of four would receive an additional $16 a \nmonth.\n  The present language in the Senate bill does not meet the goal set \nforth in President Bush's 2003 budget.\n  I am not asking for increased overall spending levels in the farm \nbill. The offset to my proposed increase in the Food Stamp Program \nwould come out of a small cut in price supports and loan rates.\n  I am asking that we consider reductions of less than one cent--less \nthan one cent per bushel--to the price support payments and marketing \nloan rates in this bill, so that we can continue to address the needs \nof our Nation's poor and disabled.\n  We need to complete the task of overhauling the Food Stamp Program's \nstandard income deduction.\n  The standard income deduction policy affects the eligibility and \nbenefit determination of every food stamp applicant. For the last \nseveral years, the standard deduction has been fixed at $134 for every \nfamily, regardless of size and regardless of inflation and the \nfluctuating levels of the national poverty level.\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\n  As I mentioned at the outset, we've made some progress on this issue \nduring the farm bill debate. The nutrition title as it now stands \nadopts the basic policy model recommended by President Bush in his \nbudget and introduced in committee by my colleague Senator Lugar--that \nis, it links the income deduction for basic family living expenses to \nannual poverty levels. By doing so, the amount is indexed by family \nsize and reflects annual economic changes.\n  As the provision is implemented, food stamp benefits increase \nmodestly. The Dorgan-Grassley amendment took the important step of \nphasing in the proposal more quickly, and I applaud them for that.\n  I ask, however, that we finish the job and achieve the goal set forth \nby President Bush to raise the standard deduction to 10 percent of the \npoverty level in this farm bill. That is precisely what my amendment \nwill do.\n  Under my amendment, over the next 10 years, there will be an \nadditional $500 million in the hands of needy families with children. \nThat's $50 million more per year.\n  Let us remember that half the gains from this change would go to low-\nwage working families. In addition, over 99 percent of the gains would \ngo to families with children.\n  The second Food Stamp Program change in my amendment would remedy an \ninconsistency in the rules that apply to the elderly and disabled. It \nwould apply the same assert rule to both populations.\n  Given the special needs of our elderly and disabled citizens, Program \neligibility rules are somewhat more generous in this area. For example, \nthese families are allowed to deduct excess medical expenses in the \ncalculation of net income.\n  With respect to food stamp asset rules, however, the elderly and \ndisabled are subject to different policies. Food stamp eligibility for \nhouseholds with an elderly member allows assets equal to $3,000, but \nasseets for the disabled can't exceed $2,000.\n  There seems no good reason for such an inconsistency. Both kinds of \nfamilies face special needs. Further, the distinction for only this \npolicy creates confusion for low-income families and increases the risk \nof errors for States.\n  I ask our colleagues to support these improvements to the Food Stamp \nProgram. The total cost of both provisions is $500 million over 10 \nyears. This is a small price to pay to help the neediest families in \nour Nation.\n  My amendment is supported by leading nutrition groups such as the \nKentucky Task Force on Hunger, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the Food Reseaerch and Action Center, and Second Harvest.\n  The farm bill is an important safety net for our farmers. Likewise, \nthe Food Stamp Program is an important safety net for our country.\n  I hope the amendment will be subsequently cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2842\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the assistant majority leader \nfor his help in providing me time to explain a vote we cast fairly \nrecently.\n  Senator Reid proposed a second-degree amendment to the farm bill \nwhich I supported. The amendment would be a substitute to the water \nconservation provision contained in section 215 of the underlying bill. \nI have reviewed the amendment that Senator Reid offered and that the \nSenate adopted. I believe it is good law, it is good policy, and it is \na substantial improvement over the original proposal. So I did support \nit. I think it is a constructive proposal.\n\n  Section 215, as originally conceived, sought to provide direct \nFederal assistance to farmers by allowing the Federal Government to \nlease or acquire water rights on a willing seller basis to use as part \nof a plan to protect and recover certain species and certain habitat. \nThat is a worthy goal, but as in all water-related issues--and we know \nthis in New Mexico perhaps better than in most parts of the country--\nthe devil is in the details.\n  On close review, valid concerns were raised. No. 1 was whether the \nprogram would be conducted pursuant to all applicable State law; No. 2, \nwhat would be the implications of Federal ownership of Federal water \nrights; No. 3, what was the correct linkage between the Conservation \nReserve Program and the Endangered Species Act.\n  So to address these problems, we agreed--this was before Christmas, \nbefore the end of the session last year--to prohibit the application of \nthe section 215 water conservation program in any State in which the \nGovernor had not formally agreed to the program being used.\n  This change, however, although it was a substantial step forward--I \nthought, again, it was a constructive way to proceed--it was considered \ninsufficient to address the needs of some States, such as my State--\nStates that wanted to make use of the program but were still concerned \nabout the issues I have mentioned--these concerns about Federal \nownership of water, in particular. Fortunately, Senator Reid was \nagreeable to making changes in that language and we were able to adopt \na much-improved version of the amendment just in the last few minutes.\n  The amendment that has now been adopted addresses many of the same \nconservation goals by utilizing two State-based water conservation \nprograms. The first program, which is a water conservation reserve \nprogram, would fund States that submit proposals seeking to enroll land \nin a conservation reserve or to acquire water rights to advance the \ngoals of Federal, State, tribal, or local plans to conserve and protect \nfish and wildlife.\n  The second of the two programs that are provided for in Senator \nReid's new amendment is a water benefits program under which \nparticipating States can develop a plan where willing water users are \noffered assistance or compensation for several different water savings \noptions, such as irrigation efficiency improvements, converting from \nwater-intensive to less water-intensive crops, leasing or selling water \nrights--again, not to the Federal Government, but to the State. Quite \nsimply, the original concept has been converted into two programs that \nare State based and State controlled.\n  Under the new amendment, there is no possibility of the Federal \nGovernment buying or leasing water rights. That is prohibited. The \nremaining Federal role is to review the State proposal to ensure that \nthey fulfill certain general purposes and to prioritize funding between \ncompeting proposals in order to get a State plan implemented.\n  I think it is appropriate that the Federal Government try to provide \nsome assistance to States and to the agricultural community to address \nthese difficult needs that arise when the water needs of farmers \ncompete with the needs of fish and wildlife. This is particularly true \nwhere the conflict is exacerbated by Federal laws, such as the \nEndangered Species Act. There are situations all over the West--in the \nRio Grande Valley in my State, in the Colorado River, all the way to \nthe Columbia River--where States, local water users, Indian tribes, and \nother interested parties are sitting down together and jointly working \nout water allocation issues for the benefit of all involved.\n\n  There is no easy solution. In all of those cases where solutions are \ndeveloped, they cost money. Let me mention a specific situation we have \nin New Mexico. The Pecos River flows southeast through New Mexico to \nthe Texas border. That major river basin is, unfortunately, close to a \nnumber of issues that include endangered species needs, drought, and \nthe interstate compact with Texas that is the subject of existing U.S. \nSupreme Court orders.\n  For all these reasons, our State has had in place a limited program \nto conserve and protect river flows, similar to that contemplated in \nthe amendment Senator Reid offered. The situation now, however, is so \nsevere that local water users, with the help of the State, with the \nState facilitation, have agreed to new measures, including retiring \nwater rights to ensure compliance with existing legal obligations, and \nto avoid having water cut off that is being used for municipal and \nagricultural needs.\n  Let me emphasize that this is a locally driven process. The Federal \nGovernment has not even participated in the discussions. But the \nreality of the new plan, which has been developed locally, is that it \nis going to cost an estimated $68 million. It is unclear and unlikely \nthat our State can put together that level of funding. It is quite \npossible that, through the programs we\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nhave included in this amendment, we could provide a very useful tool to \nNew Mexico and to the Pecos River Basin. Stakeholders in the basin have \nshown they are willing to make tough decisions to avoid even tougher \ntimes in the future. The least we can do is try to provide creative \nways to bring real resources to the table in support of those efforts. \nThat is a reason I supported Senator Reid's amendment.\n  I know my colleague expressed his dismay that I would agree to \nprovide the option for New Mexico to participate in these programs. In \nmy view, it would be foolhardy for our State not to have that option to \nparticipate. There is no mandate that we participate. There is no \nmandate in any of this legislation that any farmer or water user \nparticipate. But having the option to access these resources, in my \nview, makes a great deal of sense.\n  In sum, the amendment Senator Reid proposed, and the Senate adopted, \nmay prove to be a very effective tool in helping our constituents to \ndeal with the serious water issues they now face. Moreover, the \namendment addresses the problems identified by the Farm Bureau and \nother entities regarding the existing section 215.\n  First and foremost, there will be no Federal ownership of State-based \nwater rights as part of the program. Second, the amendment is \nabsolutely clear that the program will be implemented as a State \nprogram, and only implemented if the State chooses for it to be \nimplemented. There will have to be complete compliance with the \nsubstantive and procedural requirements of State water law. Finally, \nalthough the State may choose to use its program to help alleviate \nendangered species conflicts, this is not the sole basis or the \napplication of the program.\n  Other wildlife and habitat improvement programs are also allowable, \nand because any water acquisition will be done by the State, Federal \nactions are limited--something that should alleviate a significant \nnumber of the concerns I mentioned before.\n\n  I believe the statutory language protects the State's laws and \nprerogatives. I believe it protects the prerogatives and rights of \nindividual water users. I believe it can be a very useful tool for my \nState of New Mexico. And if there are still problems with specific \naspects of the language, I am certainly willing to consider working on \nmodifications. But it is my strong impression that this is a program \nthat could be of great benefit to many States in the West, and we \nshould have the option to participate if the State so chooses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the prior order \nbe amended to allow Senator Lugar to speak on the McConnell amendment, \nand when he finishes, we would go into recess for the party \nconferences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McConnell \namendment. For a very small reduction in the planned increases to price \nsupport and loan guarantee rates, two meaningful improvements to the \nFood Stamp Program become possible. A savings, of about $500 million \nover 10 years, is created by reducing rates less than a cent per bushel \nor pound across all crops.\n  The application of this savings to the Food Stamp Program fulfills a \nbipartisan goal to further expand the standard deduction provision in \nthe current Senate farm bill. In determining the amount of family \nincome available for food purchases, all applicant households get the \nsame standard deduction for basic living expenses. As my colleague, \nSenator McConnell points out, the amount, $134 per month, doesn't vary \nby family size and hasn't changed in value for a number of years. Since \nthe size of the standard deduction affects eligibility and benefit \ndecisions, current policy has resulted in an erosion of benefits.\n  There is both widespread and bipartisan support for making \nimprovements in this policy area. The administration's new budget, the \nSenate Agriculture Committee bill, the House nutrition title, my own \nfarm bill proposal, as well as legislation introduced last year by \nSenators Kennedy, Specter, Leahy, Jeffords, Graham, Clinton, Daschle, \nChafee, and Corzine all propose to tie the standard deduction to a \npercentage of the Federal poverty line.\n  Under the Senate farm bill, the standard deduction only reaches 9 \npercent of the poverty line, even when fully phased in. The Bush, Lugar \nand Kennedy-Specter proposals, in contrast, take the standard deduction \nto 10 percent of the poverty line over 10 years. The result is a small \nbenefit increase. A food stamp family of four would get an additional \n$6 per month compared to the current Senate bill.\n  The second food stamp improvement the McConnell amendment makes is to \nmodestly expand benefit access among low-income disabled persons. \nSpecifically, the amendment would raise the asset ceiling for low-\nincome families with a disabled member from $2,000 to $3,000.\n  Three thousand dollars is the asset limit for families with an \nelderly member. Since both the elderly and disabled face limited \nopportunities to replace assets, it is reasonable to have the same \nceiling apply. This provision reduces the need for low-income disabled \npersons to spend down savings before becoming eligible for food stamp \nbenefits.\n  Voting for this amendment is a small gesture that makes a positive \ndifference for many and takes a modest step toward repairing the impact \nof substantial budget cuts sustained by the Food Stamp Program in the \nmid-1990s.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S612-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S612-S653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PILOT EMERGENCY RELIEF PROGRAM TO PROVIDE LIVE LAMB \n                   TO AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       Title II of the Agricultural Trade Development and \n     Assistance Act of 1954 (7 U.S.C. 1721 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 209. PILOT EMERGENCY RELIEF PROGRAM TO PROVIDE LIVE \n                   LAMB TO AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The President may establish a pilot \n     emergency relief program under this title to provide live \n     lamb to Afghanistan on behalf of the people of the United \n     States.\n       ``(b) Report.--Not later than January 1, 2004, the \n     Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that--\n       ``(1)(A) evaluates the success of the program under \n     subsection (a); or\n       ``(B) if the program has not succeeded or has not been \n     implemented, explains in detail why the program has not \n     succeeded or has not been implemented; and\n       ``(2) discusses the feasibility and desirability of \n     providing assistance in the form of live animals.''.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I will refrain from most of my debate until\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\nlater. I will give a brief explanation of what the bill does.\n  It is a pilot project to provide lamb to Afghanistan. Wyoming has the \nAir National Guard that has the capability of moving livestock from the \nUnited States to Afghanistan, and there are several other units in the \nUnited States. It provides the USDA, from among current funds, to \npurchase a pilot project in lamb and ship it by way of military \ntransport to Afghanistan.\n  We have heard the story, give a person a fish, it will feed them for \na day; teach a person to fish, it will feed them for a lifetime. This \nis in that category. This is the opportunity to build up their herds. \nThey do not have much refrigeration. They can use the herd, grow the \nherd, and the production from the herd can be used for food, and it can \nbe butchered at the time they need it, so there is no refrigeration \nproblem.\n  We think it will solve a lot of problems. The amendment is wide open \nfor how extensive the pilot project could be. It does call for a report \nin January of 2004 to explain whether it worked or did not work, \nwhether it was implemented or not, and if it was not implemented, to \nexplain why it was not implemented.\n  The idea is very simple. We should ship live lamb to Afghanistan not \nonly to assist the numerous tribes in rebuilding their flocks of sheep, \nbut to provide immediate protein to their diets.\n  My amendment would authorize the President to study the feasibility \nof sending live lamb to Afghanistan. My amendment requires the \nPresident to report to Congress on the feasibility of a pilot live lamb \nprogram. The report would include information on the cost and the \nlogistics of the program. A favorable report could begin a series of \nshipments to Afghanistan, while an unfavorable report would lead us to \nre-evaluate how the program could succeed. Because this program only \nmandates a report, it is budget neutral.\n  The continued need for food in Afghanistan is great. We are all well-\nacquainted with the unique problems facing food aid to Afghanistan. The \ncountry's northern terrain is mountainous. Few roads traverse the area. \nThe number of roads is even smaller when you consider that food, \ntypically grain, is hauled in large trucks. These trucks require \npassable roads. Lastly, we have to consider the high altitude of \nAfghanistan. Much like my own State, winter in Afghanistan shuts down \npassage on all mountain roads. The only option is to consider moving \nfood aid through the gentler southern landscape. After a brief glance \nat the countries on Afghanistan's southern border, we know that we \ncouldn't depend on them as ports of entry to ship food aid to \nAfghanistan.\n  The idea to ship live lamb to Afghanistan originated when I was \nconsidering the great obstacles that prevented trucks from delivering \nfood aid to the interior of Afghanistan. But, if we couldn't move the \nfood, why couldn't the food move itself? Live lamb was the natural \nanswer.\n  Lamb has been a traditional part of the diet for the people of the \nregion for many years and has no religious prohibitions. Once the lamb \narrives at the edge or in the region, it can easily be distributed to \nthe needy area on foot or by truck. Sheep are well known for their \nagility and ability to adapt to mountainous regions. Once the lambs are \ndistributed, the families, themselves, can decide how and when to \nslaughter the lambs or even use the lambs to build up their family \nstock.\n  Now here in America, most parents wouldn't be comfortable \nslaughtering a lamb in the back yard. Most families in Afghanistan \ndon't receive their meat on a styrofoam platter in Saran wrap from the \ngrocery store. They are very comfortable slaughtering their own \nlivestock for sustenance in very traditional ways.\n  In an effort to ensure this program would be handled correctly, I did \ngive USAID, United States Agency for International Development, an \nopportunity to view an earlier version of the amendment that mandated \nthe program. USAID raised a few concerns to the amendment. One concern \nis that lamb would not provide the same caloric value per dollar as \ngrain. In response to this and other concerns, I scaled the amendment \nback to a study. I realize the importance of getting as many calories \nas possible across the ocean and to the Afghan people today, but \nmy amendment looks ahead to the future. While we address the immediate \nneeds of the Afghan people, we cannot ignore the fact that the people \nneed long-term assistance.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a simple idea with a great possibility of \nbenefits for the Afghan people. Congress, and all Americans, are \nworking to assist the Afghan people in the development of a stronger \nand long-lasting stable government.\n  As we are all too aware, the people of Afghanistan have suffered over \ntwo decades of turmoil, nearly 4 years of drought, and the oppressive \nrule of the Taliban regime. Even before 2001, Afghanistan had the worst \nnutrition situation in the world and the highest maternal mortality \nrate. Nearly one-fifth of Afghans depend on humanitarian aid for \nsurvival. In the last year, the situation has gotten even worse.\n  I am pleased that the United States has been a staunch supporter of \nthe Afghan people and a large contributor of humanitarian aid. In fact, \nsince 1979 the United States has contributed more than $1 billion in \nhumanitarian assistance to the Afghan people. The United States has \nrepresented about two-thirds of the total contribution of the \ninternational community. I believe this amendment continues our history \nof providing aid where it is needed.\n  The uniqueness of sending live lamb could open the doors for other \nareas of aid as well. My amendment does not require the program to be \ncarried out, nor does it put additional burdens on the budget, it \nsimply calls for a study. The study of a program that could have an \nimpact on so many people should be supported.\n  I know my colleagues are aware of the amounts of aid we are already \nsending to Afghanistan. I am aware that there remain some concerns \nabout how we can send live lamb half-way around the world. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this amendment in order to explore new \nstrategies of providing a long-term aid to the people of Afghanistan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2847 to Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

This amendment is a modified version of the amendment \nI offered last week to reform the EQIP program. The central argument \nagainst my amendment last week had to do with a size limitation. What \nthis amendment does is speak to some of the concerns of my colleagues, \nbut it still is very much a reform amendment.\n  No. 1, it would lower the payment limits from $50,000 per year to \n$30,000 per year with the EQIP program. Right now, it is only $10,000 a \nyear. This is very consistent with the vote last week on payment \nlimitations.\n  No. 2, it would prevent producers with an interest in more than one \nlarge CAFO from receiving more than one EQIP contract. This is the \nwhole idea of conglomerates owning many of these CAFOs and receiving \nmultiple subsidies. Again, we want to try to get support to our midsize \nproducers, our family farmers.\n  No. 3, it would require producers receiving the EQIP funds to have a \ncomprehensive nutrient management plan, environmental plan.\n  These are simple measures that I think make the EQIP program have \nmore, if you will, policy integrity. I think it is very consistent with \nwhat we have been doing with the farm bill. The last amendment I \nintroduced was a close vote. I think there are now Senators who will \nsupport this amendment.\n  We have the support of, among different organizations, the National \nFarmers Union, the Environmental Working Group, the Land Stewardship \nProject, Center for Rural Affairs, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil, Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, U.S. PIRG, and Campaign for \nFamily Farms and the Environment.\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\n  I think this is a good reform amendment, and I will wait for further \ndebate on the amendment, but I wanted to lay it down now. I ask \nunanimous consent the amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2848 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Phil Gramm of Texas. I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PENALTIES AND FOREIGN COMMERCE PROVISIONS OF THE \n                   ANIMAL WELFARE ACT.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, my amendment will clarify once and for all \nany question about rats, mice and birds used for medical research under \nthe Animal Welfare Act. Approval of this amendment will make sure that \nnone of the important work taking place in the medical research \ncommunity will be delayed, made more expensive, or be otherwise \ncompromised by regulatory shenanigans on the part of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  Specifically, this amendment will follow Congressional intent by \nexcluding rats, mice and birds from the definition of ``animal'' under \nthe Animal\n\n[[Page S617]]\n\nWelfare Act. This has been the established practice of USDA during the \nmore than 30 years that the Animal Welfare Act has been the law of the \nland during which time scientists and researchers have developed \nextensive protocols based on current regulatory procedures based on \nthat Act.\n  So, the medical research community was astonished the U.S. Department \nof Agriculture, weary and browbeat into submission by numerous lawsuits \nand petitions by the so-called ``animal rights'' crowd, gave notice of \nits intent to add rats, mice, and birds under the regulatory umbrella. \nI hasten to add that 90 percent of the mice, rats, and birds used in \nanimal research are already being regulated by the NIH Office of \nLaboratory Animal Welfare and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  But that is not enough for the professional activists who delight in \ncreating mischievous controversies like this. The problem, however, is \nthat their mischief-making in this case has serious real-life \ncomplications for the life-saving research in laboratories all over \nAmerica. The paperwork burden alone is extraordinary: If USDA is \nallowed to move forward with their new rules, it is estimated that the \nadditional reporting requirements and paperwork will cost the \nresearchers up to $280 million annually.\n  So instead of searching for cures for breast cancer, cystic fibrosis, \nheart disease, and diabetes, USDA will force researchers out of the \nlaboratory to spend their time filling out countless forms for yet \nanother federal regulator. This unnecessary paperwork will simply \ndemonstrate what the federal government already knows: that animal \nresearchers already treat research animals in a professional and humane \nmanner.\n  A rodent could do a lot worse than live out its life span in research \nfacilities. I was surprised to learn from the Wall Street Journal that \nmore than 10 times as many rodents are raised and sold as food for \nreptiles than are used by the medical research community. But nobody \nraises a point about that. I wonder if anyone in the Chamber has ever \nseen a hungry python eat a mouse. If you have, then you know it is not \na pretty picture for the mouse. Isn't it far better for the mouse to be \nfed and watered in a clean laboratory than to end up as a tiny bulge \nbeing digested inside an enormous snake?\n  I suspect Mrs. Helms would have a word or two for me if I forgot to \nphone the exterminator upon finding evidence that a mouse has taken up \nresidence in our basement. Alas, extermination remains the fate every \nyear of hundreds of thousands of rodents that have not found the \nrelative safety of a research laboratory.\n\n  It is anything but a joking matter when regulatory heavy-handedness \nprevents researchers who are working diligently to find cures for \ndeadly diseases. Consider the following recent medical discoveries in \nwhich humane animal research has played a role:\n  Breast cancer researchers learned recently that laboratory rats that \nare fed high-fiber diets develop significantly fewer breast tumors than \nrats receiving little or no fiber.\n  Asthma researchers recently used transgenic mice to isolate a \nspecific gene that plays a key role in causing human asthma, and have \nnow developed an animal model to test new asthma treatments.\n  Scientists are aggressively studying rats to learn more about \nrecovery of motor skills after spinal cord injuries, and are already \nreporting advances in knowledge about the relationship between motor \nfunctions and the nerve cells that send signals to motor neurons.\n  There are dozens of other such examples of the medical advances made \nas a result of animal research, and I feel a sense of outrage, \npersonally, that a Federal agency would now try to make it more \ndifficult to accomplish this important work that will benefit humanity.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope the Senate will resist the extremism of \nactivists and deliver a richly deserved rebuke to the methods of these \npeople who are protesting so mightily. It is time to definitively \nsettle this matter, to end the debate, and to approve the pending \namendment, thereby allowing scientists to return to the laboratory \nwithout the specter of burdensome new Federal regulations to hamstring \ntheir research.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At this time there is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, thank you very much. I understand that the \nrequest for the yeas and nays will be made in my absence by the \nmanagers of the bill and others. I have been assured, I assume, we will \nhave a rollcall vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2851 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, Senator Domenici proposes a different \nformula for dairy payments. I will discuss the issue for a few minutes \nbefore laying the amendment aside for further debate.\n\n[[Page S618]]\n\n  Some in the Senate have decided to provide $2 billion in payments to \ndairy farmers over the next 5 years. However, there is considerable \ndisparity in the way these payments will be distributed under the \nDaschle substitute.\n  The Daschle substitute establishes different payment rates, different \ntarget prices, and different payments for a handful of States.\n  The Daschle substitute would provide 25 percent of the producer \npayments to producers in States that account for only 18 percent of our \nNation's milk.\n  There is no sound policy reason for this disparity.\n  Senator Domenici has asked that we look specifically at New Mexico. \nUnder the current proposal, New Mexico would average about 6 cents per \nhundredweight on milk, while producers in Maine would average almost 90 \ncents.\n  A 1,000-cow herd in New Mexico would receive from zero, in a low \nmarket scenario, to $22,000. If this same farm were located in New \nYork, for example, these numbers could be far higher.\n  Dairy farmers work in a national market. Dairy farmers not only sell \nproducts nationally, but they buy supplies and services nationally.\n  Dairy farmers from all over the country go to an auction in Indiana \nto buy heifers for their herds. Under the pending bill, a farmer from \nPennsylvania will be able to pay more for heifers than a farmer from \nIndiana because of the Federal Government has given the Pennsylvania \nfarmer a financial advantage in this transaction.\n\n  Senator Domenici proposes that we distribute this $2 billion in an \nequitable manner under a program that is national in scope. Under his \namendment, every dairy producer, regardless of where they milk, is \ntreated the same.\n  Under his proposal, producers in 36 States will receive more than \nwhat they would receive under the Daschle substitute.\n  The amendment is relatively simple. It would provide producers with \none annual payment over the next 5 years.\n  Defining a target price and payment rate would also be difficult \nunder the Daschle procedures. Prices are announced for different \nclasses for different regions using different tests.\n  To simplify payments, the Domenici amendment proposes to level out \nthe payment with one rate, paid annually on all of a producer's milk. \nEstimates show 31.5 cents would cover all of the milk nationwide. The \n$2 billion cap would force the Secretary to adjust in the final year to \nmake sure the amount is not exceeded.\n  A fixed payment is not only more cost effective to administer, but it \nwill provide predictability in a volatile price market. Producers will \nbe able to plan. If it is already a ``good year,'' producers can set \nthe payment aside for future years that may not be so good or pay down \ndebt to better weather future economic storms.\n  On behalf of Senator Domenici, I urge my colleagues to carefully \nconsider the ramifications for dairy farmers in their States and to \nvote in favor of the Domenici amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I lay an amendment on the desk with \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that we believe will help ease \nthe transition from the peanut quota system to the new market-oriented \nprogram.\n  This amendment would increase the compensation for quota holders from \n10 cents per pound to 11 cents per pound.\n  This amendment that we offer today--the Cleland-Miller-Helms \namendment--will go a long way to help citizens in more than 15 States \nmake the transition to the new peanut program.\n  I may be back later, Mr. President, if further debate is needed on \nthis amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I applaud the Senators from Georgia for \ntheir advocacy on behalf of some of the people who sent them here: \nthose who are growers of peanuts. I tell you, the two Senators from \nGeorgia--Senator Cleland and Senator Miller--have been very determined \nadvocates on behalf of the farmers they represent.\n  I just hope the people back home realize how much energy and effort \nthe two Senators have expended to secure what is needed to help their \npeople.\n  Senator Miller, who is a very respected member of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, and Senator Cleland, who had a distinguished \nrecord of service in Washington before he ever came to the Senate and \nis respected on both sides of the aisle, have made very clear how \nimportant this is to their constituents.\n  I salute them for their vigorous efforts.\n  Mr. President, I rose to speak on another matter, and that is the \nfundamental challenge we face with this farm bill.\n  I see in the press repeated indications that farm assistance is no \nlonger needed. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  What these media critics seem to fail to realize is that our people \nare faced with major competition in the world.\n  Our major competitors are the Europeans. They are providing over $300 \nan acre of support per year to their producers. We provide $38. We are \nbeing outgunned nearly 10 to 1. On export support, the Europeans \naccount for 84 percent of all the world's export subsidy; we account \nfor 3 percent. They are outgunning us nearly 30 to 1.\n\n[[Page S619]]\n\n  The fundamental question before this country is whether or not we are \ngoing to fight for our people, whether or not we are going to give them \na fair, fighting chance.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 2:50 having arrived, debate on the \ncurrent amendment is suspended to allow other amendments to be called \nup.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2834 To Amendment No. 2471\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to offer \namendment No. 2834 which I believe is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2834 to amendment No. 2471.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nauthorize the establishment of a new voluntary organic research and \npromotion program. Just over a year ago we finalized the National \nOrganic Program Rule. As this rule is implemented, it will provide \nassurance to the American public that the organic food they buy is \nsubject to strict and consistent regulation. In addition, this rule \nwill assist organic producers who want to export their products and \nwill ensure that imported organic agricultural commodities meet \nstandards on par with those of the United States.\n  In the decade that this rule was under development, the organic \nindustry has experienced tremendous growth rates of more than 20 \npercent annually--it was estimated that in 2001 sales topped $9 \nbillion.\n  As this industry continues to develop, it is important to adapt \nexisting programs to support and enhance organic agriculture, as well \nas provide equitable benefits to organic producers. Currently, organic \nfarmers are required to pay into existing mandatory research and \npromotion programs for various commodities. Many organic farmers object \nto this because they believe insufficient checkoff program funds are \ndevoted to promoting or assisting in the development of organic \nagriculture. While they would prefer to be exempt from those \nassessments entirely, my amendment offers a viable and fair \nalternative.\n  My amendment authorizes a new voluntary organic research and \npromotion checkoff program, which will only be established if it is \nproposed and approved by a majority of certified organic producers and \nhandlers.\n  What distinguishes this from existing checkoff programs is that any \nassessments under the order would be voluntary, not mandatory--\nindividual farmers will have the flexibility to opt-in or opt-out of \nthis research and promotion program.\n  To avoid double taxation, producers who choose to contribute to the \norganic order would be entitled to a credit against assessments under \nanother order--which is similar to the credit producers are entitled to \nunder existing checkoff programs if they contribute to a state or \nregional order covering the same commodity.\n  Additional provisions in the amendment address concerns raised about \nexisting checkoff programs--representatives on the board must reflect \nboth the regional distribution and differing scales of organic \nproduction and, at least once every four years, a referendum on the \ncontinuance of the order must be held.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, which simply \ngives organic farmers the opportunity to choose how their research and \npromotion dollars are spent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

As I understand the floor situation--I will consult with \nmy ranking member--with the hour of 3 rapidly approaching, under the \nunanimous consent agreement previously entered into, all amendments to \nthe pending S. 1731 have to be offered prior to 3 o'clock this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I respond to my colleague that that is our understanding. \nHopefully, this colloquy will serve as an announcement to all of our \ncolleagues who may be listening to the debate, wherever they may be, \nthat they should proceed rapidly to the floor. Three o'clock is the \ncutoff time for the introduction of amendments. On our side of the \naisle, we have attempted to make that known in many ways. I am hopeful \nthat at least no one will be under any other illusion.

Mr. President, let me explain the amendment very briefly. \nI apologize to the Senator from Georgia.\n  All this does is take the peanut program, which is a dramatically \nchanged program, and delay its implementation for a period of 1 year. \nHere is the problem we have. If we don't do that, we will have the \nfarmers not knowing, when they go to the bank, what kind of program is \ngoing to be adopted right in the middle of their planting season.

BEAR PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Bear \n     Protection Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown \n     bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant \n     panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or \n     II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087;

and\n       (B) the wild Asian bear population has declined \n     significantly in recent years as a result of habitat loss and \n     poaching due to a strong demand for bear viscera used in \n     traditional medicines and cosmetics;\n       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed \n     that American bears have been poached for their viscera;\n       (5) while most American black bear populations are \n     generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could \n     stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the \n     demand for bear viscera increases; and\n       (6) prohibitions against the importation into the United \n     States and exportation from the United States, as well as \n     prohibitions against the interstate trade, of bear viscera \n     and products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, bear viscera will assist in ensuring that the \n     United States does not contribute to the decline of any bear \n     population as a result of the commercial trade in bear \n     viscera.\n       (c) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to ensure the \n     long-term viability of the world's 8 bear species by--\n       (1) prohibiting interstate and international trade in bear \n     viscera and products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, bear viscera;\n       (2) encouraging bilateral and multilateral efforts to \n     eliminate such trade;

and\n       (B) is authorized by a valid permit issued under Appendix I \n     or II of CITES, in any case in which such a permit is \n     required under CITES.\n       (f) Penalties and Enforcement.--\n       (1) Criminal penalties.--A person that knowingly violates \n     subsection (e) shall be fined under title 18, United States \n     Code, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       (2) Civil penalties.--\n       (A) Amount.--A person that knowingly violates subsection \n     (e) may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not \n     more than $25,000 for each violation.\n       (B) Manner of assessment and collection.--A civil penalty \n     under this paragraph shall be assessed, and may be collected, \n     in the manner in which a civil penalty under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 may be\n\n[[Page S621]]\n\n     assessed and collected under section 11(a) of that Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 1540(a)).\n       (3) Seizure and forfeiture.--Any bear viscera or any \n     product, item, or substance imported, exported, sold, \n     bartered, attempted to be imported, exported, sold, or \n     bartered, offered for sale or barter, purchased, possessed, \n     transported, delivered, or received in violation of this \n     subsection (including any regulation issued under this \n     subsection) shall be seized and forfeited to the United \n     States.\n       (4) Regulations.--After consultation with the Secretary of \n     the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative, the \n     Secretary shall issue such regulations as are necessary to \n     carry out this subsection.\n       (5) Enforcement.--The Secretary, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, and the Secretary of the department in which the \n     Coast Guard is operating shall enforce this subsection in the \n     manner in which the Secretaries carry out enforcement \n     activities under section 11(e) of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1540(e)).\n       (6) Use of penalty amounts.--Amounts received as penalties, \n     fines, or forfeiture of property under this subsection shall \n     be used in accordance with section 6(d) of the Lacey Act \n     Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3375(d)).\n       (g) Discussions Concerning Bear Conservation and the Bear \n     Parts Trade.--In order to seek to establish coordinated \n     efforts with other countries to protect bears, the Secretary \n     shall continue discussions concerning trade in bear viscera \n     with--\n       (1) the appropriate representatives of Parties to CITES; \n     and\n       (2) the appropriate representatives of countries that are \n     not parties to CITES and that are determined by the Secretary \n     and the United States Trade Representative to be the leading \n     importers, exporters, or consumers of bear viscera.\n       (h) Certain Rights Not Affected.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (e), nothing in this section affects--\n       (1) the regulation by any State of the bear population of \n     the State; or\n       (2) any hunting of bears that is lawful under applicable \n     State law (including regulations).\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nlaid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2832\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am fortunate to hold the seat of one of \nthis Chamber's giants, Senator Richard B. Russell. Senator Russell \nunderstood the importance of strong agriculture policy and he once \nobserved: ``when we strengthen American agriculture, we strengthen \nAmerica.'' The failure of the Senate to complete a farm bill in 2001 \nwas very disappointment to me. But the good news is that I believe we \nwill pass a strong farm bill this week.\n  One of the hottest issues in the farm bill for Georgia is the change \nin the current peanut program. Because there are not enough votes to \nsustain the quota program in Congress and because trade agreements have \nweakened quotas, I reluctantly agree with my colleagues that the system \nwill be changed.\n  I visited south Georgia this past weekend where the debate over the \nending the quota program is big news. The proposed peanut program that \noriginated in the House, bases the new program on acres determined by \npeanut producers, rather than by the landowning quota-holders. \nThis shift in the peanut program, from the landowner to the producer, \nhas caused a split among neighbors in south Georgia not seen in many \nyears. Despite this split, I think we should make note of a fact that \nSenator Miller has mentioned more than once on this floor: The anti-\npeanut program forces have not been out in force this year. You may \nknow that in 1996, the peanut program survived in the Senate by only \nthree votes.\n\n  I have concerns about small quota-owners, such as widows, veterans, \nand minority farmers who depend on quotas for their income. They should \nnot be forgotten in the rush for a new farm bill. For that reason, I \noffer this amendment with Senator Miller to increase the quota buyout \nto 12 cents a pound, each year, for 5 years. This is up from the House \nbuyout of 10 cents per pound and will help ease the transition for \nthousands of retired peanut farmers who invested in peanut quota as, in \neffect, their pension plan.\n  I will work to keep the Senate level of support for producers which \nis $400 million over the House bill for marketing loan rates and \ncountercyclical payments. Also, the Senate farm bill contains language \nthat I have sponsored for years to label the country-of-origin for \npeanuts. Because consumers should know where their peanuts are grown.\n  All in all I believe we will pass a strong farm bill that makes sense \nand substantial progress in meeting the needs of family farmers and our \nrural communities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to both Senator Lugar and \nSenator Harkin, the two managers of the bill. It has been cleared. I \nask unanimous consent that at 3:05 p.m. today, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Feinstein amendment No. 2829; that the time until \n3:35, a half hour, be equally divided and controlled by Senators \nFeinstein and Breaux, or their designees; that at 3:35, Senator Breaux \nbe recognized to offer a motion to table, and that no second-degree \namendment be in order prior to the vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2855 to Amendment No. 2842\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Kyl, I send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], for Mr. Kyl, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2855.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that the water conservation program is implemented \n                in accordance with all applicable laws)\n\n       On page 8, line 19, insert the following:\n       ``(12) Implementation.--In carrying out the program, the \n     Secretary shall--\n       ``(A) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the \n     program does not undermine the implementation of any law in \n     effect as of the date of enactment of this chapter that \n     concerns the transfer or acquisition of water or water rights \n     on a permanent basis;\n       ``(B) implement the program in accordance with the purposes \n     of such laws described in subparagraph (A) as are applicable; \n     and\n       ``(C) comply with--\n       ``(i) all interstate compacts, court decrees, and Federal \n     or State laws (including regulations) that may affect water \n     or water rights; and\n       ``(ii) all procedural and substantive State water law.\n       On page 8, line 19, strike ``(12)'' and insert ``(13)''.\n       On page 9, line 16, strike ``(13)'' and insert ``(14)''.\n       On page 17, line 20, insert the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--Nothing in this section--\n       On page 17, line 21, strike ``(1)'' and insert ``(A)''.\n       On page 17, line 22, strike ``(2)'' and insert ``(B)''.\n       On page 18, line 1, strike ``(3)'' and insert ``(C)''.\n       On page 18, line 5, strike ``(4)'' and insert ``(D)''.\n       On page 18, line 7, insert the following:\n       ``(2) Implementation.--In carrying out the program, the \n     Secretary shall--\n       ``(A) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the \n     program does not undermine the implementation of any law in \n     effect as of the date of enactment of this chapter that \n     concerns the transfer or acquisition of water or water rights \n     on a permanent basis;\n       ``(B) implement the program in accordance with the purposes \n     of such laws described in subparagraph (A) as are applicable; \n     and\n       ``(C) comply with--\n       ``(i) all interstate compacts, court decrees, and Federal \n     or State laws (including regulations) that may affect water \n     or water rights; and\n       ``(ii) all procedural and substantive State water law.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I will not \nobject, but there comes a point where we say 3 p.m.--well, is it 3 p.m. \nor 3:02 or 3:05? I hope we don't have a rush of amendments on either \nside coming in.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the comment of my colleague. \nHe is correct, obviously.

I thank Senator Reid, and I thank Senators Harkin and \nLugar as well.\n  On Friday, I offered an amendment to the sugar program, which really \nis a minor amendment, with one exception. It seems anything that has \nanything to do with the sugar program is frozen and can't be changed. \nAs I noted 6 years ago when I came here, the sugar program works to the \ngreat detriment of America's domestic sugar refineries.\n  The largest of those domestic sugar refineries happens to be in \nCalifornia. It is C Sugar. C got most of its sugar from Hawaii, and \nthey used to have ads as I grew up: C pure cane sugar from Hawaii. It \nis a plant that can employ about 1,300 people. It can refine about \n800,000 pounds of sugar. It is a union plant. It is the only source of \nemployment, the major source of employment, in a small town in the East \nBay known as Crockett. You drive over the Carquinez Bridge and you see \nthis big old plant, and that is from where this wonderful sugar comes.\n  The problem has been, year after year, C cannot buy enough sugar to \nrefine. Why? Because the allotments in the sugar program were more than \ntwo decades ago. They do not adequately reflect who is buying and who \nis selling sugar at the time.\n  The amendment I have offered would simply reallocate the unfilled \nportion of a country's quota when that country does not fulfill its \nquota. That is all it does. This is less than 3 percent of the sugar. \nAbout 3 percent of the sugar on the world market that is provided for \nin the allocation quota does not get allocated. So on a first-come-\nfirst-served basis, a company that wanted to buy sugar would be able to \nbecause the unused allocation of one country would go to another \ncountry that is exporting sugar, and on a first-come-first-served basis \nthe refineries of our country would have an opportunity to buy their \nsugar.\n  This amendment is supported by C Sugar; Colonial Sugar Gramercy, \nLA; Savannah Foods in Port Wentworth, GA; and Imperial Sugar in Sugar \nLand, TX.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters be printed in the Record in \nsupport of the amendment, one from the Coalition for Sugar Reform and \nthe other from Citizens Against Government Waste.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Coalition for Sugar Reform,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Coalition for Sugar Reform, \n     I urge you to vote for an amendment that Sen. Dianne \n     Feinstein will offer to ensure that when the United States \n     announces an import quota for sugar, we actually import all \n     that quota.\n       Each year, a few countries fail to fully utilize, or fill, \n     their quotas to sell sugar to the United States. Generally, \n     these amounts go unused: Because of the highly restrictive \n     import policy that the United States maintains for sugar, \n     other sugar-producing countries have no opportunity to \n     satisfy the unmet market need represented by the unfilled \n     quota. The Feinstein amendment will require that by June 1 \n     each year, any unused quota be reallocated among qualified \n     supplying countries on a first-come, first-served basis.\n       This amendment does not increase import quotas. It merely \n     says that when we announce an import quota, we will allow the \n     full amount of that quota to be imported.\n       This amendment honors our multilateral trade commitments by \n     allowing the full import quota to enter the United States. By \n     setting an example of more efficient and transparent TRQ \n     administration, the amendment advances explicit trade policy \n     goals of the United States. Please support and vote for the \n     Feinstein amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Lawrence T. Graham,\n     Steering Committee Coordinator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Council for Citizens\n\n\n                                     Against Government Waste,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the more than one \n     million members and supporters of the Council for Citizens \n     Against Government Waste (CCAGW), I am writing to inform you \n     of our support for your amendment to S. 1731, the Farm Bill, \n     which would ensure that when the United States announces an \n     import quota for sugar, all of that quota will actually be \n     imported.\n       When countries fail to fully utilize their quotas to sell \n     sugar to the United States, those quotas usually end up being \n     unused. Other sugar-producing countries have no opportunity \n     to satisfy the unmet market need represented by the unfilled \n     quota, as a result of the highly restricted import policy \n     that the United States maintains for sugar.\n       It is our understanding that your amendment will require \n     that by June 1 of each year, any unused quota be reallocated \n     among qualified supplying countries on a first-come first-\n     served basis. While we also understand that your amendment \n     does not increase import quotas, it will at least ensure that \n     the full amount of the quota be imported.\n       Athough CCAGW would still prefer the complete elimination \n     of the archaic sugar program, we believe your amendment will \n     at least provide for modest improvement of one of its glaring \n     deficiencies. Thus, CCAGW will consider a vote on your \n     amendment in the 2002 Congressional Ratings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Schatz,\n                                                        President.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The fact of the matter is, this has been done. The \nSecretary can do this. As a matter of fact, in 1995 I implored \nSecretary Glickman to do just this, and he did it. The problem, I say \nto those opposed to this amendment, is that every year you have to go \nand lobby; every year you have to try to see that this company and \nothers similar to it are able to get enough sugar. That is not right. \nSugar programs should not operate this way.\n  Awhile ago, we asked GAO to take a look at the sugar program. The GAO \ncame up with exactly what we are proposing today. Let me read a couple \nof things. Some of the 40 designated countries have been provided an \nexport allocation when they no longer export sugar. According to the \nGAO, on average, from 1993 to 1998, 10 out of the 40 countries were net \nimporters of sugar. These countries are not exporting sugar because \nclearly they are importing sugar.\n  Some countries have similar allocations under the quota despite \ndramatically different levels of sugar exports. For example, Brazil and \nthe Philippines are both allowed to export around 14 percent of the \ntotal quota, but Brazil exports 21 times more sugar than the \nPhilippines worldwide.\n  In my view, it is unacceptable that sugar quota allocations have not \nbeen revised for two decades, despite dramatic changes in the ability \nof many countries to produce and export sugar.\n  Is there a way to update the sugar export amounts allowed into the \nUnited States without adversely impacting domestic growers? I believe \nthere is, and the amendment I have offered would provide this change.\n  Incidentally, I would like the Record to reflect that Senator Gregg \nis a cosponsor of this amendment, if I may.\n  The United States has imported on average, as I said, about 3 percent \nless sugar than the quota allowed from 1996 through 1998 because some \ncountries did not fill their allocations.\n  Now the question was asked in the caucus today by the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana, What would happen to price if this amendment \nwere passed?\n  Let me again quote the GAO:\n\n       USTR's current process for allocating the sugar tariff-rate \n     quota does not ensure that all of the sugar allowed under the \n     quota reaches the U.S. market.\n       The current allocation has resulted in fewer sugar imports \n     than allowed under the tariff-rate quota. From 1996 through \n     1998, US raw sugar imports averaged about 75,000 tons less \n     annually than the amount USDA allowed USTR to allocate under \n     the tariff-rate quota.\n\n  The final quote from the GAO is this:\n\n       Because the shortfalls in the tariff-rate quota reduced US \n     sugar supplies by less than 1 percent, they had a minimal \n     effect on the domestic price of sugar.\n\n  So what I am saying is you can have a system that allows domestic \nrefineries to buy sugar that they need from countries that are not \nusing their allocated quota, and this will have a very slight, if any, \nmark on the domestic price of sugar. What is dreadfully unfair is to \nhave a situation where domestic refineries, hiring men and women who \nlive in this country, that want to refine sugar are prevented from \ndoing so by a bill where the allocations and the quotas have not been \nrevised in two decades.\n  So I am asking the Senate to please permit this small change in the \nsugar program.\n\n[[Page S623]]\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, let me assure my colleagues who might be \nlistening to this rather arcane and complicated debate, I have the \nutmost respect for the Senator from California to the point of \ndisagreeing with her on the fact that this is a minor amendment. I \nthink that nothing my colleague from California does is minor. It is \nalways a major effort, and she is to be commended for what she is \nattempting to do for one refinery in California.\n  I point out that over the last 10 years, in my own State of \nLouisiana, we have lost 24 sugar mills. We did not try to change the \nsugar program to accommodate each one of those mills but, rather, tried \nto work in a cooperative fashion to have a national program.\n  The Senator is absolutely correct that about 40 countries around the \nworld have allocations to be able to export approximately 1.25 million \ntons of sugar into the United States to make sure we have enough sugar \nfor domestic consumption. If a country does not use all of their \nallocation, it can be reallocated by the Secretary. It does not have to \nbe. The Secretary makes a determination on what amount of sugar we need \nto fulfill the mandates of the program. If we do need more sugar, and \ncountries have not used their allocation, the Secretary can give to a \ncountry an additional allocation.\n  The difference at this point between what the Senator from California \nwants to do and the existing program is that they have to reallocate it \nand bring it into the United States under the terms of the program. It \ncannot be said to one country that they are going to be the only \ncountry in the world that is going to be able to bring sugar in to the \nUnited States with an allocation that does not comply with the terms of \nthe sugar program. All of the 40 countries that send sugar to the \nUnited States have to come in under the terms of the program, and that \nis at a price that equals about 18 cents a pound. If there is 50 pounds \nof unallocated sugar and it is said to any country in the world, come \nin and bid for the right to send that sugar to the United States, they \ncan bid the price down to a point that would have a substantial effect \non the market.\n  This amendment, if it went into effect, and large amounts of sugar \nwere brought in outside of the program, could ultimately result in a \nlarge cost to the taxpayer. If it drives down the average price of \nsugar below the market loan rate, sugar will be forfeited to the \nFederal Government and taxpayers will be picking up sugar--because the \nprice has gone below the marketing loan--at about 18 cents a pound.\n\n  I don't think I have any problem giving the Secretary the right to \nreallocate sugar, which they now have when there is a shortfall, but \nnot to do it outside of the program. Not to say to all of the countries \nthat participate, you have to do it one way, but other countries, when \nwe reallocate, you can do it without having to meet the terms of the \nloan itself. The Department does not have to reallocate; they do it if \nthere is a need for the sugar.\n  The amendment of the Senator from California mandates they \nreallocate, although it is not required in order to meet our domestic \nneeds. In addition, she would mandate they allow it come in outside the \nprogram.\n  We cannot design a national program for one refinery. I point out the \nrefineries that make sugar are very divided on this issue. For those \nwho do support our amendment, there is an equal number or more who do \nnot. The Domino Sugar refinery in New York opposes it; the Domino \nrefinery in Brooklyn, NY, opposes it; the Domino refinery in Baltimore, \nMD, opposes it, as well as the refinery in Chalmette, LA.\n  The problem is there is a national program. The reason one refinery \nin one State does not have enough sugar is because their principal \nmarket has been Hawaii. As the Senator has correctly said, Hawaii is \nmoving out of the sugar program. They have reduced their production of \nsugar, and that refinery does not find itself with a sufficient amount \nof sugar. But you cannot redesign the entire national program for one \nparticular refinery and say we are going to let sugar come in to this \none refinery outside of the program, with no price protection whatever, \nand put the entire program in jeopardy, with potential costs to the \nU.S. taxpayers. If it has the effect of driving the price below the \nloan level, sugar will be forfeited.\n  It is very important to note that the program is operated at no cost \nto the taxpayer. We have no forfeited sugar. We do not want to be in a \nposition of forfeiting sugar. If this amendment were to pass and we \nmandated that the Secretary reallocate sugar imported into this country \noutside the program, which is what it does, on a first-come-first-\nserved basis, would not have to meet the terms of the program. So a \ncompany could bid and bring in sugar at 5 cents a pound if they wanted \nto dump in this market. That is what the amendment allows.\n  I don't mind having it come in under the terms of the program, but to \nallow sugar to come in and be reallocated outside the terms of the \nprogram with regard to price potentially destroys the program and would \nbe at a cost to the American taxpayer.\n  At the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to table the \namendment. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. Our intent in drafting the \namendment was that the sugar that comes in is within the program, not \noutside the program. But only 40 countries now covered by the program \nare eligible to participate. If there is an inadvertent error, we will \nbe happy to correct it.\n  The intent is that it be within the program. Then, from a country \nthat is in the program but is not using its allocation, and sold on a \nfirst-come-first-served basis, so if the price is going to be changed, \nthere will not be a buyer for the sugar.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Let me respond to the Senator. When she uses the term \n``comes in on a first-come-first-served basis,'' that is a legal term, \na term of art that clearly indicates that it can come in out of the \nprogram at a price below the market loan level of 18 cents a pound.\n  That is the No. 2 problem with the amendment. It would come in \noutside the terms of the program. It can come in at a price much lower \nthan the 18-cent loan level, which runs the risk of reducing the price \nof sugar throughout the United States. That is the No. 1 problem.\n  The second problem is that it mandates it be done. In the past it has \nalways been at the discretion of the Secretary. As the Senator has \nsaid, the Secretaries in the past, when they saw a need, have, in fact, \nallowed it to be reallocated. They can still continue to do that, but \nit can only be done within the terms of the program.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask the distinguished Senator a question. Would the \nSenator support the amendment if we amended it to make it clear, in \nsimple English, that the proposal is within the confines of the \nexisting sugar program?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I respond to the Senator's question by saying that the \ntwo things I have a problem with, and I think most of the people who \nsupport the program have a problem with, are, No. 1, it is mandatory. \nThe second point is that it would allow on a first-come-first-served \nbasis the sugar to come to the country outside of the program at a \nprice below the loan level.\n  If that part were corrected, I am fine, but I cannot support it being \nmandatory. We ought to have the flexibility to allow it, and it has to \nbe brought in under the terms of the program.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Provided we could produce those amendments, would the \nSenator then support that?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think more work certainly needs to be done. I think \ncertainly an appropriate and proper discussion--and I have had this \ndiscussion with the distinguished chairman--could be during the \nconference.\n  I make very clear the two problems I have: No. 1, it is mandatory on \nthe reallocation; and No. 2, that allocation could allow the sugar to \ncome in outside the program, the sugar program at below the marketing \nloan level which I think would destroy the program. Those are the two \nconcerns that I think most Members have.\n\n[[Page S624]]\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, is it appropriate to set aside this \namendment to see if we cannot work out some language with Senator \nBreaux?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will take unanimous consent to vitiate the \ncurrent agreement.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Senator Breaux mentioned two things which were our \nintent, in any event, that would cause him to withdraw his disapproval \nof the language. I ask it be set aside for a few moments or we suggest \nthe absence of a quorum to work out the differences and add the \nnecessary words.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I cannot control this, but I am certainly willing to work \nwith the Senator from California. I have stated the two problems.\n  I am always willing to talk to see if we can work something out.\n  Mr. REID. The vote is not scheduled for 12 minutes. How about 12 \nminutes?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I take it.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of Senators, Senators \nFeinstein and Breaux are in the process of working on their amendment. \nIt will not, at a later time, require a vote. It will be worked out in \nsome other manner. So Members should be notified there will not be a \nvote on this amendment. It was scheduled, as you know, for 3:40 this \nafternoon. We have been in a quorum call since then, anticipating there \nwould be a vote. There will not be a vote on the Breaux motion to table \nthe Feinstein amendment.\n  I also announce that I have spoken to the two managers, Senator Lugar \nand Senator Harkin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator asking for unanimous consent to \nvitiate that agreement?\n  Mr. REID. You took the words right out of my mouth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I also indicate that Senators Harkin and \nLugar are in the process, with their staffs, of working through these \namendments. We have, I think, 18 amendments. There are a number of \nthem, I have been told, that will be accepted. We expect to have a \nunanimous consent agreement in the immediate future to handle about six \nof these amendments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate consider the \namendments proposed to S. 1731 in the order in which they were offered, \nbeginning with the Santorum amendment No. 2542, as modified, and ending \nwith the Wellstone amendment No. 2847; that there be a time limitation \nof 20 minutes for debate with respect to each amendment, with the time \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that any second-\ndegree amendments be accorded the same time limitations as the first-\ndegree amendment--Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the unanimous consent proposal I just made be withdrawn. I will \noffer another one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconsider the amendments proposed to S. 1731 in the order in which they \nwere offered, beginning with the Santorum amendment No. 2542, as \nmodified, and ending with the Wellstone amendment No. 2847; that there \nbe a time limitation of 20 minutes for debate with respect to each \namendment, with the time equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform; that if there is a second-degree amendment offered, the first-\ndegree amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that it be \nin order for the managers to have a stacked sequence of votes beginning \nat a time agreed upon by the managers and the leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. REID. I state, Mr. President, as I did earlier, we are trying to \nwork out an agreement to work through the rest of these amendments so \nthat there will be definite times on them. We are in the process of \ndoing that now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--Senator Enzi is not in the \nChamber--that Senator Wellstone, who is in the Chamber, be allowed to \nbegin his 20 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2847\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to start speaking on the \namendment. We may or may not make one change.\n  This amendment is a modified version of an amendment I offered last \nweek. It is a reform amendment to the EQIP program.\n  The argument against the amendment I offered last week--which I think \nwas an important amendment for our independent producers and an \nimportant amendment for the environment--was that the size limitation \nmeant that midsized farmers could not expand. I actually thought that \nan operation with over 5,000 hogs was a pretty large operation in the \nfirst place.\n  But what I am going to do this time is make some changes, which will, \nhopefully, give us the vote to go over the top.\n  What this amendment does is comparable to what we have done with crop \nassistance in the commodity program. Now we have a reasonable payment \nlimit. What we have is a payment limit with the commodity program and, \nin addition, restrictions on multiple payments and compliance with \nenvironmental laws. This amendment would have a reasonable payment \nlimit on EQIP funds. It would restrict producers from receiving \nmultiple EQIP payments. In other words, right now these conglomerates \nown multiple CAFOs and then get government money for each one of them. \nIt becomes a subsidy in inverse relation to need. And this amendment \nwould require that producers who receive EQIP funds have an \nenvironmental plan.\n  At the moment, the direction in which this amendment goes is as \nfollows: It would lower the payment limits from $50,000 per year to \n$30,000 per year. Right now, the limit is $10,000. Some farmers don't \ndo multiple-year contracts.\n  My point is, just as we had payment limits on an earlier vote with \nthe Dorgan amendment, it seems to me we ought to also have payment \nlimits with the EQIP program, if this environmental program is to have \nthe policy integrity, and if we are not to be giving these payments to \nsome of the largest operations that don't need them.\n  Secondly, it prevents producers with an interest in more than one \nlarge CAFO from receiving more than one EQIP contract, which makes all \nthe sense in the world from the point of view of reform. And, again, we \nare talking about an amendment that has some payment limitation.\n  Finally, it requires the producers receiving the EQIP funds to have a \ncomprehensive nutrient management plan which is an environmental plan.\n  It is a reform amendment. I think we have done a lot of good work on \nthis bill. The vote earlier today on the packer ownership amendment was \nextremely important. We passed the crop payment limitation by a 66-to-\n31 vote, which was an historic vote.\n  If my colleagues are in support of payment limitations, they should \nsupport this amendment. This amendment puts some reasonable payment \nlimitations back into the Environmental Quality Incentive Program. \nCurrent law caps it at $10,000 per year. The underlying legislation \nincreases the cap to $50,000 a year. That is a fivefold increase.\n  This amendment recognizes the problem we have with the environmental \npollution that comes from these large livestock operations, but it \nplaces a reasonable payment limit on the program: $30,000 per year up \nto $150,000 over 5 years.\n  If we don't put some reasonable payment limits on the program, the \nflow of benefits is going to be just as we have seen with the \ncommodities: huge payments to huge producers; in this case large \nlivestock conglomerates that over the years have been squeezing \nindependent producers out of existence.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. Again, let me be crystal \nclear. This amendment now deals with the argument that some colleagues \nmade\n\n[[Page S625]]\n\nthat it is not going to let the midsize operations expand. This \namendment is consistent with what we have done on payment limits. It is \na reform amendment. This amendment plugs a big loophole with multiple \nCAFOs which is a huge problem when these conglomerates buy up a lot of \nthese confinement operations and then get a subsidy for each one of \nthem.\n  Finally, this amendment calls for a sound environmental plan, which \nmakes all the sense in world, a comprehensive nutrient management plan. \nIt is a modest amendment. It is a good reform amendment. It is a good \nenvironmental amendment. Frankly, it is a good amendment for our \nindependent producers.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I don't know who controls any time on the \nopposite side. We have examined the amendment on this side and, quite \nfrankly, I think the Senator from Minnesota has made constructive \nchanges to the EQIP program, which I think will inure to the benefit of \nour livestock producers all over America. On this side, we are prepared \nto accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me respond to the distinguished \nSenator. I personally favor the amendment. I will ask for 3 more \nminutes for the hotline on our side to ascertain whether all of us are \nin agreement. I am hopeful that is the case. If I may have the \nindulgence of Senators, I will ask for a quorum call for about 3 \nminutes of time. It would be my hope we could accept the amendment at \nthat point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if I could say a couple of words while we are \nwaiting. That moves us right along.\n  Before the Senator from Iowa leaves, let me say this for the record: \nI hope there will be support. I certainly would be pleased to not have \na recorded vote. I know we are trying to move things along. I ask the \nSenator from Iowa in a bit of a colloquy here for his support in \nconference committee to keep this in because my experience has been all \ntoo often, when there is not a recorded vote and there is a voice vote, \nthen the amendments get tossed aside. I know my colleague supports this \namendment. I certainly ask for his support as the chair in the \nconference committee.\n  I assume when he nods his head, it means yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Minnesota, my neighbor to the \nnorth, he is a very valuable member of our committee. When this bill is \ndone and I go on to conference, it is my intention as chair to fight \nfor all of the amendments that we in the Senate have adopted on this \nbill because it will be the Senate's position.\n  Certainly in this area on the EQIP program, I believe the Senator's \namendment improves what we have done in the underlying bill, and \ncertainly I will do everything I can to make sure we keep those \nprovisions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum with the \ntime to be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will stay here and wait patiently for \nour 3-minute limit, and my colleagues can let me know.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Wellstone \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2\\1/2\\ minutes that remain to the \nproponents; 8 minutes remain in opposition.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to reserve the \nremainder of the time, the 2 minutes and the 8 minutes, and now proceed \nto recognize Senator Enzi who had two amendments offered which are \ngoing to be accepted on this side. I don't know if the Senator wanted \nany time at all, but to move the process along, I see the Senator from \nWyoming is on the floor.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of the time be reserved \nand that we now go to the two Enzi amendments. I ask unanimous consent \nif we could just take 5 minutes on the Enzi amendment and then return \nto the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2843\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank everybody who has been working with \nme on these two very important issues. One of them is an accounting \nissue. That is to do with an authorization to have some drought \nassistance for livestock. We have had a livestock assistance program. \nIt has been kind of a last-minute, put-it-on-the-budget effort every \nyear. But the amount of money that gets spent on it every year is a \nvery consistent amount, a good amount. It calls for us to recognize \nthat upfront, provide for it upfront, and give our ranchers some \nassurance that they are going to have some help.\n  This morning we passed a very important measure, and that actually \nprovides for last year's drought assistance for livestock payments. \nPeople have been through last year's drought. They know they were \nalready heard. One of the fascinating things about this is, it doesn't \npay them for their losses. It pays them so they can buy a little feed \nso they can keep their base stock alive until they can produce again \nand have a crop. I know that Wyoming's portion of that turns out to be \nabout $15 million. That comes to about $8,000 per rancher, and $8,000 \ndoesn't even buy much feed. But it will get some people through the \nwinter. So I appreciate the concern of everybody and their willingness \nto accept it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2846\n\n  Mr. President, the other amendment, of course, is a pet pilot project \nwhich will put lamb in Afghanistan and will solve a problem there. It \nis so small a project that it can be nonexistent. I know the Department \nof Agriculture will look at it, and I think it will be one of the \nthings that will solve some problems for people who grow lambs in the \nWest and will build up a herd in Afghanistan so they can be self-\nsufficient. It is the old story--and I have heard a variation--give a \nman a fish and feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and he will buy \nan ugly hat.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we have examined both amendments on this \nside. They are valuable additions to the farm bill. I think they both \nhave tremendous merit to them. We are pleased to accept them on this \nside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2847\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me, first of all, make an announcement \nbefore I comment on the amendments of the Senator. There has been an \nobjection on our side to having a voice vote on the Wellstone \namendment. Therefore, we will need to have a rollcall vote. Because of \nthe thoughtfulness of the Senator from Iowa, there will be some further \ntime to debate the amendment. I believe there are 8 minutes for the \nopposition. For all those listening to the debate, if there is \nopposition to the Wellstone amendment, that time remains. At the end of \nthat time, the Wellstone amendment will be in the stack for votes and \ndisposition after the unanimous consent on the other amendments has \nbeen run through, which is to simply say we are going to have a vote, a \nrollcall, and it will come at the end of the stack that the Senator \nfrom Nevada offered a while back.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question? I missed the \nfirst part. There is now a call for a rollcall vote?\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment Nos. 2846 and 2843\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will return now to the amendments of the \nSenator from Wyoming. I had an opportunity to visit with the Senator \nand to appreciate the depth of his understanding and research with \nregard to both of these amendments. On our side,\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\nwe are pleased to accept them and, hopefully, we will have a unanimous \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 2843 is \npending.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2843) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider that vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2846\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 2846 is now \npending.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2846) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of the Senator from Indiana, there be no amendments in order \nprior to the vote on the Wellstone amendment No. 2847.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the \ntime being charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if other Senators are coming down with \namendments, I will stop speaking. Otherwise, I will take about 5 \nminutes now if we have the time.\n  Mr. REID. We are on the Senator's time anyway.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Wyoming \nhas arrived and may wish to speak on the Wellstone amendment. How much \ntime remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes in opposition.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me be very clear that we made a \nmodification from the original amendment to deal with some of the \nproblems my colleagues had about expansion. We are doing two things: \nLowering the payment limits from $50,000 per year to $30,000 per year, \nthough it can be $30,000 per year over 5 years. This is consistent with \nthe vote we have made on payment limitations. There is no reason for \nGovernment subsidies going to the largest of the largest. Second is to \nprevent producers with an interest in more than one large CAFO to \nreceive multiple EQIP contracts. This is consistent as a reform \namendment. Why should conglomerates get payments for multiple CAFOs?\n  Finally, making sure there is a comprehensive management plan which \ngoes to the producers, which is good, sound environmental practice. As \nI said, this has the support of a lot of farm organizations and many \nenvironmental organizations. It is a good reform vote. I hope we will \nget a majority vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me make a couple of comments. I have \nbeen very involved in this program over time. The Senator brought it up \nbefore. It seems to me there are some issues here about which we ought \nto talk. We didn't talk about it at all in committee. EQIP, in my view, \nand I think pretty much under the law, is designed to give technical \nassistance to do good for the environment. They are not tied to \nnutrients particularly or to any particular kind of action. They ought \nto be available to people who want take some action, whether it is \nchanging a ditch to make it more workable for the environment, or \nwhatever.\n  Constantly we keep trying to limit it to certain sizes and you have \nto report the number of animals that you own. That is not part of the \nproposition. This idea of nuance was an idea that came up in the \nClinton administration. It was never put in as a rule, and now we are \ngoing to put it into law. It seems to me that it is an unnecessary \namount of detail and is singly trying to target certain areas when \nreally the opportunity is broad.\n  I was out in my home this weekend and was talking about this--in \nfact, I guess it was in Denver at the Cattlemen's--and people said: We \nneed more money for EQIP, but we do not want to have more and more \nrules where every time we try to do something we invite EPA to be here \non top of us, and all these other things.\n  I feel fairly strongly about it. However, I do recognize we need to \nmove forward, and I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for his cooperation. I am saying \nthat when you put up a facility there has to be a plan of what you are \ngoing to do with the waste. That is all I am really saying.\n  If I heard the Senator from Wyoming correctly, he is not objecting. \nAre we still going to go forward with a recorded vote or not? I will do \nit either way, but it sounds as if we could move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. My understanding is that a recorded vote would occur at \nthe expiration of the time of this amendment and the expiration of the \ntime of whatever amendments that were in the original unanimous consent \nrequest. In other words, a list of, I think, four amendments needed to \nbe disposed of. So after we have completed work on all of those, there \nwould then be rollcall votes therefore required, and this would be one \nof those instances.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, is it possible to ask unanimous consent \nthat the rollcall vote on this issue be vitiated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment? If not, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 2847.\n  The amendment (No. 2847) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2845\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the McConnell \namendment No. 2845 is now pending.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time being \ncharged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we are now on \nthe McConnell amendment, No. 2845. Is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Harkin \nbe allowed to offer a second-degree amendment to amendment No. 2845; \nthat the time between now and 5 o'clock be equally divided between \nSenator Harkin and Senator McConnell or their designees, and that at \n5:45 we vote on the Harkin second-degree amendment and that at 5 \no'clock this matter be set aside.\n  I would say for the information of all Senators, there is a \nleadership meeting at 5 o'clock. I think it is bicameral. I don't know \nwhat it is; I am not attending. We will stay here on the floor and try \nto work out some other things during that 45-minute period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. To make it clear, we are going to debate now for about 20\n\n[[Page S627]]\n\nminutes on my substitute and the underlying McConnell amendment. That \nwill be set aside. The vote will then occur on my second-degree \namendment at 5:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. There may be intervening business between now and then, \nbut there will be no votes until 5:45; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2856 to Amendment No. 2845\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment. I send \nit to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2856 to amendment No. 2845.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'']\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, please clarify, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, what we have in front of us is the \nMcConnell amendment, which reduces loan rates by less than a quarter of \na percent. He takes that money and basically puts it into nutrition \nprograms.\n  Frankly, my history in both the House and Senate in the Agriculture \nCommittee for 27 years is one of very strong support for nutrition \nprograms.\n  Let's look at the record. The House of Representatives, in their farm \nbill, has $3.6 billion over baseline for nutrition programs for 10 \nyears--$3.6 billion. The Senate bill, as we reported it from committee, \nhad $6.2 billion, almost twice as much for nutrition programs over the \nsame period of time.\n  Due to certain amendments that have been offered and agreed to \nalready on the Senate floor, the amount of money for nutrition now in \nthe pending farm bill is $8.4 billion. That is well over twice what the \nHouse has. Could it be more? Yes. We could always do more, of course. \nBut we have tried to keep a well-balanced bill. I submit we have done a \nlot to address the underlying concerns of accessibility, of assets--of \na lot of things--for people who need food stamps and other nutrition \nprograms.\n  The McConnell amendment, if you divide it all up, would put about $49 \nmillion a year additional into a program that already is spending $20 \nbillion a year. Now, $49 million is a lot of money, but compared to $20 \nbillion? I submit this will have almost no effect on the underlying \nnutrition programs. Really, the way I see this amendment, it is an \nattempt to take some more money out of commodity programs by reducing \nthe loan rate, which is important as an income support for farmers in \nmy part of the country and, in fact, all over America.\n  What my amendment does is it says: OK, if you are going to nick the \nloan rates by a quarter of a percent, let's then leave it as an income \nsupport for farmers--one way or the other.\n  Last Saturday in Denver, CO, President Bush said one of the things he \nwanted to see in a farm bill was farm savings accounts. He said that. I \nthink the distinguished ranking member has proposed this in the past. \nSenator Grassley, my colleague from Iowa, has supported this proposal \nin the past. Others have supported farm savings accounts. We plan to \npropose a pilot program in the underlying manager's amendment. It \nprovides $36 million for a pilot program. It is not very much, but at \nleast it was there to try to test the idea to see if it was acceptable \nand see if it would work. Some said that is not enough money.\n  My second-degree amendment basically says we will take the less than \nquarter percent cut out of loan rates, but we will take that money, \nwhich is about $510 million, and we will put that into the farm savings \naccount as a pilot program in 10 States. With that much money, perhaps \nwe could really find out whether or not this program would work.\n  The President said he has wanted it. Other people have been \nsupporting it. I have some reservations about the idea, but there are \nplenty of people on the other side of the aisle, and the President, who \nhave supported this idea. So in the spirit of bipartisanship I would \nlike to include this pilot program so we can all find out exactly how \nit works and give the USDA some time to work out the details.\n  Again, the President has requested this program. The pilot program \nwill include 10 States. It will run from 2003 to 2006. To make the \nprogram viable, we will ramp up funding to $200 million by 2006.\n\n  The pilot program allows the farmer to set up a savings account. The \nSecretary of Agriculture will then match the producer's contribution. A \nproducer's contribution is limited to $5,000 a year. The farmer can \nthen withdraw from the account when his farm income from that year is \nless than 90 percent of his farm income averaged over the last 5 years.\n  Again, we have a strong nutrition title here. We have gone from $3.6 \nbillion in the House to $8.4 billion here. But if we want to have the \nfarm savings accounts, then Senators will have a choice. We have \nalready done a lot for nutrition. I take a back seat to no one in my \nsupport for strong nutrition programs. But if the will is to nick the \nloan rates a little bit--and I guess this is what this is all about--at \nleast let's leave it with some income support for farmers. I am willing \nto give the benefit of the doubt to my friends on the other side of the \naisle. Let's try this farm savings account. Let's see how it works. \nMaybe I will be proven wrong. I don't know that it will work, but it is \nprobably worth a try. And I know the President wants it.\n  The President keeps saying he wants bipartisanship. This is \nbipartisanship. I reach out a hand to those on the other side of the \naisle and say fine, let's try the farm savings accounts.\n  Let me point out one other thing. I mentioned the House had $3.6 \nbillion in nutrition. We are at $8.4 billion. President Bush, in the \nbudget he sent down, has $4.2 billion increases for nutrition programs \nover the next 10 years. So, as I said, I think we can be proud of what \nwe have done for nutrition in the Senate bill.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The underlying McConnell amendment which would be \nwiped out by the second-degree Harkin amendment is for the benefit of \ndisabled people and working families with children. It would simply \nallocate $50 million over the next 10 years, per year, and pay for it \nwith a thirteen-hundredths-of-1-percent lowering of loan rates, a \nthirteen-hundredths-of-1-percent reduction in loan rates over 10 years, \nwhich is a minuscule reduction in loan rates, to benefit the disabled \nand working families with children.\n  That is what the underlying amendment is about. I had hoped the \nSenator from Iowa, the chairman of the committee, would accept this \namendment. It seems to me it is pretty simple. There is not a farmer in \nAmerica who is going to notice a thirteen-hundredths-of-1-percent \nreduction in loan rates over 10 years. No farmer is going to recognize \nthat. But a lot of disabled people and working families will recognize \nthe $16-a-month difference that it will make for them.\n  On this amendment, I speak not only for myself but I speak for the \nfollowing groups: The Children's Defense Fund, the Kentucky Task Force \non Hunger, the Center on Budget and Policy\n  Priorities, the National Council of La Raza, the Food Research and \nAction Center, America's Second Harvest, Bread for the World, and the \nWestern Regional Antihunger Coalition, which includes the Food Bank of \nAlaska, the Association of Arizona Food Banks, the California Food \nPolicy Advocates, the California Association of Food Banks, the Idaho \nCommunity Action Network, the Montana Food Network, Montana Hunger \nCoalition, the Oregon Hunger Relief Tax Force, the Oregon Food Bank, \nthe Utahns Against Hunger, the Children's Alliance of Washington, the \nWashington Association of Churches, and the Washington Food Coalition.\n  All of these groups are interested in helping provide sustenance for \nthe disabled and working families with children. And the only sacrifice \nthat the McConnell amendment envisions farmers making is a thirteen-\nhundredths-of-\n\n[[Page S628]]\n\n1-percent reduction in loan rates over 10 years.\n  I don't think there is a need to further explain the underlying \namendment. I had hoped Senator Harkin would accept it. Since he has not \nchosen to do that, I hope the Harkin second-degree amendment will be \ndefeated and that the underlying amendment supported by all of these \ngroups interested in feeding hungry people and disabled people will be \nagreed to.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes in support of the \nMcConnell amendment.\n  The distinguished Senator from Kentucky has stated the case well. In \nearlier debates, both of us pointed out that the McConnell amendment is \nessential to bringing justice to all Americans who are recipients of \nfood stamps--in this case, among those who are most vulnerable in our \nsociety. It does so at a minimal change with regard to payments to \nfarmers. I suspect most farmers recognize that and would commend the \nintent.\n  In fairness, my distinguished colleague, the chairman of our \ncommittee, does not argue about the intent. Indeed, the Senate bill is \nmuch more generous than the House bill in regard to nutrition programs \nand food stamps in particular and is much more generous than \nadministration proposals. At the same time, we have spent the time in \ncommittee attempting to explore equity. This seems to me to be an \namendment that rounds this out, and that brings completion to our \nargument in a very satisfying way.\n  The savings account idea is a good one, but to introduce it at this \npoint seems to me to be inappropriate. I am most hopeful that Senators \nwho support the McConnell amendment will think through, once again, an \nopportunity that we have in a humane way to help those who are \nvulnerable in our society through satisfying nutrition programs.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes twenty-two seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, frankly, I think it is quite appropriate. \nWe plan to propose a pilot program in the manager's amendment. This \njust expands it.\n  I am trying to do something that reaches across the aisle in a \nbipartisan atmosphere, something that friends on the other side of the \naisle and the President have called for in doing something about these \nfarm savings accounts. I don't really know whether they will work or \nnot, but I am willing to let them try to put some money in the pilot \nprogram.\n  On the other hand, on nutrition programs, there is $49 million a \nyear. Every dollar helps. When you are spending $20 billion a year and \nsay we are going to put in another $49 million, you could look at it \nand say that doesn't do much. The Senator from Kentucky says we are not \ntaking much out of farmers. You are not taking much out of farmers but \nyou are not doing much to help poor people, either.\n  If you are going to do that--if you are going to nick the farmers a \nlittle bit--rather than holding out false hopes to poor people that \nsomehow you are really going to boost nutrition programs, which you \nreally aren't with this amendment, then at least try to do something \nthat might be meaningful to help farm income in the future.\n  Quite frankly, $50 million used in the farm savings accounts could be \nthe underpinnings to help farm income in the future. That could be \nmeaningful. But $49 million, or $50 million, on $20 billion for food \nstamps is, as I said, holding out false hopes to poor people that \nsomehow you have done something.\n  I suggest to my friend from Kentucky that perhaps he might want to \ntell the President not to send the budget down here that has $4.2 \nbillion in increases in nutrition programs when we are already at $8.4 \nbillion. I had hoped the President would have sent down a budget that \nsaid, no, we need to put more money in nutrition, and we need $8 \nbillion or $10 billion, as the ranking member was trying to do in \ncommittee with $10 billion more for nutrition.\n  On the other hand, that amount of money going into farm savings \naccounts could be quite significant to a number of farmers.\n  I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will not need to use the whole 5 \nminutes. Let me restate what this is about. This is about working \nfamilies with children and disabled people who are eligible for food \nstamps. It has been suggested by my friend and colleague from Iowa that \nthe amount involved for those people would not be noticed. I would \nrespectfully suggest that $16 a month for a family of four will be \nnoticed and that the loss of thirteen-hundredths of 1 percent on the \nloan rate will not be noticed by the farmers.\n  This is an amendment that ought to be approved. As I said earlier, it \nis supported by a vast array of groups led by the Children's Defense \nFund that believes it is necessary to bring this program up to the \nlevel that it ought to achieve when looking into the future.\n  I hope that the Harkin second-degree amendment will be defeated and \nthat the underlying McConnell amendment, supported by the Children's \nDefense Fund and an array of different organizations, which I listed a \nfew moments ago, will be approved.\n  Again, this is about $16 a month for working families with children \nand the disabled, paid for by a thirteen-hundredths of 1 percent \nreduction in loan rates.\n  I think this is a tradeoff that every farmer in America would \nunderstand. I consider myself a friend of farmers as well. I will bet \nthere is not a farmer in Kentucky who wouldn't think this is an \nappropriate step to take.\n  Is the Senator from Iowa out of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 18 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am happy to yield back my time if the \nSenator from Iowa wants to yield back his 18 seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2822\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, let me ask the distinguished chairman of \nour committee for his attention to the Helms amendment No. 2822 dealing \nwith animal welfare. I wanted to inquire of the Senator with regard to \nthe Helms amendment No. 2822 on animal welfare. It is my understanding \nthat on both sides of the aisle we are prepared to accept that \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is a good amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Will the Chair turn our attention to the Helms amendment \nNo. 2822 and proceed with the regular order with that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. The question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2822) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2829\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now turn \nto amendment No. 2829.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is now the \npending question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senators Breaux and Feinstein have worked on \nthis amendment now for the past hour or thereabouts.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2829, As Modified\n\n  On their behalf, I send a modification to the desk and ask unanimous \nconsent the amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It has been modified.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair for that information. I ask that the \nChair proceed to consideration of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is momentarily in doubt.\n  The pending question is amendment No. 2542 as previously modified and \nwith the proposed modification that is now at the desk.\n  Is there objection to the second modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is further modified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n       Beginning on page 2, strike line 11 and all that follows \n     through page 4, line 21, and insert the following:\n       ``(C) for the socialization of dogs intended for sale as \n     pets with other dogs and people, through compliance with a \n     performance standard developed by the Secretary based on the \n     recommendations of veterinarians and animal welfare and \n     behavior experts that--\n       ``(i) identifies actions that dealers and inspectors shall \n     take to ensure adequate socialization; and\n       ``(ii) identifies a set of behavioral measures that \n     inspectors shall use to evaluate adequate socialization; and\n       ``(D) for addressing the initiation and frequency of \n     breeding of female dogs so that a female dog is not--\n       ``(i) bred before the female dog has reached at least 1 \n     year of age; and\n       ``(ii) whelped more frequently than 3 times in any 24-month \n     period.''.\n       (b) Suspension or Revocation of License, Civil Penalties, \n     Judicial Review, and Criminal Penalties.--Section 19 of the \n     Animal Welfare Act (7 U.S.C. 2149) is amended--\n\n[[Page S630]]\n\n       (1) by striking ``Sec. 19.

Mr. President this amendment is a continuation of my \ninterest in the protection and humane treatment of animals, \nspecifically, dogs and puppies. This amendment will crack down on \nbreeders who do not abide by existing requirements for the humane \ntreatment and care of dogs bred for the pet trade. It will also fill \nsome gaps in the law that involve important humane concerns.\n  There has been extensive coverage of the improper care, abuse, and \nmistreatment common at ``puppy mills'' across America. Unsuspecting \nconsumers who purchase these puppies find out that they have latent \nphysical and behavioral problems because of the poor care they received \nin the important early stage of their lives. This can lead to safety \nconcerns, tremendous expense and heartbreak for families. And for the \ndogs, it often means they end up taken to shelters where they must be \neuthanized because they're too aggressive or sickly to be adopted.\n  My amendment enjoys the support of national animal protection \norganizations, such as the Humane society of the United States and the \nAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ASPCA, as \nwell as 861 humane organizations, shelters, and animals control \nassociations. I ask unanimous consent that a listing of these \norganizations, by State, be printed to the Record. Also let the Record \nreflect that my own State of Pennsylvania has 14 organizations on this \nlist ranging from the Western Pennsylvania Westie Rescue Committee, the \nHumane Society of Lackawanna County and the York County SPCA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SANTORUM. There are at least 3,000 commercial dog breeding \nfacilities licensed to operate by the United States Department of \nAgriculture. These facilities are required to comply with the rules and \nregulations of the Animal Welfare Act, AWA, that sets forth minimal \nstandards for humane handling and treatment. Inspections, to oversee \ncompliance with AWA standards, are performed by the USDA.\n  There are serious inadequacies with the current system that demand \nour attention and our action. One problem has been insufficient \nresources for the USDA to perform timely and routine inspections. \nSecond, inspectors have too few tools to make the assessment of proper \ncare that they must. I have worked for several years on strategies to \nsolve these problems through congressional and agency action.\n  I was very pleased to be joined last year by one-third of my Senate \ncolleagues in seeking an increased appropriation for USDA to enforce \nthe Animal Welfare Act. USDA has approximately 80 inspectors to inspect \nnearly 10,000 USDA federally-licensed facilities involving millions of \nanimals. Increases in USDA's enforcement budget will certainly help the \nagency fulfill its responsibility to ensure compliance with the AWA.\n  Counting Fiscal Year 2002, Congress has appropriated an additional \n$13 million since 1999 to enable USDA to track down more unlicensed \nfacilities, conduct more inspections, and improve follow-up enforcement \nefforts.\n  And while Congress is making progress addressing the AWA budget \nshortfall, it is also important to address gaps in the law to better \nprotect dogs and consumers.\n  That is why I introduced the Puppy Protection Act, along with my \ncolleague Senator Durbin, to address these additional areas requiring \nour attention.\n  Today's amendment is based on that bill, S. 1478, which we introduced \non October 1, 2001. The Puppy Protection Act, and our amendment today, \nwill make three very important and needed changes to the Animal Welfare \nAct's oversight of commercial dog breeding operations.\n  First, legislation addresses the need for breeding females to be \ngiven time to recover between litters and to be protected from breeding \nin their first year of life.\n  Second, it requires that dogs receive adequate interaction with other \ndogs and with people to help prevent behavioral problems in the future.\n  Third, it encourages swift and strong enforcement against repeat \noffenders by creating a ``three strikes and you're out'' system for \nchronic violators.\n  The science is clear that dogs who are raised without adequate \ncontact with other dogs and with people are likely to have behavioral \nproblems throughout their lives.\n  This amendment recognizes the critical importance of the early weeks \nof a dog's life. The Animal Welfare Act does currently recognize this \nneed.\n  Our amendment also addresses the issue of breeding and its \ncorrelation to an animals's welfare. Sometimes a life of intensive \nbreeding can begin at 6 months of age, well before a dog is mature \nenough to mother a litter of puppies and still remain healthy.\n  Relentless overbreeding can cause severe nutritional deficiencies and \nimpairs a dog's immune system, leading to increased risk of infections, \nillness and organ failure.\n  These concerns go to the heart of humane treatment, and are as \nappropriate for Congress to address as other areas already covered by \nthe AWA, such as adequate veterinary care, food, water, sanitation, \nventilation, and shelter from harsh weather.\n  Finally, our amendment addresses the problem of commercial dog \nbreeders who repeatedly violate the requirements of the Animal Welfare \nAct, but continue to operate.\n  This carefully-crafted provision will help USDA take action against \nthe genuinely bad actors while allowing for the rights of all \nindividuals in the breeding business. I am deeply concerned about small \nbusiness and the protection of private property rights, so I have \nworked with many interested parties to ensure this provision strikes \nthe right balance.\n  When families decide to buy or adopt a dog, they are taking in a new \nfamily member. When they find, after weeks or months of sharing their \nhome with this dog, that their pet has behavioral problems or some \nlatent disease, they often do everything in their power to help their \ndog with veterinarian care or behavioral training.\n  Unfortunately, dogs that are maltreated early in life and that have \nbeen denied the early contacts that allow them to form solid bonds with \npeople and other animals, may bite or lash out. Families that face \nthese problems will often go to great lengths, and spare no expense, to \nfind a cure for a problem that could easily have been prevented.\n  Our legislation should not be controversial. It is about protecting \nanimals from mistreatment. It is about preventing heartbreak and loss \nto families. And it is about doing what is responsible.\n  Please support the Santorum-Durbin amendment for puppy protection.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               Endorsement List for Puppy Protection Act\n\n                  (861 Endorsements--Updated 11/27/01)\n\n\n                                Arkansas\n\n       Anchorage Animal Control\n       Gastineau Humane Society (Juneau)\n       Sitka Animal Shelter (Sitka)\n\n\n                                Alabama\n\n       The Animal Shelter (Anniston)\n       Barbour County Humane Society Inc.

That amendment is now pending.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2849, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide equity and fairness for the promotion of imported \n                             Hass avocados)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Section 1205 of the Hass Avocado Promotion, Research, and \n     Information Act (contained in H.R. 5426 of the 106th \n     Congress, as introduced on October 6, 2000 and as enacted by \n     Public Law 106-387) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (b)(2) strike subparagraph (C) and insert \n     in lieu thereof:\n       (C)Future allocation.--After five years, the USDA has \n     discretion to revisit the issue of seat allocation on the \n     board.\n       (2) in paragraph (h)(1)(C)(iii) by striking everything in \n     the first sentence following ``shall'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``be paid not less than 30 days after the avocado \n     clears customs, unless deemed not feasible as determined by \n     the Commissioner of Customs in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. This is a very simple amendment that tries to bring equity \nto Mexican producers of avocados by collecting the fee in the same way \non imported avocados as we do on domestically grown avocados. It also \ngives the Department of Agriculture an opportunity in 5 years to look \nat the representation on the board that spends the money to promote \navocados.\n  I thank the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, for working with \nme. I commend it to my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2849), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

Mr. President, what is the matter now before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment 2825, offered by the Senator from \nOklahoma. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2853\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside and that the Harkin amendment No. 2853 be \ncalled up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment deals with a change, and \nthat has to do with the equity portion of a part of the farm bill that \njust changes the mix a little bit to cover cities up to 100,000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2853.\n  The amendment (No. 2853) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2850\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I call for the regular order. Might I \ninquire exactly what the regular order now is before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is amendment No. 2850 \noffered on behalf of Senators Kyl and Nickles.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand that the pending amendment \nbefore the Senate is the Kyl amendment No. 2850 that deals with a sense \nof the Senate on estate taxes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, we are getting close to the end \nhere. We only have a few amendments left that I have on my list. Most \nof them have been worked out. I thank all Senators for helping to work \nout the amendments. I think we have basically the pending amendment, as \nI understand it. We have an amendment No. 2851 offered by Senator \nDomenici dealing with dairy. We have the Leahy amendment No. 2834 \ndealing with organics. We have a Kerry-Snowe amendment No. 2852 dealing \nwith commercial fisheries, and we have an Inhofe amendment No. 2825 \ndealing with peanuts. That is all I have on my list. I ask Senator \nLugar if he has anything else.\n  Mr. LUGAR. That is my understanding. I believe, in addition, another \namendment will be offered in relation to the Kyl-Nickles amendment on \nestate taxes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. A second degree?\n  Mr. LUGAR. A second-degree amendment. But there will be votes on both \nof those; that is, they will be side by side in the debate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, we are now on the Kyl amendment No. 2850. \nI ask the assistant majority leader if we could enter into a time \nagreement to bring this to a close.\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to the manager of the bill for the \nmajority, we attempted to get a time agreement. We could not do that. \nWe agreed to having 30 minutes equally divided. This matter has been \ndebated endlessly for the past several weeks. I think we have heard \nabout all there is to hear. I would hope that those people who are in \nfavor of this legislation would speak, and those opposed to it. Senator \nConrad is going to speak. He has an alternative. The proposal is, we \nwould vote on his and, following that vote, on the underlying Kyl \namendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask the leader, could we move to that and debate that?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Conrad has been on the floor for more than an hour. \nHe is here someplace. He will be here momentarily. But what he did say \nis he would appreciate it if those who are proposing this legislation \nwould move forward and then, when they have completed their statement, \nhe would offer the second degree, and we would go from there.\n  Senator Kyl is here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Senator Kyl is here. Wonderful. Now we can move ahead. \nGet the Senator a podium.\n  Mr. REID. I inquire through the Chair to my friend, the Senator from \nArizona--he is going to speak--are there others who wish to speak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in response to the assistant majority leader, \nthe answer is, yes. Senator Gramm is prepared to speak. I think Senator \nHutchison was here a moment ago. Senator Nickles will be back in about \na half hour. So until we know exactly how many people want to speak, I \nam reluctant to enter into a time agreement. I don't want to take all \nnight, but I don't want to limit it at this point.\n\n  If I could further propound an inquiry, it is my understanding we \nwill have separate votes on both the second-degree amendment and on the \nKyl-Nickles amendment. What I am unclear of is the effect of the Conrad\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\namendment and whether it would obviate the Kyl amendment. It is a \nlittle unclear by virtue of the language. I have only seen a \nhandwritten copy of it. It would be helpful if we knew what the effect \nof that is before we proceed.\n  Mr. REID. If I may respond to my friend from Arizona, if the Conrad \nsecond-degree amendment passes, then his amendment is gone. If it \ndoesn't pass, then we would come back and vote on his amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I had understood earlier, the idea would \nbe to have a separate up-or-down vote on both. I thought that is what \nthe agreement was. Am I incorrect?\n  Mr. REID. I think the Senator from Arizona is correct. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota has decided he wanted to file a second-degree \namendment. I would only say to my friend from Arizona, if you and those \nwho have spoken on behalf of this legislative measure for several weeks \nnow have confidence it has been elaborated upon several times, you \nshould be OK and have a vote on yours.\n  Mr. KYL. I am sorry. If the suggestion was that we should have a \nvote, I think there are folks who would like to talk about this.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry to interrupt. If we could have some time \nagreement from the proponents of this legislation, we would work out a \nside-by-side.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I think at 7 o'clock we should revisit this \nquestion of a time agreement. We perhaps could enter into it. I want to \nwait until Senator Nickles returns.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for an inquiry on that issue?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would inquire, for purposes of scheduling this evening, \nI understand the Senator's point that someone is now gone for a half an \nhour and you might want to talk at 7 o'clock about scheduling. Is there \nany way we might get some notion of whether we will have votes, whether \nyou are intending to accept the time agreement, so that if we are going \nto have votes later this evening we could get a sense of when that \nmight be?\n  Mr. REID. If I could respond to my friend, the majority leader wants \nto finish this bill tonight. We have indicated that the estate tax \ndebate is going to take a little bit of time. Earlier today, we agreed \non half an hour evenly divided.\n  But I say about the amendments pending, Domenici 2851, Leahy, Kerry-\nSnowe, and Inhofe, if that is still available, if they are not here, I \nam going to move to table those amendments. We are not going to wait \naround for people to come by at their convenience and offer their \namendments. That is a very good question. We have been on this bill for \nweeks. We have made tremendous progress today with the help of the \nmanagers of this bill. I see no reason we can't finish it tonight. I \nthink we should finish it tonight.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield, I thought we had something \nworked out where the Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, would have a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution on making the repeal of the death tax \npermanent and that the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, would \nhave a parallel measure with a sense of the Senate about the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and that we would have an opportunity to vote on \neach so it would be technically possible that both could go into the \nbill.\n  If, on the other hand, the Conrad amendment is a substitute for the \nKyl amendment and would, in the process of being adopted, kill it, then \nwhat we want is an up-or-down vote on the Kyl amendment. We certainly \ndon't object to an up-or-down vote on the Conrad amendment. We don't \nthink it is relevant because 9 years from now, when this would go into \neffect, we will have a surplus far larger than the repeal of the death \ntax. But if we could do it where they are parallel, as I understood we \nwere going to do it, I think we can get a time limit and finish our \nbusiness.\n  If the Conrad amendment is a substitute so that we are not going to \nget to vote on a sense of the Senate to repeal the death tax, I don't \nthink we will get an agreement.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we had an agreement earlier today that was \nnot effectuated with the consent of the Chair. We thought we had an \nagreement on 30 minutes equally divided on the first- and second-degree \namendments and there would be side-by-side votes. The time agreements \nhave broken down.\n  We acknowledge that this issue has been debated considerably. We are \nwilling to give you an up-or-down vote. But even though it is not \nrelevant to the farm bill, we believe there should be a vote, it should \ntranspire. But we want a time agreement. Otherwise, we are faced with \nan all-night session here, and it is not necessary. The Senator from \nArizona has told me in 25 minutes he would agree to a time agreement. \nSo I think we should all cool our jets for a few minutes and see if we \ncan work our way through this.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If I may respond to my colleague, shortly, I will offer a \nmotion that the Inhofe amendment be withdrawn. That means there will be \nonly three amendments other than the debate on the estate tax. I \ninquire if we might get a time agreement of 20 minutes on each of those \nthree amendments.\n  Mr. REID. To interrupt my friend--and I hope he accepts this--that \nwould be Domenici, Leahy, and Kerry-Snowe.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Yes. And then perhaps work out time agreements so that \nthere are up-and-down votes on the two estate tax amendments.\n  Mr. REID. In fact, we could get one of the amendments out of the way \nbefore 7 p.m. I think that is appropriate. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2825, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I move that the Inhofe amendment No. 2825 \nbe withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2850\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I anticipate a unanimous-consent request to \nbe delivered momentarily which will set the stage for the debate on the \nKyl-Nickles amendment which I believe is the pending business. But we \ndo not need to waste time prior to that. We can actually begin this \ndiscussion and lock that in and proceed. With that understanding--and I \nhave spoken to Senator Conrad about this--I propose we begin the \ndiscussion on this amendment, and when the agreement is ready, we can \npropound it to the body.\n  Let me say by way of introduction, and then I will yield to the \nSenator from Texas for some remarks, that the Kyl-Nickles amendment is \na sense of the Senate. We should finish the job we started last year \nand make the repeal of the death tax permanent.\n  As my colleagues will recall, because the tax bill was considered \nunder the reconciliation procedure, it could only last 10 years. That \nmeans that even though we repealed the death tax in that 10th year, \nafter that, the bill sunsets and we go right back to the position of \nthe death tax as it existed last year, with a 60-percent higher rate \nand a $675,000 exemption. That is very unfair, it is very poor tax \npolicy, and if we really meant to repeal the death tax, as we voted to \ndo, then we should finish the job we started.\n  This amendment simply puts us on record as committing to that \nproposition so that when the appropriate bill comes along, we can \naccomplish the result. Clearly, this farm bill is an appropriate \nvehicle for us to discuss this issue as a sense-of-the-Senate issue \nbecause there are an awful lot of owners of family farms who would like \nto see the death tax repealed so they do not have to worry about the \nburden of it.\n  To further discuss this proposition, I yield now to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what Senator \nKyl and Senator Nickles are doing because most people think we are on a\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\nglidepath to eliminating the death tax. We have taken that vote.\n  The worst situation we could possibly have is not knowing. Can you \nimagine how debilitating it would be to plan for a family business or a \nfamily farm to think that you would have 9 years at lower inheritance \ntaxes and then in the 10th year, unless you happened to die in the one \nyear we have repealed, you would end up going back to 3 years ago? That \njust does not make sense.\n  The best tax policy is one that is stable, that people can count on; \nthat when it is passed, people can plan according to that tax law or \npolicy.\n  What we have now is the absolute opposite. We have a situation where \npeople cannot plan. They do not know when they are going to die, so \nthey do not know what the inheritance tax is going to be, and they do \nnot know if it really will be repealed because Congress keeps talking \nback and forth about not repealing something we have already repealed. \nThat is not consistent, and it is not good tax policy.\n  Family-owned farms and small businesses are the hardest hit because \nthey have assets that are valued greater than the income they can \nproduce. When someone who is the head of a small business or a family \nfarm dies, many times the value of that farm or small business is very \nhigh and the family does not have the cashflow to pay the taxes. So \nwhat do they do? They sell the family business or family farm to pay \nthe taxes.\n  This is not money that has never been taxed. No, it is money that was \ntaxed when it was earned, and taxed every year that it has been \ninvested. The money has already had its fair share of taxes taken out.\n  We have to make a decision in this Congress if we want small \nbusinesses to survive. I do. Small family-owned businesses are the \nbasis of our country. Sometimes they grow and prosper and become big \nbusinesses. Sometimes they are passed to their children and create \nlivelihoods for children.\n  Lost in a lot of this debate are the employees of these small \nbusinesses and family-owned farms, the people who own nothing but work \nfor these small businesses. What happens when a business has to be sold \nto pay taxes? All the people relying on that business lose their job. \nWe have heard story after story of a small family business that was the \nmost important business in town and had to be sold. The people working \nthere were out of jobs, in a very small community where one does not \njust walk across the street and get another job. We have heard that \ntime and again.\n  I will never forget the letter I saw written by a man who happened to \nhave a farm that his parents had worked very hard to buy, about 100 \nacres in a beautiful part of Texas, but it was a part of Texas in the \nold days that was just a farming area. It was not very expensive, not \nvery well known. It was pretty and nice but not that big a deal. Today \nit is called the hill country, and it is the most expensive land in \nrural Texas.\n  When the parents died, the children inherited that farm, but they had \nto sell their own homes to pay the taxes on that farm because it had \nescalated to such a great value. They sold their homes and moved into \nan apartment to keep the family farm.\n  The bottom line is, going into the third generation, the man said: My \nchildren could not possibly get enough cash to pay the taxes for us to \npass this farm to them in the third generation. The land is going for \n$6,000, $7,000 an acre, and the farm will eventually have to be sold.\n  Mr. President, who gains? Who gains from selling that farm? Who gains \nfrom a small business having to be sold to pay taxes? The employees who \nwork for that business lose. They lose their jobs and their livelihoods \nin the community in which they want to live. Certainly not the family, \nnot the patriarch and the matriarch who worked hard to put that \nbusiness together. Certainly not the children who may have worked or \nwanted to be in the family business, who wanted to continue the \ntradition. They lose.\n  One might say Uncle Sam gains. But is it really a gain when you tear \nsomething out of our economy that is a thriving small business? It is a \nminuscule amount. It is an amount that has already had taxes paid on \nit. In fact, the only reason one would ever want to tax an inheritance \nis to level society, and America was not built on society leveling. \nAmerica was built on the concept that one could come to this country, \nwork hard, and make as good a living as they could make by the sweat of \ntheir brow, and pass on what they have to their children, if that is \nwhat they decide to do.\n  We are not a country that is entrepreneurial, that has a spirit that \nis looking at society leveling. What good does it do for us to tax at \ndeath and disrupt family businesses, family farms, family ranches, \nfamilies? It does not make sense.\n  I hope we will pass the amendment offered by Senator Kyl and Senator \nNickles that puts the Senate on record we are going to make permanent \nthis tax cut. We have done it once. The Congress has voted for it and \nthe President has signed the bill, but because of a process, it goes \nout of existence in 10 years and that is not stabilizing, it is \ndestabilizing, and we need to correct it and do the right thing.\n  So I applaud Senator Kyl and Senator Nickles. I support them fully, \nand I hope Congress will speak once again. We passed it once; we can do \nit again. This time let us do it right, and let us do it within a \nprocess that says we are doing this and we really mean it; not we are \ndoing this but because of a process that nobody cares about it is going \nout of existence in 10 years. Let us do it right so people can count on \nit, so they can plan and so these small businesses can continue to \ncreate jobs and be a part of our economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I will offer a \nsecond-degree amendment that says this: Since both political parties \nhave pledged not to use Social Security surplus funds by spending them \nfor other purposes, and since under the administration's 2003 budget \nthe Federal Government is projected to spend the Social Security \nsurplus for other purposes in each of the next 10 years, and since \npermanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal would cost, according \nto the administration's own estimate, approximately $104 billion over \nthe next 10 years and $800 billion in the next 10 years, all of which \nwould further reduce the Social Security surplus, therefore it is the \nsense of the Senate that no Social Security surplus funds should be \nused to make currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful \nspending.\n  The situation we face as a nation is last year when we were \naddressing the budget, the President and the Congressional Budget \nOffice told us we were going to have $5.6 trillion of surpluses over \nthe next decade. Under the President's budget, that is down to $600 \nbillion. The truth is there are no surpluses left. Let me repeat that. \nThere are no surpluses left, not a dime. Every penny of money that is \nstill available is Social Security money, every dime. There are no \nsurpluses left.\n  This chart shows it very clearly. This chart shows from 1992 until \n2012 the fiscal condition of the country. We were in deep deficit in \n1992. Then we started to pull out of it with the 1993 plan that we \npassed, I might add, without a single vote on the other side of the \naisle, not a single vote, and we started moving out of deficit.\n  In 1997, we passed an additional plan. That one was on a bipartisan \nbasis, and it finished the job. We moved into budget surpluses. We \nstopped using Social Security trust funds. This chart shows in specific \ndetail what has happened since 1996. In 1996, we were using 100 percent \nof the Social Security trust funds for other purposes. The same was \ntrue in 1997. In 1998, we reduced it so we were only using 30 percent \nof Social Security money for other purposes.\n  In 1999 and 2000, we stopped using Social Security money entirely. \nThese were the good days. These were the responsible days. In 2001, we \nstarted backsliding. Under the President's budget, President Bush's \nbudget, every year we are going to be using 100 percent of the Social \nSecurity money for other purposes.\n  Let us go back to what we confront. We are headed for deficits this \nyear, fiscal year 2002, 2003, every year through the rest of this \ndecade. Making tax cuts that were previously scheduled permanent means \nevery dime of it is coming out of Social Security.\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\n  Where did the money go? The Congressional Budget Office came before \nthe Budget Committee and told us that in the near term the biggest \nreason was the recession, but over the 10 years of the President's \nplan, the biggest reason of the tax cuts the President proposed and \npushed through Congress last year, 42 percent of the reduction in the \nsurplus and the return to deficits is from the tax cut. Twenty-three \npercent is from the recession. Eighteen percent of the additional \nexpense is caused by the attack on the United States. Seventeen percent \nis caused by certain technical changes, largely the underestimation of \nthe cost of Medicare and Social Security.\n  Last year, we were told there was in the non-trust-fund side of the \nFederal accounts a $2.7 trillion surplus. That is from where the tax \ncuts came. But you know what. There is no $2.7 trillion of non-trust-\nfund money anymore. The Congressional Budget Office tells us, instead \nof surpluses, there are massive deficits, $2.2 trillion of deficits. \nWhat the good Senator from Arizona is saying is do not worry about it. \nLet us just pile on some more. Let us have some more tax cuts. Let us \ndig the hole deeper.\n  What he is saying is, let us not only have the estate tax reductions \nthat are already scheduled, which are significant--and I would correct \nthose who say there is a death tax. There is no death tax in America. \nNinety-eight percent of the estates in America pay nothing, zero. They \npay no estate tax. That is what we have in America, not a death tax; it \nis an estate tax. If one has an estate over a certain value, they start \nto pay something. Why? Because we have determined that is a fair way to \ndistribute tax burden.\n  The Senator from Texas says this is not part of American history. I \nbeg to disagree. It is a fundamental part of American history. Go back \nand read what the Founding Fathers had to say on this question. They \ndid not want America to be a land of inherited aristocracy. No, no, no. \nThey wanted this to be a land where people rose and fell on the basis \nof their own hard work and their own skills and their own talent, not \nbecause they inherited from grandpa, not because they inherited from \ngreat grandpa. That was not the point of America, and that is why \nfundamentally we have had an estate tax because our Founding Fathers \ncame from Europe and they saw what inherited aristocracy led to, the \nconcentration of wealth in the hands of a few, and ultimately \ninstability and political chaos. They did not want that for us.\n  So the reality is, 2 percent of estates in this country pay any \nestate tax. We are scheduled to raise the exemption to $3.5 million per \nperson. Only three-tenths of 1 percent of estates are at that level. \nThis would mean that one could transfer $7 million and not pay a dime \nof tax. The Senator from Arizona is not satisfied with that. He wants \nanybody to be able to pass any amount to their heirs.\n  The cost in this decade of the Senator's proposal is $104 billion. \nThe cost in the next decade is $800 billion. At the time the baby \nboomers start to retire, they will take it all out of Social Security \nfunds. That is from where it is coming from.\n\n  Here is what we confront at the very time they are talking about \nadding $800 billion of additional tax cuts: Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds go cash negative at the very time they are talking \nabout another $800 billion of tax cuts, all of it out of Social \nSecurity.\n  The Director of the Office of Management and Budget came before the \nSenate Budget Committee and said:\n\n       Put more starkly, Mr. Chairman, the extremes of what will \n     be required to address our retirement are these: We'll have \n     to increase borrowing by very large, likely, unsustainable \n     amounts; raise taxes to 30 percent of GDP, obviously \n     unprecedented in our history; [we are at 19 percent of GDP \n     now in taxes. Anybody think we will go to 30 percent of GDP? \n     If we do not, they will have to be massive cuts in benefits] \n     or eliminate most of the rest of government as we know it. \n     That's the dilemma that faces us in the long run, Mr. \n     Chairman, and these next 10 years will only be the beginning.\n\n  I cannot think of an amendment that is more fiscally irresponsible \nthan the one before this body now. The President last year in his State \nof the Union promised not to use Social Security trust funds for any \nother purpose. That is the pledge he made. I quote:\n\n       To make sure the retirement savings of America's seniors \n     are not diverted to any other program, my budget protects all \n     $2.6 trillion of the Social Security surplus for Social \n     Security and for Social Security alone.\n\n  That is what he said last year.\n  Now, in reading his budget, we see he will take $2.2 trillion of \nSocial Security and Medicare trust fund money and use it for tax cuts \nand other expenses of Government.\n  The Senator from Arizona says that is not enough, let's take even \nmore money from Social Security--let's take it all and not protect any \nof Social Security.\n  I don't think so. Those who vote to take it are going to be mighty \nsurprised by the reaction of the American people when they find out we \nare already on course to eliminate taxes for a couple that would not \npay any taxes--not a dime--on $7 million. Now the Senator proposes no \nlimits forever--and take every dime out of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  This reversal in our financial fortune has meant that over the next \ndecade, instead of being virtually debt free by 2008, which is what \nthey told us last year, we now find by 2008 there will be $3 trillion \nof debt. The result of that is we will be paying as a country $1 \ntrillion more in interest over the next decade. Instead of $600 billion \nin interest, we will pay $1.6 trillion in interest payments. We ought \nto quit digging the hole deeper.\n  This amendment takes more money out of the trust funds to have a tax \ncut that goes to a fraction of 1 percent of the American people.\n  The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas earlier argued \nthis is a question of fairness. I agree. It is a question of fairness. \nWhere should the money come from to restore the integrity of the trust \nfunds? Where should it come from? One of the first places we would look \nis the wealthiest among us, for us to say, if you die and have an \nestate of over $7 million, maybe you ought to be part of solving this \nextraordinary problem we now face. I don't think that is unreasonable.\n  We have had some of the wealthiest people in America before the \nFinance Committee saying they did not think it was unreasonable for \nthem to make some contribution to restoring the integrity of the trust \nfunds of Social Security and Medicare.\n  For those who say this money has already been taxed over and over and \nover, it is not true. Much of this money has never been taxed because \nit has been locked up in long-term capital gains and people never paid \ntaxes at all.\n  This is a fundamental question before the Senate, the most basic of \nquestions about priorities, about fiscal responsibility, about paying \nour bills, about keeping the promise that this President and Members of \nthis Chamber made on the question of not looting or raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund to pay for other things. Now before the Senate is \nan amendment that says we will take Social Security money and use it to \ngive a tax reduction to the very wealthiest. What a perversion of \nfairness. Those are not the values of the people I represent. I don't \nbelieve those are the values of the American people. I hope when the \nvote is called tomorrow we will have a chance to vote for the \nsubstitute amendment and to defeat the amendment of the Senator from \nArizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I agree with every word Senator Conrad \nsaid. Senator Conrad laments that we are not keeping our promises of \nnot raiding the Social Security trust fund. In fact, in his resolution \nhe talks about not using it for tax cuts or spending.\n  I remind my colleagues, only a few hours ago on rollcall vote No. 25, \nwe waived the Budget Act to steal $2.4 billion out of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. If people look at that vote--I voted against it, \nthe Senator from Arizona voted against it--the Senator from North \nDakota voted for the budget waiver that did exactly what he laments \ntoday. In the same day we talk about not spending the Social Security \ntrust fund on making the death tax repeal permanent, we waive the \nBudget Act to take $2.4 billion of it to pay subsidies while we \ncontinue to talk about the poor versus the rich. Where did the \nsubsidies go? A select group of people, generally very high income \npeople.\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\n  It is very instructive to note that while the assault on making the \nrepeal of the death tax permanent is an assault that is claimed to be \nprotecting Social Security, this very day those who have launched the \nassault voted to raid the Social Security trust fund when we have a \ndeficit where we are spending Social Security trust fund money and \nborrowing money. That did not prevent the Senate from spending another \n$2.4 billion this very single day. That shows how this whole amendment \nrings hollow.\n  It does not end there. Let me read this language of the Conrad \namendment:\n\n       Therefore it is the Sense of the Senate that no Social \n     Security surplus funds should be used to pay for making \n     currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful \n     spending.\n\n  Who gets to define ``wasteful''? Does that mean every effort to make \nthe death tax repeal permanent is equivalent to wasteful spending? In \nfact, was adding $2.4 billion to an already bloated farm bill less or \nmore wasteful than making the death tax repeal permanent so that \nfarmers and ranchers will not lose their farms and ranches when they \ndie?\n  A final point before I turn to the amendment I am for. Senator Conrad \nacts as if the passage of the Kyl amendment--and we are just doing a \nsense of the Senate--would spend Social Security trust fund money. Not \nso. In fact, the Kyl amendment goes into effect 9 years from now. Nine \nyears from now, in the year 2011--in fact, Conrad refers to the \nadministration's estimate. Let me tell you what that estimate is.\n\n  Nine years from now, when the Kyl amendment would go into effect, by \nmaking the tax cut that would be fully implemented permanent, we will \nhave a surplus, according to OMB, of $350 billion. The Social Security \nsurplus will be $290 billion, which is $60 billion less than the \nsurplus we are projected to have.\n  The repeal of the death tax costs $4 billion. So, in fact, if the \ndeath tax repeal were made permanent, if we were voting on, not a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution but law today--and we are going to get \nan opportunity to do that, probably on the so-called energy bill--but \nif we were voting on it today, this permanency goes into effect in 9 \nyears, in 2011, the projected surplus from the administration--contrary \nto what the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that Senator Conrad is \noffering says--is $350 billion, the Social Security surplus is $290 \nbillion, giving us an on-budget surplus of $60 billion. Repealing the \ndeath tax costs $4.249 billion. So even if we were repealing the death \ntax and making that repeal permanent, we will not spend a penny of \nSocial Security surplus in the year 2011.\n  Let me also say something about the idea that we are going to have \nsocial unrest because we don't make people pay 55 cents out of every \ndollar they earned in their life to the Government when they die; I \nthink it is stretching someone's conception of social unrest beyond the \nbreaking point. I am opposed to the death tax. None of my people have \never paid a death tax. The only thing I have ever been bequeathed in my \nlife is a cardboard suitcase that my great uncle Bill, my grandmother's \nbrother, left me, full of yellow sports clippings, but I am opposed to \nthe death tax because it is wrong. It is rotten. It is absolutely \noutrageous that people work a lifetime, they save, skimp, sacrifice, \nthey build up a business, they build up a farm, they build up assets, \nand then when they die their children have to sell their life's work to \ngive the Government another 55 cents on the dollar tax.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Kyl provision requires people to pay \ncapital gains tax. If you have untaxed income, you are going to have to \npay it. But what it does not have is double taxation.\n  I believe the American people understand this issue, and I can \nhonestly say, in speaking in my State and around the country, in white-\ncollar crowds or blue-collar crowds, when I talk about killing the \ndeath tax, when I talk about not making people sell their business or \nsell their farm, people always applaud--whether they expect to pay the \ntax or not.\n  I think if we view things politically as to who gains and who loses, \nwe often lose in terms of not understanding our own country. This is a \nquestion of right and wrong. The death tax is wrong. And the final \nabsurdity is that on the floor of the Senate we claim to be repealing \nthe death tax, Democrats and Republicans voted to repeal it, and yet \nbecause of a quirk in the Budget Act we are phasing down the death tax \nto zero, 9 years from now. So if you die 9 years from now, your \nchildren can keep what you have earned, but if you die 10 years from \nnow they have to pay 55 cents out of every dollar of your life's work \nto the Government.\n  I think that is wrong. I urge my colleagues to vote for this sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. We should be making the repeal of the death \ntax permanent.\n  I don't have any concern about committing ourselves to not spend the \nSocial Security surplus in repealing the death tax. The repeal doesn't \ngo into effect until 2011, at which point we simply make what the tax \nis on that day permanent. By 2011 we are going to have a surplus that \nfar exceeds the Social Security surplus, unless we do what we did \ntoday, which is waive the Budget Act to spend it.\n  I am hopeful that those who vote for the Conrad amendment, tomorrow \nwhen we vote on another budget waiver, will vote not to waive the \nBudget Act. But I hope people will not say to us, ``We are really \nworried, we are worried we are going to use the Social Security surplus \nto make tax cuts permanent and to make the repeal of the death tax \npermanent,'' and at the same time in the same day to take $2.4 billion \nout of the Social Security trust fund.\n  I do not understand. If you are concerned about the trust fund for \nrepealing the death tax, how come you are not concerned about it when \nyou are spending money on a bloated agriculture bill? I do not think \nyou can have it both ways.\n  I think, in the end, people who vote for this resolution, when we \nvote on another budget waiver to spend more money, I hope they will \nsay: Look, I voted for the Conrad resolution which said I wouldn't \nspend Social Security trust funds. So while I would love to spend this \nmoney, I cannot vote for the waiver.\n  I bet that many people will vote for this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, then vote not to make the repeal of the death tax \npermanent, and then the first time we have a vote on busting the budget \nand spending more Social Security trust fund, they will vote for it.\n  Maybe that sells where you are from. That doesn't sell where I am \nfrom. I am for repealing the death tax. I am for making it permanent. \nThe good news is that everyone should know that by doing that we are \nnot raiding the Social Security trust fund. We raided it today when we \nwaived the budget point of order on $2.4 billion. We stole that money \nright out of the Social Security trust fund, and everybody who voted \nfor that waiver voted to steal that money out of the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  I am proud I did not.\n  But when we make the death tax repeal permanent, it costs $4 billion \nin the year 2011, which is when the permanency would kick in. At that \npoint we will have a $60 billion non-Social Security surplus, according \nto the administration's numbers, if we quit spending money.\n  I urge my colleagues, however you vote on the Conrad amendment, just \nbe sure you read it before you vote and you are ready to live up to it. \nI am ready to live up to the sense of the Senate to repeal the death \ntax. I am ready to live up to the sense of the Senate on the Conrad \namendment.\n  I would strike out ``wasteful'' because, as we all know, every \nprogram you are for is not wasteful. So I thank our dear colleague from \nArizona for his leadership. I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate those remarks of the Senator \nfrom Texas. The Senator from Alabama, I know, and the Senator from \nOklahoma, as well, want to speak. I just wanted to make a couple of \npoints.\n  No. 1, President Bush wants us to do this. His budget for this next \nfiscal year has in it the permanent repeal of the death tax. So he \nwants us to go forward with it. As the Senator from Texas said, we will \nhave a Social Security surplus at the time when we make\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nthis death tax repeal permanent. So we are not raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund, as the Conrad amendment would suggest. In fact, \nbecause we are injecting more money into our economy, one could expect \nthere will be additional Federal revenues, not less Federal revenues.\n  One of the experts on this subject, Dr. William Steger, has estimated \nthat immediate repeal of the death tax would provide a $40 billion \nautomatic stimulus to the economy. He is president of Consad Research \nCorporation and an adjunct professor of policy sciences at Carnegie \nMellon University. So it is a $40 billion automatic stimulus to the \neconomy--not taking the Social Security trust fund.\n  I will have a lot more to say about this after we enter into our \nunanimous consent agreement, but I think both the Senator from Alabama \nand the Senator from Oklahoma would like to speak, and I will yield the \nfloor to them at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nhard work and leadership on this. I appreciate the remarks of the \nSenator from Texas. He is eloquent, as always, and is effective in the \npoints he makes.\n  First of all, I would like to say why I think it is appropriate that \nwe have this sense-of-the-Senate amendment on the farm bill. It is \nbecause it is one of the most significant issues for farmers in \nAmerica. I speak to farmers frequently. When I first began to campaign \nfor the Senate, they told me right upfront that one of their top \npriorities was the elimination of the death tax. It threatens \neverything they do.\n  I was shocked and really surprised to hear the Senator from North \nDakota say he is not worried about people passing on their farms to \ntheir children. I thought that was what the farm bill was all about. I \nthought it was all about trying to preserve a family farm. What good \ndoes it do to preserve the farm, have a living wage for farmers, and \nthen make them pay 50 or 55 percent of the value of the farm to the \nGovernment every generation?\n  Eliminating the death tax is about preservation of the farm. I think \nit is appropriate that we are considering it. It is certainly one of \nthe highest priorities of every agricultural organization of which I \nknow.\n  Second, let me say why I think this thing is bad economics for \nAmerica, why it is hurting our economy, and why we need to eliminate \nit.\n  First of all, the death tax is extraordinarily difficult to compute \nand collect by the Federal Government. It produces a lower return based \non how much money the taxpayer has to pay than almost any other tax we \npay. It is an extraordinarily complex thing. It causes individuals to \ngo through the most intricate gyrations and causes them to make \nfinancial decisions they would never make otherwise except to attempt \nto avoid being decimated or having their heirs decimated by the death \ntax.\n  Let me tell you what I am really concerned about. This is an issue \nthat I feel has not been talked about enough. There are a lot of \ndifferent ideas that people have about why this tax is bad. I would \nlike to talk about a purely economic argument that strikes me as a \ngreat unfairness about the death tax.\n  Let us say International Paper Company, or the Weyerhaeuser Company, \nowns 1,000 acres of land, and an individual owns 1,000 acres of land \nand saves some money and manages it well. Then the individual dies. \nThey have to pay an estate tax. But Weyerhaeuser or International \nPaper, which may own 600,000 acres of land, or maybe multimillion acres \nof land, never pays a death tax. Big corporations, large stock-held \ncorporations, never have their corporate work--Mr. President, I believe \nthere is a little noise here. Even I can't think very well when it is \ngoing on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair.\n  So these large corporations are never impacted by estate taxes, but \nthey are competing with smaller farmers, smaller timber producers, and \nsmaller landowners. Whenever a family member in one of those privately \nheld companies dies, they get whacked by the Federal Government with a \ntax. It makes them less competitive.\n  In my State of Alabama, we have seen an extraordinary number of banks \ngo out of business by selling out to larger banks. Small, closely held \nbanks no longer exist today. One of the main reasons is that the family \nsits around the table and wrestles with what they are going to do about \nthe future. They get an offer from a big holding company to buy them \nout. They consider how much in taxes they are going to have to pay and \nhow they are going to keep the bank going while paying 55 percent tax \non it. They end up selling out, and then we get bigger and larger \ncorporations with more and more concentrations of wealth and less \ncompetitiveness in the American economy.\n  We need and desire more smaller motel companies. We need more small \nentrepreneurs. We need more stores selling material, like Home Depot or \nWal-Mart. But those stores, if they are closely held, end up getting \nwhacked in each generation by an estate tax.\n  I talked to a young man and his father. They had four motels. He told \nme they were paying $5,000 a month for insurance on the father's life, \ntrying to make sure that if he were to die, they wouldn't lose their \ninvestment.\n  That is the reality of America. This tax is favoring large \ncorporations in their competitiveness against small corporations and \ncompanies and closely held companies. It is not fair. It is not healthy \nfor the economy. We can do better.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment my friend from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, for his speech, as well as the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, and the Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, because they \nhave laid it out very plainly and very clearly to the American people.\n  When we repealed this tax, it was temporary. Some people asked, Why? \nWe did it under a reconciliation instruction. Most Americans don't have \na clue what that means. Basically, that instruction was given to \nCongress, saying you can pass a bill for 10 years. In other words, it \nhad a sunset. We passed the bill that increased the exemption basically \nfrom about $750,000 up to about $4 million. It took 9 years to do that. \nOn the 10 years, we said we will just eliminate the tax which is \nunfair. It is unfair to have a tax on death. It is unfair for the \nFederal Government to say: When somebody dies, we want half of their \nestate. We don't care if they built up a big business. Maybe they built \nup Microsoft, or maybe they built up a series of restaurants, or maybe \nthey built up a manufacturing facility, or maybe they have a large \nranch or a large farm which they have had in their family for two or \nthree generations.\n  We said even if you are fairly large, we don't think the Federal \nGovernment should come in and take half of it because you happen to \npass away. So we changed it. We said the taxable event will not be \ndeath; it will be when the property is sold. That is what we passed.\n  So the taxable rate, when and if that property is sold, will be at \nthe capital gains rate. It will be at 20 percent, which is plenty of \ntax, and the taxable event will be figured when the property is sold, \nwhen there is money available to pay that tax. That made good, eminent \nsense.\n  The bad news is it will be sunset. Presently, we take the exemption \nof last year. This year, because of the tax changes we made last year, \nthe exemption is $1 million. There is no death tax by the Federal \nGovernment if you pass away this year and the taxable estate is less \nthan $1 million. That is an improvement.\n  We gradually increased that over a period of time. For 2009, we go up \nto a $3.5 million exemption. We gradually reduce the rate, which is \npresently 50 percent--last year it was 55--to 45 percent by the year \n2009, and there is a $3.5 million exemption. For the year 2010, we said \nwe are going to eliminate it. There will be no taxable event on death. \nThe taxable event will be when the property is sold. The tax rate will \nbe at the capital gains rate, which is 20 percent, instead of the rate \nof 45 percent. It makes good sense. It is good sense.\n  Unfortunately, because of the sunset in the year 2011, bingo, nothing \nhappens. So we revert back to last year's\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nlaw. Instead of having a $3.5 million exemption, we have an exemption \nof about $1 million. Instead of having the rate at 45 percent, we are \ngoing to go back to the rate of 55 or 60 percent. But there was a \nlittle 5-percent kicker rate for estates that were between $10 million \nand $17 million. We go back to a maximum rate in the year 2011 of 60 \npercent. That is absurd.\n  A lot of us said we should make the death tax repeal permanent. That \nis what the sense of the Senate is. Somebody asked, Why isn't this \nreal? We tried to do it on the tax bill we had pending before the \nSenate--the so-called stimulus package. Senator Daschle pulled that \nbill down. He didn't want a vote on the amendment of my colleague from \nArizona and me. Maybe it is because we are going to win. Maybe it is \nbecause we are going to change the tax law and do some real good so \npeople can count on it. We didn't get a vote on it.\n  That is the reason we are here today. We are on the farm bill. We \nvoted on a lot of amendments dealing with agriculture, none of which is \nas strongly supported as this amendment we are going to vote on \ntomorrow.\n  I have spoken to my fair share of agricultural groups--ones that want \nvery little Government involvement and ones that want a lot more than I \nwant. But they are unanimous. When you ask them if they want to repeal \nthe tax, they are in support because they realize that the so-called \ndeath tax is one of the most punitive things you can do to American \nagriculture.\n  That is telling somebody, who in many cases is asset rich and cash \npoor: We want half your assets. So they may be trying to pass their \nfarm or ranch on to their kids or to their grandkids, but Uncle Sam \nsays: No, you can't do that because the value of your estate is over $1 \nmillion. And you don't have to have a very big farm or ranch for that \nto happen where the Federal Government wants half.\n  The Federal Government is entitled to take half? That is going to be \nthe law unless we make repeal permanent. So that is why this is \nimportant to agriculture. That is why it is important that the \namendment be adopted.\n  What about the underlying amendment or the ``let's confuse the \nAmerican public'' amendment that was offered by our friends on the \nDemocratic side. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I don't have a \nproblem with the conclusion. It says:\n\n       Therefore it is the Sense of the Senate that no Social \n     Security surplus funds should be used to pay to make \n     currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful \n     spending.\n\n  I do not want them to be used for wasteful spending.\n  And ``permanent tax cuts,'' let's see, do we do that in our \namendment? The answer is no. So I guess I could support the \n``therefore,'' which is the only thing people really read in these \nresolutions.\n  If you read the sentence above that, it is just factually incorrect. \nIt says:\n\n       Since permanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal \n     would cost, according to the Administration's estimate, \n     approximately $104 billion over the next 10 years, all of \n     which would further reduce the Social Security surplus. . ..\n\n  That is factually incorrect. I am a stickler for facts. I think \npeople are entitled to their own opinion. They are not entitled to \ntheir own facts.\n  If you use the administration's estimate, they estimate that the \nsurplus will exceed Social Security by about $51 billion in the year \n2010, $99 billion in the year 2011--the first year this would have real \nimpact--$199 billion in the year 2012, and $395 billion--these are \nsurpluses over and above Social Security. In other words, they are \nenormous surpluses in the outyears.\n  You may say this does not really have an impact until the years 2011, \n2012, and 2013 because that is when the death tax is repealed, and \nthose are years we have enormous surpluses, including Social Security.\n  So the amendment is trying to confuse people and bring in Social \nSecurity, and so on. Maybe it is confusing, but it is not accurate. It \nis factually inaccurate. I want people to know that. I do not care how \nyou vote on it. It doesn't mean anything. The sense of Senate says we \nare not going to use Social Security to pay for permanent tax cuts.\n  This amendment that Senator Kyl and I and Senator Gramm and Senator \nSessions have offered does not do that. Are we for wasteful spending? \nNo.\n  It is interesting to note that people start drawing out Social \nSecurity every time we have a tax cut that is real or a tax cut that is \nproposed as real. But they couldn't care less about spending. \nEvidently, it is OK to spend money--Social Security money--on anything \nand everything, and, oh, we will waive the Budget Act to do so, but, \noh, in the outyears, when we have enormous surpluses far exceeding \nSocial Security, don't you dare do it. We are going to waive the Social \nSecurity flag. It is a false flag. It is false cover. Maybe it makes \npeople feel good. I can care less how people vote on that amendment.\n  I hope people will vote in favor of the sense of the Senate that says \nwe should make the repeal of the death tax permanent. We should do it. \nWe can afford it. We must do it.\n  It makes no sense, whatsoever, to have a death tax where the Federal \nGovernment is coming in and taking a significant portion of somebody's \nfarm or ranch or business, saying: Oh, we want to take it and use it to \npay for other programs, and so on. That does not make sense.\n  So I compliment my colleagues from Arizona and Texas and Alabama for \ntheir work on this amendment. I am happy to cosponsor this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues, tomorrow morning, to vote in favor of this \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment to permanently repeal the death tax. \nProbably the best thing we can do for agriculture in this entire bill \nis to make repeal of the death tax permanent.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the proposal before us today to repeal the \nestate tax rests on profound misunderstandings of this tax, and \nparticularly on who pays this tax.\n  We have been hearing our colleagues talk about the death tax and that \nit is stalking every American. It turns out that in 1999, 2.5 million \nadults died; 49,870 estates incurred a tax liability. A very small \nfraction of Americans face the estate tax, but I point out, they are \nthe wealthiest Americans. They are not the Social Security recipients. \nThey are not individuals who have worked all their lives and are now \nwith a small pension facing their last days. These are the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  It turns out that with the unified credits, with the ability to gift \nfunds to individuals, there is an opportunity--in fact, one that is \ntaken by most Americans--to avoid the estate tax. So this is not a \ndeath tax; this is a tax on the very wealthiest Americans. And this is \na tax that was really, in many respects, copied from the example of our \nBritish brethren across the sea, who saw the corrosive power of wealth \nthat is passed on from generation to generation to generation.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues on the Republican side talk about \nhow the death tax is an insidious weapon of large corporations to beat \ndown the small workers and farmers in this country. Nothing is further \nfrom the truth.\n  This whole estate tax not only is designed to raise revenue, it is \nalso designed to ensure that great fortunes are not passed down, \nbecoming great and powerful without any check whatsoever.\n  There is another issue with respect to estate taxes. People talk \nabout it as so unfair because it is a double tax: You get taxed when \nyou earn the money and you get taxed again when you pass away. It turns \nout that a significant amount of estates consist of unrealized capital \ngains.\n  Economists have estimated that 36 percent of the wealth in all \ntaxable estates is in the form of unrealized capital gains: someone \npurchases a home, someone purchases stock, they hold that stock for \nyears, and at the time of their death, the estate tax is imposed. But \nalso at the time of death, these assets are passed on to their heirs on \na stepped-up basis. So without an estate tax, much of this gain would \nnever be taxed.\n  There is also another myth that we have heard time and time again; \nthat is, really what happens is that this onerous tax takes away from \nthe family farms and the small businesses of America; that they have to \nliquidate their assets; that they cannot pass\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nthem on; that they have to pay everything they have earned just to \nsatisfy this tax.\n  First of all, recognize this tax applies to very few Americans at \nall. And second, recognize that, despite all the discussions about the \nfamily farms being forced into sale because of this tax, no one can \nproduce any real evidence.\n  The New York Times did a report, talking about an Iowa State \nUniversity economist who searched out and tried to find farms that were \nforced into sale because of the estate tax. He could not find any. \nIndeed, they cited officials from the American Farm Bureau. They could \nnot find any concrete examples of a farm that was forced to be sold to \npay for estate taxes. So the myth of the family farm being eliminated--\nthe sons and daughters standing there being denied their inheritance \nbecause of the estate tax--is a myth.\n  There is also the suggestion that if we repeal the estate tax there \nwill be no effect on charitable contributions. That, too, is a \nmisnomer. There have been studies on this question. One study was by \nDavid Joulfaian, a Treasury Department economist, who estimated that \neliminating the estate tax would reduce charitable bequests by about 12 \npercent, or about $1.3 billion in 1998 dollars. This would have a \ndeleterious effect on something that we all want to encourage; that is, \ncontributions to charities.\n  So for these reasons, and many more, I do not think repeal of the \nestate tax is something that should become permanent.\n  It will also have an impact on State budgets because there is a \nportion of the estate tax which is credited to local States for their \npurposes. This would have adverse effects on the finances of States and \nthe finances of the Federal Government. Ultimately, we would be trading \noff estate taxes for the rich, relief for those individual estates, and \nwe would be paying for it with Social Security funds. I believe this is \nnot the right way to proceed.\n  Much of what is talked about today as the inequity of the estate tax \nis more myth than reality. The reality is that if we make this \npermanent, it will be a huge windfall, most of it the result of \nunrealized capital gains for the very wealthiest Americans, and we will \nbe taking away the resources we need to provide support for seniors, \nfor children, for the educational system, for those things that will \nmake us strong as a nation.\n  I hope we will reject the proposal offered by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I, too, rise in strong support of the \nsecond-degree amendment offered by our distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. His arguments about protecting Social Security and \nthe promotion of fiscal responsibility and basic fairness in our \neconomy are compelling, particularly when we consider it relative to \nthe permanent extension of the inheritance tax.\n  This amendment stands for a very simple proposition, a principle that \nno Social Security surplus funds should be used for any other purpose. \nUnder this second-degree amendment, the Senate would go on record \nopposing the use of Social Security funds for making currently \nscheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful spending.\n  Social Security is a sacred compact between the American people and \ntheir Government. We have promised all Americans if they work hard and \nplay by the rules, when they retire they will not have to live in the \nfear of poverty. We have promised them a safety net that will provide \nbaseline payments for their retirement years. That is what Social \nSecurity is all about, that safety net.\n  The Kyl amendment and those who would make permanent the estate tax \nare truly undermining that promise of Social Security. In this decade \nalone, we will spend $104 billion, if this is made permanent, of Social \nSecurity revenues and reserves to fund this new accelerated tax cut. \nAnd probably as serious with regard to fiscal issues, we will spend \nover $800 billion in the following decade just at the time our baby \nboom generation, those in the demographic bubble, come into play, and \nwhen the stresses on Social Security and Medicare and all other Federal \nGovernment expenditures will be under most pressure.\n\n  This is a bad idea. It is a mistake. The Senator from Rhode Island \nwas speaking in the context of fairness. I wonder why we think 2,800 \nfarm estates out of over 2\\1/2\\ million in 1999 leads us to believe \nthat we need to change this tax policy, particularly when we put it in \nconjunction with undermining our Social Security payments, and only \n48,000 estates were paid in 1998. Then you add in the fact that taxes \nhave not been paid on unrealized capital gains. I don't understand why \nwe want to make the tradeoff of undermining our fiscal position as a \nnation, undermining our ability to continue to fund Social Security \nappropriately for such a narrow slice.\n  We are all asked to sacrifice in a world where we are under \nconstraints because of national defense, homeland security, \nexpenditures we need to make, but we also need to protect our seniors, \nour Social Security. It seems to me this is a priority that does not \nmatch the time nor the place nor the needs of our Nation.\n  It is not like Social Security is an extraordinarily generous benefit \nfor our seniors. It provides a little more than $10,000 per person per \nyear on average. In New Jersey, that doesn't go a long way toward \npaying for retirement.\n  I don't know why we should be putting it at more risk today than we \nwould at other times, particularly since we are talking about such a \nnarrow slice of the American landscape. This is a time when making some \nadjustments to our estate taxes are perfectly reasonable. We have \naccomplished that. We continue to do that as we go forward. But why we \nwant to make this permanent, undermine our fiscal integrity, undermine \nSocial Security, and do it with an eye that forgets about the fairness \nof who is getting the benefit relative to what is going to be charged \nto the American people as we go forward makes no sense.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will stand with the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota and make sure that we have a true expression \nof the sense of the Senate that stands with the American people.\n  When the American people are asked a question, do we want to make \npermanent these tax cuts or do we want to have a raid on Social \nSecurity and an undermining of our retirement benefits, 84 percent of \nthe American people say: Let's stand with Social Security, and let's \nforgo these tax cuts.\n  I hope we take that into consideration when we are thinking about \nwhat are our priorities in this debate about an estate tax cut \nacceleration relative to our priorities on fiscal responsibility and \nprotecting our seniors through Social Security.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Minnesota will withhold \nbriefly, we are at a point now where we can see a finality to this \nbill. At the present time, it is my understanding on this estate tax \ndebate, Senator Kyl and Senator Dayton are the only two people still \nleft to speak on this. That is my understanding.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl be allowed to speak for up \nto 15 minutes and Senator Dayton for up to 15 minutes regarding \namendment No. 2850 and that there be no second-degree amendments in \norder to either amendment; that is, the Conrad amendment or the Kyl \namendment; that upon the use or yielding back of the time of the two \nSenators I have just mentioned, the amendments be set aside to recur \nWednesday, tomorrow, February 13, at 9:40 a.m.; that there be a total \nof 5 minutes for debate on both amendments with the time equally \ndivided and controlled; that at 9:45 a.m., the first vote occur on the \nConrad amendment, to be followed immediately by a vote on the Kyl \namendment without further intervening action or debate.\n  Has Senator Conrad offered his amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has not.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will offer his amendment. These will be \nthe two amendments that have been talked about here this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object, I would like to suggest one \nchange\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nin the proposal. I know Senator Domenici would like to speak tomorrow. \nHe is not here this evening. Since there are no other Senators in the \nChamber to listen to this debate except for the four who are here, \nmight I inquire of the assistant majority leader whether he would be \nagreeable to a total of 10 minutes, with 5 minutes per side, and then \nadjusting it, the 9:40 or 9:45 time; in other words, to add 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes per side?\n  Mr. REID. We accept that suggestion. The vote will be at 9:50.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have no objection to that point. Since \nthere were two previous Democratic speakers, I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Minnesota would allow me to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as modified? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2857\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Conrad, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2857.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Since both political parties have pledged not to misuse \n     Social Security surplus funds by spending them for other \n     purposes; and\n       Since under the Administration's fiscal year 2003 budget, \n     the federal government is projected to spend the Social \n     Security surplus for other purposes in each of the next 10 \n     years;\n       Since permanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal \n     would cost, according to the Administration's estimate, \n     approximately $104 billion over the next 10 years, all of \n     which would further reduce the Social Security surplus;\n       Therefore it is the Sense of the Senate that no Social \n     Security surplus funds should be used to pay to make \n     currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful \n     spending.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 20 \nminutes each for debate prior to a vote in relation to the following \nremaining amendments: Domenici 2851, as modified; Kerry-Snowe 2852, \nwith the time equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that \nthe amendments must be debated tonight; that no second-degree \namendments be in order to the amendments prior to a vote in relation to \nthe amendments; that if the amendment is not disposed of, then it \nremains debatable and amendable; that the vote in relation to these \namendments occur on Wednesday in a stacked sequence in the order in \nwhich they were offered; that there be 2 minutes for explanation \nbetween each vote; that upon disposition of all amendments, the \nremaining provisions of the previous unanimous consent agreement remain \nin effect; provided further that a managers' amendment still be in \norder on Wednesday and that Senator McCain be recognized to speak for \nup to 15 minutes prior to final disposition of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2834, As Modified\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk and state \nthat Senators Leahy and Stevens and the two managers have agreed to \nthis amendment. This is in relation to the Leahy amendment No. 2834.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  [The amendment will be printed in the Record of February 13, 2002.]\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Leahy amendment \nas modified?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2834), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2851, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I call up amendment No. 2851, which I offered on behalf of \nSenator Domenici earlier today, and I send a modification of the \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 132 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 132. NATIONAL DAIRY PROGRAM.\n\n       The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \n     (as amended by section 772(b) of Public Law 107-76) is \n     amended by inserting after section 141 (7 U.S.C. 7251) the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 142.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me explain where we are. We have two \ncompeting sense-of-the-Senate amendments. The first is the Kyl-Nickles \namendment. Incidentally, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHutchinson of Arkansas be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. This sense-of-the-Senate amendment says we should make \npermanent the repeal of the death tax that the majority of us voted for \nlast year and the President signed into law. It is kind of a cruel hoax \nto repeal the death tax after a 10-year period, only to have that \nsunset the very next year. So if you are lucky enough to die in the \nyear 2010, your heirs don't have to pay the tax. But if you are unlucky \nenough to live to the year 2011, you go right back to the death tax as \nit existed last year, with a 60-percent rate, with only a $675,000 \nexemption. That will be a huge tax increase in that year unless we are \nable to make the death tax repeal permanent.\n  I submit that all of us who voted for that--the vast majority of the \nMembers of this body--certainly intended that we weren't playing a \ntrick on the American people. We intended the repeal of the death tax \nto be permanent rather than just for 1 year. The competing amendment is \nSenator Conrad's. The bottom line is that we\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\nnot spend Social Security money either for tax cuts or wasteful \nspending. That is a proposition with which I suspect we can all agree.\n  The only problem with his proposal is in the text of it, an assertion \nthat the proposal to make permanent the repeal of the death tax \nactually would spend Social Security money. That is incorrect, as has \nbeen pointed out by Senators Gramm and Nickles.\n  Let me talk about the reasons we need to make the death tax repeal \npermanent and why the arguments of those who oppose that are simply \nincorrect. One of the arguments the Senator from Rhode Island had was \nthat there is the myth that lots of people pay the death tax. Actually, \nI didn't assert that. I don't think most people would say lots of \npeople pay it. Too many estates pay it. I guess his point was that \npeople don't pay it, estates pay it. Who owns estates? People do--the \nheirs, the children, usually, of the person who has died. It is not a \nvery happy circumstance that the death of their father or mother causes \nthem to have to pay a tax. All of the other taxes, with two minor \nexceptions that we have in our Tax Code, are a result of some action \nthat we take, voluntary action. If you want to earn money, you have to \npay income tax. The death tax is the only one where you don't choose \nthe event that triggers the tax. You die; you pay a tax. That is not \nsomething you voluntarily do.\n  That is why everyone who has voted for it has agreed it is an unfair \ntax and it should not be paid. The fact that not that many people pay \nit is beside the point. It affects millions and millions of people. \nWhom does it affect? First of all, all the people in the families of \nthe estates that are being taxed. Secondly, it affects all of the \npeople who tried to plan against the eventuality of paying a death tax. \nThere are literally millions of those people.\n  In 1999, the estimate is that we collected $23 billion in estate tax \nand, in addition to that, Americans paid an additional $23 billion in \nestate planning, in insurance, to accountants and lawyers and estate \nplanners. So, in effect, it is a double tax.\n\n  Another point the Senator from Rhode Island made was that there is \nreally a demonstrable effect on charitable contributions. He cited a \nstudy that said there might be fewer contributions to charity if we \nrepeal the death tax. First, it should not be Federal Government policy \nto force people to give money to charity. That should be from the \nheart, not because you have a gun at your head. We can have incentives \nand we can have a tax credit if you contribute to charity. But we \nshould not say unless you contribute that money to charity, the \nGovernment is going to confiscate it from your heirs. That is unfair \nand not something Federal tax policy should do.\n  Secondly, to summarize a story of a friend of mine, Jerry Witsosky, \nwho started a small printing company: He eventually hired 200 people. \nHe was one of the most generous people in our community of Phoenix, AZ. \nHe just could not say no. He had Boys and Girls Clubs named after him. \nHe was a very generous person. When he died, his family had to sell the \nbusiness to pay the estate taxes. They sold it to a big corporation. So \nmuch for preventing the accumulation of wealth. Has that big \ncorporation ever contributed to charities in my community? Not that I \nam awere.\n  The bottom line is these private, family-owned businesses are pillars \nof their community. When they have to be sold off to some big \ncorporation, don't tell me you are going to have enhanced contributions \nto charity as a result.\n  The Senator from New Jersey had a couple of arguments--I wish he were \nstill here. He is absolutely wrong in both of the arguments he made. I \ndon't think he has actually read the bill that repealed the tax last \nyear or he would not have made the statement that taxes are not paid on \nunrealized capital gains under the law that exists today, under the \nbill we passed last year. That is not correct. We substitute the \ncapital gains tax for the estate tax. So for the first time there will \nbe a tax on unrealized capital gains. The only amount we carve out from \nthat is essentially equal to the exemption we have in the law today. So \nnobody who is exempt from paying the tax today would have to pay the \ntax 10 years from now. But except for that carve-out, there is going to \nbe a capital gains tax substituted for the estate tax. So that argument \nof the Senator from New Jersey is simply incorrect.\n  The second argument is also incorrect, that no Social Security \nsurplus funds should ever be used and that that is what would happen if \nwe made permanent the repeal of the estate tax. But that is not correct \neither. As the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Oklahoma pointed \nout, at the point in time that the repeal of the death tax is made \npermanent, we are running huge Social Security surpluses. In 2010, for \nexample, according to OMB, we would have a Social Security surplus that \nyear of $290 billion--a non-Social-Security surplus of $60 billion. \nSubtract the $4 billion in costs from the repeal of the death tax and \nyou still have $56 billion in non-Social-Security surplus, and you \nstill have the original $290 billion Social Security surplus.\n  So the OMB numbers--the very numbers referred to in Senator Conrad's \namendment--belie the claim that we would be taking Social Security \nmoney in order to pay for the repeal of the death tax. It just isn't \ntrue.\n  Mr. President, what are the reasons for making the repeal of the \ndeath tax permanent? The primary reason is fairness. But the secondary \nreason is the confusion that exists in the code if we don't do that. \nThink about it. We gradually phase down the amount of death tax until \nthe ninth year, when it finally goes out of existence, and 1 year later \nit is all back again in its worst form--the form that existed last \nyear. How do you plan against that? Unless you are absolutely certain \nyou are going to die in the year 2010, you are going to have to pay the \nsame lawyers, accountants, buy the same insurance, and do the same \nestate planning that you do today that you will have to do tomorrow. \nYou will have to do all of those things, and the net result is a very \ninefficient and wasteful situation--money that is unproductively going \nto these people who could be put productively back into the economy to \ncreate jobs, stimulate the economy and, to be fair, frankly, to our \nfamilies.\n  That money is wasted unless you consider money going to lawyers as \nnot being wasted. As a recovering lawyer, I would argue differently. \nThe fact is, that is unproductive capital. Wilbur Steger says if you \ncan repeal it tomorrow, you can inject $40 billion of capital into our \neconomy.\n  The bottom line is repealing the death tax is good economically. It \nis also good for the people who have to plan against the eventuality of \npaying the tax, and it is good for the families who otherwise would \nhave to bear the burden of it.\n  It is not fair because it is a tax on death rather than voluntary \nactivity. It is bad economic policy and bad tax policy because nobody \ncan figure out under the law we passed last year what they are going to \nhave to do, again, unless they know for sure they are going to die in \nthe year 2010.\n  Let's go back to the basics. Last year, because of a quirk in the \nlaw, we could only pass a 10-year tax bill. We did the best we could. \nWe repealed the estate tax within that 10-year frame. Right after the \n10 years expire, the whole provision sunsets, and we go right back to \nthe Tax Code as it existed last year.\n  Is that what we intended when the vast majority of us voted to repeal \nthe estate tax we call the death tax? No. Were we playing a cruel hoax \non our constituents, claiming with great fanfare that we repealed the \ndeath tax, but knowing all along we really only repealed it for 1 year? \nDid we really intend for it to be repealed for 1 year? I daresay \neveryone who voted for repeal of the death tax is going to support the \namendment, the sense-of-the-Senate resolution that says we should make \nit permanent. Otherwise, they intended something different certainly \nthan I did and, I think, the vast majority of the Americans who support \nthis.\n  The President in his budget calls for the ``permanentizing'' of the \nrepeal of the death tax. That is calculated in his budget, and OMB \nmakes crystal clear that budget is not taking one dime from the Social \nSecurity surplus to do it. That is why we should reject the proposal of \nthe Senator from North Dakota which has in it a statement that that is \nwhat we are doing.\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\n  If he is willing to drop that one clause of his sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, then I will be the first to vote for his sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution and urge my colleagues to do so because I agree we \nshould not take Social Security surplus money. But that is not what \nwill happen if we are able to effect a permanent repeal of the death \ntax.\n  At the end of the day, this is all about fairness. Is it fair to tax \npeople who are members of a family and who did not choose that the \nbreadwinner in the family die? Is it fair to tax them up to 60 percent \nof the value of that estate, especially since many of the assets of \nsmall businesses and farms are tied up not in cash or liquid assets but \nin the business itself, so that the net result is they cannot just \nwrite a check for that obligation, they literally have to sell the \nbusiness, as my friend Jerry Witsosky's family had to do? Is that fair?\n  Is that the policy the U.S. Government should be setting? I submit \nthe answer is no. That is what the vast majority of Senators said last \nyear. The House of Representatives concurred, and the President signed \nthe repeal of the death tax into law.\n  The only problem with that is, as I have said, it sunsets after the \n10th year. That is what we need to correct. We need to find the right \nvehicle to do that. It has been said the farm bill is not the right \nbill to do that, even though the tax has a very perverse effect on \nfamily farms. That is why we bring this sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nto our colleagues--if you agree with us that we make the repeal of the \ndeath tax permanent, that we intended to do that, and we intend to do \nas soon as we have the right opportunity and reject the competing \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution that claims that doing this would take \nmoney from the Social Security surplus, something which now three of us \nhave pointed out is absolutely totally false.\n  If the author of the competing sense-of-the-Senate resolution will \ndrop that claim and will simply say it is the sense of the Senate we \nnot spend the Social Security surplus to ``permanentize'' tax cuts or \non wasteful spending, then we will be happy to support that. We can \nsupport both of them. Otherwise, we are going to have to vote against \nthe sense-of-the-Senate resolution of the Senator from North Dakota, \nand I urge my colleagues to support the sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nthat Senator Nickles, Senator Hutchison, I, and others have sponsored. \nIt is the right thing, it is the fair thing, and it is the honest thing \nto do for the American people so they are not misled that our action \nlast year in repealing the death tax is for all time.

Mr. President, I hope my colleagues are joined in making \npermanent the repeal of the death tax, and we can express that is our \nintention when we vote on this tomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Jeffords). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a different tack from some of my \nDemocratic colleagues and say to the Senator from Arizona and others \nwho have expressed his point of view that I understand and respect his \nsentiment as one which reflects also accurately what I have heard from \na lot of Minnesota farmers, a lot of Minnesota business owners \nthroughout the State.\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\n  I am convinced, regardless of what my particular view might be and \nregardless of what the facts of the situation might be, that any farmer \nor business person or probably anybody who has accumulated some estate \nwho even believes it is possible that he or she will ultimately be \naffected by this tax considers it onerous. I can see for those it does \nimpact, they consider it onerous.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona that the decision made a year \nago by the Congress, signed into law, to finally repeal the estate tax \nentirely in the year 2010 and then reverse that repeal and go back to \nthe pre-2001 tax level is nonsensical, absurd, and should have been \nrecognized last year for what it was, which was an attempt--in fact, a \nsuccessful effort--to compress 10 years of tax cuts permitted by the \nbudget resolution into the first 9 years of the budget so we would face \nexactly this predicament and there would be, as the Senator said, and \nproperly so, no logical explanation to the American people for why \nthese tax cuts which occurred over those 9 years are suddenly all going \nto disappear in the 10th year.\n  In fact, I think that argument can equally apply to the reduction in \nthe rates which would also go back to their pre-2001 levels if no \nchange is made. The child tax credit, which will go up to $1,000 per \nchild, reverts back down to its pre-2001 $500 level.\n  I agree with the Senator what was done last year was nonsensical, and \nany rational person trying to look into that situation, any tax \nplanning expert advising someone about his or her tax plan decisions, \nespecially as that year 2011 approaches, is going to say what it is, \nand with which I agree: It is nonsensical and ridiculous to conduct tax \npolicy in that way.\n  I invite the Senator from Arizona to work with me--and I look forward \nto doing so--to change this practice which I encountered last year \nwhich, for the first time, my first year--I understand the tactic, but \nI think it is fundamentally wrong no matter who perpetrates it, to be \nhaving tax changes phasing in, phasing out, and the like. These are the \nkinds of games and manipulations we all realize occur. No wonder the \nAmerican people do not think we have a Tax Code they can depend upon, \ntrust, that makes sense. They are right.\n  In my experience, just about any tax that is imposed upon people is \nconsidered onerous. As a policymaker, I guess I am left wondering which \nof those taxes, from the standpoint of perceived burden and actual \nburden, would be the prime candidates to be reduced if we had the \nresources to do so.\n  I certainly note that competing with the estate tax elimination, in \nterms of what taxes impact most Americans, the payroll tax would \ncertainly be my first candidate, especially as it affects the employee. \nSeventy-five percent of working Americans pay more out of their payroll \ntaxes than they do out of their income taxes. And certainly for \nemployers, for businesses, it is perceived as a cost and as an \nimpediment to hiring additional people.\n  Another inequity we will face over this next decade as it stands \ntoday is some 39 million Americans will be bumped up against the \nalternative minimum tax by the year 2011 under current law.\n  We should remedy all of those inequities. The bottom line is, and \nwhat Senator Conrad was asking his colleagues to recognize tonight, and \nwhat the American people need to understand about the course that we \nare about to head down, is we cannot afford to make all of these tax \ncuts and all of the spending increases which the President's budget \nproposes without seriously weakening the financial strength of this \ncountry so that in a decade, at the end of this 10-year budget period, \nwe are likely to be unable to meet the increased demands of Social \nSecurity and medical benefits of an aging population.\n  If we take the President's budget, assume that the Congress does not \nchange one thing about it, and then apply the Office of Management and \nBudget, the administration's own fiscal expert, consequences of that \nbudget, as Senator Conrad said, and it bears repeating, for those next \n10 years every dollar in the Federal Government's operating budget, the \nsurpluses, will be eliminated. All of the surpluses in the Medicare \ntrust fund for every 1 of those 10 years will be eliminated. Sixty \npercent of the Social Security trust fund surpluses, totaling $1.5 \ntrillion during that time, will have to be spent to pay for the \noperating deficits which will result, leaving at the end of those 10 \nyears in the fiscal year 2012, $1 trillion of surpluses in the Social \nSecurity trust fund, and $1.9 trillion of debt that has not been paid \nbecause of this additional spending--national debt that, I might add, \nwas projected originally a year ago to have been eliminated by the end \nof these 10 years.\n  So I repeat, if we, today, were to adopt the budget which the \nPresident has sent to the Congress, without a change, if the economy of \nthis country over the next decade performs according to OMB's \nassumptions, which are that we will come out of the recession quickly, \nwe will boost up above average GDP, and then we will continue at a rate \nfor the rest of the decade that will result in a decade average of 3.1 \npercent real growth in GDP; in other words a reasonably optimistic \neconomic assumption sustained over 10 years--low inflation, 2.1 \npercent, unemployment staying at 4.9 percent, good economic \nconditions--we will still face $849 billion in deficits in our \noperating budgets which have to be made up by Social Security and \nMedicare trust fund dollars.\n\n  At that point, we end up facing the proposal of Senator Kyl and \nothers that we should eliminate the estate tax permanently during that \nfollowing decade, which the Congressional Budget Office predicts would \ncost $4 trillion. If we look at the numbers, we will see we cannot \nafford to sacrifice another $4 trillion in tax revenues during that \ntime.\n  The Social Security payments are going to increase. The national debt \nhas not been eliminated. Frankly, I am not even as concerned about that \ndecade, at least not tonight, as I am about the decisions we will be \nmaking over the next few weeks and months that will affect what \nprecedes that decade.\n  I assume Senator Kyl's amendment will pass tomorrow. It is a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution. It has no force of law. It does not start to \ntake effect until the year 2011. That is about as easy a tax cut vote \nas anybody can ever hope for.\n  I implore my Republican colleagues, I implore all of my Senate \ncolleagues, to review the President's budget proposals and to review \nSenator Conrad's predictions because they essentially agree. They say \nif that budget is adopted, we are heading into another decade-long \nspree of cutting taxes. We did last year. Now some want to accelerate \nthose tax cuts. We want to make some of those tax cuts permanent in \nfollowing decades--popular decisions, every one of them not in context.\n  We are proposing to embark on a major military spending spree, $451 \nbillion of additional defense spending in the next 5 years compounded \nthrough the next 5 years, spending that we are not paying for with the \ntax cuts; that we are paying for with the Medicare and Social Security \ntrust funds. Those are the unavoidable realities, the unpleasant \nrealities that we would prefer to avoid. If we do that, we will \njeopardize the long-term financial security of this Nation.\n  If we repeat what occurred in the 1980s and send this country down \nthe path of ongoing budget deficits, we will bequeath to our children \nand those who follow a fiscal nightmare of unprecedented proportions. \nRegardless of what we do tomorrow with the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, the real decisions we are going to face in the months ahead \nwill not be those kinds of cosmetics. They will be real commitments to \ntax cuts and to spending increases that will be sweet and appealing at \nthe time, but the reality is they will jeopardize this country's \nfinancial strength and stability.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2851\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement that \nhas been adopted on amendment No. 2851, the Domenici amendment on \ndairy, that debate must occur this evening. The provision provides for \n2 minutes of debate tomorrow prior to the vote, equally divided. \nSenator Domenici is not able to be present. Earlier today, on his \nbehalf, I offered the amendment with a short argument.\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\n  I ask that the Chair call up amendment No. 2851.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I may \nrequire from the 10 minutes provided to the proponents of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President I will read from a letter which Senator \nDomenici has written to his colleagues in the Senate in support of \namendment No. 2851:\n\n       I ask you to join me in making the dairy title of the farm \n     bill equitable to all producers across the country. There is \n     currently $2 billion available in S. 1731 over the next five \n     years for the dairy program. However, the dairy title of the \n     farm bill currently under consideration on the Senate floor \n     gives special treatment to 12 states at the expense of the \n     remaining 38. Specifically, those producers in the 12 New \n     England states currently producing 18% of our nation's milk, \n     will receive a disproportionate 25% in producer payments. \n     This is inconsistent with the vast majority of other programs \n     where the loan rate, or payment rate for a particular \n     commodity is the same for producers all across the country. \n     There is no market justification for this type of division.\n       FAPRI analysis of S. 1731 shows that the response to these \n     payments would result in depressed market prices. By the last \n     year of the program, estimates predict that income to dairy \n     farmers in every state would be reduced. This is a reduction \n     on all milk--not just milk of a certain level of production. \n     Thus, producers whose milk is not eligible for the payments \n     will be receiving less money for their milk than if the \n     payments were not made at all. To be fair, those producers \n     should not have to pay for this policy. All producers should \n     be allowed to fully participate.\n       I ask that you support an amendment that will be offered on \n     my behalf that will distribute this $2 billion in a more \n     equitable manner. The program that I propose is national in \n     scope.\n       Dairy prices can change rapidly from month to month. Rather \n     than burden the Secretary with the costs of computing payment \n     rates and making monthly payments, I propose to streamline \n     this process and make an annual flat payment to producers \n     over the next five years which will approximate the counter-\n     cyclical payments they would receive if computed and paid \n     like other commodities. Estimates show that rate to be \n     approximately 31.5 cents per hundredweight on all milk \n     produced. Under this approach, administrative costs will be \n     reduced and payment uncertainties will be eliminated. A \n     payment on all milk will provide, in gross dollars, as much \n     or more money to virtually all states. A table illustrating \n     this is attached.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         COMPARISON OF PRODUCER PAYMENTS DASCHLE SUBSTITUTE--DOMENICI

Daschle Substitute are from Ken Bailey. Penn State Staff paper #344, December 20, 2001. Analysis of the Dairy Provisions in the\n  Senate Version of the Farm Bill. Payments in the NE Program had to be reduced to keep within the 500 million budgetary cap.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. I continue reading:\n\n       I also propose the elimination of caps on payments to \n     producers based upon production. This is a fairness issue. \n     Since 1983, dairy producers have paid assessments for their \n     programs. These assessments have always been without \n     limitation. Now that there are payments, these producers \n     should benefit from the same policy--payments without \n     limitations.\n       A well known dairy economist with Penn State University, \n     using recent historical prices, estimated that payments for \n     the Northeast farmers would be from 24 cents to 91 cents per \n     hundredweight with an average of 57 cents. At the same time \n     producers elsewhere would receive from nothing to 35 cents \n     with a mid point of 14 cents.\n       Producers in the same marketing orders who share the same \n     blend prices and the same markets, could be treated vastly \n     different under S. 1731. These producers are members of the \n     same cooperatives, use the same trucking companies and \n     otherwise participate in a single market. Yet, some in the \n     market order stand to make 3 to 4 times as much as their \n     neighbors, while market prices in the rest of the country are \n     significantly reduced as a result of the disparity.\n       Again, I urge you to join me in making the dairy title \n     equitable to all producers. If you\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\n     are interested in co-sponsoring this legislation or need \n     additional information, please contact Shelly Randel at 224-\n     1964.\n\n  I wish Senator Domenici were here to make the statement himself and \nto further amplify the equity of his program, but common sense would \ndictate that there should be equity among the States. Clearly, there is \nnot. Clearly, dairy farmers with almost identical conditions and \nidentical cooperatives should have equitable treatment. S. 1731 clearly \ndoes not accomplish that.\n  Therefore, I commend the Domenici amendment to Senators. I am hopeful \nwhen the debate concludes tomorrow after the 2 minutes, 1 minute a side \nto summarize, that Senators will vote in favor of the Domenici \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I will ask again that a quorum call be \ninstituted with the time evenly divided between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to bring to the Senate's \nattention an issue that I hope we might continue to work on during the \nconference on the farm bill. Last year President Bush set a theme that \nwe ``should not leave any child behind.'' While the world has certainly \nchanged in the past year, I believe that one of the reasons we will \nsucceed in the war against terrorism is that we understand the \nimportance of leaving no child behind. It is my hope that as we work \nthrough this conference we will keep our children's health as a top \npriority.\n  The Food Stamp Act provides assistance to millions of children living \nin the United States. In 1980, Congress removed Puerto Rico from the \nfood stamp program as a budget-cutting initiative and established in \nits place the Nutrition Assistance Program, a block grant for Puerto \nRico to provide a modified Food Stamp Program. The Nutrition Assistance \nProgram in Puerto Rico known as NAP, provides support to over 400,000 \nchildren.\n  Over the past year, Puerto Rico's Governor Sila Calderon and her \nadministration have moved aggressively and voluntarily to complete \nimplementation of an Electronic Benefits System for the nutrition \nprogram. The Commonwealth thus joins the 50 States as they modernize \ntheir food stamp distribution services to ensure authorized purchases \nby the individuals for whom the benefits were intended. They have \nworked effectively with the USDA's Food and Nutrition Service to \nstrengthen the administration of the program to ensure that limited \ndollars are stretched to the maximum.\n  However, as of 2000, the annual purchasing power of NAP was $147 \nmillion less than when it was enacted 22 years ago, compared to the \ncost of household food on the mainland. If you use the index measuring \nthe increased cost of food in Puerto Rico, you find that the purchasing \npower of the program has fallen by almost $1 billion.\n  The loss of purchasing power has real effects on real children. If \nyou look at the NAP and compare it to the Federal Food Stamp Program, \nyou find that the program, 1, does not provide similar benefits; and 2, \nthe budget limitations have excluded many low-income children in Puerto \nRico from participation in the program.\n  For example, the Food Stamp Program's monthly income limitation is \n$1,531 for a family of three on the mainland and in the Virgin Islands, \nbut the NAP program must limit participation in the program to families \nof three whose income is $558. This amount equals about 47% of the \nFederal poverty level, while participation in the Federal Food Stamp \nProgram is extended to those whose incomes are less than 150% of the \nFederal poverty level.\n  The NAP maximum benefit level for the family of three is $268 as \ncompared to $341 for food stamps on the mainland and $431 on the Virgin \nIslands. this problem becomes even more egregious when the cost of \npurchasing essential food items is compared between Puerto Rico and the \nmainland. For example, a gallon of milk in San Juan costs $3.89 \ncompared to $2.87 in Washington, D.C.\n  When Congress established the Nutritional Assistance Program it was \nour intent to reduce cost and permit the Commonwealth flexibility in \nproviding nutrition support. We certainly did not intend to create a \ngap such as the one that now exists between these two programs.\n  Puerto Rico's children are U.S. citizens who deserve a greater \nopportunity for nutritional support. These young men and women will \nserve in the U.S. military, they will pay Social Security, Medicare and \nunemployment taxes, and they are expected to compete in the U.S. labor \nmarket. I believe that we need to ensure that children who are U.S. \ncitizens and live in Puerto Rico are not left behind when it comes to \nnutrition.\n  I look forward to working with the distinguished chairman; the \ndistinguished ranking member Senator Lugar; and the other conferees to \nexamine alternatives for providing resources to the Nutrition \nAssistance Program so that there is some narrowing of the gap between \nthe Federal Food Stamp Program and the Nutrition Assistance Program.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his excellent work on this issue, and \nI look forward to working with him to advance this cause.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks of my friend, the distinguished Senator from Vermont. As I have \nindicated in remarks throughout the Senate's deliberations on this \nbill, nutrition assistance is of paramount importance for enhancing our \nnation's security. I am familiar with the Nutrition Assistance Program \nin Puerto Rico and recognize the importance of adjusting benefit levels \nand income requirements for inflation. This is why Senator Cochran and \nI worked together on legislation, 2 years ago, that now provides such \nan adjustment. I look forward to working with Senator Leahy, Chairman \nHarkin and the other conferees in the conference on this bill to \nexplore this issue by assessing the needs of low-income Puerto Ricans \nand possible means of addressing those needs.\n\n\n                             peanut program\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ndistinguished colleague from Georgia, Mr. Miller, regarding the peanut \ntitle of the proposed farm bill.\n  My colleague represents the largest peanut growing State and I \nrepresent one of the largest peanut product manufacturing States. I \ncompliment him for his leadership and I am pleased by the efforts of \nthe Agriculture Committee in moving to a market-oriented peanut \nprogram. My foremost concern is for elimination of the peanut quota \nsystem, which has restricted peanut production in the United States. Do \nthe provisions of this farm bill terminate the peanut quota program?\n  Mr. MILLER. Yes, the legislative language of this farm bill \nexplicitly terminates the peanut quota system effective with the 2002 \ncrop. The bill also provides that the Secretary of Agriculture is to \nenter into contracts that will compensate quota owners for the lost of \ntheir quota.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I believe such provisions are useful, but I would like \nto have the compensation to quota owners terminated 1 year before the \nend of this 5-year farm bill. I have no problem with the House bill, \nwhich buys out quota owners over a 5-year period in the context of a \n10-year farm bill.\n  Mr. MILLER. If we end up with a 5-year farm bill as a result of the \nHouse-Senate conference, my quota owners would have no problem in \nhaving their quota bought our over 4 years. Therefore, I commit to the \nSenator to work with the House-Senate conferees to ensure that we end \nthe quota owner buy-out contract 1 year shy of any farm bill \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank my colleague for this unquestioned commitment \nto finding an agreeable resolution. I understand that these reforms\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\nmay be difficult for some of his peanut quota growers. However, if we \nfail to provide real reform of the peanut program we will have done a \ngreat disservice to the entire U.S. peanut sector.\n  Mr. MILLER. Ever-expanding peanut imports are threatening the current \nand future viability of the peanut industry in Georgia and other \npeanut-producing and manufacturing states. Peanut growers, shellers, \nand manufacturers will come under increasing pressure as peanut \nproduction and peanut processing infrastructure moves offshore. I am \npleased to say that this new peanut program offers a positive \nresolution for the entire peanut industry, and the new program ensures \nthat the U.S. peanut sector is competitive in the world marketplace.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I applaud the leadership and foresight of the Senator \nfrom Georgia in developing a peanut program that truly brings needed \nreform to the program while presenting new opportunities for young \npeanut farmers.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I wish to enter a short colloquy with \nthe Senator from Iowa, Chairman of the Agriculture Committee and the \nfloor manager of this bill. As you know, the manager's amendment \ncontains a provision designed to remedy problems that transpired last \nyear in the programs governed by Public Law 107-25. My question is \nwhether this remedy applies to farmers eligible for payments and \nassistance under Public Law 107-25, but who were denied payments and \nassistance because their cases were under appeal when the September 30, \n2001 deadline passed.\n  As the distinguished Senator might know, several Missouri farmers did \nnot receive payments and assistance they were entitled to under Public \nLaw 107-25. It was impossible for these Missouri farmers to meet their \nSeptember 30 deadline because their cases were under appeal. They \nreceived no payments even though it was eventually determined that they \nwere eligible for assistance. So, by no fault of their own, several \nMissouri family farmers face ominous financial situations without the \nclarifications provided in this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I commend the Senator's work on behalf of Missouri family \nfarmers and thank her for her consideration of this amendment. This \namendment will indeed apply to farmers who were under appeal status \nwhen the deadline passed but later were found to be in compliance and \neligible for payments and assistance under Public Law 107-25. The \namendment provides that they will receive payments for which they were \neligible and have not received. I am pleased that this amendment will \nhelp Missouri farmers facing difficult situations.\n\n\n                               Nutrition\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized for the purpose of \nengaging in a colloquy with my good friends, the distinguished senior \nSenators from Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Minnesota. Each \nof us worked closely with the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member \nof the Committee on Agriculture to ensure that the nutrition title of \nthe pending legislation represents an important step forward to improve \nthe program's ability to help low-income children, working poor, and \nthe elderly. As a former chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I know \nthe importance of achieving balance in a farm bill. To ensure broad, \nbipartisan and bicameral support, a farm bill must have a strong \nnutrition title that benefits urban and suburban areas that feel less \nof a direct stake in the agricultural provisions of the bill. I think \nthe pending legislation has that. Unfortunately, the bill passed by the \nother body earlier this fall does not. A mere $3.6 billion out of a \n$73.5 billion farm bill does not come close to representing balance and \nleaves unmet too many of the urgent nutritional needs of low-income \nfamilies in urban, suburban, and rural areas alike.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This farm bill makes important progress in ensuring the \nnutritional well-being of low-income children. The food stamp program \nis by far our nation's largest and most important child nutrition \nprogram. Over half of all food stamp recipients are children. Four-\nfifths of all food stamp benefits go to families with children. Despite \nits important mission, however, this program has been in trouble. Fully \nhalf of the savings in the 1996 welfare law came from budget-driven \ncuts in food stamp benefits. Since then, sharp reductions in the \nparticipation rate among eligible households have produced huge \nadditional problems. As a result, significant unmet need exists among \nlow-income children in our country. This legislation takes important \nsteps to address these problems. It recognizes that one of the clear \nconsequences of welfare reform is that children have been hurt. It was \nnever the intention of the 1996 law to cut off these children. This \nlegislation restores benefits to all children to eliminate confusion, \nand to encourage parents to apply for benefits on behalf of their \nchildren. In addition, this legislation recognizes that families with \nchildren have greater living expenses than single individuals, and it \nadjusts the food stamp standard deduction accordingly. It relies on the \nfundamental concept, similar to the concept in legislation I introduced \nlast year with Senator Specter, that food stamp benefits should not \nstart to phase down until a family's income is nine percent above the \npoverty line. By providing more adequate food assistance benefits to \nchildren, we can help ensure that they go to school ready to learn and \ngrow up to be strong, healthy, productive members of our society.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Accordingly, one of the most important aspects of the \nnutrition title of this legislation is its sensitivity to the needs of \nlegal immigrants and their families. Immigrants come to this country \ntoday for the same reasons that have brought them here throughout our \nhistory: to live in freedom and the opportunity to earn a better life \nfor themselves and their families through hard work. Unfortunately, \nmany immigrants, like other workers in this country, will at times find \nit difficult to obtain work. Others may be unable to work for a period \nof time because of workplace injuries or family illnesses. To prevent \nthese hard-working, tax-paying families from suffering serious \nhardship, it is vital that we extend our country's nutritional safety \nnet, the food stamp program, to more legal immigrants, particularly \nimmigrant children. Unlike its counterpart in the other chamber, the \nnutrition title of this legislation does just that. I am proud to \nsupport that effort.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. While falling somewhat short of what I had hoped for \nin terms of nutrition funding, this legislation nonetheless makes \nimportant strides to help ensure that the most vulnerable among us are \nnot left without adequate nutrition in this land of plenty. Refugees \nand asylees, who enter this country to escape foreign oppression, could \nreceive food stamps for as long as they need them without having to \nworry about an arbitrary time limit such as the one in current law. \nChildless unemployed adults could receive six months of food stamps \nwithin a twenty-four month period designated by the state. This is \nstill a harsh provision, tougher than the provision that twice passed \nthe Senate in the mid-1990s with bipartisan support. Nonetheless, it \nwould give more people enough time to find new employment before their \nfood stamp eligibility runs out. The legislation also preserves a $25 \nmillion fund to help these states provide work slots to persons \nreaching this time limit. The legislation also helps the very poorest \nof the poor by increasing the standard deduction and by providing \ntransitional food stamps to persons leaving welfare because they \nobtained low-paying jobs or because they reached a time limit.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I fully concur with and support the comments of all four \nof my distinguished colleagues that have just spoken on the nutrition \ntitle of the farm bill. In addition to the many important features of \nthe bill highlighted in their remarks, I would like to add that this \nlegislation also takes major steps to simplify the program. Households \nwould be permitted to report on changes in their circumstances by \nfilling out a simple form every six months rather than having to take \ntime off from work to visit the food stamp office, as often happens \ntoday. The cumbersome recertification process would be replaced by the \nsame kind of redetermination process long used in the SSI and Medicaid \nprograms. The crucial excess shelter deduction would be retained. This \nis essential to protect families in cold weather states like Vermont \nfrom facing the cruel choice\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nbetween heating and eating. Nonetheless, legislation would greatly \nsimplify the calculation of households' utility costs. States would be \ngiven the option to conform their definitions of income and resources \nin the food stamp program to those they use in other programs. This \nshould allow states to eliminate unnecessary questions from their \napplication forms. In simplifying the program, this legislation strives \nto protect families in need from experiencing hardship. Simplification \nshould be a means of helping the program serve families better, not an \nend unto itself. I believe the simplification provisions in this \nlegislation meet that test. As a result, this legislation makes \nimportant progress toward simplifying the program in ways that the \nbenefit of State administrators and needy families alike.\n\n\n                     MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM FUNDING\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I \nfiled to the farm bill that would enhance funding for the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Market Access Program. I appreciate the \nsupport and cosponsorship of Senators Feinstein, Craig, Cantwell, \nBoxer, and Wyden on this amendment.\n  Last year, the House of Representatives passed Trade Promotion \nauthority by one vote, and the World Trade Organization meetings in \nDoha wrapped up with an agreement to begin a new round of trade \nnegotiations. In Washington, D.C., and in the capitals of nation's \naround the world, it appears that momentum is building to expand trade.\n  But in rural areas in my home State, the support for new trade \nagreements is declining. Apple growers in Omak, WA and asparagus \ngrowers in the Yakima Valley are asking tough questions about our trade \nagreements.\n  Washington State is the most trade-dependent State in the nation. I \nhave supported opening new markets for our products, whether it's \nairplanes or apples. I have also been a strong supporter of giving our \nfarmers and businesses and tools they need to compete.\n  The global marketplace is tough, extremely competitive, and not \nalways based on free market principles. Foreign governments have taken \nan aggressive posture in promoting their products. We need to be \naggressive too.\n  One way we can be aggressive is to fully fund the Market Access \nProgram. MAP helps nonprofit industry groups and other qualifying \nentities to conduct market promotion in foreign markets. MAP funds can \nbe used for advertising and other consumer promotions, market research, \nand technical assistance.\n  In my home State of Washington, I have seen how MAP can help farmers, \ncooperatives, and small businesses. For example, each year, the apple \nindustry receives roughly $3 million in export development funds from \nthe USDA Market Access Program.\n  These funds, matched by grower funds, are used to promote U.S. apples \nin more than 20 countries throughout the world. Since 1987, when the \napple industry first used MAP funds, apple exports have increased by 88 \npercent. Nearly one-quarter of fresh U.S. apple production is exported \neach year, with an estimated value of nearly $400 million.\n  If we are not aggressive, we will not gain market share.\n  My amendment would have modified the Senate Farm Bill to fund MAP at \n$200 million by 2004, and brought the Senate bill more in line with the \nHouse-passed Farm Bill, which funds MAP at $200 million beginning in \nfiscal year 2002. While it may not be possible to fully fund MAP at \n$200 million in fiscal year 2002, I strongly support funding MAP at \nthis level beginning in fiscal year 2003.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I want to begin by thanking Senator Feinstein for her \nstrong advocacy for additional Market Access Program funding. I also \nwant to commend the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, \nSenator Harkin, for writing a strong trade title in this Farm Bill. It \nis clear to me that Senator Harkin understands how critical USDA trade \nprograms are to our farmers and ranchers, and to hungry nations around \nthe world.\n  I am concerned, however, about the level of funding for the Market \nAccess Program in the early years of this Farm Bill. I was prepared to \noffer an amendment to the Farm Bill to add $145 million to the Market \nAccess Program, so that we would fund MAP at $200 million sooner than \nin the underlying bill. Unfortunately, some controversy arose over the \noffset for my amendment.\n  I would ask Senator Feinstein if she believes we need to fund the \nMarket Access Program at $200 million as soon as possible in the final \nFarm Bill.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I agree very strongly with the Senator from \nWashington that we need to fund the Market Access Program at $200 \nmillion.\n  If American agriculture is to remain competitive, we must ensure that \nour farmers are given the same support that their foreign competitors \nreceive.\n  Heavily subsidized foreign citrus entering the U.S. has quadrupled \nover the last five years, significantly lowering prices domestically \nfor California growers. In the European Union alone, government \nsubsidization of the fresh produce sector reaches upwards of $15 \nbillion each year.\n  The Market Access Program provides new jobs--jobs for longshoremen, \njobs in processing, jobs in transportation, and of course, jobs for \ngrowers.\n  The Market Access Program is an important tool in expanding markets \nfor U.S. agricultural products.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that each dollar spent \non the Market Access Program results in an increase in agricultural \nexports of between $2 and $7.\n  Small farmers especially benefit from this program because they would \nnot be able to break into these foreign markets on their own.\n  The Market Access Program helps create and protect U.S. jobs, combat \ninequitable trade practices, improve the U.S. balance of trade, and \nimprove farm income.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for her leadership on this issue. \nI look forward to continuing our work together on increasing funding \nfor this valuable program. To the distinguished Chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee, thank you for your continued help and support.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from California for her remarks. I \nwould ask the Senator from Iowa if he supports raising MAP funding to \n$200 million as soon as possible in the final Farm Bill that is sent to \nPresident Bush.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I want to thank the Senators from Washington and \nCalifornia for their strong advocacy for the Market Access Program. I \nbelieve this is an indispensable program, particularly for specialty \ncrop producers around the country.\n  To answer the question raised by the Senators from Washington and \nCalifornia, I agree we need to fund MAP at $200 million. The conference \ncommittee will have to address many difficult issues, however I believe \nit is a reasonable goal to try to fund MAP at $200 million as soon as \npossible, recognizing that it may take some time for USDA to ramp up \nthe program effectively.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from Iowa for his strong support for \nthe Market Access Program and the specialty crop growers in my state.\n\n\n                        MILK PROTEIN CONCENTRATE\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I planned to offer an amendment to \nthe Senate farm bill that would close the milk protein concentrate \nloophole.\n  During the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations, the United \nStates agreed to allow a substantial increase in dairy product imports \ninto this country. Tariff-rate quotas were established to allow imports \nof most dairy products to rise from an average of 2 percent of domestic \nconsumption to as much as 5 percent.\n  Until recently, these controls have been effective, but foreign \nexporters now have found ways to circumvent these quotas. Importers are \nadjusting the protein content of nonfat dry milk so that it is \nclassified by the U.S. Customs Service as milk protein concentrate, or \nMPC, a product that is not limited by a tariff-rate quota\n  There is no tariff-rate quota on MPC because it was a relatively new \nproduct when the Uruguay Round WTO agreement was negotiated.\n  In March 2001, a General Accounting Office study requested by \nCongress determined that MPC imports have surged by more than 600 \npercent in just 6 years. MPC imports doubled between 1998 and 1999 \nalone. According to the GAO study, it appears that some foreign \nexporters are blending previously\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\nprocessed dairy proteins, such as casein and whey, into nonfat dry milk \nto boost its protein content. This is being done solely for the purpose \nof avoiding the U.S. tariff-rate quota for nonfat dry milk. This \npractice, specifically cited in the GAO report, circumvents statutory \nregulations designed to restrict imports of nonfat dry milk powder.\n  I have introduced legislation, S. 847, that would close this loophole \nby regulating MPC imports in the same manner all other dairy product \nimports are regulated, by establishing new tariff-rate quotas on MPC. \nIt also would close a similar loophole that exists for casein used in \nthe production of food or feed, while continuing to allow unrestricted \naccess for imports of casein used in the manufacture of glues and for \nother industrial purposes.\n  The Minnesota Farmers Union, the Minnesota Milk Producers, the \nNational Milk Producers Federation, and the National Farmers Union \nstrongly support this bill. I have worked closely with these \norganizations over the past year to find an appropriate legislative \nvehicle for my bill, and that is why I am now offering this legislation \nto the Senate Farm Bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Minnesota for \nhis hard work on behalf of U.S. dairy farmers. This bill, however, \nproperly falls under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance Committee. \nAs chair of the finance Committee, I will work with the Senator from \nMinnesota to bring the issue to the attention of the Finance Committee \nmembers and to find an appropriate legislative vehicle for his proposal \nthis session.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his \nstrong support for U.S. dairy farmers. I respectfully withdraw my plans \nto offer this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S653-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, Division C of Public Law 107-117, the \nDepartment of Defense and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for \nRecovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States \nAct of 2002, increased the statutory limits on discretionary spending \nfor fiscal year 2002. Specifically, it raised the cap on general \npurpose discretionary budget authority to $681.441 billion and the cap \non general purpose discretionary outlays to $670.206 billion. The \nlegislation also increased the cap on outlays for conservation programs \nto $1.473 billion. Accordingly, I am adjusting the Appropriations \nCommittee's allocation and the budget aggregates to reflect the revised \nstatutory caps.\n  In addition, Mr. President, section 314 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, as amended, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto adjust the budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the \nAppropriations Committee by the amount of appropriations designated as \nemergency spending pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. Public \nLaw 107-38, the 2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \nRecovery from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States, \nauthorized $40 billion in emergency funding. Public Law 107-38 made the \nfirst $20 billion immediately available in fiscal year 2001 and the \nsecond $20 billion contingent on the enactment of a subsequent \nappropriation.\n  Mr. President, I previously adjusted the committee's allocation and \nthe budget aggregates for the 2002 impact on outlays from the first $20 \nbillion provided in 2001. Public Law 107-117, which was signed into law \non January 10, 2002, made available the second $20 billion in emergency \nspending. That budget authority will result in new outlays in 2002 of \n$8.223 billion. Consequently, I am making further adjustments to the \ncommittee's allocation and to the budget aggregates.\n  Pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 allocation provided to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in the concurrent budget resolution in the following amounts:\n\n     TABLE 1.--REVISED ALLOCATION FOR APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget\n                                                 authority     Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent allocation:\n  General purpose discretionary...............      549,744      551,379\n  Highways....................................            0       28,489\n  Mass transit................................            0        5,275\n  Conservation................................        1,760        1,232\n  Mandatory...................................      358,567      350,837\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................      901,071      937,212\n                                               =========================\nAdjustments:\n  General purpose discretionary...............      154,496      141,338\n  Highways....................................            0            0\n  Mass transit................................            0            0\n  Conservation................................            0          241\n  Mandatory...................................            0            0\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................      154,496      141,579\n                                               =========================\nRevised allocation:\n  General purpose discretionary...............      704,240      692,717\n  Highways....................................            0       28,489\n  Mass transit................................            0        5,275\n  Conservation................................        1,760        1,473\n  Mandatory...................................      358,567      350,837\n                                               -------------------------\n    Total.....................................    1,064,567    1,078,791\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Pursuant to section 311 of the Congressional Budget At, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 budget aggregates included in the concurrent budget \nresolution in the following amounts:\n\n                TABLE 2.--REVISED BUDGET AGGREGATES, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   Budget\n                                                 authority     Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent allocation: Budget resolution.........    1,520,019    1,498,600\nAdjustsments: Emergency and cap increases.....      154,496      141,579\nRevised allocation: Budget resolution.........    1,674,515    1,640,179\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                                                             \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S653-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the subject of eco-\nterrorism and the assault on our public lands. Eco-terrorism is \ndescribed as any crime committed in the name of saving nature. And \nthese ``crimes'' range from civil disobedience to crimes\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\nofficially designated as a terrorist act by the FBI. In January a band \nof criminals who call themselves the Earth Liberation Front (ELF) and \nthe North American Animal Liberation Front (ALF), released a report on \ntheir combined crime spree during 2001. They also chose to announce a \nday of national action for February 12th apparently to protest \nCongressional hearings on their activities.\n  While I agree that our public lands needs to be saved for the use of \nfuture generations, I believe this should be accomplished through \nactive lands management that promotes the mission statements of our \npublic lands agencies. I denounce those who believe that saving nature \nmeans driving metal spikes through trees or burning buildings, actions \nthat threaten human lives.\n  While these folks characterize burning down research centers, homes, \nand businesses as a form of self-expression protected by the First \nAmendment, most Americans would question these wrongheaded beliefs. \nNeither our government nor the American public will support the \nactivities of ELF and ALF.\n  These groups of eco-terrorist hide from the law, there organizations \nhave no rosters, no board of directors; they work in ``cells''; and \nthey use guerrilla warfare tactics so as not to inform on others. They \ncarry out their acts and then anonymously take credit on behalf of the \nEarth Liberation Front. They feel it is their duty to commit life-\nthreatening crimes against society to protect nature. Yet they post \nguidelines on underground websites and give directions as to how to \nspike trees and build bombs.\n  Insurance companies are also starting to recognize the risk of eco-\nterrorism by broadening their definitions of ``terrorist activities/\norganizations'' and increasing premiums. As a result, the timber \nindustry is bearing a greater financial burden. If a group that meets \nthe insurance industry definition burns or destroys any equipment, it \nis NOT covered by insurance. Insurance companies intend to include \nEarth First!, ELF, and ALF in these new definitions.\n  Let me give my colleagues, an example of this change. The coverage \npremium for a helicopter was $10,200 for $5,000,000 liability coverage. \nThe premium increased to $24,000 for $1,000,000 worth of coverage. This \nis a 140 percent increase in premium for an 80 percent decrease in \ncoverage. This is outrageous! Even the insurance companies recognize \nthe dangers involved in eco-terrorism.\n  The destruction by ELF and ALF has not been directed at just timber \ncompanies, though. Land grant universities are also a target because of \nthe research they provide. To those struggling to pay for the education \nof their college-age children, the recent ELF and ALF 2001 action \nreport makes for interesting reading. The ELF and ALF claim to have \ndestroyed parts, or all, of several buildings at four major land grant \nuniversities and to have attempted to burn down additional buildings at \nseveral other universities.\n\n  Administrators faced with the cost of rebuilding facilities as well \nas recreating important research surely now question ELF's definition \nof ``nonviolent.'' The list of ELF and ALF actions against our \neducational system is sobering. It includes the University of \nWashington--Center for Urban Horticulture, $5.6 million; the Oregon \nState University--destroyed poplar trees and cottonwood trees, \n$200,000; the University of Arizona--Mt. Graham International \nObservatory power line, equipment and vehicles monkey wrenched, \n$200,000; the University of Idaho--Biotech building spray painted and \nsurvey stakes pulled, $20,000; the Ohio State University--locks on \ndoors super-glued and spray painted, no cost estimate; the Michigan \nTech University--Noblet Forestry Building and Forest Engineering Lab \nattempted arson, no cost estimate; and the Cornell University--Duck \nLaboratory ducks stolen, no cost estimate.\n  The ELF continued its reign of terror as recently as February 3 when \nit set fire to heavy equipment and a trailer at the University of \nMinnesota's new plant genetics laboratory.\n  We're not just talking about the destruction of inanimate public \nproperty here. What of the thousands of hours of research that were \ndestroyed in these senseless not-so-random acts of violence? Is it fair \nto the scientists whose work was destroyed in these facilities, to tell \nthem the American public thinks so little of their work that we will \naccept these acts as legitimate political statements? Some of these \nscientists have spent a career working on this research, working to \ndiscover ways to make our world and our lives better.\n  Some advocates demand we protect bio-diversity by setting aside vast \nareas of forests because they believe a potential cure for cancer or \nsome other disease may be found in these forests. Shouldn't we also be \nconcerned about the potential cures for cancer and other diseases, or \nother technological advances, that might have been under development at \nthese research centers? The destruction of these buildings and the \nresearch housed within these institutions is no less important than the \nbio-diversity harbored in our forests. The American people, the press, \nthe Congress cannot stand by and ignore these events.\n  Given the number of training sessions carried out each summer by \nthese organizations, as well as the more mainline environmental groups \nthat teach impressionable young people how to destroy property, I \nexpect our federal government to put more effort into ending this \ndomestic terrorism. I'm also concerned about the financial support \ngroups such as ELF, ALF, the Ruckus Society, and others receive from \nthe large environmental trusts, and others, who support this unlawful \nbehavior. Grants to these organizations that result in the destruction \nof public and private property make the funding organizations \naccessories to these crimes.\n  When we turn a blind eye to these types of activities, and we tell \nourselves that these are just young people searching for meaning in \ntheir lives, or that these folks are only participating in the \npolitical process, we do ourselves and our neighbors a disservice.\n  When we stand idly by and tell ourselves that these are just timber \ncompanies or giant corporations that can afford these events, we \ndiminish ourselves, our society, and the freedom that we enjoy in this \ngreat country. The simple fact is: burning down buildings and \ndestroying research facilities and the research housed in those \nfacilities, is a crime, and there is no reason, political or other, \nthat this type of behavior should be accepted by anyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S654-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S654-S655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ``THE OTHER HALF OF THE JOB''\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last week the Washington Post ran an \nopinion piece authored by Michael McFaul, a professor of political \nscience at Stanford University, entitled ``The Other Half of the Job.''\n  Professor McFaul's thesis is that while the budget presented by the \nPresident last week contained a significant, and needed, increase in \nresources for the Department of Defense, it failed to provide a \nsignificant, and needed, increase for ``the other means for winning the \nwar on terrorism.'' The budget, Professor McFaul writes, ``builds[] \ngreater American capacity to destroy bad states, but it adds hardly any \nnew capacity to construct good states.''\n  I share Professor McFaul's concerns about the inadequacy of the \ninternational affairs budget, that is, the funds for the State \nDepartment and foreign assistance. The President's budget request for \nforeign affairs for Fiscal Year 2003 is actually less than the amount \nprovided in Fiscal Year 2002, if the funds provided in the emergency \nsupplemental after September 11 are included in the calculation. \nAmerica's armed forces are doing a brilliant job in the military \ncampaign in Afghanistan. But it will take American diplomats, and our \nassistance agencies, working with other partners, to win the peace. We \ncannot win the peace there, or prevent other failed states from \nbecoming havens for terrorism, without giving our people the tools they \nneed.\n  I commend Professor McFaul's article to my colleagues. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S655]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 5, 2002]\n\n                       The Other Half of the Job\n\n                          (By Michael McFaul)\n\n       The United States is at war. President Bush therefore has \n     correctly asked for Congress to approve additional resources \n     to fight this war. The new sums requested--$48 billion for \n     next year alone--are appropriately large. Bush and his \n     administration have astutely defined this new campaign as a \n     battle for civilization itself, and have wisely cautioned \n     that the battle lines will be multifaceted and untraditional.\n       So why are the new supplemental funds earmarked to fight \n     this new war largely conventional and single-faceted--i.e., \n     money for the armed forces? Without question, the Department \n     of Defense needs and deserves new resources to conduct the \n     next phase of the war on terrorism. The Department of Defense \n     may even need $48 billion for next year.\n       What is disburbing about President Bush's new budget, \n     though, is how little creative attention or new resources \n     have been devoted to the other means for winning the war on \n     terrorism. The Bush budget is building greater American \n     capacity to destroy bad states, but it adds hardly any new \n     capacity to construct new good states.\n       We should have learned the importance of following state \n     destruction with state construction, since the 20th century \n     offers up both positive and negative lessons. Many have \n     commented that our current war is new and unprecedented, but \n     it is not. Throughout the 20th century, the central purpose \n     of American power was to defend against and, when possible, \n     destroy tyranny.\n       American presidents have been at their best when they have \n     embraced the mission of defending liberty at home and \n     spreading liberty abroad. This was the task during World War \n     II. This was the objective (or should have been the mission) \n     during the Cold War. It must be our mission again.\n       The process of defeating the enemies of liberty is twofold: \n     Crush their regimes that harbor them and then build new \n     democratic, pro-Western regimes in the vacuum.\n       In the first half of the last century, imperial Japan and \n     fascist Germany constituted the greatest threats to American \n     national security. The destruction of these dictatorships, \n     followed by the imposition of democratic regimes in Germany \n     and Japan, helped make these two countries American allies.\n       In the second half of the last century, Soviet communism \n     and its supporters represented the greatest threat to \n     American national security. The collapse of Communist \n     autocracies in Europe and then the Soviet Union greatly \n     improved American national security. The emergency of \n     democracies in east Central Europe a decade ago and the fall \n     of dictators in southeast Europe more recently have radically \n     improved the European security climate, and therefore U.S. \n     national security interests. Democratic consolidation in \n     Russia, still an unfinished project, is the best antidote to \n     a return of U.S.-Russian rivalry.\n       The Cold War, however, also offers sad lessons of what can \n     happen when the United States carries out state destruction \n     of anti-Western, autocratic regimes without following through \n     with state construction of pro-Western, democratic regimes. \n     President Reagan rightly understood that the United States \n     had an interest in overthrowing Communist regimes around the \n     world. The Reagan doctrine channeled major resources to this \n     aim and achieved some successes, including most notably in \n     Afghanistan. State construction there, however, did not \n     follow state destruction. The consequences were tragic for \n     American national security.\n       So why is the Bush administration not devoting greater \n     capacity for state construction in parallel to increasing \n     resources for state destruction? Bush's pledge of $297 \n     million for Afghanistan for next year is commendable, but \n     this one-time earmark does not constitute a serious, \n     comprehensive strategy for state construction in Afghanistan \n     or the rest of the despotic world that currently threatens \n     the United States.\n       On the contrary, in the same year that the Department of \n     Defense is receiving an extra $48 billion, many U.S. aid \n     agencies will suffer budget cuts. Moreover, the experience of \n     the past decade of assistance in the post-Communist world \n     shows that aid works best in democratic regimes. Yet budgets \n     for democracy assistance in South Asia and the Middle East \n     are still minuscle. Strikingly, the theme of democracy \n     promotion was absent in President Bush's otherwise brilliant \n     State of the Union speech.\n       It is absolutely vital that the new regime in Afghanistan \n     succeed. Afghanistan is our new West Germany. The new regime \n     there must stand as a positive example to the rest of the \n     region of how rejection of tyranny and alliance with the West \n     can translate into democratic governance and economic growth. \n     And the United States must demonstrate to the rest of the \n     Muslim world that we take state construction--democratic \n     construction--as seriously as we do state destruction. Beyond \n     Afghanistan, the Bush administration must develop additional, \n     non-military tools for fighting the new war. To succeed, the \n     United States will need its full arsenal of political, \n     diplomatic, economic and military weapons. Bush's statements \n     suggest that he understands this imperative. Bush's budget, \n     however, suggests a divide between rhetoric and policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S655-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S655-S656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MINNESOTA CELEBRATES BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, February is a very special month for \npeople in Minnesota and throughout our country. It is ``Black History \nMonth,'' when all of us recognize the many outstanding achievements of \nAfrican-Americans and their important contributions to our nation. We \nalso honor the African-American men and women who achieved these \nsuccesses despite obstacles which would have defeated lesser people.\n  In 1926, Carter Woodson, considered by many to be the ``Father of \nBlack History,'' created Negro History Week. It evolved into Black \nHistory Week in the early 1970s. In 1976, February was chosen to be \nBlack History Month, because it included the birthdays of Frederick \nDouglass and Abraham Lincoln, both of whom made heroic contributions to \nthe lives of African-Americans in this country.\n  So throughout this month, let us celebrate the accomplishments of so \nmany African-American heroes. They dared to take risks to ensure a \nbetter way of life for all people, and the results of their courageous \nacts have been felt around the world.\n  Though we have come a long way in our battle for equal rights for all \nAmericans, there is still much to be done. We must be bolder in our \nefforts to ensure that Americans of every race have every opportunity \nto share in and contribute to our economic prosperity. That means \nquality education and health care and adequate housing for all \nAmericans. It means a good job with living wages, so that everyone can \nearn the American dream. And it means that our tax and budget policies \nmust spread their benefits across all social and economic lines.\n  We must intensify our push toward a justice system that is color \nblind in enacting and enforcing our laws. Hate crimes, prejudice, \nracial profiling, and discrimination must be eliminated now and \nforever.\n  We must continue to honor the people who have shaped our society and \nalso recognize the work of today's leaders who endeavor to continue \nthat crusade for equality. Minnesota takes great pride in the African-\nAmericans who have made our State and our country a better place. Their \nachievements abound throughout public service, the arts, sports, and \nacademia.\n  Sharon Sayles-Belton has just completed two terms as the Mayor of \nMinneapolis. Throughout her eight years, she provided extraordinary \nleadership. Her many accomplishments have left Minneapolis a better \nCity than when she took office, and they will be her lasting legacies \nfor many years to come.\n  Sharon exemplifies the highest caliber of dedicated public service, \nwhich has been a great Minnesota tradition. As a very successful and \nvisible African-American woman, she served as a role model for many \ngirls and young women in the City. And her compassion for others, her \nsteadfast resolve, and her effective leadership are models for all of \nus.\n  Mahmoud El Kati, professor of African-American Studies at Macalester \nCollege in St. Paul, teaches courses such as ``The Black Experience \nSince World War II'' and ``Sports and the African-American Community.'' \nHe is a frequent contributor to the opinion pages of both Twin Cities \nnewspapers as well as the local Black press, and he speaks candidly \nabout African-American society today. Most recently, El Kati has \ncampaigned to name a street in St. Paul after Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr.\n  Evelyn Fairbanks, a St. Paul native who died last year, was a \nRenaissance woman. She became the first Black employee at St. Paul's \nHamline University, as a cashier. She wrote a memoir, ``The Days of \nRondo'', which portrays her experiences growing up in the Rondo \ncommunity, the largest Black neighborhood in St. Paul, in the 1930s and \n'40s. While still employed in various jobs such as factory worker, \nmaid, and director of a neighborhood arts center, Fairbanks earned her \nundergraduate degree from the University of Minnesota at the age of 40. \nLater, her memoir was adapted for the stage, as the play Everlasting \nArms. In 1995, Hamline University awarded this accomplished woman an \nhonorary doctorate degree.\n  The mission of Minnesota's Penumbra Theatre is ``to bring forth \nprofessional productions that are artistically\n\n[[Page S656]]\n\nexcellent, thought provoking, relevant, entertaining and presented from \nan African-American perspective.'' That is how Lou Bellamy, Penumbra's \nfounder and artistic director, runs this nationally recognized theatre. \nUnder Bellamy's leadership, the Penumbra has received numerous honors, \nincluding the Jujamcyn Theaters Award for the development of artistic \ntalent.\n  As the Dean of the University of Minnesota General College, David \nTaylor does what he loves, assisting educationally disadvantaged \nstudents. He is also a scholar of African-American Studies whose \ngreatest influences have been his mother and Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. Taylor, who grew up in the Summit-University neighborhood of St. \nPaul, is often called upon to provide an historical perspective on \nMinnesota's African-American community.\n  These are just a few of the Minnesotans, past and present, who \nexemplify the struggle for attainment of human dignity, justice, and \nself-determination. As we celebrate Black History Month, we can look to \nthem as models of leadership, making Minnesota and this country all \nthat it should be for all our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S656-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VERMONTERS TAKE FIRST GOLD AT 2002 WINTER OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, my colleagues sometimes may wonder whether \nwe Vermonters will ever run out of examples to illustrate the pride we \ntake in our beautiful State and its people. Not today, we won't.\n  Today I rise to describe two of Vermont's finest athletes \nrepresenting all Americans at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake \nCity.\n  Vermont's cold winters and plentiful snow breed true winter athletes. \nWe need not look any further than this year's Olympic roster to see \nthis. At least 21 of America's competitors can claim ties to Vermont. \nSome of them have lived in the Green Mountain State for their entire \nlives, while others have come to our mountains to attend one of our \nschools or universities.\n  During the last two days, two of these Vermonters swept the Olympic \nsnowboarding halfpipe competitions, winning America's first two gold \nmedals of the 2002 Winter Olympics. Vermont is famous for its firsts. \nMany of snowboarding's newly formed roots reach deep into the Green \nMountains of our State. It is fitting that two Vermont snowboarders \nhave shown the world how it is done.\n  On Sunday, February 10th, 18-year-old Kelly Clark of West Dover, VT, \nbecame the first American to win a gold medal in the 2002 Winter \nOlympics, scoring a 47.9 out of 50 points in the women's halfpipe \ncompetition. Then on Monday, Ross Powers, 23, of South Londonderry, \nVermont, took gold in the men's halfpipe competition, winning America's \nsecond gold medal of this year's Winter Games.\n  Since the fourth grade, Kelly Clark has been riding the slopes of \nVermont. Her parents own a small restaurant near the beautiful resort \nof Mount Snow. It was on our Green Mountains that Kelly exerted herself \nbeyond belief, pushing the limit, jumping higher and attempting new \nmoves. She succeeded because she refused to let danger, fear, and \nexhaustion keep her down.\n  Kelly is no stranger to winning. Only two short months ago she won \nthe gold medal at the Winter X-Games in Aspen, CO. On Sunday, not only \ndid she win the gold medal, but she managed to do it under great \npressure. As the last competitor of the event, she only had one last \nchance to show the world what she could do, and she rose to the \nchallenge.\n  The day after Kelly introduced herself to the world, Ross Powers won \nhis second Olympic medal adding to a collection of medals he began \nduring the 1998 Nagano Games when snowboarding made its Olympic debut. \nAll the more remarkable is the fact that Ross led America in a medal \nsweep of a winter event for the first time in nearly half a century. He \nimpressed the judges and spectators by shooting off the snow 15 feet \ninto the air, landing flawlessly and performing trick after trick.\n  His family and friends back at Vermont's Bromley Mountain and \nStratton Mountain resorts watched Ross, as a child snowboard prodigy, \nwork hard and push himself from the time he first strapped a snowboard \nto his feet at age five. Three years later he began competing.\n  Recognizing the hard work, determination and financial backing it \ntakes to become a world-class athlete, Ross formed the Ross Powers \nFoundation. This non-profit program gives talented and hard-working \nchildren the financial support they need to follow their winter sports \ndreams.\n  I am sure many more of my fellow Vermonters will find their way onto \nour sports pages before the Olympics leave Salt Lake City. I know that \nthe country shares our pride in the accomplishments of these courageous \nOlympic athletes. We Vermonters join all Americans in thanking Kelly \nand Ross, and all Olympic athletes, for their hard work and devotion to \ncompetition and to their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S656-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         RECOGNIZING ROY LEWIS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

I praise Mr. Lewis for his \nwillingness to put other's needs ahead of his own and thank him for \nhaving such a strong character and heart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S656-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S656-S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           IN RECOGNITION OF THE 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF HADASSAH\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me today \nin congratulating Hadassah upon its 90th anniversary. Originally \nfounded in 1912 by Henrietta Szold as a woman's study circle, Hadassah \nhas grown into an organization with over 300,000 members involved with \n1,500 chapters across the country. Today, Hadassah is not only the \nlargest woman's group in the country, but also the largest Jewish \nmembership organization in the United States.\n  Since its inception, Hadassah has been an advocate on behalf of \nwomen, Israel and the Jewish diaspora. However, Hadassah has done more \nthan advocate on behalf of these issues, it has taken concrete steps to \nhelp people throughout the world. In particular, Hadassah is to be \nlauded for its provision of world class health care to the people of \nthe Middle East, irrespective of race, religion or nationality. Every \nyear, more than 600,000 patients are treated at the centers operated by \nthe Hadassah Medical Organization, HMO, which includes two hospitals, \n90 outpatient clinics, and numerous community health centers. Under the \nauspices of the HMO, Haddassah also provides medical training during \ninternational health crises, including the recent events in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and Rawanda.\n  Though Hadassah's medical efforts are primarily in the Middle East, \nthe organization also has other important initiatives. One of the most \nnotable is a nationwide breast cancer detection and awareness campaign \nconducted by the Women's Health Department. This campaign includes the \nCheck it Out high school program which strives to educate teens about \nthe dangers of cancer and how to screen oneself for early signs. In \naddition, Hadassah produces quality educational programs that help \nJewish families learn about and celebrate their Jewish culture and \nheritage.\n  Hadassah is also affiliated with numerous other programs which \nprovide such services as technical and vocational training and \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S657]]\n\npreservation. Of particular note is Youth Aliya, which assists \ndisadvantaged and at risk youth. Through a system of residential \nvillages and day centers these teens have the opportunity to take part \nin health education programs, vocational training and are offered \nexposure to and encouragement in art, dance, music and athletics.\n  The long and storied history of Hadassah and the record of public \nservice by its members is truly commendable. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues will join me in congratulating Hadassah on this significant \noccasion.\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to \nHadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, on the occasion \nof its 90th anniversary.\n  As you may know, Hadassah is the largest women's and the largest \nJewish membership organization in the United States. Hadassah's 300,000 \nvolunteers are active throughout the world, including 800 U.S. \ncommunities in 48 different States, as well as the District of Columbia \nand Puerto Rico.\n  Since 1912, Hadassah volunteers have played a lead role in advancing \nthe cause of social justice, particularly in the areas of education and \nhealth. One such endeavor, the breast cancer detection and awareness \ncampaign, ``Check It Out,'' has had powerful, positive effects on women \nnationwide. The success of Hadassah's youth programs, particularly \nYoung Judaea and Youth Aliya, proves that volunteerism can affect \nchange.\n  The organization's commitment to a peaceful future in Israel and \nPalestine also deserves praise. Hadassah has earned accolades for its \nwork in Israel, where they operate a world-renowned medical complex in \nJerusalem, made up of two advanced hospitals, with a clientele of more \nthan 600,000 patients of all races, religions and creeds. In addition, \nthe Hadassah Medical Organization is actively involved in global \noutreach programs in scores of other countries, particularly those in \nAfrica. These international campaigns focus on public health awareness, \nparticularly AIDS education, as well as on treatment of eye diseases.\n  As the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian \nAffairs, I have learned a great deal about the important work of \nHadassah. I respect their contributions and appreciate all they have \ndone to advance the legislative agenda of women and Israel.\n  The spirit of founder Henrietta Szold lives on today, through the \ndedication and commitment of Hadassah's volunteers. I am proud to offer \nmy commendation on 90 years of quality service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S657-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HONORING THE CITY OF MOORHEAD FOR ITS COMMITMENT TO RENEWABLE SOURCES \n                               OF ENERGY\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, this week, the U.S. Senate will \nbegin consideration of a historic National Energy Policy, which will \nguarantee our citizens access to affordable, reliable, and renewable \nsources of energy far into the future. As we begin this historic \ndebate, we can learn much from the efforts of many organizations that \nhave led the way in promoting a greater reliance on renewable sources \nof energy.\n  Moorhead, MN is an exceptional example of a city that has \ndemonstrated a clear commitment to renewable sources of energy. \nMoorhead city officials, and the citizens themselves, are to be \napplauded for their vision of a city that will continue to reduce its \ndependence on fossil fuels for their future electricity needs.\n  The city of Moorhead initiated its ``Capture the Wind'' program in \n1998--offering its municipal electric customers the opportunity to \npurchase wind energy from a turbine that would be owned and operated by \nthe city. The success of the program has been nothing short of \nphenomenal.\n  Three weeks after the announcement of the Capture the Wind program, \nover 400 Moorhead Public Service customers signed up to purchase \nelectricity from the proposed wind turbine. Because these 400 customers \nwould consume the entire capacity of the proposed turbine, the city \nbegan placing additional residents on a Capture the Wind program \nwaiting list.\n  While all other Moorhead Public Service customers would receive two-\nthirds of their electricity from hydropower and one-third from a coal-\nfired electric generation plant, the 400 Capture the Wind charter \nmembers would replace their coal-generated electricity with electricity \ngenerated by the 750 kilowatt wind turbine to be constructed on the \nedge of town. The Capture the Wind customers agreed to pay the \nadditional cost of wind-generated electricity, amounting to one-half \ncent more for each kilowatt-hour of electricity consumed. The \nadditional cost amounts to approximately $5 more per month for the \naverage residential customer. This additional cost is among the lowest \nin the Nation for wind-generated electricity.\n  Due to the overwhelming success of the Capture the Wind Program, the \ncity of Moorhead appealed to its utility customers to help Moorhead \n``catch its second wind'' in the fall of 2000. Once again, over 400 new \ncustomers signed up for the program--enabling the city to build a \nsecond wind turbine alongside its first.\n  As of last fall, the twin turbines have generated over 3.5 million \nkilowatt-hours of electricity. Thanks to the customers who have \nembraced the Capture the Wind program, these turbines have already \nprevented the emission of over 7.7 million pounds of greenhouse gases \ninto our atmosphere. That has the same positive effect on the \nenvironment that would be achieved if we were to remove 770 cars from \nthe road for one year.\n  At this time, over 925 Moorhead Public Service customers have become \nCapture the Wind members, accounting for 7.3 percent of all Moorhead \nutility customers. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory has \nrecognized Moorhead Public Service as the utility with the highest \npercentage of its customers participating in a renewable energy program \nin the nation. Moorhead's Capture the Wind program has also earned it \nthe 2001 Energy Innovator Award from the American Public Power \nAssociation.\n  Moorhead City officials are to be commended for the phenomenal \nsuccess of the city's Capture the Wind program. While many officials \nstaked their reputations on the program's outcome, I would be remiss if \nI did not mention several leaders who especially contributed to its \nsuccess. First and foremost, Moorhead's former mayor, Morrie Lanning--a \nman who served his city as mayor for over 22 years before retiring last \nDecember--is to be applauded for his solid support and advocacy for the \nCapture the Wind program. Moreover, the program would not have been \npossible without the thousands of hours of work invested by Bill \nSchwandt, General Manager of Moorhead Public Service, and Christopher \nReed, Manager of Energy Services and Marketing.\n  But most important, the 925 members of the Capture the Wind program \ndeserve special recognition for their commitment to renewable energy. \nThe rest of the Nation can learn much from Moorhead's example. We can \nlearn that when citizens are informed about the importance of reducing \nour reliance on fossil fuels for our energy needs, many are willing to \npay a little bit more to help secure our energy future. The citizens of \nMoorhead can lead the way to a brighter future for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S657-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S657-S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              HONORING THE WASHINGTON STATE LABOR COUNCIL\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on behalf of all the citizens of \nWashington State, I am delighted to congratulate the Washington State \nLabor Council on the 100th anniversary of its original formation. \nWashington State has a rich labor tradition.\n  On January 17, 1902, 120 delegates representing 114 local unions and \nfive central labor councils from around Washington State gathered in \nTacoma and voted to affiliate with the American Federation of Labor. \nThis local organization eventually merged with the Washington State \nCongress of Industrial Organizations in 1957, the same time the \nnational AFL and CIO merged, to form the Washington State Labor \nCouncil, AFL-CIO.\n  There have been many challenges faced during their first one hundred \nyears, yet each challenge was faced with dignity and courage, knowing \nthat the struggles faced would build a better life for working men and \nwomen. Union members throughout Washington State have risked their own\n\n[[Page S658]]\n\nlivelihoods to stand up for decent wages, safe working conditions, and \njob security.\n  I have enormous respect for the past and present leadership of the \nWashington State Labor Council. We stand together in the ongoing battle \nto give working families the strongest possible voice.\n  For the past 100 years, Washington State's labor community has been a \npowerful force for progress. Their tireless efforts are indispensable \nin the daily battles for worker's rights. Countless families across \nWashington State are better off today because of their commitment.\n  The Washington State Labor Council has also been at the forefront of \nthe effort to pass fair increases in the state minimum wage, setting \nstandards for the rest of the country to follow. Simply put, the \nWashington State Labor Council has been there in the trenches, making \nprogress happen.\n  I look forward to working closely with the Washington State Labor \nCouncil on all the great causes we share. Washington State has made \nreal progress because of their work, and will continue to do so with \ntheir help now and in all the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S658-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WEST VIRGINIA VA MEDICAL FACILITIES HONORED\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am enormously proud to \nhighlight the recognition of the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter in Huntington, in my home State of West Virginia, for excellence \nin health care delivery.\n  The Huntington VA Medical Center has received accreditation from the \nJoint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, JCAHO, \nas a result of meeting national health care standards. I am very \npleased to see this VA health care provider in my home State receiving \nthe accolades it so richly deserves for delivering a high standard of \ncare to veterans.\n  The Joint Commission, an independent, non-profit organization, is an \naccreditation body focused on ensuring quality and safety standards for \nhealth care on a national level. An on-site survey of the Huntington VA \nMedical Center, as well as its affiliated facilities, was conducted by \nthe Joint Commission last November, giving Huntington an overall score \nof 98. Only about 4 percent of all of the facilities that the Joint \nCommission surveys receive scores of 98 or above a true testament to \nthe quality of health care at the Huntington VA Medical Center.\n  It is the administration and staff at the Huntington VA Medical \nCenter that make it the superb facility it is. I recognize the hard \nwork and tireless efforts of all the staff there: from the Director's \noffice, maintenance workers, the food preparers, doctors, nurses, \nphysician assistants and physical therapists, to the mental health \ntreatment staff, specialized medicine, emergency, and geriatric care \nproviders. The entire team has made the hospital a true model for \nquality health care delivery, not just within the VA health care \nsystem, but for the entire Nation. I, along with the veterans who \nreceive care at Huntington, thank them for all they do, and encourage \nthem to continue their good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S658-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES\n\n  The following presidential messages were laid before the Senate, \ntogether with accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were \nreferred as indicated:\n\n       PM-70. A message from the President of the United States, \n     transmitting, pursuant to law, the National Drug Control \n     Strategy for 2002; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit the 2002 National Drug Control Strategy, \nconsistent with the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nReauthorization Act of 1998 (21 U.S.C. 1705).\n  Illegal drug use threatens everything that is good about our country. \nIt can break the bonds between parents and children. It can turn \nproductive citizens into addicts, and it can transform schools into \nplaces of violence and chaos. Internationally, it finances the work of \nterrorists who use drug profits to fund their murderous work. Our fight \nagainst illegal drug use is a fight for our children's future, for \nstruggling democracies, and against terrorism.\n  We have made progress in the past. From 1985 to 1992, drug use among \nhigh school seniors dropped each year. Progress was steady and, over \ntime, dramatic. However, in recent years we have lost ground. This \nStrategy represents the first step in the return of the fight against \ndrugs to the center of our national agenda. We must do this for one \ngreat moral reason: over time, drugs rob men, women, and children of \ntheir dignity and of their character.\n  We acknowledge that drug use among our young people is at \nunacceptably high levels. As a Nation, we know how to teach character, \nand how to dissuade children from ever using illegal drugs. We need to \nact on that knowledge.\n  This Strategy also seeks to expand the drug treatment system, while \nrecognizing that even the best treatment program cannot help a drug \nuser who does not seek its assistance. The Strategy also recognizes the \nvital role of law enforcement and interdiction programs, while focusing \non the importance of attacking the drug trade's key vulnerabilities.\n  Previous Strategies have enjoyed bipartisan political and funding \nsupport in the Congress. I ask for your continued support in this \ncritical endeavor.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Law Enforcement Pay Equity Act of 2000 \nto permit certain annuitants of the retirement programs of the United \nStates Park Police and United States Secret Service Uniformed Division \nto receive the adjustments in pension benefits to which such annuitants \nwould otherwise be entitled as a result of the conversion of members of \nthe United States Park Police and United States Secret Service \nUniformed Division to a new salary schedule under the amendments made \nby such Act; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nLaw Enforcement Pay Adjustment Equity Act. I am proud to be joined on \nthis bill by my colleague, Senator Clinton. This legislation amends the \nLaw Enforcement Pay Equity Act of 2000 to allow retired police officers \nof the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division and the United \nStates Park Police to receive the same Cost of Living Adjustment, COLA, \nas active officers.\n  For almost 80 years, Secret Service and Park Police retirees were \nassured an increase in their pensions whenever their active \ncounterparts received an increase by the ``equalization clause'' in the \nDistrict of Columbia Police and Firearms Salary Act, DCRA, of 1958. \nWhen the Law Enforcement Pay Equity Act passed in 2000, the automatic \nlink that ensured retirees of getting the same COLA as active officers \nwas severed. This bill would restore that link, guaranteeing that the \npension for these retired federal police officers keeps up with the \ncost of living.\n  The Law Enforcement Pay Equity Act of 2000 created a sharp inequality \nin retirement benefits for a small number of retirees, 630 Secret \nService retirees and 465 Park Police retirees, roughly eleven hundred \nin total. They gave years of loyal service, often in difficult and \nlife-threatening situations. They are the only federal retirees who had \nexisting retirement benefits scaled back.\n  Providing for government retirees and their families has always been \nan important function of the Federal Government. There is no reason why \nthe government should go back on its word to provide this small group \nof valuable employees with secure retirement benefits. Restoring the \nCost of Living Adjustment to the pensions of 1100 Federal retirees will \nhave a minimal impact on the Federal budget, but a major impact on the \nquality of life of the people involved.\n  When it comes to Federal employees, I believe that promises made \nshould be promises kept. These former Secret Service and Park Police \nofficers planned for their retirement with the understanding that their \npension would be enough to live on, even as the cost of living \nincreased. They deserve the retirement benefits they were promised when \nthey signed up for service.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in expressing support for this bill \nto restore promised retirement benefits to retired officers of the \nUnited States Secret Service Uniformed Division and the United States \nPark Police.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. \n        Clinton):\n  S. 1935. A bill to amend chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States \nCode, to include inspectors of the Immigration and Naturalization \nService, inspectors and canine enforcement officers of the United \nStates Customs Service, and revenue officers of the Internal Revenue \nService as law enforcement officers; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Law \nEnforcement Officers Retirement Equity Act of 2002. I am proud to be \njoined on this bill by my colleagues, Senators Leahy, Clinton, and \nBingaman. This legislation will ensure that revenue officers of\n\n[[Page S663]]\n\nthe Internal Revenue Service, customs inspectors of the U.S. Customs \nService, and immigration inspectors of the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service have the same retirement options as most Federal \nlaw enforcement officers and conforms with the Federal law enforcement \nretirement system.\n  Under current law, most Federal law enforcement officers and \nfirefighters are eligible to retire at age 50 with 20 years of Federal \nservice. Most people would be surprised to learn that current law does \nnot treat revenue officers, customs inspectors and immigrations \ninspectors as Federal law enforcement personnel. I feel very strongly \nthat in the light of the increased duties that these men and women are \ndoing to help combat terrorism, keep our homeland secure, and help with \nthe war on drugs we need to do what we can to give them the benefits \nthat they deserve.\n  This legislation will amend the current law and finally grant the \nsame 20-year retirement to these members of the Internal Revenue \nService, Customs Service, and Immigration and Naturalization Service. \nThe employees under this bill have very hazardous, physically \nchallenging occupations, and it is in the public's interest to make \nsure that these homeland security officials receive the benefits they \nearn on our frontlines everyday.\n  The need for a 20-year retirement benefit for inspectors of the \nCustoms Service is very clear. These employees are the country's first \nline of defense against terrorism and the smuggling of illegal drugs at \nour borders. They are required to have the same law enforcement \ntraining as all other law enforcement personnel. These employees face \nso many challenges. They may potentially confront criminals in the drug \nwar, organized crime figures, and increasingly sophisticated white-\ncollar criminals.\n  U.S. Customs inspectors have the authority to arrest those engaged in \nthese crimes if the crimes are committed in their presence. These \nofficers carry a firearm on the job. They are responsible for the most \narrests performed by Customs Service employees. Along with U.S. Customs \nagents, uniformed U.S. Customs inspectors are helping provide \nadditional security at the Nation's airports and could assist U.S. \nCustoms agents with the arrest of anyone violating U.S. Customs laws. \nThey were among the first to respond to the tragedy at the World Trade \nCenter.\n  The Customs Service interdicts more narcotics than all other law \nenforcement agencies combined, over a million pounds a year. In 1996, \nthey seized nearly 400 tons of marijuana, over 90 pounds of cocaine, \nand nearly 1.45 tons of heroin.\n  Like U.S. Customs Service Inspectors, INS inspectors are part of the \nfirst line of defense for homeland security. INS inspectors enforce the \nnation's immigration laws at more than 300 ports of entry. In the \nnormal course of their duties, they enforce criminal law, make arrests, \ncarry firearms, interrogate applicants for entry, search persons and \neffects, and seize evidence. Inspector's responsibilities have become \nincreasing complex as political, economic and social unrest has \nincreased globally. The threat of terrorism only increases these \nresponsibilities.\n  INS Inspectors help secure our borders. In FY 2001, over 510 million \ninspections were performed by these inspectors with 700,000 individuals \nwere denied entry, and approximately 15,000 criminal aliens being \nintercepted.\n  Revenue officers struggle with heavy workloads and a high rate of job \nstress. Some IRS employees must even employ pseudonyms to hide their \nidentity because of the great threat to their personal safety. The \nInternal Revenue Service currently provides it's employees with a \nmanual entitled: Assaults and Threats: A Guide to Your Personal Safety \nto help employees respond to hostile situations. The document advises \nIRS employees how to handle on-the-job assaults, abuse, threatening \ntelephone calls, and other menacing situations.\n  This legislation is cost effective. Any cost that is created by this \nact is more than offset by savings in training costs and increased \nrevenue collection. A 20-year retirement bill for these critical \nemployees will reduce turnover, increase productivity, decrease \nemployee recruitment and development costs, and enhance the retention \nof a well-trained and experienced work force. These vital Federal \nemployees bear the same risks and work under similar conditions to \nother law enforcement officials and deserve to receive the same level \nof benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me again in this Congress in expressing \nsupport for this bill and finally getting it enacted. This bill will \nimprove the effectiveness of our inspector and revenue officer work \nforce to ensure the integrity of our borders and proper collection of \nthe taxes and duties owed to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise to join my good friend Senator \nMikulski in introducing the Law Enforcement Officers Retirement Equity \nAct of 2002. This bill would correct an inequity that exists under \ncurrent law, whereby U.S. Customs Service and INS Inspectors as well as \nrevenue agents from the IRS are denied the same retirement benefits \nprovided to other law enforcement officers. I have introduced a similar \nbill, S. 1828, with the support of Senator Hatch and Senator Mikulski, \nwhich would provide similar benefits to the Nation's Federal \nprosecutors, who are now more than ever facing the immense dangers and \nchallenges of the war on terrorism. Both measures are long overdue and \nimportant corrections in the Federal law.\n  This bill would increase the retirement benefits given to federal INS \nand Customs inspectors and IRS Revenue agents by including them as \n``law enforcement officers,'' LEOs, under the Federal Employees' \nRetirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System. The relevant \nprovisions of the United States Code dealing with retirement benefits \ndefine an LEO as an employee whose duties are ``primarily the \ninvestigation, apprehension, or detention'' of individuals suspected or \nconvicted of violating Federal law. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331(20) & \n8401(17). Under that definition, it is inconceivable that Customs and \nINS Inspectors and IRS Revenue Agents would not be included, yet they \nare not. Customs and INS Inspectors spend their entire days searching, \nquestioning, and investigating potential violations of Federal law by \nthose who either cross our borders or those who send goods and freight \ninto and out of the United States. In many cases, they are our first \nand last defense against smugglers and those who seek to enter the \nUnited States unlawfully. IRS Revenue Agents have a long history of tax \nenforcement, sometime in dangerous circumstances involving contraband \nmaterials.\n  This bill would make these agents and inspectors eligible for \nimmediate, unreduced retirement benefits at age 50 with 20 years of \nservice. For example, those who are covered by the Civil Service \nRetirement System would receive 50 percent of the average of their \nthree highest years' salary. That is the retirement package that is \ncurrently afforded to nearly every other Federal law enforcement \nemployee. Just like the Federal prosecutors covered by S. 1828, there \nis no good justification for not including these Customs, INS and IRS \nlaw enforcement employees with their peers in terms of their retirement \nbenefits, and plenty of good reasons supporting their inclusion.\n  First and foremost, the danger faced by these men and women supports \ntheir inclusion as LEOs. The primary reason for granting enhanced \nretirement benefits to LEOs is the often dangerous work of law \nenforcement, and at no time in our Nation's history has both the danger \nand importance of protecting our Nation's borders been more clear. As \nthe September 11 attacks on our nation amply demonstrated, the tools of \nterrorism and the terrorists themselves are often imported to the \nUnited States from abroad--and often times illegally. The people who \nare included in this bill are the men and women who literally stand \ntheir posts to make sure that, among other things, illegal weapons and \nterrorists are not allowed into the United States. What could possibly \nbe more dangerous?\n  I know first hand, from my experience as a former prosecutor in \nVermont that the men and women who stand watch at our Northern border \nput themselves in harm's way each and every day that they put on their \nuniforms and go to work. In Vermont, I know that these men and women \nhave a proud history of confronting and apprehending those who seek to \nenter the\n\n[[Page S664]]\n\ncounty illegally and smuggle contraband into the United States. \nAlready, as part of the USA PATRIOT Act, I was able to work to include \nimportant provisions which enhanced the protection of our Northern \nborder. This bill is yet another overdue measure which recognizes the \nimportance of such border protection.\n  Another reason for correcting this inconsistency in the law is the \nretention of good officers at the agencies which guard the border. \nFaced with new security challenges, it is crucial that the Customs \nService and the INS possess the tools to maintain an experienced and \nprofessional cadre of agents at our Nation's land borders, airports, \nand seaports. When one type of Federal law enforcement officer is \nprovided worse benefits than all others for no good reason, there is a \nrisk that the most qualified and successful agents will move to other \ncomparable jobs with better benefits. Since LEO retirement benefits are \ncurrently afforded to nearly every other group of people that enforce \nour laws, there is currently a risk that the best and most dedicated \nCustoms and INS Inspectors will be lured away from their jobs \nprotecting the border for ``greener'' pastures. This bill would \neliminate this risk by providing proper incentives for the best people \nto stay right where we want them, protecting our borders.\n  To conclude, I commend Senator Mikulsi's leadership in this area, and \nI join her in introducing the Law Enforcement Officers Retirement \nEquity Act of 2002. For all of these reasons, I urge its swift \nenactment into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1936. A bill to address the international HIV/AIDS pandemic; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Global \nCoordination of HIV/AIDS Response Act, known as the Global CARE Act. \nHIV/AIDS is a national security issue, an economic issue, a health and \nsafety issue, and most importantly a moral issue. It is for these \nreasons I am proposing comprehensive legislation to address the global \nHIV/AIDS pandemic. This bill will not solve all these problems. But it \ndoes set the bar where the need is, and it does offer innovative ideas \nto address the global AIDS crisis in a strategic, coordinated, \naccountable manner.\n  Since the tragedy of September 11, we have all been focused on \ncombating the war on terrorism, and rightfully so. But as we all know, \nperhaps even more clearly since September, fighting and preventing \nterrorism, preparing for and preventing bioterrorist attacks, \nmaintaining international stability, and promoting global economic \ncooperation and growth require not only a military and political \nresponse but also a social and humanitarian effort.\n  Today's reality is a world in which geographical borders seem to hold \nless and less significance. As we work to maintain economic prosperity \nand safety in our own Nation, we must face the fact that globalization \nis upon us. This has never been more true than in the case of disease. \nThe HIV/AIDS pandemic, tuberculosis and other life threatening \ninfectious diseases know no borders. They cannot be prevented by a \nmissile defense system. We cannot halt the spread of AIDS with bombing \nraids.\n  Whether deliberately spread as a man made bioterrorist threats or a \nnaturally occurring, infectious diseases are a pressing national \nsecurity issue. A CIA report last year noted the link between disease \nand political chaos, saying that rampant AIDS, tuberculosis and other \ninfectious illnesses were ``likely to aggravate, and in some cases, may \neven provoke, economic decay, social fragmentation and political \ndestabilization in the hardest hit countries.''\n  The epidemic is not confined to Africa. HIV has reached epidemic \nproportions in India. The World Bank estimates that if effective \nprevention efforts are not implemented immediately and sustained, India \ncould have more than 37 million people infected with HIV by the year \n2005. This is roughly equal to the total number of HIV infections in \nthe world today. The AIDS epidemic is sweeping across Eastern Europe, \nwhere HIV infection rates are rising faster in the former Soviet Union \nthan anywhere else in the world according to a U.N. Report on AIDS. The \nBaltic nation of Estonia reported 10 times as many new infections last \nyear as it did in 1999. In China, the number of people living with AIDS \nnow tops one million. This is a moral issue that cannot be ignored.\n  The rising rates of infection and the rising death toll are draining \nnational budgets and depriving local economies of their workforce. Last \nNovember United Nations officials predicted that some of the most \naffected African nations could lose more than 20 percent of their Gross \nDomestic Product, GDP, by 2020 because of AIDS. Recent studies by the \nWorld Health Organization's Commission on Macroeconomics and Health \nshow that infections and disease are not only the product of poverty; \nthey also create poverty. By investing in health in developing \ncountries we can save lives and produce clear and measurable financial \nreturns. For example, the Commission reported that well-targeted \nspending of shared among nations in the amount of $66 billion a year by \n2015 could save as many as 8 million lives a year and generate six-fold \neconomic benefits, more than $360 billion a year by 2020.\n  AIDS is also the single largest contributor to a worldwide resurgence \nin Tuberculosis, TB. The spread of TB in the developing world has a \ndirect effect on the health and safety of Americans. Last month, forty-\neight people in Mobile, Alabama, tested positive for exposure to \ntuberculosis, three weeks after a graduate student at Spring Hill \nCollege died of the disease. The Student, from Nairobi, Kenya, is \nthought to have contracted TB before coming to the U.S. Also last \nmonth, health officials in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, \nannounced they were treating five people for drug-resistant TB. All \nwere immigrants from countries where TB flourishes. Just last week, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that the number of \nnew cases of TB in this country declined in 2000 but the number of \ncases occurring in the foreign-born U.S. population increased. The \npoint is clear: we cannot maintain our own safety if we neglect the \nhealth needs of the developing world.\n  For all these reasons--national security, economic stability, public \nhealth, and our moral obligation, I have introduced the Global CARE \nAct. It is critically important that we demonstrate the political will \nto act on this issue. I think it would be productive for Congress to \nestablish clear policy goals and funding targets that represent the \nreal need. It is also our job to ensure that there is accountability \nfor the money that we appropriate, and that we are able to articulate \nthe results of our U.S. investment. It is my hope that by doing this we \nwill secure a serious, effective financial commitment that to date has \nbeen woefully inadequate.\n  The Global Coordination of HIV/AIDS Response Act is grounded in the \nprinciples of leadership and accountability.\n  The policy goals I have set forth in this bill are the following: \nbetter coordination among the myriad of U.S. agencies active in the \nglobal AIDS fight; a more focused strategic planning initiative that \nmakes the best use of U.S bilateral assistance; increased \naccountability for the health and policy objectives we seek to achieve \nwith our financial and human investment in AIDS-ravaged countries; the \nability to mobilize the most effective human and capacity-building \ntools to provide some of the building blocks that are needed; and a \nclear articulation of the broader issues that need to be addressed to \nhave a real impact on HIV/AIDS, including not just prevention but \ntreatment and care, and not just health initiatives but also economic \ninvestments.\n  The Global CARE Act provides specific funding authorizations for the \nkey agencies working on global AIDS, as well as for the Global Fund. \nBoth bilateral and multilateral assistance is needed to address this \nproblem. Before the Leadership and Investment in Fighting and Epidemic, \nLIFE, initiative authorized USAID to conduct activities specifically \nfocused on global AIDS in FY2000, there was little direction from \nCongress on this issue. And up until the United Nations and President \nBush specifically requested money for the Global Fund, there was little \nagreement about what was needed. It is now time for Congress to step up \nto the plate and provide some direction.\n  The authorized funding levels in the Global CARE Act represent a need \nthat\n\n[[Page S665]]\n\nhas been well documented. The World Health Organization's \nMarcoeconomics and Health Commission has determined that by 2007, the \ninternational community--donor and affected countries--should be \nspending $14 billion in response to the AIDS pandemic. Last year, the \nUnited Nations called for roughly $10 billion annually.\n  America has by far the greatest giving capacity, yet we devote the \nsmallest percentage of our overall wealth to efforts aimed at \nalleviating global poverty and disease. Last year the United States \ngave one-tenth of 1 percent of its GNP to foreign aid--or $1 for every \nthousand dollars of its wealth, the lowest giving rate of any rich \nnation. By comparison, Canada, Japan, Austria, Australia and Germany \neach gave about one-quarter of 1 percent, of $2.50 for every thousand \ndollars of wealth. Many other countries give even more, at rates 8 to \n10 times higher than the United States. Based on its share of global \nGNP, the United States should contribute at least 25 percent of the \ntotal AIDS response cost in 2003. Twenty-five percent of the estimated \n$10 billion needed next year would be $2.5 billion. Hundreds of civic \ngroups and religious leaders have joined together, calling on Congress \nto provide at least $2.5 billion to combat the pandemic.\n\n  The Global CARE Act establishes broad policy goals and activities \nthat are embodied in an international HIV/AIDS Prevention and Capacity \nBuilding Initiative and an International Care and Treatment Access \nInitiative. These goals and activities, which range from education, \nvoluntary testing and counseling, to helping preserve families and \nameliorate the orphan crisis, are not parceled out to the various \nagencies we know are actively engaged in this issue such as the U.S. \nAgency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention (CDC). Rather this legislation generally \nrelies on the existing authorities of the agencies to carry out these \nbroad activities with the requirement that they coordinate their \nactivities with each other and with host country needs and host country \nplans.\n  The development of a coordinated, effective, and sustained plan for \nU.S. bilateral aid in relation to multilateral aid and other nation's \nbilateral aid is paramount. The U.S. has the opportunity to provide the \nrequisite leadership in this global effort though operating \nstrategically, and in an accountable and transparent manner.\n  To provide an incentive for such coordination, the bill establishes \nan interagency working group charged with ensuring that global HIV/AIDS \nactivities are conducted in a coordinated, strategic fashion. Members \nof this working group include agencies within the Department of State, \nspecifically USAID; agencies within the Department of Health and Human \nServices, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the \nHealth Resources and Services Administration, and the National \nInstitutes of Health; the Department of Defense, Labor, Commerce and \nAgriculture, and the Peace Corps.\n  This is policy working group with representatives from the agency \nprograms doing the real work. It is my intention that the working group \nhelp to ensure that the various agencies we fund to provide bi-lateral \nassistance are making the most of the money we appropriate; that they \nare not duplicating efforts; that they are learning from each others' \nprogrammatic experience and research in order to implement the best \npractices; and that they are accountable to Congress and the American \npeople for achieving measurable goals and objectives. In fact, the \nfunction of this group is very similar to the interagency working group \nestablished in H.R. 2069--legislation that passed the House of \nRepresentatives last year.\n  The Global CARE Act very specifically directs the working group to \nreport back to the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, the Senate \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, and the corresponding Committees in the House \nof Representatives, with the following information: 1. The actions \nbeing taken to coordinate multiple roles and policies, and foster \ncollaboration among Federal agencies contributing to the global HIV/\nAIDS activities; 2. A description of the respective roles and \nactivities of each of the working group member agencies; 3. A \ndescription of actions taken to carry out the goals and activities \nauthorized in the International AIDS Prevention and Capacity Building \nImitative and the International AIDS Care and Treatment Access \nInitiative set out in the legislation; 4. Recommendation to specific \nCongressional committees regarding legislative and funding actions that \nare needed carry out the activities articulated in the bill; and 5. The \nresults of the HIV/AIDS goals and outcomes as established by the \nworking group. In my view, only by requiring very specific reporting \nrequirements will the working group actually work.\n  The Global CARE Act includes a number of other provisions. Some have \nbeen discussed on the Hill, others have not. It authorizes a Global \nPhysician Corps to utilize the human capital we have in our working and \nretired physicians by providing a mechanism for them to serve overseas \nwhere their expertise is so needed.\n  The bill authorizes a small amount for USAID to work on development \nand implementing initiatives to improve injection safety. According to \nthe World Health Organization (WHO), each year the overuse of \ninjections and unsafe injections combine to cause an estimated 8 to 16 \nmillion hepatitis B virus infections, 2.3 million to 4.7 million \nhepatitis C infections and 80,000 to 160,000 HIV infections. Together, \nthese chronic infections are responsible for an estimated 10 million \nnew infections, more than 1.8 million deaths, 26 million years of life \nlost, and more than $535 million in direct medical costs.\n  It includes a new pilot program to provide a limited procurement of \nantirectoriviral drugs and technical assistance to programs in host \ncountries. And it includes a very important orphan relief and \nmicrocredit component that acknowledges that addressing the AIDS \nproblem requires both an economic and social investment in women and \nfamilies.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider the framework and policy I have \ndeveloped as we work to introduce a unified proposal to address the \nHIV/AIDS problem.

Roosevelt of the Emergency Conservation \n     Work Act, a precursor to the Civilian Conservation Corps Act \n     that established the CCC;\n       Whereas, between 1933 and 1942, the CCC provided employment \n     and vocational training for more than 3,000,000 men, \n     including unemployed youths, more than 250,000 veterans of \n     the Spanish American War and World War I, and more than \n     80,000 Native Americans in conservation and natural resources \n     development work, defense work on military reservations, and \n     forest protection;\n       Whereas the CCC coordinated a mobilization of men, \n     material, and transportation on a scale never previously \n     known in time of peace;\n       Whereas the CCC managed more than 4,500 camps in every \n     State and the then-territories of Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto \n     Rico, and the Virgin Islands;\n       Whereas the CCC left a legacy of natural resources and \n     infrastructure improvements that included planting more than \n     3,000,000,000 trees, building 46,854 bridges, restoring 3,980 \n     historical structures, developing more than 800 state parks, \n     improving 3,462 beaches, creating 405,037 signs, markers,\n\n[[Page S666]]\n\n     and monuments, and building 63,256 structures and 8,045 wells \n     and pump houses;\n       Whereas the benefits of many CCC projects are still enjoyed \n     by Americans today in national and state parks, forests, and \n     other lands, including the National Arboretum in Washington, \n     DC, Bandelier National Monument in New Mexico, Great Smoky \n     Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee, \n     Yosemite National Park in California, Acadia National Park in \n     Maine, Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado, and \n     Vicksburg National Military Park in Mississippi;\n       Whereas the CCC provided a foundation of self-confidence, \n     responsibility, discipline, cooperation, communication, and \n     leadership for its participants through education, training, \n     and hard work, and participants made many lasting friendships \n     in the CCC;\n       Whereas the CCC demonstrated the commitment of the United \n     States to the conservation of land, water, and natural \n     resources on a national level and to leadership in the world \n     on public conservation efforts; and\n       Whereas the conservation of the Nation's land, water, and \n     natural resources is still an important goal of the American \n     people: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates both March 31, 2002, and March 31, 2003, as \n     ``National Civilian Conservation Corps Day''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the day \n     with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution \ntoday with Senators Lugar, Carnahan, Bond, Torricelli and DeWine, \ndesignating March 31, 2002 and March 31, 2003 as ``National Civilian \nConservation Corps Day.'' March 31, 2002 is the 69th anniversary and \nMarch 31, 2003 is the 70th anniversary of the signing by President \nRoosevelt of the Emergency Conservation Work Act, the precursor to the \nCivilian Conservation Corps Act.\n  The Civilian Conservation Corps, commonly known as the CCC, was a \nDepression-era public works program started by President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt. The CCC put over 3 million young men to work on natural \nresources conservation and public lands infrastructure improvements. \nMany of the physical accomplishments of the CCC are still visible, but \neven more importantly, the CCC also provided its participants with \neducation, lasting friendships, a cooperative spirit, and a foundation \nof self-confidence and discipline.\n  Americans still enjoy the benefits of the work done by the CCC in the \n1930s and 1940s at national and state parks across the U.S. CCC \nparticipants planted more than 3 billion trees, developed more than 800 \nstate parks, improved more than 3,000 beaches and are responsible for \ncountless monuments, signs, wells, and other improvements. CCC camps \nwere located in every State, including the then-territories of Hawaii \nand Alaska.\n  CCC alumni across the country still share the bonds of friendship and \nhard work. The National Association of Civilian Conservation Corps \nAlumni has thousands of active members from all 50 States whose lives \nwere often dramatically changed for the better by their enrollment \nyears ago. Many traveled for the first time, learned new trades and \ndeveloped self-confidence, while sending much-needed money home to \ntheir families during the Depression.\n  This resolution would pay tribute to the lasting contribution of the \nCCC to natural resources conservation and infrastructure improvements \nand to its outstanding success in providing employment and training to \nmillions of Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S666-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S666]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 96--COMMENDING PRESIDENT PERVEZ MUSHARRAF \nOF PAKISTAN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP AND WELCOMING HIM TO THE \n                             UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Wellstone) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to.\n\n                            S.

and\n       (B) the wild Asian bear population has declined \n     significantly in recent years as a result of habitat loss and \n     poaching due to a strong demand for bear viscera used in \n     traditional medicines and cosmetics;\n       (4) Federal and State undercover operations have revealed \n     that American bears have been poached for their viscera;\n       (5) while most American black bear populations are \n     generally stable or increasing, commercial trade could \n     stimulate poaching and threaten certain populations if the \n     demand for bear viscera increases;

Mr. REID (for Mr. Conrad) proposed an amendment to amendment \nSA 2471 submitted by Mr. Daschle and intended to be proposed to the \nbill (S. 1731) to strengthen the safety net for agricultural producers, \nto enhance resource conservation and rural development, to provide for \nfarm credit, agricultural research, nutrition, and related programs, to \nensure consumers abundant food and fiber, and for other purposes; as \nfollows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       Since both political parties have pledged not to misuse \n     Social Security surplus funds by spending them for other \n     purposes; and\n       Since under the Administration's fiscal year 2003 budget, \n     the federal government is projected to spend the Social \n     Security surplus for other purposes in each of the next 10 \n     years;\n       Since permanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal \n     would cost, according to the Administration's estimate, \n     approximately $104 billion over the next 10 years, all of \n     which would further reduce the Social Security surplus;\n       Therefore it is the Sense of the Senate that no Social \n     Security surplus funds should be used to pay to make \n     currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for wasteful \n     spending.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/12/senate-section/article/S672-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S672-S673]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. REID.
