At 10:30 this morning, the Senate will consider the \nAgriculture appropriations conference report under a 1-hour time \nagreement with a vote on the adoption of the report at approximately \n11:30.

There will be \nother business as well, perhaps including some additional nominations.\n  I have just consulted with Senator Hollings in regard to the airport \nsecurity legislation. He has indicated that negotiations continue. He \nwas encouraged by the progress made overnight. I have discussed the \nmatter at some length with Senator Lott over the course of the last \ncouple of days. It is his view, as it is mine, that we just cannot \nleave today, this week, until this matter has been completed.\n  I know a number of Senators have been interested in the schedule for \nthe balance of the week. I am not able to give them a definitive \nschedule with regard to votes, either today or tomorrow, until we know \nthe timeframe involved in completing our work on the airport security \nbill.\n  It is my hope and expectation that it would be done sometime today. \nIf not, of course, we will then take it up tomorrow, and Senators would \nbe required to stay for the vote on that very important legislation.\n  I ask Senators' patience. As soon as the progress becomes more \napparent, we will make a definitive judgment about the time involved in \nconsideration of the conference report later this week.\n  I thank Senators for their attention and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11869-7", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Senator Ensign and I rise to address the Senate on \nsomething we believe is extremely important.\n  For 20 years now, there have been attempts made to place high-level \nnuclear waste in the deserts outside Las Vegas. We have always believed \nthat the process has not been fair. Originally, there was supposed to \nbe three sites selected under the 1982 act. Washington, Texas, and \nNevada were the three sites chosen.\n  In 1987, for various reasons, the two other sites were eliminated, \nand so there is only one site now being focused. That is Yucca Mountain \nin Nevada.\n  Let's assume that a person is charged with a crime and they learn \nlater that the prosecutor and the person representing the accused were \nthe same lawyer. People would be outraged. If you were in an automobile \naccident and you had a trial and you suddenly\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nlearned that the person representing you, the person injured, also \nrepresented the insurance company, that would be unfair. That is what \nwe have just learned has been going on at Yucca Mountain.\n  We found that the attorney who was giving advice to Yucca Mountain \nand being paid up to $16 million, this law firm also was representing \nthe nuclear power industry.\n  Senator Ensign will outline for anyone within the sound of our voices \nhow this came about that we learned that there was one law firm \nrepresenting both sides in effect.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the senior Senator from Nevada. Back in July of \nthis year, one of the local Las Vegas Sun reporters, Ben Grove, brought \nout in a news report that there was a potential conflict of interest \ninvolving a law firm based in Chicago, Winston & Strawn, which was \nrepresenting not only the nuclear power industry but also the \nDepartment of Energy at the same time. We sent a letter together, dated \nAugust 1, to the Inspector General for the Department of Energy, asking \nthat the inspector general look into this conflict of interest. Late \nyesterday afternoon, the inspector general met with the senior Senator \nfrom Nevada and myself and laid out the full report on their findings. \nAs it turns out, the inspector general said that there has been \nvirtually no clear evidence of a conflict of interest in his time \nperiod that he has been doing these types of investigations. From \nSeptember 1999 until July 2001--and by the way, only because of the \nreporters bringing this thing to the public did Winston & Strawn \nterminate the relationship with the Energy Institute. But during that \nperiod of time, this law firm represented both the Department of Energy \nand the Nuclear Energy Institute.\n\n  Now, to paint what was going on there, the DOE had hired this law \nfirm to give them advice on the licensing process and the legal process \nfor building a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. During the time \nthat they were supposed to be getting unbiased information, they were \nbeing retained by the lobbying group that is pushing Yucca Mountain to \nbe built. This is a clear conflict of interest.\n  There were over 14 employees, from what we read in the report. This \nreport was released this morning publicly at 8 o'clock. It is on the \nInternet. But there were 14 employees that had done work both for the \nDepartment of Energy and for the Nuclear Energy Institute.\n  Potentially, up to $16 million is the total amount of lawyer's fees \nthat the DOE could be paying out to Winston & Strawn for supposedly \ngetting unbiased information. So I tell the senior Senator from Nevada, \nwith this information that we have received--and I know that my friend \nagrees--there should be a full investigation by the Department of \nEnergy and by the Nuclear Regulatory Institute, and anybody else \ninvolved in the licensing of Yucca Mountain, of how severely tainted \nwas the information they received on building Yucca Mountain. This is \nsupposed to be unbiased science and legal information. Was the science \nbiased now? Did the Department of Energy buy biased science? They have \nobviously bought biased legal work.\n  So there needs to be a full investigation of this whole process. We \nhave some very serious questions to come before the U.S. Senate next \nyear. The Department of Energy is ready to make their recommendation in \na favorable fashion on the suitability for Yucca Mountain. We think we \nneed to put the brakes on all of this and take a whole fresh new look.\n  So, Mr. President, I say to the senior Senator from Nevada that I \nthink we have some serious, serious matters before us that need the \nattention of quite a few people as we are going forward.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Nevada has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. As the Senator, my friend, from Nevada has indicated, 14 \nemployees working for this law firm were, in effect, giving advice to \nboth sides. This isn't like representing somebody who may have had a \nstop sign violation. This is a law firm that has represented the \nDepartment of Energy in an attempt to go forward on a licensing \nprocedure that affects the life and safety of tens of millions of \nAmericans. This not only involves the State of Nevada but the rest of \nthis country. The nuclear waste is going to have to travel across this \ncountry on highways and railways.\n  The advice the Department of Energy has been getting from this law \nfirm is tainted. This is a clear case of bias. It is an ethical \nmeltdown. What the people of Nevada need now is a full accounting of \nhow far this misconduct has spread. What my friend, the junior Senator \nfrom Nevada, has said is, has this gone over into the scientific \ncalculations and considerations made.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Ensign and I both \nhave 20 minutes, and if the Chair will advise us when we have 2 minutes \nleft.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The people of Nevada need a full accounting of how far this \nmisconduct has spread. The junior Senator from Nevada is a scientist. \nHe is a doctor of veterinary medicine. He knows how easy it is to \nmisinterpret, miscalculate scientific calculations.\n  I am a lawyer. I know what it means to have misconduct, to commit \nmalpractice. Certainly, that is what you have here. This is an ethical \nmeltdown. I think what this law firm of Winston & Strawn should be \ndoing today is searching for lawyers to represent them because what \nthey have done is, if not illegal, certainly unethical.\n  Mr. President, we have done this legislatively with the support of \nvarious administrations. Each Cabinet agency we have has an inspector \ngeneral who is independent. The inspector general doesn't have to \naccount to the Secretary of Energy. He is independent. Their terms go \nthrough different administrations. He was appointed during the Clinton \nadministration, now in the Bush administration. He is giving the best \nadvice that he can give. What he has determined is that this is one of \nthe most serious ethical violations they have ever found in that \ndepartment, and I think rightfully so.\n  The American people have spent millions of dollars on a biased \nreport, biased advice given to the Department of Energy.\n  We can't blame this on the Department of Energy. We blame them for a \nlot of things, but we can't blame them for this conflict of interest. \nWhen they were filing an application to get this account, they asked \nquestions such as: Do you have a conflict of interest? Do you represent \nparties adverse to giving good advice to the DOE? They said, without \nany qualifications, no.\n  I want to ask my friend from Nevada a question. The Senator is a \nscientist. He has a degree in veterinary medicine. He is a doctor. It \nis easy to spin science the wrong way, if you choose to do so, and not \nbe fair; is that correct?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. If the Senator will yield, I will go even further and say \nthat, in science, one of the reasons you even do what are called double \nblind studies is so that you don't prejudice yourself in going forward \nwith a potential conclusion. What I mean by that--and I will try to \ngive an example on this particular project--you would not want to have \npeople who are saying upfront that Yucca Mountain is safe for a nuclear \nrepository and, therefore, we are going to investigate it and prove \nthat it is safe. You want people to look at it who are going to say: We \ndon't know whether Yucca Mountain is safe or suitable for a nuclear \nrepository or not, but we are going to do the investigation to find out \nwhether it is suitable.\n  That would be an unbiased view. And then on top of that, if you have \npeople who have a financial interest giving you information, you can \nimagine how that can taint the whole process.\n  I say to the senior Senator from Nevada that the potential for bias \nhere in a scientific realm is very great and causes me great concern.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, DOE hired a biased lobbyist and an unethical \nlaw firm. What stops them from having already purchased biased or \nunethical science? Nothing.\n  I believe we need an independent scientific review of the science, an \nindependent review by scientists who have never received funding from \nDOE for Yucca Mountain work.\n  With this review, we would have a program that could stand the light \nof day. Until we do this, we have a tainted program, one that should be \nstopped. This involves 43 of our United\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\nStates, with train and truck traffic going through every one of those \nStates. This is very serious.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seven minutes remain.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The junior Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to point out a couple other items \nin this report. First, when the inspector general was giving us the \nbriefing, one of the things that was pointed out to us was that Winston \n& Strawn had actually recognized in some of their internal documents a \npotential conflict of interest.\n  Some of their senior people said that we need to put up some \nfirewalls within our firm to make sure if we have lawyers over here \nworking one way, that they are in no way in concert with some of the \nlawyers working with DOE, say, versus the Nuclear Energy Institute.\n  Those firewalls were never put in place. Let me repeat, those \nfirewalls which could have potentially stopped the conflict of interest \nwere never put in place. Instead, 14 lawyers worked on both sides. If \nthis is not a conflict of interest, if this does not spark people's \noutrage, not only at this law firm--by the way, upfront this law firm \nwas asked: Do you have any clients who would present a conflict of \ninterest?\n  When we let Government contracts, especially for law firms such as \nthis, they are always asked that same question. From what I \nunderstand--and if the senior Senator, being a lawyer, will address \nthis--there are people within law firms, there are ethical panels that \nreview whether there are going to be problems representing one side or \nthe other side to make sure that ethical violations do not occur simply \nbecause it is such a serious matter within the legal profession.\n  Will the senior Senator from Nevada address how that is set up within \nlaw firms, the whole ethics committee, to make sure they do not have \nthese conflicts of interest?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to respond to the question of the junior \nSenator from Nevada.\n  One of the things we discussed yesterday evening with the Office of \nthe Inspector General when they were going over the report they \nreleased this morning is that law firms have built-in mechanisms to \nprevent conflicts of interest. These large law firms can develop \nconflicts of interest, so every case they take is submitted to a \ncommittee. Even the relatively small law firms in Nevada that have 40, \n50, 60 lawyers have an apparatus within them where every new file they \ntake is looked over for conflicts.\n  I am astounded that Winston & Strawn did not have such a program. If \nthey did not have such a program, that is malpractice. If they did have \na program and avoided it, that is an ethical violation. That is why I \nhave said several times today, I think they need to find themselves a \nlawyer because what they have done is either criminal or unethical.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I want to point out one other item that is \nin this document to show what a conflict of interest we have. Winston & \nStrawn not only represented the Nuclear Energy Institute, but they also \nwere representing a company that manufactured the nuclear waste \ncontainers. There is no company that would benefit more from having \nYucca Mountain built than the company that builds these nuclear waste \ncontainers.\n  If they are representing people who are going to benefit financially \nfrom this project going forward--obviously, the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute does as well--clearly the people who make the casks to store \nthe waste are going to benefit hugely financially.\n  Those same lawyers representing this firm over here and also trying \nto give the Department of Energy unbiased information is so outrageous \nit is hard to even conceive.\n  I hope all our colleagues will take a fresh look at this issue \nbecause the Senate is going to be dealing with some very serious issues \nwhen it comes to Yucca Mountain over the next 12 months.\n  I hope, regardless of how people have voted in the past, that my \ncolleagues will take a fresh look and say: Maybe we need a timeout on \nthis issue.\n  About $7 billion has already been spent on Yucca Mountain. We \nappropriated another couple hundred million dollars this year. We are \ntalking a lot of money that is potentially being wasted, being put down \na rat hole. All of your colleagues need to take a fresh look at this \nbecause the GAO has said it is going to cost over $50 billion more to \nfinish this project. That is serious money, and we need to take a fresh \nlook.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor to the senior Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my final statement is, if this law firm, \nWinston & Strawn, had firewalls set up to see if there was a conflict \nof interest, these firewalls burned down. They burned to the ground. \nThis law firm, in my opinion, has burned to the ground. They should \nrefund the money to the Department of Energy, and I think the State Bar \nAssociation of Illinois should look at proceedings against this law \nfirm.\n  What they have done gives not only lawyers a bad name but gives the \nentire process dealing with Yucca Mountain a bad name. With Winston & \nStrawn's malfeasance, malpractice, and unethical actions, I think they \nshould refund the money, I repeat, and find themselves a good lawyer \nfor the other activities in which they have been engaged.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11871-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11871-S11872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     VETERANS BENEFITS ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on \n     December 1, 2001.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as chairman of the committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am tremendously pleased to urge prompt, favorable \nSenate action on the pending measure, legislation that will provide a \ncost-of-living adjustment to veterans' compensation for next year. This \nmeasure includes the actual adjusted amounts as calculated, based on \nthe increase in the Consumer Price Index. I thank my colleague on the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, Ranking Minority Member Senator Arlen \nSpecter, for his diligence and commitment to providing this important \nincrease to well deserving veterans.\n  The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2001 \ndirects the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase, as of December \n1, 2001, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, as well as \ncompensation for eligible dependents and surviving spouses. The \nlegislation raises compensation by 2.6 percent, the same percentage as \nthe increase provided to Social Security recipients.\n  It is particularly timely that we move this legislation during the \nweek of Veterans Day. Veterans and their families depend on the cost-\nof-living increase to ensure that their well-deserved benefits not be \neroded by inflation. Veterans' disability compensation rates must keep \npace with the increasing cost of living.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Summary of S. 1088\n\n       This bill contains the annual Cost-of-Living Adjustment \n     (COLA) to veterans disability compensation. The manager's \n     amendment strikes the text of the House bill and inserts the \n     actual amount of the increased rates. The percentage of the \n     increase will be the same percentage--2.6 percent--as Social \n     Security recipients will receive. There are no other \n     provisions contained in the bill as amended.\n\n  The bill (H. R. 2540), as amended, was read the third time and \npassed.\n  The title amendment (No. 2150) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       Amend the title so as to read ``An Act to amend title 38, \n     United States Code, to provide a cost-of-living adjustment in \n     the rates of disability compensation for veterans with \n     service-connected disabilities and the rates of dependency \n     and indemnity compensation for survivors of such veterans.''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nnow proceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying \nH.R. 2330, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2330), making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and related agency \n     programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, \n     having met have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees \n     on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The report is printed in the House Proceedings of the Record of \nNovember 9, 2001, page H7962.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will be 60 \nminutes of debate on the conference report with the time to be equally \ndivided and controlled.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring to the Senate, the \nconference report on H.R. 2330, the Agriculture, Rural Development, \nFood and Drug, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002. The House \napproved this measure day before yesterday, and we need to take swift \naction in the Senate on final passage in order for the President to \nsign this conference report into law as soon as possible.\n  This conference report includes $75.8 billion in total spending for \nfiscal year 2002. These funds will be used to support programs and \nservices of the\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture--except for the Forest \nService--the Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. Of this total, $16 billion is discretionary \nspending, and this amount is within the subcommittee's 302(b) \nallocation.\n  As I have stated before, this is not simply an ``agricultural'' bill. \nThis bill not only supports the rural sector, it supports all sectors. \nIt supports families in the cities; it supports inspectors along our \nborders; it supports the availability of drugs and vaccines to respond \nto the challenges of today and whatever tomorrow may bring. I support \nthis conference report, and I hope all Senators will do the same.\n  Again, I thank Senator Cochran, ranking member of this subcommittee, \nand his staff for their tireless and indispensable help this year. I \nalso thank my staff and all people who have helped bring us to this \nfinal stage of the appropriations process.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized \nfor such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join my friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Kohl, to present for the Senate's approval the \nconference report on H.R. 2330. This conference agreement provides \ntotal new budget authority of $75.8 billion for the programs and \nactivities administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, \nthe Food and Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission. These include programs that provide housing opportunities \nfor low and moderate-income residents of rural America, that protect \nour Nation's food supplies against pests and diseases, assure the \nsafety and efficacy of drugs and medical products, and provide \nnutrition assistance for America's children and working families.\n  This is the seventh conference report of the 13 regular fiscal year \n2002 appropriations bills to be presented to the Senate this year for \napproval. This conference agreement has been approved by the House of \nRepresentatives by a substantial vote in that body, and Senate passage \nof the conference report today would be the final step necessary to \nsend this bill to the President for his signature. I am hopeful the \nSenate will approve the conference report and give our committee a vote \nof confidence in our efforts to resolve successfully the differences \nthat existed between the Senate and House-passed bills.\n  We think we defended the Senate's interests aggressively, and we \nworked out a compromise that will serve the interests not only of the \ntwo bodies but of the American people as well.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition? Time is running.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under whose time does the Senator seek recognition?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Under that of the ranking minority member, Senator \nCochran.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. From Senator Cochran. Very well, the \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Kohl, and Senator Cochran, for the tremendous cooperation they \nhave extended to me and Idaho agriculture as we have considered this \nvery important appropriations bill. I am pleased the conference report \nis now before us.\n  We all know that agriculture over the last 4 or 5 years has had a \nvery difficult time, especially at the production level, in finding a \ncommodity with which the producer could break even or make a profit. \nThat has certainly been true in my State of Idaho. While that has gone \non, there have been opportunities to improve the research capability \nand certainly the conference report we have before us represents that. \nAll of our Nation's agricultural production has historically benefited \nfrom Federal dollars that have flowed into research at our colleges and \nuniversities that ultimately produce hybrid crops, better techniques, \nbetter conservation, better use of water and soil. All of those things \nin combination make agriculture as great as it is in our country today.\n  I am always amazed at the abundance we have produced as a result of a \nprivate-State-Federal partnership. It can at times be a problem, too, \nand that explains part of where we are today. With phenomenal abundance \nand availability of commodities, commodity prices in the last several \nyears have been at about their all-time lows in relation to the cost of \nproduction. As a result of that, certainly this appropriating \nsubcommittee and the authorizing Committee of Agriculture here in the \nSenate, along with the House of Representatives, has made every effort \nto assure that production agriculture at least had a safety net so we \nwould not lose this valuable part of the American economy.\n  I know our consumers oftentimes take for granted when they go to the \nsupermarket, and go to the food shelf in that supermarket, finding such \nan abundance at such a low price. They oftentimes assume it is always \ngoing to be there. Very seldom do we have the ability to look behind at \nthe thousands and thousands of American producers and processors that \nprovide that high-quality food to the American consumer. This \nlegislation assists in that important part of the American lifestyle \nand the American economy.\n  Also, as agriculture has dwindled, and especially in my State of \nIdaho where we have seen Federal policy and national attitudes over the \nlast two or three decades that would suggest we ought not log or we \nought not mine or we ought not graze because somehow it damages the \nenvironment, we have seen rural economies dwindle, unemployment rise, \nand many of our rural areas, which are farm and resource communities, \nin dire straits.\n  In this package is also a rural economic development component that \nis increasingly important to rural America. As agriculture struggles, \nmany of the other associated service industries, and many of the \nindustries that were very typical in my State, have suffered even more. \nMany of them have shut down. Over the last decade, and in part because \nof the philosophy of the former administration, we have seen an 80-\npercent decline in logging on public lands. That has cost Idaho, and \nother States like Idaho, tens of thousands of jobs. As a result, \nunemployment in those areas has grown to 12 percent and 14 percent.\n  Unemployment means people out of work. It means no food on the table. \nOftentimes it means fewer clothes for the children. It means strife \nwithin the family because of the economic circumstances they are \nexperiencing. To be able to turn that around is part of my job. But it \nis also part of the job of the Congress, to have sensitivity toward \neconomic development of the kind that is, in fact, represented here as \nwe strive to fund U.S. Forest Service programs, USDA programs that will \nbenefit rural communities of the kind that make up a very large part of \nmy State.\n  I thought it important and appropriate this morning that I come to \nthe floor to thank the chairman, Senator Kohl, and the ranking member, \nSenator Cochran, for the cooperation and the sensitivity they have \nshown. Certainly, the chairman of the full committee, who is now the \nPresiding Officer here in the Senate, has always had an eye to rural \nAmerica. I appreciate that because his State of West Virginia is much \nlike mine. It is built on resources. It is built on mining. It is built \non the rural lifestyle.\n  That has been and remains a major part of the American economy. This \nbill represents that sensitivity, and I thank them for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  How much time do I have, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Byrd has up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, Senator Kohl, who is also \nchairman of the agriculture appropriations subcommittee. I thank him \nfor his good work on behalf of the people of his State, for his good \nwork on behalf of the people of my State, and for his good work on \nbehalf of the people of the Nation. He is an apt student of public \nservice and of the legislative process. He is one of my favorites. When \nI speak in that term, I think of the legislative process and I think of \nthis institution, the Senate.\n  I also thank Senator Cochran, who is the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee. I thank him for his service to the Nation and to his \npeople and to my people--to our people. Senator Cochran likewise does \ngood work for the Nation and for the committee. He is a very able \nmember of the Appropriations Committee.\n  This conference report includes $75.8 billion in total spending for \nfiscal year 2002. This amount is $3 million below the level passed by \nthe Senate. Of the total amount provided, $16.0 billion is \ndiscretionary spending, and this amount is within the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation. This conference does not include one cent--not one \ncopper penny--of emergency spending.\n  This conference report supports programs related to agricultural \nresearch, conservation, rural development, promotion of international \ntrade, and many other traditional programs for which the agriculture \nbill has become so well known. This conference report also supports \ndomestic food programs such as Food Stamps and the Women, Infants, and \nChildren, WIC, program, as well as the other food safety and public \nhealth programs of the Food and Drug Administration and other agencies. \nThe programs supported by this conference report serve the most basic \nof needs of the American people in nearly every facet of their lives.\n  On September 11--another day that will always live in history, a date \nthat will not be a footnote in the annals of mankind--the American \npeople were reminded of the importance of programs related to public \nhealth, food supply, and food safety. These programs have long been a \npart of the Agriculture Appropriations bill, and they are continued, \nand strengthened, by this bill.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report contains a \nnumber of provisions related to the treatment of animals--those \ncreatures that cannot speak for themselves, those creatures without \nwhich mankind would perish. We should think of them, and we do think of \nthem. There are two principle underlying statutes that provide \nauthority to agencies under the jurisdiction of this conference report \non the subject of animal treatment. They are the Animal Welfare Act and \nthe Humane Slaughter Act.\n  The Animal Welfare Act was first authorized by Public Law 89-544, the \nAct of August 24, 1966, and is today carried out by USDA's Animal and \nPlant Health Inspection Service (APHIS). The primary purpose of this \nAct was to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to regulate the \ntransportation, sale, and handling of dogs, cats, and certain other \nanimals intended to be used for purposes of research or \nexperimentation, and for other purposes. Think of the service that \nthose animals render to mankind. And they don't do it without a \nsacrifice to themselves. Today, in addition, this act is used to \nregulate individual dog breeders and handlers and larger operations \nsuch as circuses and zoos around the nation.\n  The Humane Slaughter Act was originally passed in 1958, and requires \nthat animals be rendered insensitive to pain before they are killed in \na slaughterhouse. This Act is today carried out by USDA's Food Safety \nInspection Service, FSIS.\n  For a number of years, the level of funding at APHIS for inspections \nand enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act had been held stagnant. More \nrecently, this Congress has been able to provide significant increases \nfor these activities, including $2.5 million provided through an \namendment I offered in the supplemental appropriations bill that was \nsigned into law on July 20, 2001.\n  In this conference report, additional increases are provided for \nthese purposes. In this conference report that we are debating today, I \nsay, additional increases are provided for these purposes.\n  This conference report includes an increase of $2.4 million above the \nPresident's request for animal welfare inspections and the conferees \nhave directed the agency to hire additional inspectors and support \nstaff to increase the overall number of inspections, and to conduct \nmore repeat inspections of facilities found to be in noncompliance with \nthe act. Let's go back and look at them again, if they are not \ncomplying with the act. This year's appropriation of $15,167,000--in \naddition to funds made available in the supplemental--represents an \nincrease of 60 percent since fiscal year 1999. So, at last, we are \npaying more attention--and we ought to pay more attention--to these \nanimals and to the enforcement of the law in regard to their slaughter.\n  Increased inspections are logically followed by increased demand for \ninvestigations and enforcement. This conference report includes an \nincrease of $1,852,000--that is in addition to funds made available in \nthe supplemental--for APHIS investigation and enforcement activities. \nIn addition, Statement of Managers language directs the agency to hire \nadditional inspectors to service the backlog of animal care \ninvestigations. I would like to mention that the conference committee \nbecame aware of reported violations of the Animal Welfare Act regarding \ntreatment of polar bears by a traveling circus, and Statement of \nManagers language is included directing the agency to investigate this \nmatter, take appropriate action, and report to the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Earlier this year, news accounts described incidents in meat \nslaughterhouses which were atrocious--atrocious--violations of the \nHumane Slaughter Act. As part of the $2.5 million amendment that I \nsponsored in this year's supplemental, an enhanced program of oversight \nwithin the agency has been initiated to ensure better enforcement of \nthis act. Last month, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that \nit had begun this new initiative--using both funds provided by the \nsupplemental and other Departmental funds--and had placed additional \nFSIS personnel in field district offices to work closely with plant \ninspectors and veterinarians.\n  These individuals, who will be officially known as ``Humane Handling \nVerification Experts and Liaisons''-- let me repeat, these individuals, \nwho will be officially known as ``Humane Handling Verification Experts \nand Liaisons''--will work to tighten up enforcement and oversight of \nthe Humane Slaughter Act.\n\n  We are talking about animals. I am not one of those who claim that \nman is an animal. Man was created a little lower than the angels but \nabove the beasts of the field. Read the Scriptures. Read Milton's \n``Paradise Lost.'' Yes, the animals serve us every day in ways that we \ndo not tend to remember. They serve us. But for the animals, mankind \nwould not exist upon the Earth, in all likelihood. Oh, you say, he \nmight become a vegetarian, but what about the beasts of burden? The \nrighteous man looks to the welfare of his beast. So, I intend to watch \nthis initiative. You can bet on it. I intend to watch this initiative \nwith keen interest and will look forward to making sure that resources \nare continually provided to make it an effective tool to stop inhumane \ntreatment of animals.\n  I guess my little dog Billy has had a great deal to do with my \nattitude toward animals. He has a little sister named Bonnie. Billy \nByrd is 15 years old. But if there is a creature on this Earth that is \nabsolutely and forever unfailingly loyal and dedicated to me--and there \nis--it is my little dog Billy, that Maltese terrier. He is an animal, \nbut he feels pain. He must understand affection and love because he \ngives it to me and he gives it to Erma; and I give it and she gives it \nin return.\n  Yes, never does he let me leave the door for work that he does not \nfollow me to the last step. That is an animal. We are talking about \nanimals that are slaughtered for the food that graces\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nthe table of men and women and children around the world--animals that \nwe should treat humanely.\n  Mr. President, again I want to congratulate the chairman and the \nranking member of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee for a job \nwell done. Well done, Senator Kohl. Well done, Senator Cochran. I also \nthank all members of the subcommittee for their contributions to this \nfinal product. I thank the members of the staff on both sides of the \naisle, without whom, where would we find ourselves. I thank them. I \nsupport this conference report, and I hope that all Senators will do \nthe same.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of the conference report to H.R. 2330, the \nAgriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and \nRelated Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $16.018 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, which will result in new outlays in 2002 of $12.038 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for the report total $16.282 billion in \n2002. By comparison, the Senate-passed version of the bill provided \n$16.137 billion in discretionary budget authority, which would have \nresulted in $16.118 billion in total outlays. The conference report is \nat its revised Section 302(b) allocation for budget authority and \noutlays. The conferees have met their target without the use of any \nemergency designations.\n  I commend Senators Kohl and Cochran for working together in a \nbipartisan manner with their House counterparts to complete in an \nexpedited manner the conference to this very important piece of \nlegislation, which provides funding for agriculture, conservation, \nrural development, and domestic food programs. I also commend Chairman \nByrd and Senator Stevens, as well as House Chairman Young and Ranking \nMember Obey on the significant progress made by the two appropriations \ncommittees over the last couple of weeks in completing the 2002 \nappropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nbudget committee scoring of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nCONFERENCE REPORT TO H.R. 2330, THE AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD\n AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002,\n                 SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     General\n                                     purpose     Mandatory      Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority...............       16,018       43,112       59,130\n  Outlays........................       16,282       33,847       50,129\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............       16,018       43,112       59,130\n  Outlays........................       16,282       33,847       50,129\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,399       43,112       58,511\n  Outlays........................       15,789       33,847       49,636\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       15,668       43,112       58,780\n  Outlays........................       16,044       33,847       49,891\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............       16,137       43,112       59,249\n  Outlays........................       16,118       33,847       49,965\n \n  CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority...............            0            0            0\n  Outlays........................            0            0            0\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority...............          619            0          619\n  Outlays........................          493            0          493\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............          350            0          350\n  Outlays........................          238            0          238\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority...............         -119            0         -119\n  Outlays........................          164            0          164\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the\n  conference report to the revised Senate 302(b) allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted\n  for consistency with scorekeeping conventions.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Who yields time to the \nSenator from Illinois?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield the 3\\1/2\\ minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. First, I \ncongratulate him on his excellent remarks. All of us who have owned \npets and have developed a friendship and affection for them can \ncertainly identify with his kind words about his beloved Billy Byrd and \nBilly Byrd's sister Bonnie. I say to Senator Byrd, I was not aware your \ndog had a sister. I am glad that has been reported formally in the \nCongressional Record.\n  I also congratulate Senator Kohl because he has worked hard on the \nAgriculture appropriations bill that is before us. I am happy to serve \non the subcommittee. I know the hours that have been put in by the \nSenator and his staff.\n  Let me highlight two aspects of this bill that we ought to keep in \nmind. It is known as the Agriculture appropriations bill, but it is so \nmuch more.\n  As important as agriculture is to America, this bill contains as much \nmoney or more for nutrition and feeding as it does for agricultural \nprograms.\n  This morning a man by the name of Robert Forney came to my office. \nBob is an old friend. He was head of the Chicago Stock Exchange. When \nhe retired last year, Bob Forney became the CEO of a program known as \nSecond Harvest. Second Harvest is the largest emergency food provider \nin America. They keep the canned goods and other items of food \navailable for families who are struggling.\n  Bob came to tell me this morning that the challenge facing food banks \nacross America and feeding programs is growing geometrically; 415,000 \nAmericans lost their jobs last month. Many of them lost jobs that don't \nqualify for unemployment insurance, and they are struggling to feed \ntheir children.\n  In this land of prosperity, children are going hungry and the numbers \ngrow by the day. This bill, with its provision for WIC, for mothers, \ninfants, and small children, as well as the provision for food stamps, \naddresses that. We ought to be mindful of the need to watch this \nclosely. More money probably will be needed before the end of the next \nfiscal year.\n  There is an important element in this bill about food safety. I \nsalute Senator Byrd, who stood here yesterday and said: Let us put \nmoney into food security at a time when American families are worried \nabout bioterrorism. We lost because colleagues from the other side of \nthe aisle said this is not an emergency. We know better. America knows \nbetter.\n  This bill, which funds the Food and Drug Administration and the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to make certain that our food is safe, \nprovides funds, but the bill offered by Senator Byrd would have given \nthe additional resources needed for more inspectors, better inspection, \nbetter peace of mind for people all across America. That bill was \ndefeated. I hope we have a chance to debate that again.\n  What happened yesterday really turned this Chamber on its head. We \nare supposed to listen to the people we represent. We are supposed to \nspeak for them and advocate for them. What Senator Byrd came forward \nwith yesterday was spending so that we could produce vaccines to \nprepare America for a possible bioterrorist attack. Some have said: \nThere the Democrats go again, spending money right and left on \nporkbarrel. Vaccines to immunize our children and families in case of a \nbioterrorist attack is not porkbarrel or wasteful. It is prudent and \nthoughtful. I thank Senator Byrd for his leadership on that.\n  Putting money into law enforcement: We tried yesterday so that across \nIllinois and West Virginia and Wisconsin and across the Nation, our \nfirst responders, whether police or firefighters, will have the \nresources to respond to an act of terrorism.\n  Modernization for computers: The Senator from West Virginia may be \nstunned to learn, as I did recently, that a new FBI agent told me their \ncomputer system at the FBI does not have e-mail, nor does it have \naccess to the Internet. That is the computer system of the premier law \nenforcement agency in America.\n  Senator Byrd put resources in that bill to modernize computers at the \nFBI and other important law enforcement\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\nagencies. The Republicans voted against it, saying it was not an \nemergency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield 30 seconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am always happy to yield to the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  I thank Senator Durbin, the very distinguished and able Senator from \nIllinois, for his kind remarks and for his references to the amendment \nof yesterday. We will be back.\n  I again thank the distinguished Senator who yielded me the time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, the Agriculture appropriations bill is fundamental to \nthe Nation's agricultural economy and supports foreign and domestic \nfood programs. Unfortunately, porkbarrel interests also received \nremarkable support in this final conference report. While this final \nconference report includes less porkbarrel spending than the Senate \nbill passed just a couple weeks ago, it still includes $335 million in \nwasteful, unnecessary, and unreviewed spending which is $30 million \nmore than the amount included in the final report passed last year.\n  Every single appropriations bill we have passed so far has an \nincrease in porkbarrel spending over last year. We are now up to $9.6 \nbillion of wasted, unnecessary programs.\n  While the Senator from Wisconsin is on the floor, I saw one of the \nmore egregious things happen the other night when there was a managers' \npackage which had 35 provisions in it. When we were about to vote on \nit, I asked: Does anybody here know what is in this package? No one \ndid.\n  We found out what was in it. What was in it was a violation of a \ntrade agreement we just concluded with Vietnam. We found 15 porkbarrel \nprojects identified by State for members of the appropriations \nsubcommittee. I tell the Senator from Wisconsin, I will not allow a \nvote again until the managers' package is examined. That was an \negregious act that was done by the Senate. My constituents deserve a \nlot better than what happened the other night with a managers' package \nwhich was brought up late in the evening. No one had seen it. When we \nfound out, it was certainly something that I never would have allowed \nto pass.\n  When the Senate considered and passed the Agriculture spending bill a \ncouple weeks ago, the typical porkbarrel trickery reached unprecedented \nlevels. Midnight legislative riders were covertly slipped in unseen by \na majority of the Senate. Erroneous earmarks for special interest \nprojects were tacked on--again, unseen and circumventing the normal \ncommittee process--and funding priorities in stark discord with that of \nthe administration.\n  Many of my colleagues have spoken before the Senate about the \neconomic struggle of America's farmers. Common sense would dictate that \nthis bill be directed towards supporting those Federal programs that \nmost benefit farmers in need. Instead, special interests reign and \nmillions of taxpayers' dollars are diverted to funding research \nfacilities, universities, and farming conglomerates.\n  Even emergency dollars provided by Congress for farmers do not reach \nintended beneficiaries. This porkbarrel bonanza includes millions for \nprojects that administrations have proposed for elimination year after \nyear. Yet generous benefactors on the Appropriations Committee keep the \nspigot open and continue to drain dollars from hard-working taxpayers.\n  This method of budget monopolization is ricocheting out of control. \nLet's take a look at the top 10 porkbarrel earmarks in this final \nAgriculture appropriations bill.\n  No. 10, $2.2 million for the Center for Cool and Cold Water \nAquaculture in Leetown, WV. I come from a pretty hot State. It is \nstarting to cool off now. Maybe we could get some of that money out in \nArizona for cool and cold water aquaculture rather than have it all be \ndevoted to Leetown, WV.\n  No. 9, $600,000 for a tristate joint peanut research project in \nAlabama. Naturally it is in Alabama, but it is tristate.\n  No. 8, $600,000 for agricultural waste utilization in West Virginia. \nNowhere else in America--$600,000 for agricultural waste utilization in \nWest Virginia. I guess agricultural waste needs to be utilized more \nimportantly in West Virginia than any other part of America.\n  No. 7, Increase of $750,000 for the Wisconsin Livestock \nIdentification Consortium. We now have a consortium in Wisconsin to \nidentify livestock.\n  No. 6, $2 million to pay for efficient irrigation in New Mexico and \nTexas--efficient irrigation in New Mexico and Texas.\n  No. 5, $100,000 for the Trees Forever Program in Illinois. Trees \nForever. I have mentioned on the floor, I would like to see a cactus \nforever program. Perhaps the appropriators might devote that to my \nState of Arizona.\n  No. 4, $200,000 for the Iowa Soybean Association. Last I checked, the \nIowa Soybean Association was a private organization composed of \nindividuals who decided to join in this association in support of \nsoybeans. Now we are going to give them $200,000.\n  No. 3, $4.5 million for the U.S. Vegetable Laboratory in Charleston, \nSC.\n  No. 2, $230,000 for animal waste management in Oklahoma.\n  No. 1, $100,000 for the Weed It Now initiative in Massachusetts, New \nYork, and Connecticut. Weed It Now. Mr. President, we need a Weed It \nNow program on these appropriations bills. We need to weed out this \noutrageous dispensation of American tax dollars.\n  I want to speak briefly about one of the concealed provisions slipped \ninto the managers' amendment just before the Senate passed this bill. \nThis provision effectively bans all imports of Vietnamese catfish into \nthe United States. The sly wording of this measure doesn't mention \nVietnam at all. But it does patently violate our solemn trade agreement \nwith Vietnam, before the Vietnamese National Assembly has even ratified \nthat agreement. The ink isn't even dry yet, and we are violating that. \nWhy? No doubt it was inserted on behalf of several large, wealthy U.S. \nagribusinesses that will handsomely profit by killing competition from \nVietnamese catfish imports.\n  Whether you are a free trader or an opponent of harmful special \ninterest riders hidden in big spending bills, you can't help but find \nthis sort of behavior to be a scandalous abrogation of our duty to the \nnational interest. After preaching for years to the Vietnamese about \nthe need to get government out of the business of micromanaging their \neconomy, we have sadly implicated ourselves in the very sin our trade \npolicy claims to reject. I will work with Senators Kerry, Phil Gramm, \nand others to see that this offensive trade barrier doesn't stand.\n  We have a great responsibility to American citizens. I urge my \ncolleagues to exercise greater prudence and principle in this \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I have an article from the Wall Street Journal of \nyesterday, and I also have an article from the Washington Post of \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent that both of those articles be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 14, 2001]\n\n    Add-On Spending Projects Are on Course To Exceed Those of Last \n                             Administration\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Washington.--After tough talk last spring, the White House \n     appears to be retreating from its vow to stem the tide of \n     year-end spending projects added by Congress to annual \n     appropriations bills.\n       Soon after taking office, the administration proposed to \n     write off billions of dollars in existing pork-barrel \n     projects as ``one-time'' expenditures. But as the legislative \n     session draws to a close just the opposite is the case, and \n     the number of so-called spending earmarks by lawmakers may \n     actually be growing.\n       Congress yesterday sent President Bush a $112.7 billion \n     appropriations bill estimated to have close to 1,400 earmarks \n     attached to science, veterans, housing and environmental \n     programs. The list of projects in a single account in the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development consumed 10 pages \n     of the Congressional Record, and space-science programs \n     increasingly have become a conduit for grants to home state \n     universities.\n       The action came as House and Senate negotiators approved a \n     $75.9 billion agriculture budget adding scores of research \n     projects along with an amendment to help U.S. catfish growers \n     fight off imports from Vietnam.\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\n     Hours later, still more earmarks were approved as part of a \n     final $39.3 billion Commerce, Justice, and State Department \n     budget that adds money for maritime loan subsidies that the \n     White House wants to terminate.\n       The administration has raised objections, but nothing like \n     this week's veto threat over how much Congress can spend in \n     response to the terrorist attacks. For example, in a recent \n     five-page letter to negotiators on the HUD and science bill, \n     the issue of earmarks was almost the last issue raised by \n     Budget Director Mitchell Daniels Jr. His Deputy, Sean \n     O'Keefe, insisted yesterday that progress is being made \n     incrementally, but on a bipartisan basis, House \n     Appropriations staff say the administration has been little \n     help in curbing the more earmark-prone Senate. ``We haven't \n     heard a peep,'' said James Dyer, chief clerk to the House \n     Appropriations panel.\n       Last spring, the tone was very different, as the Office of \n     Management and Budget tallied up more than 6,000 earmarks \n     costing $15 billion in the last appropriations bills approved \n     by the departing Clinton administration. In trying to make \n     room for its own initiatives--including the president's tax \n     cut--OMB assumed cuts of $8 billion from such earmarks and \n     other ``one time'' expenditures. Failure to enforce this \n     budget discipline, now, could come back to haunt the \n     administration, which faces the prospect of rising costs \n     because of terrorist strikes and a troubled economy.\n       The revised agriculture budget yesterday is a first sign of \n     these pressures. As unemployment has risen, so has the \n     projected caseload next year for federal nutrition programs, \n     and lawmakers had to add $211 million to Mr. Bush's request \n     to pay these bills.\n       All of this comes at a time of increasingly bitter \n     relations between the Appropriations and OMB. Mr. Daniels is \n     blamed by lawmakers in both parties for precipitating the \n     veto clash this week with Mr. Bush. In a ``Dear Mitch'' \n     letter, House Appropriations Chairman Bill Young (R., Fla.) \n     and Wisconsin Rep. David Obey, the ranking Democrat, asked \n     that OMB freeze all spending and transfers from an emergency \n     fund until there is more consultation with the panel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 15, 2001]\n\n                    In Congress, Pork Stays on Menu\n\n\n        pet projects sometimes at odds with new spending demands\n\n                   (By John Lancaster and Dan Morgan)\n\n       Last month, lawmakers rejected a proposal to add $131 \n     million to a program that helps Russia keep track of its \n     nuclear stockpile. It's not that they didn't like the idea: \n     After Sept. 11, almost everyone in Congress agrees on the \n     need to do more to stop terrorists from acquiring nuclear \n     bombs.\n       But House and Senate negotiators meeting to decide the \n     final shape of a $24.6 billion spending bill covering the \n     nation's nuclear and water programs could not find room for \n     the increase.\n       They had other priorities, including:\n       A museum at the Atomic Testing History Institute in Las \n     Vegas ($1 million);\n       Aquatic-weed removal in the Lavaca and Navidad rivers in \n     Texas ($350,000).\n       A study of erosion on Waikiki Beach in Hawaii ($350,000).\n       Targeting funds for specific projects at the request of \n     individual lawmakers is a time-honored ritual on Capital \n     Hill, and this year is no exception. But as Congress \n     completes work on 13 annual spending bills, its business-as-\n     usual approach to managing the federal budget is colliding \n     with the new demands of fighting terrorism.\n       The soaring costs of responding to the attacks--Congress \n     has already approved $40 billion for the purpose--have done \n     little so far to curb congressional appetites for \n     courthouses, highways, dams, parks and other purely parochial \n     items. According to congressional aides, the number of such \n     ``earmarks'' in this year's crop of spending bills is likely \n     to approach or even exceed last year's record number, which \n     was estimated by the White House budget office at 6,400 (a \n     threefold increase from 1995).\n       Many of the earmarks, as in previous years, reflect \n     political clout more than national need. Money is flowing \n     disproportionately to the districts of appropriations \n     committee members and congressional leaders--including self-\n     described fiscal conservatives such as Senate Minority Leader \n     Trent Lott, who secured millions for projects in his home \n     state of Mississippi.\n       ``These legislative hijinks are bad enough in peacetime,'' \n     Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) told the Senate last week, after \n     noting acidly that on Sept. 13, while the Pentagon and the \n     World Trade Center ``still smoldered,'' the Senate approved \n     $2 million for the Oregon Groundfish Outreach Program. \n     ``America is at war. . . . Congress should grow up and stop \n     treating the domestic budget as a political Toys R Us.''\n       There is no shortage of examples: $510,000 for a chapel at \n     Kaneohe Bay Marine Corps Base in Hawaii; $100,000 to study \n     the feasibility of converting a building in Martinsburg, W. \n     Va., to a museum for Army artifacts; $70,000 to refurbish a \n     bird observatory in Montgomery County, Pa.; $500,000 for the \n     Montana Sheep Institute.\n       ``Pork thrives in good times and bad times,'' said Allen \n     Schick, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution. \n     He added, ``the problem is not the individual project, but \n     the cumulative effect. . . . When you add up the total, it \n     just blows your mind.''\n       Earmarks do not automatically swell the federal budget, \n     because in some cases they merely direct government agencies \n     to spend money for specific purposes within the limits of \n     available funds. But many of this year's items were added on \n     top of President Bush's budget request, sometimes in House-\n     Senate conferences where they received little scrutiny. \n     Successive administrations have insisted that such choices \n     are better left to federal agencies, complaining that \n     earmarks create upward pressure on the budget by crowding out \n     more important needs.\n       Members of the appropriations committees--who note that the \n     Constitution grants Congress authority over spending--say \n     they can judge local needs better than federal bureaucrats \n     because they have their ears to the ground back home.\n       Several congressional aides defended this year's earmarks, \n     observing that spending legislation was largely drafted--and \n     in some cases voted on by one or both chambers--before Sept. \n     11. They also noted that, whatever the particulars of \n     individual bills, spending is on track to stay within the \n     overall budget ceiling of $686 billion negotiated by the Bush \n     administration and congressional leaders last month.\n       There is little question, however, that the fat surplus \n     projections of recent years, now fading into memory, have \n     eased pressure on Congress to show restraint. White House \n     budget director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. has all but abandoned \n     the quest he launched earlier this year to contain the \n     practice of earmarking. ``To be honest, the appropriators \n     weren't that receptive,'' an administration official said.\n       Despite broad bipartisan agreement on the need to spend \n     more to fight terrorism--lawmakers have tried without success \n     to persuade the White House to lift the $40 billion ceiling \n     on emergency spending related to the Sept. 11 attacks--they \n     have been reluctant to do so at the expense of pet projects \n     back home.\n       During a House-Senate conference on the energy and water \n     bill Oct. 26, for example, Rep. Chet Edwards (D-Tex.) offered \n     an amendment that would have added $131 million to an Energy \n     Department program to help Russia safeguard its nuclear \n     materials. He was responding, in part, to a January warning \n     by a department task force--chaired by former Senate \n     Republican leader Howard H. Baker Jr. (Tenn.) and former \n     White House counsel Lloyd Cutler--that lax nuclear security \n     in Russia was ``the most urgent unmet national security \n     threat to the United States today.''\n       But conferees rejected Edwards's proposal to shift the \n     money from a program to refurbish nuclear warheads in the \n     U.S. arsenal. Nor did they consider taking funds from \n     hundreds of local water projects or other earmarks, such as \n     the atomic history museum.\n       ``That's a very fair question to ask,'' Edwards said when \n     queried about why he did not suggest the option.\n       Edwards said that while he would have been open to an \n     across-the-board cut in water projects to fund the \n     nonproliferation program, ``it is politically very \n     difficult'' to eliminate individual earmarks--some of which, \n     he acknowledged, he sought on behalf of his own constituents.\n       The $1 million earmark to pay for exhibits at the Atomic \n     Testing History Institute was added by Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-\n     Nev.), the assistant majority leader, who chairs the energy \n     and water panel of the Appropriations Committee. Reid's hand \n     is evident throughout the final bill, which adds 50 Nevada-\n     specific items worth $146 million to Bush's original budget \n     request.\n       According to a spokesman, Reid strongly supports the Energy \n     Department's nonproliferation efforts but objects to shifting \n     funds for the purpose ``at the eleventh hour.'' The \n     spokesman, Nathan Naylor, said it was not surprising that a \n     bill to fund nuclear programs would steer a lot of money to \n     Nevada, given the state's central role in nuclear testing.\n       Naylor said the atomic history museum would ``chronicle the \n     historic sacrifice that Nevada has made for the country \n     during the Cold War,'' when some of its residents were \n     poisoned by radiation from above-ground tests in the 1950s. \n     ``This is part of our history, and if this is what it costs \n     to protect that legacy, so be it,'' he said.\n       Reid is hardly alone in using his leadership post to \n     channel federal resources to the folks back home.\n       Lott, for example, has joined the Bush administration in \n     opposing additional spending for homeland defense, the \n     military and New York City in a pending supplemental \n     appropriations bill. ``He's concerned about spending just \n     spiraling completely out of control,'' Lott told reporters \n     last week. ``And I share that concern.''\n       But even as Lott was making that comment, the Senate was \n     giving final approval to a spending bill that included $10 \n     million for the Stennis Space Center in Bay St. Louis, Miss.; \n     $50,000 for a street extension that will ``link cultural and \n     entertainment districts'' in Jackson, Miss.; $500,000 for \n     Lott's alma mater, the University of Mississippi; and more \n     than $1 million for water systems in Jackson and Picayune, \n     Miss.\n       In a similar vein, Rep. Jerry Lewis (R-Calif) used his \n     power as chairman of the Appropriations defense subcommittee \n     to steer a $10 million grant to the city of San Bernardino, \n     in his district, to clean up the underground water supply. \n     The bill would direct the Army to clean up radioactive waste \n     at a site in the district of Rep. John P. Murtha (Pa.), the \n     ranking Democrat on the panel.\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\n       Senate appropriators, meanwhile, used the $10.5 billion \n     military construction bill, signed by the president on Nov. \n     5, to speed up stalled environmental projects in their states \n     and districts. For example, the report attached to the \n     enacted bill gives the Pentagon 90 days to submit a master \n     plan for ``environmental remediation'' of Hunters Point Naval \n     Shipyard in San Francisco, home town of the chairman of the \n     military construction panel in the Senate, Dianne Feinstein \n     (D).\n       According to a Senate study, the nine states that will \n     receive the most earmarked military construction money are \n     represented by senior members of the defense or military \n     construction panels, or the two armed services committees.\n       To pay for earmarked projects while staying within a $10.5 \n     billion ceiling established by the appropriations committees, \n     House and Senate conferees adopted a 1.127 percent across-\n     the-board cut in regular military construction accounts.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am against what is going on here. In a \ntime of war, some have called it ``war profiteering.'' I think it is \nwrong. We are abrogating our responsibilities to the American people. I \nalso think it is time the administration step in and the President veto \nsome of these bills with these outrageous spending projects in them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2500\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the action on the Agriculture appropriations conference \nreport, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the conference \nreport to accompany H.R. 2500, the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill, and that it be considered under the following \nlimitations: 45 minutes for debate with time equally divided under and \ncontrolled as follows: 15 minutes each for Senator Hollings, Senator \nGregg, and Senator McCain, or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, without further intervening action or debate, \nthe Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that the order is that the vote \nbegin at 11:30; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote will begin when all time is yielded \nback.\n  Mr. REID. How much time is outstanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are approximately 4 minutes on each \nside.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2500, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2500), ``making appropriations for the Departments of \n     Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and \n     for other purposes,'' having met have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, signed by all of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nNovember 9, 2001 page H7986.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, \nthere are 45 minutes for debate of which Senator Hollings, Senator \nGregg, and Senator McCain have 15 minutes each.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I yield myself such time as is \nnecessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I am very pleased to present to the \nSenate today the FY 2002 State, Justice, Commerce, and related agencies \nconference report. The conference report before you combines the \nstrongest components from both the Senate and House bills which passed \na few months ago, and it addresses new priorities that have arisen \nsince September 11.\n  I could not have done this without the help of the ranking member, \nSenator Gregg. He and his staff have worked diligently with me and my \nstaff to produce a fair, well balanced, and bi-partisan bill. I also \nwant to thank Chairman Wolf and ranking member Serrano, as well as \ntheir staffs, for their commitment to a positive and constructive \nconference. The outcome of this conference is a bi-partisan and bi-\ncameral piece of legislation. In fact, the House passed this bill 411-\n15 yesterday. I now call on the Senate to pass this bill as well.\n  I have always said that the funds appropriated under this bill affect \nthe lives of all Americans in so many different ways. However, the \nimportance of this bill became even more apparent in the aftermath of \nthe September 11 attacks. The conference report before you today meets \nthe following three goals: One, it provides funding at the Federal, \nState, and local level to combat terrorism here at home.\n  In fact, that is exactly what we were debating with Senator Gregg's \ninitiative on counterterrorism at the time the Pentagon was struck that \nmorning.\n  Second, it provides funds to protect American citizens and employees \nof\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\nthe American Government, while overseas, and three, this bill continues \nthe numerous domestic programs that have had, and will continue to \nhave, a positive impact on the American way of life.\n  First, this bill continues to fund the counter-terrorism programs \nunder the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office of Domestic \nPreparedness (ODP). Most of these funds go directly to States in the \nform of formula grants for the purchase of equipment to respond to \nterrorist incidents at both the State and local level. The distribution \nof funds among State and local agencies are based on State plans that \neach State must submit to ODP prior to receiving grant funds. Funds \nprovided to the office of domestic preparedness are also used to \nprovide training to State and local law enforcement officials, as well \nas to provide real-time emergency exercises for first responders and \nFederal, State, and local executives.\n  The bill also provides a significant increase in funds over last year \nto ensure that agencies have the resources they need to prevent and \nfight terrorism. For example, the fiscal year 2002 bill includes a $280 \nmillion increase over last year for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations and a $700 million increase for Immigration and \nNaturalization Services.\n  Second, as in past years, the conferees have placed significant \nresources--$1.3 billion for worldwide security upgrades and $458 \nmillion for Embassy construction--into ensuring that our overseas \nfacilities are adequately protected. U.S. citizens and overseas \nemployees utilizing these facilities should be safeguarded against \npossible terrorist attacks--and the funding provided in this conference \nreport will help assure that they are.\n  Finally, the conferees have placed great emphasis on continuing \nfunding for domestic programs that have a positive impact on the \nAmerican way of life. It is imperative that the terrorist attack \nagainst this Nation does not force us to abandon the vital domestic \nprograms that have made us a great nation. This conference report \nensures that those vital programs are not neglected. It continues \nprograms that make our Nation's primary and secondary schools safer by \nproviding grants for the hiring of school resource officers. Funds are \nprovided to protect all Americans by increasing the number of police \nofficers walking the Nation's streets, providing additional funds to \nfight the growing problem of illegal drug use, guarding consumers from \nfraud, and shielding children from internet predators. In addition, \npeople throughout this country benefit from weather forecasting \nservices funded through this bill. These Americans include farmers \nreceiving information necessary to effectively manage their crops, and \nfamilies receiving lifesaving emergency bulletins regarding tornadoes, \nfloods, torrential rains, and hurricanes. This conference report \ncontinues to assist States in their efforts to manage overwhelming \neconomic growth in our coastal communities. It also provides funds to \npreserve our few remaining pristine estuarine areas. Funding is \nprovided to assist our small businesses, to gather economic statistical \ndata, to perfect our census process, to promote export of American \nproducts. All of these are vital programs that have contributed daily \nto the strength of this Nation.\n  In all, the CJS bill totals $39.3 billion in budget authority, which \nis $1.2 billion above the fiscal year 2001 amount. The Departments of \nState, Justice, and Commerce, as well as the Judiciary, all receive \nsignificant increases over prior year appropriations. I would like to \ntake a few minutes to go over some of the specific funding highlights \nfrom the SJC bill the conferees are presenting to the Senate:\n  Once again, the FBI's Preliminary Annual Uniform Crime Report \nreleased this past May demonstrates how well these programs are \nworking. According to the FBI's report, in 2000, serious crime has \ndecreased 7-percent from 1998, marking 9 consecutive years of decline. \nThis continues to be the longest running drop in crime on record. \nBipartisan efforts to fund DOJ's crime fighting initiatives have \nimpacted this reduction in crime during the past 10 years.\n  The conference report provides $3.5 billion for the FBI, which is \n$280 million above last year's funding level. To meet the critical need \nof sharing and storing information within the FBI, the bill provides \nthe FBI with $142 million for the FBI's Computer Modernization Program, \nTrilogy. In addition, the conference report provides significant \nfunding increases for vital programs such as $6.8 million to improve \nintercept capabilities; $7 million for counter-encryption resources; \n$12 million for forensic research; and $32 million for an annex of the \nengineering research facility, which develops and fields cutting edge \ntechnology in support of case agents.\n  The conference report provides $1.48 billion for DEA, $129 million \nabove last year's funding level. Increased funds are provided for \ntechnology and infrastructure improvements, including an additional $13 \nmillion for DEA's laboratory operations for forensic support.\n  To combat drugs that are reaching our streets and our children, the \nconference report provides $32.8 million to fight methamphetamine and \nencourages the DEA to increase its efforts in fighting heroin and \nemerging drugs such as oxycontin and ecstacy. The conference report \nalso directs the DEA to renew its efforts to work with Mexico in \ncombating drug trafficking and corruption under the country's new \nPresident Vicente Fox.\n  For the INS, the conference report includes $5.6 billion, $2 billion \nof which is derived from fees. This is an $800-million increase over \nlast year's funding level and provides the necessary resources to \naddress border enforcement and benefits processing.\n  For border enforcement, the bill provides $66 million for 570 \nadditional Border Patrol agents, and $25.4 million for 348 additional \nland border inspectors. To better equip and house these enforcement \nofficers, the conference report provides $2 million for Border \nvehicles, $22 million for Border equipment, such as search lights, \ngoggles and infrared scopes, $40 million to modernize inspection \ntechnology; and $128.4 million for Border patrol and detention facility \nconstruction and rehabilitation.\n  For INS' benefits processing efforts, the conference report provides \nan additional $45 million to specifically address the case backlog and \naccelerate processing times.\n  This conference report includes $3.24 billion for the Office of \nJustice Programs, which is $425 million above the amount requested by \nthe President. This bill provides for the funding of a number of \nimportant law enforcement programs.\n  The conference report provides $251.4 million to the Office of \nDomestic Preparedness for equipment and training of State and local law \nenforcement regarding counter terrorism activities. In addition, $2.4 \nbillion has been provided for State and local law enforcement \nassistance grants. Within this amount; $594.4 million is provided for \nthe Byrne State and Local Law Enforcement Program; $400 million is \nprovided for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant Program; $390.5 \nmillion is provided for Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, Programs, \nincluding programs to assist disabled female victims, programs to \nreduce violence against women on college campuses, and efforts to \naddress domestic and child abuse in rural areas; and $565 million is \nprovided for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program which \nreimburses States for the incarceration costs of criminal aliens.\n\n  Within the amount provided for the Office of Justice Programs, a \ntotal of $305.8 million has been included for Juvenile Justice \nPrograms. These funds will go toward programs aimed at reducing \ndelinquency among at-risk youth; assisting States in enforcing underage \ndrinking laws; and enhancing school safety by providing youth with \npositive role models through structured mentoring programs, training \nfor teachers and families so that they can recognize troubled youth, \nand training for students on conflict resolution and violence \nreduction.\n  The conference report includes $1.05 billion in new budget authority, \nfor the COPS Office which is $195.3 million above the President's \nrequest. As in prior years, the Senate has provided up to $180 million \nfor the Cops-In-Schools Program to fund up to 1,500 additional school \nresources officers in fiscal year 2002, which will make a total of \n6,100 school resource officers funded since Senator Gregg and I created \nthis program in 1998.\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\n  The conference report reflects Congress' continued commitment to \nproviding grant funds for the hiring of local law enforcement officers \nthrough the Cops Universal Hiring Program. Although the President did \nnot seek funding for this program in fiscal year 2002, the committee \nhas provided $150 million to continue to hire officers, as well as to \nprovide much needed communications technology to the Nation's law \nenforcement community.\n  Within the Cops budget, the conference report provides increased \nfunding for programs authorized by the Crime Identification and \nTechnology Act, CITA. In fiscal year 2002, $197 million is provided for \nprograms that will improve the retention of, and access to, criminal \nrecords nationwide, improve the forensic capabilities of State and \nlocal forensic labs, and reduce the backlog of crime scene and \nconvicted offender DNA evidence.\n  And finally, the conference report has provided $70.4 million within \nCops to continue the Cops Methamphetamine Initiative. These funds will \nprovide for the clean-up of meth production sites which pose serious \nhealth risks to law enforcement and the surrounding public. Funds will \nalso be provided to State and local law enforcement to acquire training \nand equipment to safely and effectively dismantle existing meth labs.\n  A total of $5.51 billion is provided for the Department of Commerce \nin fiscal year 2002, this conference report focuses on the goals of \nimproving departmental infrastructure and promoting the advancement of \ntechnology. The Department of Commerce consists of 37,000 employees \nworking in agencies as diverse as the Economic Development \nAdministration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nand the Bureau of the Census. They are highly-trained experts who are \nresponsible for a huge array of critical programs. These employees help \nminority businesses and small manufacturers flourish, run trade \nmissions to open foreign markets to American goods, forecast \nhurricanes, estimate the Nation's gross domestic product, set standards \nand measurements recognized and used world-wide, fly satellites, manage \nthe Nation's fisheries, conduct censuses, and process patents. These \nmissions of the Department of Commerce are the glue that holds together \nthe U.S. economy, both domestically and abroad.\n  There is no doubt as to the importance of the missions under the \npurview of the Department of Commerce. There is, however, a crisis \nlooming in terms of the infrastructure available to the employees who \nwork there. The conference report we have before us begins to turn the \ntide on infrastructure needs. In all cases, the conference report funds \nthe President's request for capital upgrades. This includes new \ninformation technology systems at the Minority Business Development \nAgency, the Bureau of the Census, the Economic Development Agency, and \nthe Office of Economic and Statistical Analysis. The conference report \nincludes a $76 million increase for the next generation of polar-\norbiting satellites. It also includes a new radio spectrum measurement \nsystem at the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration. We also encourage the United States Patent and \nTrademark Office to reflect on its infrastructure needs and to report \nback on what we can do to help in the future.\n\n  The conference report provides $3.26 billion for NOAA. Funding is \nincluded to begin construction of 2 new research vessels and to \nrefurbish 5 others. In addition, funding is included for repairs at the \nBeaufort, Oxford and Kasitsna coastal laboratories. Sufficient funding \nis provided to begin construction on regional National Marine Fisheries \nService buildings in Hawaii and in Alaska. The bill provides funding to \nstart building visitor facilities at national marine sanctuaries.\n  The funding provided in this conference report for these purposes is \na down-payment on the future of a robust Department of Commerce. I \nbelieve that the people at the department are its greatest asset and \nthat these targeted funds will allow these professionals to better do \ntheir jobs for decades to come.\n  In terms of advancing technology, in addition to the satellite \nprograms, research vessels, radio spectrum management systems and other \nprograms that I mentioned earlier, the bill provides $674.5 million for \nthe National Institute for Standards and Technology, NIST. This amount \naggressively funds scientific and technical research and services that \nare carried out in the NIST laboratories in Gaithersburg and in \nBoulder. The bill provides the current year funding level of $60.7 \nmillion for new ATP awards. The ATP is an industry-led, competitive, \nand cost-shared program to help the U.S. develop the next generation of \nbreakthrough technologies in advance of its foreign competitors. ATP \ncontracts encourage companies to undertake initial high-risk research \nthat promises significant widespread economic benefits. Over one-half \nof the ATP awards go to small companies.\n  In the aftermath of the bombings of Dar es Salaam and Nairobi, the \nDepartment of State focused more on the security of our overseas \ninfrastructure and peacekeeping missions than on the ``quality of \nlife'' needs of its employees. Secretary of State Colin Powell should \nbe commended for taking the approach that the morale of his employees \ndoes not have to be compromised in the name of safety. The conference \nreport before the Senate today takes a good first step in that same \ndirection. The conference report provides $7.36 billion in funding for \nthe Department of State, an increase of $761 million above last year's \nappropriated level of $6.6 billion. This funding level includes $95 \nmillion for the Secretary's ``new hire'' initiative which will provide \nfor an increase in 360 personnel, along with $12 million for training \nand recruitment, and $162 million in human resources enhancements. The \nconference report provides funding for recruitment, spousal employment, \nand civil service mobility. Funding also is provided for an additional \n186 security personnel and for the replacement of obsolete equipment \nand motor vehicles overseas.\n  The conference report before the Senate today also addresses a \nsignificant weakness in the State Department's information technology \ninfrastructure. The worldwide web has become essential to the conduct \nof foreign policy. Yet, at this moment, most of the State Department's \noverseas posts are dependent on obsolete computers and communications \nequipment to process information, and most posts lack secure internet \nbrowser access for their employees. Full funding is provided in this \nconference report to bring the internet to the desk top of all \nemployees by January 2003 and also to protect the Department's \nclassified global computer system from cyber-terrorism.\n  Finally, full funding in the amount of $1.3 billion is provided for \nworldwide security upgrades and $458 million for Embassy construction. \nAgain, under Secretary Powell's leadership in the selection of General \nWilliams to head the foreign buildings operations, millions of U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars have already been saved in the re-evaluation of \ncurrent construction projects. This prudent action should expedite the \nconstruction needs highlighted in the Crowe report and put us ahead of \nschedule in addressing the security needs of our vulnerable facilities.\n  Let me conclude by saying again this is a solid piece of legislation \nthat addresses issues that affect the daily lives of all Americans. It \nis a good bill that balances the needs on many diverse missions, and \nthe interests of members from both parties and both Houses. Every year, \nwe face difficulties with respect to limited funding and multiple, \nsometimes competing, priorities. This year was no different. And, as in \npast years, the CJS conferees made those decisions in a bipartisan, \nbicameral, and judicious manner. This could not have happened without \nthe assistance of Senator Gregg and the endless hours of work that both \nmy and his staff put into drafting the conference report before the \nSenate today. Specifically, I would like to thank my clerk, Lila Helms, \nalong with Jill Shapiro Long, Luke Nachbar, and Dereck Orr as well as \nSenator Gregg's minority clerk, Jim Morhard, along with Kevin Linsky, \nKatherine Hennessey, and Nancy Perkins.\n  This is a great conference report before the Senate and with the help \nof my colleagues, I look forward to swift passage at the end of this \ndebate.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair. I again thank my distinguished \nranking member.\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n  I yield the floor and retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, as I understand the regular order, the \nSenator from South Carolina has 15 minutes, I have 15 minutes, the \nSenator from Arizona has 15 minutes, and then we go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, does the Senator from New Hampshire seek \nrecognition?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I inquire of the managers if I may have 5 \nor 6 minutes to raise a point.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will be happy to yield you 6 minutes of my time after I \nhave finished.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Thank you.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I begin by congratulating the Senator \nfrom South Carolina for bringing this bill forward. He has done a \nsuperb job. This is a bill that has a lot of moving parts. It covers a \nbroad sector of the agencies of the Federal Government, some of the \nmost critical agencies, of course, being the Justice Department, the \nState Department, the Commerce Department, SEC, FTC, FCC, and SBA. The \nlist goes on and on, so it is a complex bill.\n  As is typical of the Senator from South Carolina, he has handled it \nwith great ability and acumen. As a result, we have before us what I \nthink is an extraordinarily strong bill, and a bill which aggressively \nfunds and promotes these agencies, and the primary roles of these \nagencies, as well as making a point of focusing on certain initiatives \nwhich are critical to better governance in this country, especially in \nlight of September 11.\n  A large percentage of the terrorism dollars that are domestically \noriented, and the initiatives that are domestically oriented, are tied \nup in this bill with over $1.1 billion of funding. The initiatives \nwhich are necessary in order to secure strong action on the part of the \nJustice Department and the State Department are also part of the policy \nin this bill.\n  So I congratulate the Senator from South Carolina for doing a superb \njob. But he could not have done it, and I could not have participated \nin this bill, without having exceptional staff. His staff, headed up by \nLila Helms, has done an exceptional job. His staff has been extremely \nsupportive of the efforts on our side of the aisle, and has worked with \nour staff, led by Jim Morhard, extraordinarily well. I specifically \nthank my staff people, including Jim Morhard and Kevin Linskey, \nKatherine Hennessy, and Nancy Perkins. They all work around the clock \nat this time of the year, and we very much appreciate it. We have \nproduced an exceptional bill because of those efforts.\n  The Senator from South Carolina has highlighted what amounts to the \nkey areas in the bill, but I do want to return to a couple items and \nmake a point to reinforce the commitment that this bill makes in those \nareas.\n  First is the area of terrorism, as I mentioned. This committee long \nbefore this bill was brought forward, has focused a great deal on the \nissue of how we try to get ourselves up to speed to deal with \nterrorism. Regrettably, obviously, we were not up to speed when \nSeptember 11 occurred. But in the past, this committee orchestrated the \nCentral Command Center for Crisis Management at the FBI. It has \norchestrated the legate services overseas in order to try to improve \nour intelligence capabilities.\n  It was as a result of this committee that we undertook two major \nexercises in the area of terrorism, the top-off program, which showed \nus that we had cracks, but it also showed us where we needed to go. A \nlot of what is happening in the post-September climate is as a result \nof information we were able to develop especially out of the Denver \nbioterrorism top-off exercise.\n  The bill specifically has in it the creation of a Deputy Attorney \nGeneral for Combating Terrorism, the concept being there are a lot of \ndifferent agencies, a lot of different moving parts just within the \nJustice Department that have responsibility for terrorism--the INS, \nobviously; the DEA; most importantly, the FBI; and the Justice \nDepartment itself. There needed to be a central focus where there was \none person thinking solely about the issue of how Justice specifically \nmanages the question of terrorism.\n  There were some questions as to how this individual would relate to \nthe Attorney General, and specifically to Governor Ridge in his role. \nMy view is that he complements Governor Ridge in that he or she will \ngive Governor Ridge a single point of contact where he can get action \nwithin the Justice Department and cut through red tape and turf. And, \nhopefully, as a result, this person will increase the capabilities of \nGovernor Ridge as we try to manage the Federal response to terrorism. \nSo I think it is an initiative which makes sense, and I understand that \nit has been worked out.\n  Secondly, I congratulate the chairman and his staff and the \nparticipation of our staff in the area of NOAA. This is an agency which \nis really one of the premier science agencies in our country; of \ncourse, specifically, science related to the atmosphere and ocean.\n  The maintenance of a series of vibrant NOAA programs is extremely \nimportant if we, as a country, are going to have the science we need in \norder to protect, preserve, and improve those resources, the ocean and \nour air, and manage issues such as hurricanes and tornadoes, and other \npotential God-driven catastrophes, and be ready for those events so \nthat we can handle them more effectively as a Government.\n  In addition, as the Senator mentioned, we have made a huge commitment \nin the area of technology. This is a very important function for us, \nnot only in the Justice Department but equally important in the State \nDepartment, where they really have been lagging in their technological \ncapability. We think progress is being made in this area, rather \ndramatic progress, as well as, of course, as was mentioned, the attempt \nto upgrade our facilities overseas, and especially harden them in light \nof the terrorist threat which they confront.\n  One area that was left out of this bill, which was not left out \nbecause of any actions by the chairman--it was left out because of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee--was the issue of conflict diamonds. \nWhen this bill passed the Senate, it had language in it which would \nlimit the use of conflict diamonds. Conflict diamonds are those \ndiamonds being produced primarily in Sierra Leone. They are diamonds \nwhich have blood on them. They are diamonds which are being used to \nfund not only the terrorist elements in Sierra Leone, known as the RUF, \nbut it appears now there is a connection between those diamonds and al-\nQaeda and the organizations of Osama bin Laden. These diamonds, where \npeople are basically held in slavery in order to produce them, and \nchildren are used, child labor is used, and people are tortured in \norder to produce these diamonds, should not be on the open market in \nfree countries.\n  Therefore, we put in language which would attempt to set up a system \nthat would track diamonds. Diamonds are an important part of our \nculture, especially when we get around the holidays. There are a lot of \nfolks who express their love and concern for individuals by using \ndiamonds, but we want Americans to know when they buy diamonds they are \nnot funding terrorist organizations such as al-Qaeda or the RUF.\n\n  Regrettably, that language--which I think is very important, and \nwhich I know the chairman on the House side, Congressman Wolf, strongly \nsupported because he was one of the authors of this language on the \nHouse side--was forced out of the bill on a procedural issue raised by \nthe House Ways and Means Committee. It is my understanding the Ways and \nMeans Committee is going to have hearings on this issue. I hope they \nhave them soon. I hope we do not leave this session of Congress without \nhaving passed effective conflict diamond language.\n  Again, in conclusion, I thank Chairman Hollings. I thank his staff, \nled by Lila Helms, and I thank my staff, led by Jim Morhard. I thank \nthem all for the excellent job in producing what I think is an \nexceptional piece of legislation, which more than adequately \naggressively funds our efforts to try to address the issue of \nterrorism, but it also strongly funds the agencies which are under our \njurisdiction, especially agencies such as NOAA.\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\n  Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I thank my colleague for \nthe 5 minutes.\n  I simply want to use this time to raise a point that I think should \nconcern all of us in the Senate in terms of procedures. I understand \nthat the Parliamentarian would rule against me and so, therefore, I \nwill not offer it. I cannot because of the unanimous consent agreement, \nbut I raise this point--and I hope the Parliamentarian will pay \nattention--because I believe this is a serious matter.\n  There was language in both the House and Senate bills that dealt with \ntaxpayer dollars not being used to interfere in any pending lawsuits \nwith some of the survivors of the Bataan Death March.\n  It was a controversial issue, but both the House and the Senate \nagreed verbatim with the language. Not one word, no date, no comma, no \nletter, nothing, nothing misspelled, no changes in spelling; it was \nverbatim. The language was exactly the same.\n  Under rule 28.2, it states:\n\n       Conferees shall not insert in their report matter not \n     committed to them by either House, nor shall they strike from \n     the bill matter agreed to by both Houses. If new matter is \n     inserted in the report or if matter which was agreed to by \n     both Houses is stricken from the bill, a point of order may \n     be made against the report, and if the point of order is \n     sustained, the report is rejected or shall be recommitted to \n     the committee of conference if the House of Representatives \n     has not already acted thereon.\n\n  This is very complicated and it is parliamentary language. It is \ndifficult to understand. In essence, what has happened here is the \nHouse and the Senate, as prescribed by rule 28.2, had identical \nlanguage. And because under the rules you substituted the Senate bill \nfor the House bill, you have now used that as a technicality to rule \nagainst me and to rule against this provision.\n  What happens is, the House and the Senate agree on something. You go \ninto conference. Nobody disagrees. But it comes out. Mysteriously, it \nis taken out by somebody in the conference committee, of which the rest \nof us are not privy. It violates the rules. And if it does not violate \nthe rule, it violates the spirit and intent of it, clearly.\n  This is very troubling. It is not just this issue. It could be any \nissue down the road where somebody has worked hard on both sides, the \nHouse and Senate, to put in the language. Then it is taken out in \nconference in violation directly of rule 28.2. It clearly violates it.\n  When you say you can substitute a Senate bill for the House bill to \nget around that, that means any provision to which we agree can be \nheld, if you want to apply that standard. That is simply wrong.\n  I would just say to the Parliamentarians that we ought to clarify \nthis. If this is what we are going to do, then throw out rule 28.2 and \nsay it is irrelevant. You are throwing it out because you are using \nthis substitute which is a gimmick to take out language that somebody \njust decided they didn't like.\n  Again, the language is the language. You have a bunch of POWs now who \nare going to get screwed by this, to put it bluntly. That is not the \nissue as much as it is who is next and how many times does this have to \nhappen before we correct it and do the right thing.\n  I am not picking on this particular bill or the two managers here. \nThe point is, it happens to be something I was involved in and I know \nabout it.\n  If I had had the chance, I would have made the Parliamentarian rule. \nBut I didn't get down here in time before the unanimous consent. I \nthink you should rule and we can prove that it is an incorrect ruling.\n  You have to decide. I hope we will take 28.2 out, if that is what we \nare going to do. My preference is that it would stay in and you would \nstop the interpretation, because if you can substitute a Senate \nsubstitute for the House, how then can you have a conference? What is \nthe purpose of a conference if you can say, I am going to substitute \nthe Senate version for the House version, take the House version and \nthrow it out the window? That is where it goes, right out. There is no \nconference. You have now substituted bill A for bill B, and there is no \nconference. And anything that you have in here, whatever you have in \nthis book, in your report, is no good. The language is irrelevant \nbecause you have now said you can substitute one bill for another.\n  It is wrong. It is absolutely wrong. It is what makes the American \npeople sick of what we do here, that they see stuff passed. They see it \nin both Houses. They see it go into conference, identical language. At \nleast you could have changed the date and made it legal. Instead, you \ntook verbatim language and threw it out. It is wrong. And I want to \nmake that point. I am very sorry it happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, generally speaking, is correct. We tortured over this. \nBottom line, the White House opposed it. So question: Do we pass a bill \nthat is going to be approved or do we pass a bill that is going to be \ndisapproved?\n  On page 171 of the report language:\n\n       The conference agreement does not include language proposed \n     in both the House and Senate bills regarding civil actions \n     against Japanese corporations for compensation in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that, as an American prisoner of war during \n     World War II, he or she was used as slave or forced labor. \n     The conferees understand that the Administration strongly \n     opposes this language, and is concerned that the inclusion of \n     such language in the act would be detrimental to the ongoing \n     effort to enlist multilateral support for the campaign \n     against terrorism. The conferees strongly agree that the \n     extraordinary suffering and injury of our former prisoners of \n     war deserve further recognition, and acknowledge the need for \n     such additional consideration.\n\n  In fairness to the position of the White House, we did have in 1951 \nthe treaty of San Francisco settling the claims of prisoners of war \nagainst the Japanese Government. Maybe it wasn't adequate. For 50 years \nwe have adhered to that treaty, and now with the terrorism attacks in \nthe United States out with an affirmative action plan to win friends \nand influence people, to form a coalition, now is no time for us to \ntake treaties and start abrogating them 50 years past or 1 year hence.\n  The truth is, the U.S. Senate ratified that treaty. On this \nparticular vote, the Senate bill was--the Senate bill--in the nature of \nan amendment to the House bill. The entire bill was in the nature of an \namendment. That is how technically, under the rule cited by my \ndistinguished colleague from New Hampshire, it can be found as \nparliamentarily sound. That is what we had to do in order to get the \nbill approved. I am sorry these occasions arise. It was a measured \njudgment.\n  We agree with our distinguished colleague from New Hampshire, but \nthat is the best we could do under the circumstances.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Will the Senator yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I say to the Senator from South Carolina, \nyou are correct. I am not challenging the technical aspect. I think it \nis a violation of the spirit of the rule. My point is, I know how you \nfeel about it. We had the debate on the floor. I respect your view. I \nknow you respect mine. The House, by 393 to 33, disagreed with you. And \nthe Senate, by a vote of 58 to 34, disagreed with you. I thought we had \nseparate but equal branches of Government. If the White House wants to \nveto the bill over that, then veto the bill over it. We will bring it \nback here and talk about it. I don't think it is right to violate the \nspirit and intent of the rules.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It was just like President Lincoln, during the Civil \nWar, when he put a vote to his Cabinet and all the Cabinet voted aye \nand President Lincoln voted no. And he said: The ``no'' vote prevails. \nThat is what prevailed here.\n  I yield the remainder of our time under the agreement.\n\n\n               national domestic preparedness consortium\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank Chairman Hollings and \nSenator Gregg for their leadership and efforts on the Commerce, \nJustice, State appropriations bill for fiscal year 2002.\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\nThis bill contains funding for many of the important law enforcement \nactivities and counterterrorism training that is vital in the wake of \nthe September 11 attacks.\n  I want to comment on one aspect of this bill and that is the funding \nfor the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium. The consortium has \nbeen fulfilling the important role of training the Nation's first \nresponders and training cities and communities on how to assess their \nown vulnerabilities to an attack for over 3 years. I believe the bill \nfunds the consortium at a level of $13.969 million, divided evenly. \nThis is a significant reduction in funding from last year, and it is my \nunderstanding that additional funding is expected to be provided in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill.\n  The components of the consortium each have an important role to play, \nhowever, the National Emergency Response and Rescue Training Center, \nNERRTC, at Texas A has been the leader in the number of first \nresponders trained. It would be my hope and willingness to assure \nincreased funding for the NERRTC and the consortium as a whole.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I will be happy to review the need for increased \nresources for the consortium and consider further funding in the \nsupplemental bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I agree that additional funding for the consortium should \nbe considered in the supplemental bill to support our antiterrorism \nefforts.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank Chairman Hollings and Senator Gregg for their \nconsideration.\n\n\n               detention facility on choctaw reservation\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nclarify language included in the Commerce, Justice, State, \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002. My distinguished colleague, \nthe chairman of the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Hollings, \nworked with me to ensure that a very important project for the \nMississippi Band of Choctaw Indians was included in the Senate version \nof the bill and the subsequent conference report.\n  The Senate-passed version contained $16,300,000 for the construction \nof an adult and juvenile detention facility on the Choctaw Reservation. \nThe tribe has encountered many obstacles as it has sought to satisfy \nboth the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Justice Department through \ncompliance with their varying jurisdictions, regulations, and varied \ninterpretations of law enforcement for Indian tribes over the past \ndecade. These delays have resulted in a deterioration of law \nenforcement, and an escalation in the costs of the facility. Further \ndelays will only exacerbate these problems.\n  The Choctaw Tribe is firm in its view that detention is essential to \nthe maintenance of law and order of the reservation. The detention \nfacility the tribe currently utilizes was built by the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs in 1973 as a temporary holding facility designed to hold 18 \nprisoners for up to 72 hours. Today, an average of 33.4 offenders are \nbeing held daily. Because of the lack of space, only the most serious \nand repeat offenders are incarcerated and the tribal court has been \nforced to rely on ``deferred sentencing'' for less serious offenses. \nThis has created a large backlog of convicted inmates waiting to be \nplaced in jail. The current facility is simply inadequate to meet \nexisting needs and the projected law enforcement needs of the tribe and \nits growing population.\n  The tribe is in need of a new facility and the gentleman from South \nCarolina recognized this requirement and included funding for the \nconstruction of the Choctaw jail in the Senate bill. I thank the \nconference committee for its inclusion of language directing the \nDepartment of Justice to fund the Choctaw detention facility. I would \nlike to clarify, however, that it was the intention of the Senate to \nprovide $16,300,000 for the construction of the Choctaw jail facility.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Indeed, my colleague from Mississippi is correct. The \nSenate did include funding in the amount of $16,300,000 for the Choctaw \nIndians to construct their jail facility. It was the intention of the \nSenate that the tribe receive this needed funding for this project as \nnoted in the conference agreement.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I thank the Senator for clarifying this \nissue and for his support of this project.\n\n\n                          slave labor in japan\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment \nwith the conference committee on the FY 2002 Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill for eliminating the provision that would allow \nWorld War II POWs, who served as slave laborers in Japan, to have their \nday in court.\n  The amendment, sponsored by Senator Smith of New Hampshire and \nmyself, would have prohibited the U.S. State Department and the \nDepartment of Justice from blocking attempts by American veterans to \nobtain compensation in court from Japanese companies who used the POWs \nfor slave labor during WWII.\n  Some 30,000 Americans were taken prisoner in the Philippines in the \nmonths following Pearl Harbor and forced to perform as slave laborers \nfor Japanese companies. For more than 3 years, our POWs endured \nhorrific conditions and received little or no compensation. It is wrong \nand unfair that the U.S. Government is using taxpayer dollars to fight \nagainst these men and women who served and suffered for us during WWII, \nand deny them the compensation they deserve.\n  Some 60 families and POW survivors in Iowa are affected.\n  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire if it was appropriate for the \ncommittee to cut out this provision, considering both the House and \nSenate voted to include it in the bill?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this decision clearly \ndisregards the wishes of the House and Senate. I taught history and \ncivics when I was a teacher. I always taught my students that \nconference committees were intended to resolve differences between the \nHouse and Senate versions. There is not difference in this case.\n  Let me read from the report:\n\n       The conference agreement does not include language proposed \n     in both the House and Senate bills regarding civil actions \n     against Japanese corporations for compensation in which the \n     plaintiff alleges that, as an American prisoner of war during \n     World War II, he or she was used as slave or forced labor.\n\n  There was no difference between the two versions, just a decision by \na small group of conferees to impose their own will on both Houses of \nCongress. This is not the way things should work.\n  The House passed this amendment in July with a 393-33 vote. The \nSenate later passed the exact same provision with a 58-34 vote.\n  Congress should not turn its back on the 700 prisoners of war and \ntheir families who are seeking long-delayed justice. They have gone to \ncourt to demand compensation from the Japanese companies that used from \nfor slave labor. Throughout the war, these Americans worked in mines, \nfactories, shipyards, and steel mills. They labored every day for as \nlong as 10 hours a day in dangerous working conditions. They were \nbeaten on a regular basis. They were given no compensation by these \ncompanies.\n  Now they deserve their day in court without interference by the U.S. \nState Department or the Department of Justice. That's what our \namendment had set out to do--allow our POWs to seek the long-delayed \njustice and compensation they deserve.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the record the \nBudget Committee's official scoring of the conference report to H.R. \n2500, the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2002.\n  The conference report provides $38.656 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority, of which $567 million is for defense and $438 million \nis for conservation activities. That budget authority will result in \nnew outlays in 2002 of $26.126 billion. When outlays from prior-year \nbudget authority are taken into account, discretionary outlays for the \nreport total $38.847 billion in 2002. By comparison, the Senate-passed \nversion of the bill provided $38.641 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, which would have resulted in $38.744 billion in total \noutlays. The conference report does not include any emergency \ndesignations.\n  Because the conference report exceeds the outlay allocation provided \nto the subcommittee for conservation activities, the report is in \nviolation of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying the budget \ncommittee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n THE CONFERENCE REPORT TO H.R. 2500, THE DEPARTMENTS OF COMMERCE, JUSTICE, AND STATE, THE JUDICIARY, AND RELATED\n                   AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                          General\n                                                          purpose     Defense   Conservation  Mandatory   Total\n------------------------------------------------------------\\2\\---------\\2\\-------------------------------------\nConference report:\n  Budget Authority....................................     37,651         567          438         572    39,228\n  Outlays.............................................     37,853         631          363         581    39,428\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority....................................     37,651         567          439         572    39,229\n  Outlays.............................................     38,653           0          203         581    39,437\nPresident's request\n  Budget Authority....................................     37,178         465          284         572    38,499\n  Outlays.............................................     38,016         538          259         581    39,394\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority....................................     37,534         567          440         572    39,113\n  Outlays.............................................     37,913         632          360         581    39,486\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority....................................     37,782         604          255         572    39,213\n  Outlays.............................................     37,880         660          204         581    39,325\n \n           SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\1\\\n  Budget Authority....................................          0           0           -1           0        -1\n  Outlays.............................................       -169           0          160           0        -9\nPresident's request:\n  Budget Authority....................................        473         102          154           0       729\n  Outlays.............................................       -163          93          104           0        34\nHouse-passed:\n  Budget Authority....................................        117           0           -2           0       115\n  Outlays.............................................        -60          -1            3           0       -58\nSenate-passed:\n  Budget Authority....................................       -131         -37          183           0        15\n  Outlays.............................................        -27         -29          159           0       103\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For enforcement purposes, the budget committee compares the conference report to the Senate 302(b)\n  allocation.\n\\2\\ The 2002 budget resolution includes a contingent ``firewall'' in the Senate between defense and nondefense\n  spending. Because the contingent firewall is for budget authority only, the Senate appropriations committee\n  did not provide a separate allocation for defense outlays. This table combines defense and nondefense outlays\n  together as ``general purpose'' for purposes of comparing the conference report outlays with the Senate\n  subcommittee's allocation.\n \nNotes.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the conferees of this bill for \ntheir hard work. This legislation provides funding for fighting crime, \nenhancing drug enforcement, and responding to threats of terrorism. It \nfurther addresses the shortcomings of the immigration process funds the \noperation of the judicial process, facilitates commerce throughout the \nUnited States, and supports the needs of the State Department and other \nagencies.\n  This conference report spends at a level 4.9 percent higher than the \nlevel enacted in fiscal year 2001. In real dollars, this is $828 \nmillion in additional spending above the amount requested by the \nPresident, and a $1.9 billion increase in spending from last year.\n  Once again, however, I find myself in the unpleasant position of \nspeaking before my colleagues about parochial projects in yet another \nconference report. I have identified $1.8 billion in earmarks, which is \ngreater than the cost of the earmarks in the conference report passed \nlast year, which totaled $1.5 billion. so far this year, total \nporkbarrel spending has already hit a staggering $9.6 billion.\n  There are hundreds of millions of dollars in porkbarrel spending \nthroughout this bill. The avalanche of unrequested earmarks buried in \nthis measure will undoubtedly further burden the American taxpayers. \nWhile the amounts associated with each individual earmark may not seem \nextravagant, taken together, they represent a serious diversion of \ntaxpayers' hard-earned dollars at the expense of numerous programs that \nhave undergone the appropriate merit-based selection process.\n  Let me read a quote from Allen Schick, a congressional expert at the \nBrookings Institution:\n\n       Pork thrives in good times and bad. The problem is not the \n     individual project, but the cumulative effect. . . . When you \n     add up the total, it just blows your mind.\n\n  Now I want to turn to some examples of earmarks in this bill:\n  There is $250,000 for the Central California Ozone Study; $500,000 \nfor the International Pacific Research Center at the University of \nHawaii; $1 million for the National Coral Reef Institute in \nHawaii; $3.7 million for the Conservation Institute of the Bronx Zoo; \n$750,000 for the Alaska Fisheries Development Foundation; $3.35 million \nfor the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College; \nand $6 million for the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth \nUniversity for the nanocystalline materials and biomass research \ninitiative.\n\n  There are many more projects on the list that I have compiled, which \nwill be available on my Senate Web site.\n  Once, again, I must remind my colleagues that the administration has \nurged us to maintain our fiscal discipline to ensure that we will \ncontinue to have adequate funds to prosecute our war against terrorism, \nto aid those in need, and to cover other related costs. We should let \nthe people who run the programs we fund decide how best to spend the \nappropriated funds. After all, they know what their most pressing needs \nare.\n  I am also greatly concerned by the Appropriations Committee's \ndecision to fund the controversial Advanced Technology Program at \n$184.5 million. In his budget request, the President recommended that \nCongress suspend new funding for ATP, pending a reevaluation of the \nprogram. The Secretary of Commerce has not released the results of that \nreview nor any recommended changes to the program to the Commerce \nCommittee. I urge my colleagues to await the results of the Secretary's \nreview, before we consider funding this program. As we all know, the \ncountry is currently involved in both war and economic downturn, and \nthis $184.5 million should be spent on higher priorities than a welfare \nprogram for special corporate interests.\n  Furthermore, I am equally concerned that of the $62.4 million in the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology's Construction account, \n$41.5 million is for non-construction related ``pork'' projects. \nEarlier this year, I wrote to the Secretary of Commerce expressing my \nconcerns about the physical conditions of the NIST laboratories, home \nof two recent Nobel Prize winners. I am amazed to see that we are more \nconcerned about ``pork'' than supporting world-class research \nfacilities.\n  Several items provided under funding for the State Department stand \nout for their questionable role in advancing American foreign policy \ninterests. The report language directs the Department to make available \n$500,000 to the Northern Forum, which works to ``improve international \ncommunication, cooperation, and opportunities for economic growth in \nnorthern regions of countries'' around the world. I am from the \nSouthwest, so perhaps I am geographically biased, but I have trouble \nunderstanding how this earmark serves the national interest.\n  There is also a $200,000 earmark for a conference in human \ntrafficking at the University of Hawaii in this bill. I am pleased the \nconference report does not include language earmarking $9 million for \nthe East-West Center, as proposed in the Senate bill, although it does \ncontain a plus-up for the center of $500,000, and it does not include \nSenate language earmarking $5 million to the State of Hawaii for \nhosting an Asian Development Bank meeting.\n\n  Five new educational exchange earmarks found their way into this \nconference report, although the report language refers only to \n``$500,000 for one-time seed funding for five new exchange activities \nlisted in the Senate chart.'' Since the conference report neglects to \nlist them, I will: they are the Jointer Fellowships in War, the Padnos \nInternational Center, the UNI-Cedar Falls Russo-American Exchange, the \nUNLV Global Business Exchange, and the UNR International Business \nExchange. In addition, the conferees have generously provided $400,000 \nfor ``exchanges to build linkages between American and foreign \nmusicians and musical institutions.''\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to curb our habit of directing hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars to locality-specific special interests.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I rise to congratulate and commend Chairman Hollings and \nSenator Gregg and their staff for their tireless work in crafting the \nConference Report on the Fiscal Year 2002 Appropriations Bill for the \nDepartments of Commerce, Justice, and State and the Judiciary. Because \nof their efforts, we have before us today a fair bill that puts aside \npartisan politics in favor of delivering to the American people the \ngovernmental programs and support they need. I know from personal \nexperience how difficult it can be to strike balances among competing \ninterests, and the introduction of the tragic events of September 11, \n2001, have only compounded these difficulties.\n  The efforts of my friends, Chairman Hollings and Senator Gregg, were \nsupported by the work of their extraordinary staff. Under the \nleadership of\n\n[[Page S11885]]\n\nMs. Lila Helms on the majority side, and Mr. Jim Morhard on the \nminority, this dedicated crew stayed late and came in on weekends to \nhelp my distinguished colleagues put together a conference report that \nevery one of us can vote for with pride.\n  Accordingly, I also wish to extend my congratulations to each member \nof Chairman Hollings' staff, Ms. Lila Helms, Ms. Jill Shapiro Long, Mr. \nLuke Nachbar, and Mr. Dereck Orr, and to each member of Mr. Gregg's \nstaff, Mr. Jim Morhard, Ms. Katherine Hennessey, Mr. Kevin Linsky, and \nMs. Nancy Perkins.\n  Ladies, gentlemen, my esteemed colleagues, I salute you all.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to vote for the Commerce, \nJustice, State, and the Judiciary, CJS, conference report today. This \nlegislation is critical to our continuing efforts to fight terrorism \nand increase homeland security.\n  I am troubled, however, that the conference report appropriates only \n$14.4 million for the Police Corps Program, an amount which I believe \nis insufficient to adequately fund this critically important program. I \nstrongly support the $30 million level of funding that was included in \nthe Senate version of the CJS appropriations bill. The CJS conference \nreport before us today slashes the budget of the Police Corps program \nin half. It is more important now than ever before that we work to \nensure that Americans feel safe within their communities and that our \nNation's police forces have strong federal support.\n  The Police Corps Program helps police and sheriffs' departments to \nincrease the number of officers with advanced education and training. \nIt provides Federal scholarships to highly motivated students who agree \nto serve as police officers or sheriffs' deputies for at least 4 years. \nParticipants in the program are assigned to areas of the country that \nare in the most desperate need for additional officers. All of the \nparticipants serve on community patrol.\n  The benefits of this program can be seen in many ways. By encouraging \neducated young men and women to enter into the police force, Police \nCorps improves the quality of law enforcement in towns and States \nthroughout the country. Police Corps reduces the local costs of hiring \nand training new officers by providing Federal funding law enforcement \ntraining. In addition, the Federal Government pays police departments \nthat hire participants $10,000 a year per participant for the first 4 \nyears of service.\n  Police Corps also offers a scholarship program for children of \nofficers killed in the line of duty. Eligible children can receive up \nto $30,000 to cover educational expenses. There is no service or \nrepayment obligation and the application process is non-competitive. I \ncan think of no time in our recent history more appropriate than now, \nin the wake of the terrible loss of police officers on September 11, to \nensure that this program is adequately funded.\n  Every police department in the country is being called upon to \nincrease their vigilance, to expand their duties, and to do more to \nrespond to the threat of terrorism. Increased funding for the Police \nCorps Program would improve the quality and capabilities of police \ndepartments throughout the country by educating and training qualified, \nmotivated young people. The whole country stands to benefit from this \nprogram. I deeply regret that the CJS conference report does not \ncontain, at a minimum, level funding for the Police Corps Program and \nam saddened that the program has been so drastically cut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I would like to draw attention to what I \nbelieve is an unconstitutional amendment that was recently added to the \nfinal conference report of the FY02 Commerce, Justice, State and the \nJudiciary Appropriations Act. This amendment, which was first offered \nby Senator Craig on September 10 in the Senate version of the bill, \nwould prohibit any U.S. funds from being used ``for cooperation with, \nor assistance or other support to, the International Criminal Court or \nthe Preparatory Commission.''\n  The Craig amendment, which was opposed by the administration, seeks \nto prevent our government from having a role in shaping the definition \nof the crime of aggression and other key issues pertaining to the \nInternational Criminal Court, ICC. It is my belief that this attempt to \ncurtail the power of the President to negotiate treaties is \nunconstitutional and I urge the administration to remain engaged in a \nprocess vital to our country's national security.\n  In addition to highlighting the constitutional concerns raised by \nthis amendment, I would also like this opportunity to raise a broader \nconcern. The legislative maneuvering that led to the adoption of this \namendment follows European Union and German requests that our \ngovernment refrain from adopting anti-ICC legislation. In late October \nthe Belgium Foreign Minister Louis Michel wrote on behalf of the \nEuropean Union to Senator Daschle and Secretary of State Colin Powell, \nexpressing the EU's strong support for the ICC. German Foreign Minister \nJoschka Fischer wrote to the Secretary of State directly on October 31, \nnoting that, ``In view of the international effort against terrorism . \n. . it is particularly important for the United States and the European \nUnion to act in accord in this field too.'' He continued, ``The future \nInternational Criminal Court will be a valuable instrument for \ncombating the most serious crimes. It will provide us with an \nopportunity to fight with judicial means crimes such as the mass murder \nperpetrated by terrorists in New York and Washington on 11 September \n2001.''\n  While Members of the Senate may have real questions and concerns \npertaining to the ICC, now is not the time to be pushing legislation \nthat undercuts the administration's efforts to work with our closest \nallies in building a strong coalition against terrorism. In addition, \nthe President's recent order allowing military tribunals to be created \nfor trials involving members of al Qaeda suggests that a long-term \nfight against terrorism will include a variety of legal structures \nranging from Lockerbie type tribunals to the International Criminal \nCourt. It is thus imperative that our government remains engaged in the \ndevelopment of the ICC. I strongly hope that the Bush administration \nwill do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is my understanding, Madam President, that the Senator \nfrom Arizona, who had the other 15 minutes, is willing to yield back \nhis time. I believe that is correct. So I yield back our time on this \nside, and I understand we are setting the vote for 12:45.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the time is yielded back.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that all time on the conference \nreport be yielded back and the Senate vote on adoption of the report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nfinal vote on the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a situation developing that I think deserves attention as we \ncontemplate the Thanksgiving recess and shortly thereafter, hopefully, \nthe break for the Christmas holidays.\n  Throughout the year, our new President has requested that Congress \ntake up and pass an energy bill. The question of our Nation's energy \nsecurity, the question of our continued dependence on imported oil from \noverseas, and the question of our vulnerability relative to terrorist \nactivities here at home bring to this body the reality of taking \npositive action to correct that situation.\n  The circumstances surrounding our vulnerability need some \nexamination. That examination should focus, first, on the lessons of \nhistory.\n  Many people in this body, and many young people in this country, do \nnot remember 1973. They do not remember the Arab oil embargo. They do \nnot remember the gas lines that were stretching around the block. They \ndo not remember the inconvenience that was associated with that \nreality.\n  What were the circumstances, then?\n  We were 37 percent dependent on imported oil. The public was \nindignant at that time. They blamed the government. They blamed \neverybody. How could this country allow itself to become that dependent \non external sources of oil?\n  Today, we are 57 percent dependent on imported oil. The Department of \nEnergy has indicated by the year 2010 we will be somewhere in the area \nof 66 percent dependent on imported oil.\n  What do we do about that?\n  There are two logical steps we can take. One is to use less oil by \nbeing more creative with technology, increasing efficiency; and the \nother is to produce more domestically.\n  Where does America's oil come from? Fifty-seven percent comes from \noverseas. The rest of it comes from Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, \nColorado, and my State of Alaska. However, it is important to note that \nAlaska has produced about 20 percent of the total crude oil produced in \nthis Nation for the last 27 years.\n  We had a great debate in this body in the early 1970s. That debate \nwas whether or not Congress should authorize the building of an 800-\nmile pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez to move the oil. There was a \ntie vote in the Senate. The Vice President, Spiro Agnew, broke the tie, \nand the pipeline was authorized. As a consequence, we have been \nproducing for many, many years up to 2 million barrels of oil a day. \nNow that pipeline is producing a little over 1 million barrels a day.\n  The important point to recognize, as we reflect on what we can do \nnow--and what we can do now is to open up that small sliver of the \nArctic known as the ANWR Coastal Plain--is what that will mean to this \nNation's dependence on increased imports from overseas. It will reduce \nthat dramatically.\n  We do not really know what is in ANWR because Congress has never \nauthorized the opening of this area. But the geologists estimate \nsomewhere between 5.7 and 16 billion barrels. That may not mean much in \nthe overall scope of things, but it is estimated that the current \nproven oil reserves of Texas are about 5.3 billion barrels. So this \ncould be very, very significant.\n  Let's compare it back to Prudhoe Bay because Prudhoe Bay is an actual \nexperience. We have been there for 27 years. The experts indicated that \nfield would produce about 10 billion barrels. Today, it is on its 13th \nbillion barrel. It is still producing a million barrels a day.\n  So when you talk about what might be in ANWR, whether it is 5.7 or 16 \nbillion, even if it is 10 billion, it is as big as Prudhoe Bay. It has \na very significant potential in reducing, if you will, our dependence \non imports.\n\n  What is involved here? I have stood in this chamber numerous times \nand have indicated that you have to get a feel for the magnitude of the \narea. The ANWR area is a million and a half acres in the sense of the \nclassification of 1002. I do not want to confuse Members, but what I am \nsaying is that only the 1002 area--or a million and a half acres--can \nbe authorized by Congress out of the 19 million acres that are in ANWR. \nNineteen million acres is the size of the State of South Carolina, a \npretty big piece of real estate. Out of that 19 million acres in ANWR, \nwe set aside 8\\1/2\\ million acres in a wilderness in perpetuity. We set \naside another 9 million acres in a conventional refuge, leaving this \nmillion and a half acres only for Congress to consider making available \nfor exploration.\n  The House passed an energy bill, H.R. 4. In that bill they authorized \nthat only 2,000 acres of the 1002 area could bear a footprint of \ndevelopment. That reminds me of the Hollywood movie star, Robert \nRedford, who is very much opposed\n\n[[Page S11887]]\n\nto opening this area. He has a 5,000-acre farm in Utah. I mention that \nto put things in perspective. A 2,000-acre footprint out of 19 million \nacres, that is what we are talking about.\n  I know America's environmental community is very much opposed to \nthis. This is an issue that is far away. The American people cannot see \nit. They cannot see the good record of Prudhoe Bay or the contribution \nof the 27 years of production from Prudhoe Bay. So it is an ideal issue \nfor America's environmental community. It is like a cash cow, if you \nwill pardon the expression. They have milked it for all it is worth, \nand they will continue to do so because it is warm and fuzzy. They \nthrow in a polar bear. They do not tell you that you cannot take a \npolar bear for trophy, cannot shoot a polar bear in Alaska because they \nare protected marine mammals. You can go to Russia or you can go to \nCanada if you want to shoot one. They talk about the porcupine caribou \nherd. They talk about the Gwich'in people. But they do not tell you \nthat the Gwich'ins in Canada are leasing their land for oil \nexploration. They are developing their corporation and their \nopportunity for jobs, a better lifestyle, a better education, and so \nforth. They do not tell you that we have had experience with the \ncentral Arctic herd of caribou in Prudhoe Bay that was 6,000 strong in \n1978 and that is now over 27,000 because you cannot shoot them, you \ncannot take them.\n  So every argument that the environmentalists use against opening ANWR \nis a bogus argument. These arguments are not based on sound science; \nthey are based on emotion.\n  What is this issue really all about? It is not about replacing \nimported oil, if you will, but it is about reducing our dependence on \nimported oil. If we made a commitment in this body to open up ANWR, one \nof two things would happen, or perhaps both. OPEC would, in my opinion, \nincrease production because they would know that the United States \nmeans business about reducing its dependence on imported oil. As a \nconsequence, you would see a stabilization in price.\n  What OPEC has done now is they have put together a self-disciplined \ncommitment of the countries that make up OPEC to have a floor and \nceiling. The ceiling is about $28 a barrel, and the floor is about $22 \na barrel.\n  If you do not believe that, just look at what OPEC did the other day. \nThey decreased production a million and a half barrels. What does that \ndo? It makes the price go up. We are caught in that leverage. Of \ncourse, right now, we have seen a tremendous reduction in oil demand \nbecause of the terrorist activities, lack of air traffic in this \ncountry, the reduction of people driving. But that isn't going to be \nthe case forever. We are going to go back and begin to use fuel at a \nhigher degree.\n  I am all for alternatives. I am all for renewables. I am all for wind \nand solar. But let's face it, America and the world moves on oil. We \nhave no other means of transportation currently available. Our \nairplanes, boats, and trains all move on oil. There is no relief in \nsight. We use heating oil to fuel our homes. So until we develop a new \ntechnology, America is going to have a continued dependence on oil.\n  We have an opportunity here, in the stimulus package, to address a \nreal stimulus. A real stimulus is opening up ANWR because here is what \nANWR would do: It would provide at least 250,000 direct jobs.\n  This isn't something the Federal Government has to underwrite or the \ntaxpayer has to basically contribute to. These are private sector jobs, \nskilled labor, welders, pipe fitters, Teamsters, you name it. These \nunions support this. They are in contrast to the environmentalists who \nare opposed to it. This is the biggest jobs issue in the stimulus \npackage.\n  What else is there in this proposal? There is an opportunity for the \nFederal Government to garner about $3.3 billion in bonus bids as a \nresult of this 1002 area being put up for lease. That is a lot of \nmoney. That can offset some of the responsibilities we have to address \nin response to terrorism, the cost of the war, security. There are lots \nand lots of things that we can use this revenue for.\n  If you look at the jobs, if you look at the revenue and recognize \nthat none of this is going to cost the taxpayer one red cent, we should \nconsider the real merits of a stimulus package that contains a \nprovision to provide the authority to open up this area.\n  We have brought this to the floor time and time again. We have \nproposed opportunities for committee action. As the ranking member on \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I can only express my \ndisappointment in the process. The Democratic leader has taken away \nfrom the authorizing committee, the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and the chairman, the ability to address the formation of an \nenergy bill in the committee. For some reason there is a terrible fear \nto have a vote on this issue in committee or, for that matter, on the \nfloor.\n  I know there are several Members from time to time who have ideas of \nPresidential aspirations. This body and the American people have a \nright to have an energy bill debated on the floor of the Senate and \nvoted upon. The President has asked for it continually. He deems it as \na stimulus. We don't seem to be able to move.\n  What happened is--as a member of the Energy Committee, I am obviously \npretty close to it--I thought we could proceed, have a markup in the \ncommittee, vote it out of committee, and take it to the floor. The \nDemocratic leader intervened, took the authority away from the chairman \nof the committee. We have been waiting for the majority leader to come \nup with an energy bill and present it to us. He has not done it. We \nknow it will not include ANWR. There is absolutely no question about \nthat.\n  Yet, here we are with a situation that is ongoing. Time runs and \nnothing is done. We face a crisis associated with our vulnerability and \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  Let me add a couple more points that bear some reflection. Currently \nwe are importing almost 1 million barrels of oil a day from Iraq. How \ncan we justify on the one hand becoming more dependent on a source that \nwas our enemy just a few years ago when we fought the war in the \nPersian Gulf and on the other hand, importing oil from that country and \nenforcing a no-fly zone over Iraq on a daily basis? We are putting the \nlives of our men and women at risk in enforcing that. We occasionally \ntake out targets in Iraq. I have said it before and I will say it \nagain: We take their oil, put it in our airplanes, and enforce a no-fly \nzone. They take our money, develop missile capability, a biological \ncapability, and aim it at our ally Israel. We don't know what they are \ndoing because we don't have inspectors over there anymore. It is a \ngrossly inconsistent policy.\n  We have differences of opinion, of course. I respect my colleagues \nwith regard to issues such as this. I find it ironic that the \nspokespersons who stand before this body communicating directly their \nfeelings on the issue have never been up there. They have never taken \nthe time. Each year Senator Stevens and I offer trips to ANWR. They \ndon't come. Yet they are experts.\n\n  Members have opinions on this, but they don't go up and see for \nthemselves. They don't evaluate. They don't talk to the people who live \nthere. My Native and Eskimo people have rights, too. There are 95,000 \nacres of private land that they own in the 1002 area, the 1.5 million \nacres in question. The Native and Eskimo people have no access. They \ncan't even drill for gas to heat their homes. Is that democracy? Is \nthat fair and equitable? Should they not have the same rights as any \nother American who owns private land? This is a terrible travesty on \nthe people of my State. It is unjustified.\n  We are a big piece of real estate with a small population. We have \nreal people. We have a village in the area. Some people say: This \npristine area, it is an extraordinary area. It is a huge area. To \nsuggest that a 2,000 acre footprint suddenly is going to have a \ndisastrous activity associated with it is absolutely inconsistent with \nreality.\n  We have a village there of 300 people. It has a little school, a \nhealth care facility, a little airport. These are real people. They \nhave real hopes, real aspirations. They are very disappointed that this \nbody fails to hear their cry and the Members who feel very strongly \nabout this are refusing to go up and talk to them, to recognize that \nthey are really there.\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n\n  I have said this before, as we look at terrorist activities, as we \nlook at vulnerability, let's look at the Mideast for a moment. Look at \nSaudi Arabia. Some individuals predict that Saudi Arabia is setting \nitself up for what happened a few decades ago with Iran, the fall of \nthe Shah, America's ally.\n  Bin Laden's terrorist activities in the oilfields of Saudi Arabia \ncould wreak havoc. What you would see is the price of oil skyrocketing. \nA couple of tankers in the Straits of Hormuz taken out by terrorist \nactivities could accomplish the same effect.\n  These are the real risks associated with our increased dependence. If \nyou look at the terrorists who we can identify with the Trade Center \ndisaster, a lot of them had Saudi Arabia citizenship, including bin \nLaden. Where does the money come from? You and I are associated with \nthe business community. We know where it comes from. It comes from oil. \nThat is the wealth of the Mideast; it funds terrorism. Make no mistake \nabout it.\n  A good friend of mine, a Member of this body for many years, Mark \nHatfield, is a pacifist. He said: I would vote for ANWR any day than \nsend another man or woman of our Armed Forces to fight a war on foreign \nsoil, a war over oil.\n  This Senator has been a good soldier. I have been here 21 years. I \nhave lived with this issue for 21 years. I have asked for votes. We \npassed this bill in 1995 in both the House and the Senate. It was \nvetoed by President Clinton. It is not going to be vetoed by the White \nHouse this time around. The point is, we can't get the leadership to \nbring it up.\n  I am going to have to filibuster something around here. There are a \nfew things left to get some kind of a commitment from the Democratic \nleadership to get a vote on this issue in a timely manner. We have that \nright. All we want is a vote. We will take our lumps. But they don't \nwant to vote on it.\n  They don't want to vote on it, even to the point where they are \nfearful if I were to bring this up in committee and prevail, that \nsomehow it would pass and it would represent a position of strength.\n  Let me conclude by alerting Members that we are not going to let this \nissue go away. We are going to force a vote. If I have to force a \nfilibuster, I will. This time this issue is going to come up before \nthis body and be addressed once and for all.\n  I thank the Chair for the time. I thank my colleague for his \nindulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska, who has been here for 21 years. I can personally \nattest to that and take an affidavit to that fact because I came here \non the same day that he did. We have worked together over the years and \nwe have a curious relationship, in the sense that he is senior to me in \nthe Republican caucus because it was done alphabetically, and ``M'' \ncomes before ``S.'' I am senior to Senator Murkowski in the Senate \nbecause I come from a State that is somewhat larger population-wise but \nnot geographically. But it is always a pleasure to follow Senator \nMurkowski on the floor or any other time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11888-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11888-S11890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRYING TERRORISTS AS WAR CRIMINALS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on a \ncouple of subjects today. First is a subject that is very much in the \nforefront of the news, which is the proposal to try terrorists in \nmilitary tribunals as opposed to trials in U.S. courts of law.\n  The Attorney General of the United States is quoted in this morning's \npress as citing circumstances that the administration believes would \nrequire this change in procedure, and it is a matter that I believe \nought to be considered by the Congress, because under the Constitution \nthe Congress has the authority to establish military courts and \ntribunals dealing with international law.\n  I have written today to the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nsuggesting that prompt hearings be held on this subject. We are going \nto be returning after the Thanksgiving recess, and we will have a \nchance to look into this matter. Events are unfolding very rapidly now \nin the war in Afghanistan, with major advances being made by the \nNorthern Alliance, with U.S. commandos on the ground, moving in an \neffort to find Osama bin Laden. I have predicted consistently since \nSeptember 11 that we would find him and, as President Bush has said, we \nwould either bring bin Laden to justice, or we would bring justice to \nhim. So the issue of military courts is something that may be upon us \nsooner rather than later.\n  The Constitution provides that the Congress is empowered to define \nand punish violations of international law, as well as to establish \ncourts with exclusive jurisdiction over military offenses. Under \narticles of war, enacted by Congress, and statutes, the President does \nhave the authority to convene military commissions to try offenses \nagainst the law of war. Military commissions could be convened to try \noffenses, whether committed by U.S. service members, civilian U.S. \ncitizens, or enemy aliens, and a state of war need not exist. So there \nhas been a delegation of authority by the Congress. But under the \nConstitution it is the Congress that has the authority to establish the \nparameters and the proceedings under such courts.\n\n  In World War II, in the case of Ex parte Quirin, 317 U.S. 1, eight \nGerman saboteurs were tried by a military commission for entering the \nUnited States by submarine, shedding their military uniforms and \nconspiring to use explosives on unknown targets. After their capture, \nPresident Roosevelt proclaimed that all saboteurs caught in the United \nStates would be tried by military commission. The Supreme Court of the \nUnited States denied their writs of habeas corpus, holding that trial \nby such a commission did not offend the Constitution.\n  In World War II, we obviously faced a dire threat. The decision was \nmade, understandably at that time, to have that kind of a trial \nprocedure and not in regular civil Federal courts. Our current \ncircumstances may warrant such action at the present time, but I do \nbelieve it is something that ought to be considered by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I note the presence of the distinguished chairman of the committee in \nthe Chamber. I just commented, Senator Leahy, that I have signed a \nletter to you on this subject. I thought it worthwhile to go far beyond \nthe letter and to talk about this subject because I believe it is a \nmatter of very substantial importance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I haven't seen the \nletter, but the press described it to me and asked me about it. I told \nthem I totally agree with you on that, that we should have hearings on \nthis--actually a number of these steps. One of the difficult things, as \nthe Senator knows, is getting the Attorney General to come up here and \ntestify. I think the last person to be able to even ask him a question \nin our committee was the senior Senator from Pennsylvania during the \nterrorism bill.\n  I only heard part of what the Senator was saying, but his usual \nfashion is to lay out the law and the history very clearly. I do \nbelieve we should have hearings. I intend to have a meeting with the \nFBI Director this afternoon. I am also going to talk to the Attorney \nGeneral on this and a number of other issues, including some about \nwhich the Senator has expressed concern to me. He really should come up \nhere before we finish for the year. We should discuss some of these \nissues.\n  I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is absolutely right in raising \nthis. I appreciate him doing it. He does us all a service.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Vermont for those comments. I \nthink the Attorney General would come up on an invitation. We are due \nback here on the 26th. I think it would be in order to make this the \nfirst order of business of the committee on the 27th. That would be 12 \ndays' notice.\n  I note that there is a very extensive Executive Order implementing \nthis procedure. This matter is not something which burst upon the scene \nyesterday. It has been under consideration.\n  I noted that a key Member of the House of Representatives was quoted \nin this morning's press as not having been consulted. I noted the \nchairman is also\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\nquoted in the press as having not been consulted. That is the \nPresident's right. He can take his action, but under the separation of \npowers we have our own rights. The Congress has the authority to make \nthose determinations. That is what the Constitution says. We have the \nauthority to decide how those trials will be conducted. Of course, we \nare in a very difficult situation. We face a struggle for survival with \nwhat happened on September 11. The executive branch is entitled to \ngreat deference, but we are entitled to know the reasons for the \nPresident's order and its scope. Such a military tribunal need not have \na trial by jury, which would be expected. Not to have a trial by jury \nis a military court-martial. There is no explicit privilege against \nself-incrimination. That is something we have to consider.\n\n  There is even no right of the defendant to choose his counsel. I \ndon't think that would be the case in every tribunal, but these are \npowers that are very broad, and just as we found it necessary to take \nsome time on the terrorist bill, our job is to take a look at it. And \nthe executive will be immeasurably strengthened if the Congress backs \nthe President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield further on that point, first \noff, I could not agree more with him. I think his last point is one \nthat bears emphasis--how they might be strengthened. The Senator from \nPennsylvania and I have served here longer than most Members of this \nbody. I think it is safe to say that we have seen more bipartisan--\nvirtually nonpartisan--support for the President in the last 2 months \nthan we have for any President, Republican or Democrat, during the \ntimes he and I have been privileged to serve together in this body. \nThat can be very helpful for the President.\n  However, it raises one certain danger. That support in our common \ngoal to fight terrorism and to protect our fellow citizens in this \ncountry is good, but if it goes beyond that, and nobody has a question, \nultimately the Presidency is hurt, the Senate is hurt, and the country \nis hurt. I think we have to ask these questions. You have a question of \nbasic rights such as counsel, jury trial, and whatnot. Obviously, there \nare exceptions. We understand that. But if the exception becomes the \nrule, then all of us suffer. We have seen this in efforts to go after \norganized crime and in other efforts. It is easy to push the envelope \nbecause we only need it this time.\n\n  We have to ask what are the standards, what is the trigger for using \nthis. I have read the Executive order. It is obvious it was thought \nabout a lot. George Terwilliger, a former prosecutor from Vermont and \nformer Deputy Attorney General, is quoted today as saying a lot of \nthese items have been around the Justice Department in both Republican \nand Democratic administrations--my words, not his--for a long time and \nare being dusted off. Some were not dusted off in the past because \ncooler heads prevailed.\n  I think the American public will, as the Congress has, support the \nPresident in a fight against terrorism, but the American public \ndeserves having questions aired and answers given. The Senator from \nPennsylvania does a service in raising that. I can assure him there \nwill be a time set. The Attorney General will be requested to come \nbefore us prior to the Senate adjourning. There has not been \nconsultation with either the Republican or Democratic leadership in the \nCongress on each of these issues. I do not know how many other shoes \nwill drop between now and the time of the hearing, but whatever is \nthere, we will ask about them.\n  I do not want to interrupt the Senator from Pennsylvania any further, \nbut I came to the Chamber simply to thank him for raising what is a \nvery valid point.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for \nthose comments. These are issues of very considerable moment. These are \nmatters which need to be analyzed very carefully.\n  The war against terrorism is a very vital war. Some suggestions have \nbeen made there might be a concern about convicting bin Laden, but I \nremind them, he has been under indictment since 1998 for killing \nAmericans in Mogadishu in 1993 and the blowing up of our embassies in \nAfrica in 1998, and there evidence against him linking him to the \nattack on the U.S.S. Cole. So there is considerable evidence. However \nthat may turn out, this is a matter which should receive deliberation \nby the Judiciary Committee because there are very weighty issues to be \nconsidered.\n  There is not a great deal of time. We are scheduled to have a recess \nto get a secret briefing later today on what is happening in \nAfghanistan. So I ask unanimous consent to print in the Congressional \nRecord a CRS Report for Congress, dated October 29, 2001, on ``Trying \nTerrorists as War Criminals,'' which outlines some of the key \nconsiderations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Trying Terrorists as War Criminals\n\n    (By Jennifer Elsea, Legislative Attorney, American Law Division)\n\n       Summary: In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist \n     attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the \n     question of whether to treat the attacks as acts of war or \n     criminal acts has not been fully settled. The purpose of this \n     report is to clarify the rationale for treating the acts as \n     war crimes and the ramifications of applying the law of war \n     rather than criminal statutes to prosecute the perpetrators. \n     The discussion focuses on the trial of alleged terrorists and \n     conspirators by a military commission rather than the federal \n     courts.\n       In the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks on \n     the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, the question of \n     whether to treat the attacks as acts of war or criminal acts \n     has not been fully settled. The distinction may have more \n     than rhetorical value. The purpose of this report is to \n     clarity the law enforcement implications of treating the \n     terrorist acts as war crimes and to identify the possible \n     ramifications of applying the law of war rather than criminal \n     statutes to prosecute the alleged perpetrators.\n       Law Enforcement versus Law of War. Some observers have \n     expressed concern that treating terrorist acts as acts of war \n     may legitimize the acts as a lawful use of force and elevate \n     the status of the Taliban and the terrorist networks to that \n     of legitimate state actors and lawful combatants. However, it \n     may be argued that an application of the law of war to \n     terrorism does not imply lawfulness of the conflict, nor does \n     it imply that perpetrators are not criminals. Terrorists do \n     not, by definition, conduct themselves as lawful combatants. \n     Under this view, they may be treated as war criminals and if \n     captured, are not entitled to prisoner-of-war status under \n     the Geneva Conventions. As suspected war criminals, they may \n     be tried by any nation in its national courts or by a \n     military commission convened by one nation or many.\n       The Justice Department is reportedly exploring whether to \n     adopt the law of war approach to prosecute those responsible \n     for the September 11 attacks. It appears that there are few \n     legal impediments to adopting such an approach. Other \n     practical considerations that may arise include the following \n     questions: Must war crimes be investigated by military \n     police, possibly implicating the Posse Comitatus Act? If \n     federal or state police are used, must they follow the same \n     standards that they apply to criminal cases? How will it \n     affect the United States' ability to extradite terrorists \n     captured abroad?\n       Such an approach could also have an impact on civil \n     matters. Will there be any effect on the possible civil \n     liability of terrorists to compensate victims? Would it \n     matter if a particular victim was a government employee or \n     someone located at a ``military target'' at the time of an \n     attack? Will there be an effect on the liability of insurers? \n     A decision to adopt a law of war approach to the terrorist \n     acts currently at issue, or to all future terrorist acts, \n     could also have significant foreign policy repercussions.\n       What is the Law of War? As a subset of the law of nations, \n     the law of war is a composite of many sources and is subject \n     to varying interpretations constantly adjusting to address \n     new technology and the changing nature of war. It may also be \n     referred to as jus in bello, or law in war, which refers to \n     the conduct of combatants in armed conflict, as distinguished \n     from jus ad bellum--law before war--which outlines acceptable \n     reasons for nations to engage in armed conflict. The main \n     thrust of its principles requires that a military objective \n     be pursued in such a way as to avoid needless and \n     disproportionate suffering and damages. Sources of the law of \n     war include international agreements, customary principles \n     and rules of international law, judicial decisions by both \n     national and international tribunals, national manuals of \n     military law, treatises, and resolutions of various \n     international bodies.\n       At the risk of oversimplifying the concept, three \n     principles derived from the law of war may be applied to \n     assess the legality of any use of force for political \n     objectives.\n       Military necessity. If the use of force is justified, that \n     use must be proportional in relation to the anticipated \n     military advantage or as a measure of self-defense. The \n     principle applies to the choice of targets, weapons and \n     methods. This principle, however, does not apply to unlawful \n     acts of war. There can be no excuse of necessity if the \n     resort to the use of arms is not itself justified.\n       Humanity. Lawful combatants are bound to use force \n     discriminately. In other words,\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\n     they must limit targets to valid military objectives and must \n     use means no harsher than necessary to achieve that \n     objective. They may not use methods designed to inflict \n     needless suffering, and they may not target civilians.\n       Chivalry. Combatants must adhere to the law of armed \n     conflict in order to be treated as lawful combatants. They \n     must respect the rights of prisoners of war and captured \n     civilians, and avoid behavior such as looting and pillaging. \n     They may not disguise themselves as non-combatants.\n       Although these principles leave a great deal of room for \n     interpretation, there can be little doubt, assuming such acts \n     can be viewed as acts of war, that the attacks of September \n     11 were not conducted in accordance with the law of war. Even \n     if one considers the Pentagon to be a valid military target, \n     the hijacking of a commercial airliner is not a lawful means \n     for attacking it. Acts of bioterrorism, too, violate the law \n     of war, regardless of the nature of the target.\n       Constitutional Bases for Establishing military Commission. \n     The Constitution empowers the Congress to define and punish \n     violations of international law as well as to establish \n     courts with exclusive jurisdiction over military offenses. \n     United States law recognizes the legality of creating \n     military commissions to deal with ``offenders or offenses \n     designated by statute or the law of war.'' Under the former \n     Articles of War and subsequent statute, the President has \n     authority to convene military commissions to try offenses \n     against the law of war. Military commissions could be \n     convened to try such offenses whether committed by U.S. \n     servicemembers, civilian citizens, or enemy aliens. A \n     declared state of war need not exist.\n       Precedent. Although the current crisis does not fit the \n     typical mold associated with war crimes committed by \n     otherwise lawful combatants in obvious theaters of war, there \n     is precedent for convening military commissions to try \n     accused saboteurs for conspiring to commit violations of the \n     law of war outside of the recognized war zone. In the World \n     War II case of Ex Parte Quirin, eight German saboteurs (one \n     of whom was purportedly a U.S. citizen) were tried by \n     military commission for entering the United States by \n     submarine, shedding their military uniforms, and conspiring \n     to use explosives on unknown targets. After their capture, \n     President Roosevelt proclaimed that all saboteurs caught in \n     the United States would be tried by military commission. The \n     Supreme Court denied their writs of habeas corpus, holding \n     that trial by such a commission did not offend the \n     Constitution.\n       Power of the Military Commission. As a legislative court, a \n     military commission is not subject to the same constitutional \n     requirements that apply to Article III courts. Defendants \n     before a military commission, like defendants before a court-\n     martial, have no right to demand a jury trial before a court \n     established in accordance with rules governing the judiciary. \n     There is no right of indictment or presentment under the \n     Fifth Amendment, and there may be no protection against self-\n     incrimination or right to counsel. While Congress has enacted \n     procedures applicable to courts-martial that ensure basic due \n     process rights, no such statutory procedures exist to codify \n     due process rights to defendants before military commissions.\n       Congress has delegated to the President the authority to \n     convene military commissions, set rules of procedure, and \n     review their decisions. This authority may be delegated to a \n     field commander or any other commander with the power to \n     convene a general court-martial. Statutes authorize \n     prosecuting persons for failure to appear as witness, \n     punishing contempt, and accepting into evidence certain \n     depositions and records of courts of inquiry.\n       Procedural Rules. Procedural rules and evidentiary rules \n     are prescribed by the President and may differ among \n     commissions. Courts-martial are conducted using the Military \n     Rules of Evidence set out in the Manual for Courts-\n     Martial; however, these rules need not apply to trials by \n     military commission. Subject to the statutory provisions \n     above, the President may establish any rules of procedure \n     and evidence he deems appropriate.\n       Although there may be little judicial review available to \n     persons convicted by U.S. military commissions, it is surely \n     necessary to provide for trials that will be fundamentally \n     fair under both U.S. and international standards regarding \n     the application of the law of war. Telford Taylor noted in \n     evaluating World War II war crimes trials: ``It is of the \n     first importance that the task of planning and developing \n     permanent judicial machinery for the interpretation and \n     application of international penal law be tackled immediately \n     and effectively. The war crimes trials, at least in Western \n     Europe, have been held on the basis that the law applied and \n     enforced in these trials is international law of general \n     application which everyone in the world is generally bound to \n     observe. On no other basis can the trials be regarded as \n     judicial proceedings, as distinguished from political \n     inquisitions.''\n       There is some historical precedent from which an \n     international norm regarding procedural rights for accused \n     war criminals might be derived. The Nuremberg Tribunals \n     provide a good starting point, as further refined by the \n     International Criminal Tribunals for Yugoslavia and Rwanda. \n     Perhaps the most recent embodiment of the requirements of the \n     international law of war is to be found in the procedures of \n     the not-yet-operational International Criminal Court \n     established by the Rome Statute.\n       The evidentiary rules used at Nuremberg and adopted by the \n     Tokyo tribunals were designed to be non-technical, allowing \n     the expeditious admission of ``all evidence [the Tribunal] \n     deems to have probative value.'' This evidence included \n     hearsay, coerced confessions, and the findings of prior \n     mass trials. While the historical consensus seems to have \n     accepted that the war crimes commissions were conducted \n     fairly, some observers argue that the malleability of the \n     rules of procedure and evidence could and did have some \n     unjust results. For some, the perception is that \n     ``victors' justice'' was all that was sought.\n       Assuming that ordinary procedural and evidentiary rules are \n     unsuitable for the task, it will likely be necessary to adapt \n     or develop a more fitting set. The necessity to protect civil \n     liberties will be seen to require balancing with the need to \n     protect vital national security information and the public \n     safety.\n       Possible Challenges. Although federal courts do not have \n     jurisdiction to review the decisions of legislative courts, a \n     defendant sentenced by a military commission may file a writ \n     of habeas corpus claiming a violation of the law of war, the \n     Constitution, relevant statutes, or military regulations. A \n     challenge based on an interpretation of the law of war is not \n     likely to succeed. Because of Congress' power to define and \n     punish violations of international law, and due to national \n     security implication, courts are likely to defer to the \n     political branches. Due process claims are also unlikely to \n     succeed. Case law demonstrates the difficulties such a \n     challenge would face. A U.S. citizen charged with aiding and \n     abetting the foreign terrorists might be able to argue that \n     the charges against him amount to treason, for which the \n     Constitution contains explicit limitations. Aiding and \n     abetting a hostile (but lawful) force, however, may be \n     distinguishable from conspiring to commit a war crime.\n       The broad delegation of authority to convene military \n     commissions makes a statutory claim unlikely to succeed. A \n     defendant could argue that Congress, by passing comprehensive \n     anti-terrorism legislation that does not authorize trial by \n     military commission, implicitly withholds such authority. A \n     similar argument failed in Ex Parte Quirin. However, the \n     Supreme Court noted that the Espionage Act of 1917 and the \n     Articles of War explicitly kept open concurrent jurisdiction \n     with military tribunals.\n       A last option would be to argue that the military \n     commission violated its own rules. For such a challenge to \n     succeed, the court would have to find that the military \n     reviewing authority committed an error which probably \n     affected the verdict. If the appeal were successful, the \n     court would likely remand the case to the military \n     authorities for retrial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11890-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11890-S11891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECLASSIFICATION OF SCRANTON-WILKES BARRE-HAZELTON, WILLIAMSPORT, AND \n                 SHARON METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, on another subject of great importance to \nPennsylvania, on two amendments which I am considering offering on the \nstimulus bill, one relates to the reclassification of the Scranton-\nWilkes Barre-Hazelton metropolitan statistical area and also the \nreclassification of the Williamsport metropolitan statistical area, and \nthe reclassification of the Sharon metropolitan statistical area. These \nareas' hospitals are in dire straits because the Medicare reimbursement \nformulas allow them less compensation than that to which they should be \nentitled.\n  This matter was considered near the end of the last Congress, and \nthere were quite a few areas which wanted to have a reclassification. \nAll were omitted. The pain for these areas in my State has become more \nintense. An appropriate vehicle would be the stimulus package because \nthese reimbursement shortfalls have a direct bearing on the economies \nof these three very important areas.\n  There has been a great problem which has resulted from the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, and these areas have a much lower reimbursement \nrate than adjacent areas. For example, if you take the Scranton-Wilkes \nBarre-Hazelton area, they receive $6,010 in Medicare payments per case \ncompared to Monroe County, an adjacent county, which receives $7,390, \nmore than $1,380 more, an enormous differential.\n  What is the result? The nurses and the medical personnel go from one \narea to the higher paid area. The Allentown area, again adjacent, \nreceives $6,665 compared to the $6,010 for the Scranton-Wilkes Barre-\nHazelton area. The Williamsport area, which is in the same region, is \nsimilarly disadvantaged, and so is Sharon, PA.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a 2-page summary on reclassification of \nthese areas be printed in the Congressional Record since there is \nrelatively\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\nlittle time remaining, and the summary will explain in some greater \ndetail the reasons, and also a copy of the proposed amendment which \nSenator Santorum and I are considering offering when the stimulus \npackage comes before the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Reclassification of Scranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazleton, Williamsport, and \n                 Sharon Metropolitan Statistical Areas\n\n       Many of Northeastern Pennsylvania's hospitals faced \n     operating losses over the last few years, a troubling reality \n     felt all across the country. In addition, the area is one of \n     the most aged communities in the country, therefore the \n     region's hospitals are extremely dependent on Medicare \n     reimbursement.\n       The region has also seen one of the most rapid and dramatic \n     shifts to managed care in the country: over the last five \n     years, managed care grew from virtually no presence to almost \n     50% of the commercially insured population and 20% of the \n     Medicare population.\n       While virtually no hospital in the nation has been left \n     untouched by the cost pressures inflicted by BBA 97 and other \n     factors, hospitals in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazleton \n     Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) and in the Williamsport \n     MSA face a unique situation.\n       Both of these MSAs contain areas or border on areas from \n     which Geisinger Medical Center, a 437 bed teaching hospital \n     in Montour County, Pennsylvania, draws its patients--and more \n     importantly, its workforce.\n       Due to the understandably high wage costs of operating its \n     large tertiary care facility, Geisinger has been reclassified \n     to be deemed part of the Harrisburg MSA. (Its original \n     classification was part of the rural area of Pennsylvania.)\n       Therefore, Geisinger Medical Center is being reimbursed \n     based on a wage index that is currently more than 12% higher \n     than the wage indexes of the Scranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazleton \n     MSA and the Williamsport MSA. This results in unsustainably \n     low Medicare reimbursements within those MSAs, particularly \n     since the costs of living are similar to those in Geisinger's \n     area.\n       From 11/13/01 Citizen's Voice (Hospitals' Numbers): \n     Medicare Payment per case in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton--\n     $6,010--compared to: Monroe County: $7,390; Allentown: \n     $6,665; and Harrisburg: $6,359.\n       The Scranton-Wilkes Barre MSA wage index has been steadily \n     falling, reduced from 0.8578 last fiscal year to 0.8473. The \n     actual wage index for the area is around 0.80, but federal \n     law does not permit an MSA to go below the state's rural \n     rate, which will be 0.8473.\n       Nursing Shortages Intensifies: the Hospital Association of \n     PA has identified Northeast PA as the area in the state with \n     the worst shortage of nurses. Moreover, other skilled care \n     givers remain in very short supply. These shortages drive up \n     the cost of health care and the need to increase wages--\n     something which these hospitals have done.\n       Sharon, PA, in the Northwestern part of Pennsylvania, faces \n     similar difficulty hiring skilled workers, due to an \n     unacceptably low reimbursement rate and its need to \n     compete with bordering areas which qualify for higher wage \n     indices.\n       Sharon Regional Medical Center, UPMC Horizon and United \n     Community Hospital are located in the Sharon MSA. Sharon \n     Regional Medical Center is 1 mile from the Ohio border and 12 \n     miles from Youngstown, OH.\n       However, further reductions in the wage index will make it \n     impossible for the hospitals to retain or recruit all the \n     caregivers that the communities require. Nearby regions, \n     including Newburgh, Allentown and Harrisburg, continue the \n     Scranton skilled workforce. For Sharon, it must compete with \n     the Erie area to the North and Youngstown to the West.\n       All of the hospitals in the Sharon MSA compete with \n     Youngstown for nurses, pharmacists, radiology technicians, \n     and other allied health professionals. Youngstown pays nurses \n     $2-$3 more per hour than hospitals in Sharon, yet those \n     hospitals receive nearly the lowest area wage index in \n     Pennsylvania (.850). Youngstown is a larger city/region with \n     a much higher area wage index.\n       An MSA reclassification for Sharon, PA is crucial if its \n     hospitals are to maintain their ability to provide quality \n     health care to its citizens.\n       A National Solution is Still Years Away: These hospitals \n     cannot afford to wait for this.\n       The amendment we intend to offer seeks to remedy this \n     disparity. Our language would reclassify for a period of \n     three years the Williamsport MSA to the Harrisburg MSA: all \n     of the counties within Scranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazleton MSA \n     into the Newburgh, NY MSA; and the Sharon MSA into \n     Youngstown, OH.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            amendment no.--\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the reclassification of certain counties for \n         purposes of reimbursement under the medicare program)\n\n       At the end of title IX, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I wish to make one more point before \nyielding the floor, and that is another amendment which I am \nconsidering offering on the stimulus package. That is an amendment \nwhich would add $350 million for capital grants to be made by the \nSecretary of Transportation for the rehabilitation, preservation, and \nimprovement of railroad tracks, including bridges, roadbed, and related \ntrack structures to short-line railroads.\n  Legislation has been pending in the House of Representatives on this \nsubject which has more than 100 sponsors. Legislation is pending in the \nSenate which has 7 sponsors. This would be a tremendous stimulus \nbecause it would immediately put many people to work on the \nreconstruction of the short-line railroads in the short run, providing \nvery extensive jobs, and in the long run, by improving the \ninfrastructure which would be enormously helpful to the economy of \nPennsylvania and similarly to other areas where there are short-line \nrailroads.\n  At my request, the McFarren Group prepared an extensive analysis of \nproposed railroad costs to be included in the Federal stimulus package. \nBecause of the shortage of time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a limited portion of this report be printed: The executive summary \nand the third page of the summary, together with a summary of factors \nin support of this amendment and a copy of the amendment itself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\nproposed railroad costs to be included in the federal economic stimulus \n                       package, October 31, 2001\n\n     Background\n       At the request of Senator Arlen Specter, the Keystone State \n     Railroad Association conducted a survey of member and non-\n     member Pennsylvania railroads to ascertain the degree of \n     infrastructure improvements needed across the Commonwealth's \n     rail system. Respondents were asked to provide information \n     related to project readiness, safety and infrastructure \n     conditions, security and insurance cost estimates, and \n     estimates on the number of jobs that could be created if \n     listed projects were undertaken.\n     Summary of Findings\n       Pennsylvania railroads responding to this survey indicate \n     more often than 60% of the short line and regional railroad \n     infrastructure is in need of extensive rehabilitation, \n     including more than 170 bridges. Excluding the Bessemer & \n     Lake Erie and Delaware & Hudson railroads, both of which have \n     heavy load infrastructures, the short line and regional \n     railroads are capable of handling the heavier 286,000-pound \n     loads on only 70% of their infrastructure. The funds needed \n     to upgrade these lines and the related bridge infrastructure \n     will exceed many preliminary cost estimates. Many customers \n     are beginning to demand the use of 315,000-pound cars, which \n     will dramatically escalate funding needed for these rail \n     lines even further.\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\n       The cost of most extensive bridge repairs can easily exceed \n     $1 million each for smaller spans. Short line and regional \n     railroads also indicate that more than 300 rail crossings are \n     in need of serious rehabilitation and repair.\n       Projects that could be undertaken to address Pennsylvania \n     railroad infrastructure needs total some $280 million. Of \n     these projects, construction could be initiated on 44% of \n     them, totaling more than $120 million, in the next six \n     months.\n       While it may be difficult to quantify, a clear correlation \n     undoubtedly exists between derailments and rail \n     infrastructure conditions. Railroads indicated that more than \n     350 derailments occurred during the past twelve months \n     resulting in only nine worker injuries. This is a tremendous \n     testament to the railroad industry's excellent safety record. \n     A majority of the derailments occurred at low speeds in yard \n     and switching operations. It is estimated that more than \n     540,000 carloads of hazardous materials cross Pennsylvania's \n     rail system each year.\n       In the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, \n     business and government are taking a much harder look at ways \n     to improve the security of the nation's transportation \n     system. A group of Class I railroads has already met to \n     discuss a series of security measures. Any efforts undertaken \n     by Class I railroads will also need to be addressed by \n     regional and short line railroad systems. The costs of \n     augmenting manpower at critical points along the system can \n     be extremely prohibitive to many small and medium-sized \n     operations.\n       The September 11 disaster has already escalated insurance \n     costs in most sectors. Several railroads have been warned \n     that their risks and their rates will be re-evaluated. Some \n     railroads may not even qualify for any affordable insurance \n     coverage. It is conceivable that railroads receiving funding \n     for infrastructure projects will be forced to spend an \n     equivalent amount in additional security and insurance costs \n     in coming years. An addendum provides an overview of current \n     insurance conditions, as it relates to the railroad industry.\n       There is no doubt that investment in the nation's railroad \n     infrastructure is warranted. The American Short Line and \n     Regional Railroad Association (ASLRRA) recently surveyed \n     members nationwide and reported that the nation's short line \n     and regional railroads could invest $1.2 billion in \n     infrastructure upgrades in the next six months if the \n     financial resources were available. KSRRA's findings in \n     Pennsylvania certainly bear this out. The most modest \n     forecasts for the movement of freight by the Federal Highway \n     Administration (FHWA) indicate that increases of up to 70% \n     can be expected in the Northeast over the next ten years. A \n     fraction of this type of growth would severely congest the \n     national transportation network unless investments are made \n     today. Railroads remain the safest and most viable mode for \n     transporting hazardous materials, coal, industrial raw \n     materials and large quantities of goods. It is clear that an \n     investment in an improved rail infrastructure is an \n     investment in the country's economic future.\n       The funding of railroad infrastructure projects also \n     creates powerful economic stimuli as more than 650 new \n     construction and maintenance jobs could be directly created \n     if the attached projects were funded. This does not include \n     the hundreds of additional jobs that would need to be added \n     by railroad tie manufacturers, steel rail manufacturers, the \n     stone industry and other additional suppliers. Typically, a \n     multiplier of four is applied to measure the overall economic \n     impact. These infrastructure projects would also be of \n     tremendous benefit to the nation's steel industry since new \n     rail would be purchased from domestic steel sources, as \n     required in most government funded projects. Pennsylvania \n     railroads responding to this survey have painted a compelling \n     picture for investment in rail infrastructure.\n       Attached is a detailed listing of projects that \n     Pennsylvania railroads are prepared to undertake, as well as \n     an addendum pertaining to railroad security.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Any economic stimulus package should include expenditures \n     that will initiate further economic activity and that will \n     produce a long-term economic benefit. Any such stimulus must \n     be timely and result in meaningful product development rather \n     than merely being an additional burden on future government \n     spending patterns.\n       Many transportation authorities have continually pointed to \n     the dramatic need to invest in our major transportation \n     infrastructure. These improvements in most cases are already \n     part of the strategic transportation plan. The projects, \n     which we have analyzed and produced for your consideration, \n     have already been engineered and prioritized by the \n     respective railroad companies. These projects can be \n     initiated with very short notice and the economic stimulus \n     will be immediate. The additional employment will be needed \n     immediately.\n       From a national security perspective, railroads are one of \n     the best ways to produce a more secure system for \n     transporting dangerous or hazardous products. By further \n     improving the infrastructure, the overall railroad operating \n     system can become even safer and more difficult to disrupt by \n     any terrorist group. These needed changes and the additional \n     security measures will add substantial costs to industry \n     operations but the changes and improvements are long lasting \n     and a fraction of the cost incurred in other areas.\n       Transportation is the centerpiece of industrial production \n     and energy generation. Railroads transport more than 60% of \n     coal used by generating facilities and some 70% of motor \n     vehicles from the factory to a regional distribution \n     facility. Some 30,000 miles of the railroad network is part \n     of the strategic national defense corridor system. The \n     regional and short line railroads are the feeders and \n     supporting players in this overall transportation network. \n     The network is only as strong as its weakest link. Therefore, \n     the $280 million of projects for Pennsylvania short line and \n     regional railroads is an absolute priority in any national \n     economic stimulus package.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        Facts in Support of Proposed Specter-Santorum Amendment\n\n\n                             general points\n\n       The amendment would provide $350 million in track \n     rehabilitation funds for short line railroads. It would be \n     distributed based on the criteria established in S. 1220, \n     pending legislation that would authorize this expenditure. \n     This legislation was moving quickly through the process prior \n     to September 11th. It was passed unanimously by the House T \n     Committee and awaiting floor action. It has strong bipartisan \n     support in the Senate including sponsorship by the Chairman \n     and Ranking Member of the Senate authorizing subcommittee of \n     jurisdiction. It is supported by the Class I railroads and by \n     rail labor.\n       There are over 500 Class II and III railroads that together \n     operate approximately 50,000 miles of track, or just under \n     one third of America's railroad route mileage, and employing \n     approximately 25,000 people.\n       The short line industry keeps the less populated areas of \n     the country connected to the national railroad main line \n     network. It does so over track that was very marginal in the \n     Class I system because it never generated enough traffic to \n     justify sufficient investment. With a lower cost structure \n     and more flexible service, short line companies that \n     purchased the track have been able to keep these lines going. \n     However, the revenue is still not high enough to make up for \n     past years of neglect.\n       Today, two factors have combined to bring this situation to \n     a head. First, the advent of the heavier 286,000-pound cars \n     that are becoming the standard of the Class I industry \n     require substantially higher investment in the track. Second, \n     as the Class I's put a greater premium on speed and precisely \n     scheduled operations, the short line railroads must meet \n     these higher standards or be cut off from the national \n     system.\n       Transportation is at the heart of industrial production and \n     energy generation. Railroads transport more than 60% of coal \n     used by generating facilities and are a major mover of \n     automobiles, industrial chemicals and mining products. The \n     short line and regional railroads are the feeders and \n     supporting players in this transportation network and the \n     network is only as strong as its weakest link.\n\n\n          points related to the stimulus package and security\n\n       Money spent on railroad capital programs can be spent \n     immediately. Replacing rails and ties and rebuilding \n     equipment is an on-going process for railroads. The \n     engineering and planning were done long ago. Unlike highways, \n     railroads control their rights-of-way and the timing of their \n     traffic. To double or triple the number of rails and ties \n     installed requires virtually no lead-time. The short lines \n     national association surveyed its entire membership following \n     September 11th and found that the short line industry could \n     spend over $400 million on infrastructure improvements in the \n     next three months and over $1.2 billion in the next six \n     months. Over 6,000 workers would be directly employed for the \n     three month period and nearly 9,500 workers would be directly \n     employed for the six-month period. These jobs would be in \n     addition to the railroad's in-house work forces and would not \n     include additional workers in the tie and rail supply \n     industry.\n       A large portion of this investment involves the purchase of \n     rail and in testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee on \n     November 1 the short line association president indicated \n     that the short lines have agreed they will purchase only US \n     made rail with this money.\n       One of the recommendations being made by security experts \n     in the wake of September 11th is that we find ways to \n     transport hazardous materials around heavily populated areas. \n     The nation's short line railroads offer a ready-made \n     transportation network that bypasses our nation's most \n     heavily populated areas. Today, 20 percent of all short line \n     customers ship hazardous materials.\n       Keeping America's light density railroad lines connected to \n     the national railroad system is important under any \n     circumstances. Today it is even more important. The events of \n     September 11th have caused major disruptions in all our \n     transportation systems. As we sit here today, the federal \n     government is determining how to best inspect truck cargo and \n     is surveying all of America's railroads to determine the \n     location of critical infrastructure assets such as bridges \n     and tunnels and how and where we move hazardous materials \n     near large population centers. Today, America's entire \n     transportation infrastructure is under duress and we should \n     be concerned that America's entire transportation \n     infrastructure is up to the task.\n       September 11th has already escalated insurance costs in \n     many sectors. Several railroads have been warned that their \n     risks and\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\n     their rates will be re-evaluated. Some railroads may not even \n     qualify for affordable insurance coverage. As small railroads \n     are hit with higher and higher insurance costs, they will \n     have less and less to invest in needed rehabilitation.\n\n\n                     points related to pennsylvania\n\n       Sixty percent of Pennsylvania's short line and regional \n     railroad infrastructure is in need of extensive \n     rehabilitation, including more than 170 bridges. Over 300 \n     rail crossings require significant rehabilitation. Excluding \n     the Bessemer & Lake Erie and Delaware & Hudson railroads, \n     both of which have heavy load infrastructures, almost one \n     third of Pennsylvania's short lines and regionals cannot \n     effectively handle the heavier 286,000-pound cars that are \n     becoming the new standard in the industry.\n       A recent survey of the state's short lines indicate that \n     infrastructure needs total some $280 million, and over 40% of \n     those projects could be initiated in the immediate future.\n       More than 540,000 carloads of hazardous materials cross \n     Pennsylvania's rail system each year.\n       The most modest forecasts for the movement of freight by \n     the Federal Highway Administration indicate that increases of \n     up to 70% can be expected in the Northeast over the next ten \n     years. This growth will severely congest the national \n     transportation network unless investments are made today. \n     Railroads remain the safest and most viable mode for \n     transporting hazardous materials, coal, industrial raw \n     materials and bulk commodities. Investment in rail \n     infrastructure is an investment in the country's economic \n     future.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            amendment no.--\n\n    (Purpose: To provide additional funding for capital grants for \nrehabilitation, preservation, or improvement of railroad track of class \n                      II and class III railroads)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   .

Mr. President, the Nation's attention is focused on the \nthreat of biological weapons. The pernicious nature of these types of \nweapons has been shown in the anthrax-laced mailings that were sent to \nthe office of the majority leader, Tom Daschle, NBC news in New York, \nand American Media in Florida, which have resulted in contamination of \na number of post offices in Washington, D.C., New Jersey, Florida, and \nperhaps elsewhere.\n  One question is on all American's minds: how can we defend ourselves \nagainst a threat that is literally microscopic? In the days of the Cold \nWar, we became accustomed to being able to quantify the threats posed \nto the United States: we could count the number of Soviet missiles, \nbombers, tanks, and soldiers, and respond by increasing the \ncapabilities of our own military.\n  But now, the threat to our security has changed. We can not quantify \nthis threat and we can not track its movements until it might be too \nlate. Building up our military will not affect our security from \nbiological weapons. We must adjust our thinking on how to deal with \nthese abhorrent weapons of pestilence.\n  Mr. President, remember that Jesus said: You shall hear of wars and \nrumors of wars, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against \nnation and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and \npestilences and earthquakes.\n  Pestilences, that is what I am talking about; germ warfare, viral \nwarfare, anthrax. Building up our military, I said, will not affect our \nsecurity from these pestilences. We must adjust our thinking, I say \nagain, on how to deal with these abhorrent weapons of pestilence.\n  We do not yet know for certain whether the anthrax attacks were \ncarried out by foreign or domestic agents, by someone across the seas \nor someone in our midst. We also do not know when the next biological \nweapons attack might happen, what type of germs or viruses might be \nused, or who might be planning it. But the U.S. must take action. The \ntime is right now, in the midst of intensified international \ncondemnation of the use of biological weapons, to form an international \nregime to eliminate the manipulation of nature for violent purposes.\n\n  Over 140 countries have signed the Biological Weapons Convention of \n1972. It is one of the simplest arms control treaties in existence. \nParties of the treaty agree not to develop or retain any biological \ntoxins or agents that are to be used for other than peaceful purposes. \nThere are no means to verify this binding commitment, but the \nConvention has succeeded in its limited purpose by confirming among \nmost of the world that biological weapons are abhorrent to all mankind.\n  Negotiations began in 1995 on how to add a binding protocol to the \nBiological Weapons Convention to create a regime that would verify \ncompliance with the treaty. Parties to the Convention would thereby \nsubmit themselves to the same kinds of inspections that are conducted \nat nuclear facilities under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and \nchemical facilities under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The purpose \nof these inspections would be to assure the whole wide world that \npotentially dangerous microbes, which are needed to conduct scientific \nand medical research, are handled in a safe manner, and are not being \ndiverted to nefarious purposes.\n  Representatives at the last conference on the Biological Weapons \nConvention, which took place in July, hoped to gain consensus on the \nfinal text of the protocol, which may open for signature within weeks. \nThe results of that conference were disappointing. Rather than \nnegotiating toward the resolution of many outstanding issues on the \nprotocol, the Bush Administration took the view that no protocol would \nbe preferable to a negotiated protocol. Like much of the world, I was \nleft wondering whether this Administration takes arms control \nseriously.\n  I am pleased to see that on November 1, the Administration unveiled a \nnumber of proposals to complement the Biological Weapons Convention. \nThese voluntary measures are well-intentioned and they make sense. \nHowever, they do not go far enough.\n  I am wary of addressing our urgent and serious national security \nconcerns simply through voluntary measures by foreign countries. With \nno formal multilateral protocol to spell out exactly what each \ncountry's responsibilities are, I fear that the future of the \ninternational ban on biological weapons will be a patchwork quilt of \nfull compliance, non-compliance, half-measures, and more talk and less \naction. This could ultimately leave us even less secure from these \nhorrific weapons.\n  There are other important treaty matters before our country. We are \nclosing in on an agreement with Russia for sharp reductions in our \nnuclear stockpiles, and negotiations will continue on altering the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972 to allow increased national \nmissile defense testing. These deals, if concluded, would be a major \ndevelopment in our relationship with Russia and have a major impact on \ngeopolitics. The strategic arms of the two biggest nuclear powers would \nbe cut to between 1,700 and 2,200 warheads, which is less than a third \nof our present level. We have not had as few as 2,000 strategic \nwarheads in our nuclear arsenal since 1955.\n  I am not against reducing the nuclear stockpile. I am not against \nreducing the number of missiles, the number of warheads. I am not \nagainst that. But as important as this agreement would be, I am shocked \nby the President's view that an agreement on arms reductions need not \nbe on paper. Legally and\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\ntechnically he is right. It need not be on paper. But, Mr. President, \nit ought to be on paper. The President said that he was content to \nconclude arms reduction talks with nothing more than a handshake. \nNothing more than a handshake.\n  Now, that is troubling me. If I sell a piece of property or if I buy \na piece of property, I will shake hands with the person who buys my \nproperty. I will shake hands with the person from whom I buy property. \nBut there will also be a deed and it will be registered at the \ncourthouse in the county where the property exists. There will be a \nhandshake--that is fine. A handshake carries with it the indication of \nhonor. ``It is an honor to deal with you--it is a pleasure, I have \nenjoyed doing business with you.'' But it is that deed that is in \nwriting that assures my grandchildren, and their children if necessary, \nthat that property, that transfer of property is on record.\n  So I say again, the President said--he is reported to have said that \nhe was content to conclude arms reduction talks with nothing more than \na handshake. Are you? Are you, the people who are watching this Senate \nfloor through those electronic eyes behind the Presiding Officer, are \nyou content? Are you content that arms reduction talks be concluded \nwith nothing more than a handshake?\n  We are closing in on a historic compact, and I cannot understand why \nthis agreement should not be done as a formal written treaty. That \nwould require a two-thirds vote, yes. But a simple handshake leaves \nmany questions unanswered. I would like to see one or both Houses of \nthe Congress having some say in that, and backing up that handshake, if \nneeded, with their votes, the representatives, the elected \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  A simple handshake leaves many questions unanswered. What will happen \nto the nuclear warheads once they are removed from their missiles? I \nmust note that in this year's budget request, the Administration cut \nmore than $131 million from the programs that keep these powerful \nweapons from falling into the wrong hands. How will we verify? How will \nwe verify that Russia carries out its arms reductions, and how will \nRussia, how will President Putin verify that we carry out ours? That we \nare carrying out our arms reduction? It was Ronald Reagan himself that \nsaid, ``Trust, but verify.'' In other words, yes, shake hands. But \nverify.\n  And what will happen to the agreement when President Bush and \nPresident Putin leave office? President Bush under the Constitution can \nserve 3 more years after this year, and if he is then elected again, he \ncan serve 4 more years. But who knows what the attitude of his \nsuccessor will be. If there is no treaty, no formal agreement in which \nthis Senate, or on which the Senate and House--whichever type of \nagreement it might be--has been able to put a stamp of approval, who \nknows what his successor might say. Or who knows how the successor to \nMr. Putin might feel about it. A written treaty could provide clear \nanswers to each of these important questions.\n\n  It would be a real mistake to make such an important international \nagreement in any other form, I think, than a treaty. We do not need \nfly-by-night arms control. We need arms control measures that are \ncarefully examined to support our national security. We do not need \nhush-hush agreements with other countries on our nuclear weapons. We \nneed public confidence in our military and foreign policy. Lacking the \nfull confidence of the public, an informal agreement on nuclear arms \nand national missile defense is not worth the paper that it is--or is \nnot--written on.\n  President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, ``Treaties are the \ncornerstones on which all relations between nations must rest.'' \nTreaties are useful in clearly elaborating the responsibilities of each \nparty, and formal ratification of treaties indicate a country's full \nacceptance of those responsibilities. The Founding Fathers of this \ncountry The Founding Fathers who wrote this Constitution and made \nreference to treaties in that Constitution, understood that, and that \nis why they secured for the Senate advice and consent responsibilities \nto any treaty made by the President.\n  We should not turn away from this treaty-making process for the \nsimple convenience of the executive branch.\n  The Kings of England make treaties. The Kings of England have always \nmade treaties. But this country has no King. This Republic has no King. \nGentlemen's agreements on matters as important as international \nsecurity or the control of weapons of mass destruction are simply not \nsufficient to inspire the confidence of the public in this or other \ncountries. By making treaties, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, the United States shows itself to be a reliable ally to our \nfriends, and a principled actor to our opponents.\n\n  We should also consider the President's role in conducting our \nforeign policy, and his role as commander-in-chief. Is his hand in \nconducting future negotiations with Russia, in the case of the ABM \nTreaty and nuclear arms reduction, or with the other nations of the \nworld, in the case of the Biological Weapons Convention, the Kyoto \nProtocol, and a host of other treaties, strengthened if he concludes \nthese types of agreements without the advice and consent of the Senate?\n  Is his hand strengthened if he doesn't have the advice and consent of \nthe U.S. Senate standing behind him? No. I don't think his hand would \nbe strengthened. I would think just the opposite.\n  Senate approval or ratification of important international agreements \nis a signal to all the world that our nation not just a branch of our \ngovernment approves of and will carry out those agreements negotiated \nby the President. Senate approval of important treaties, such as a \nprotocol to the Biological Weapons Convention or a new strategic \nagreement with Russia would strengthen the Chief Executive's hand to \nnegotiate from a position of strength on other international matters, \nsuch as the Kyoto Protocol, possible NATO expansion, and future arms \ncontrol treaties.\n  So I say that legally and technically, the President might not need \nto have it written on a piece of paper. Legally and technically, he may \nbe able to do it with a handshake.\n  Let me say again that I am not proposing that we shouldn't reduce our \nnuclear weapons stockpile. I am not proposing that at all. I think the \nMX missile, for example, is old, and we shouldn't continue to keep that \naround. But a handshake is not enough. I don't rest easy. Do you, Mr. \nPresident? I am saying to the Presiding Officer, and I am saying to \nother Senators, would you rest easy with just a handshake in a matter \nof this nature?\n  The two issues I have just discussed, the Biological Weapons \nConvention and our strategic situation with regard to Russia, are very \nimportant to the security of our country. The United States must take a \nleadership position on these issues to crack down on the use of germs \nand viruses as weapons, and to clarify our relationship with the nation \nthat has emerged from our Cold War opponent. These matters cannot rest \non voluntary measures or unwritten pacts. I urge the Administration to \npursue formal agreements on these issues in order to recognize their \nimportance to Americans and the world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11894-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11894-S11896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THANKSGIVING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr, President, nearly 4 centuries ago, a courageous little \ngroup of people left their homeland, boarded a small, flimsy sailboat--\nit was not a steamboat; it was a sailboat, a sail ship--and they \njourneyed across a mighty ocean, and settled in an inscrutable \nunfriendly wilderness. They did all of this, took all of these risks.\n  Think about the risks that they took. They did not have any cell \nphones. They did not have any radios. They did not have any weather \npredictors. They did not have any newspapers to tell them what might \nlie ahead or what the weather conditions might be 24 hours away. They \ndid not have any hospitals nearby. But they had faith. They had the \nguiding light of God's word. Many of them took all these\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\nrisks so that they could go to church, the church of their choice. \nThink about it. How many of us today have difficulty getting up on \nSunday morning in order to go to church? I do. Ah, how I like to lie in \nbed on Sunday morning. My little dog Billy gets me up many times, or \nthat alarm clock does. But I like to go back to bed on Sunday morning. \nCan't do it on Monday, you see. Can't do it on Tuesday. But Saturday \nand Sunday--ah, Sunday.\n\n  How many of us do not like to walk those few blocks or drive those \nfew miles to go to church? But here were the Pilgrims, crossing a vast \nocean--2,500 miles, 3,000 miles--a vast body of water, facing the \ndarkest of unknowns. They did not know what would lie in wait for them. \nThey knew it would be a long time before they could get back home, and \nperhaps there would not be friendly winds that would bring their sail \nships back home. They faced the darkest of unknowns just to preserve \nthe sacred right to worship as they pleased, or not to worship, to go \nto this church or that church, the church of their choice. Many of them \ncame for that reason only.\n  Stop and think about it. Doesn't one stand in awe, absolute stark \nawe, as one thinks of the courage of those men and women to strike out \nacross the stormy deep, in awe of their courage and their devotion to \nGod? One cannot help but be awed by that courage that they had to go \nagainst odds, to face hunger and deprivation and danger, to be away \nfrom their loved ones there in the British Isles or in the Netherlands \nor in Germany or in France or Italy, or wherever, to leave those \nfriends and relatives, those loved ones, perhaps forever, not knowing \nwhether they would ever in this world see those loved ones, those \nfriends, those acquaintances again.\n  The journey was not easy. Turbulent weather, including rough winds \nand strong currents, forced the Pilgrims to anchor at Cape Cod, MA, far \nnorth of their destination and well outside the boundaries of their \npatent. This meant that, once on land, there would be no legal \nauthority or government over them.\n  Therefore, before disembarking, the Pilgrim leaders assembled \ntogether all the adult men who made the journey on the Mayflower in \norder to formulate a government.\n  It was a covenant. One might call it a contract. I prefer to call it \na covenant. Drawing upon their church covenant which vested religious \nauthority in the congregation, they established a form of self-\ngovernment.\n  It seemed simple enough, but little could these men aboard the \nMayflower that fateful November night in 1620 have realized the mighty \nforces that they were unleashing. By binding themselves into a ``civil \nbody politic,'' by giving themselves the power to enact laws for the \ncommon good, and obligating themselves to obey such laws, the Pilgrims \nwere establishing the fundamental, the basic principles of democracy in \nAmerica, namely a belief in self government, the rule of law, and \ngovernment by mutual consent.\n  The Pilgrims had also established that the government of their new \nworld would be a government under God. The Mayflower Compact made this \nintent perfectly clear as it read, in part:\n\n       In the name of God, amen, we whose names are underwritten . \n     . . Having undertaken for the Glory of God . . . Do by these \n     Presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and \n     one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a \n     civil Body Politik, for our better Ordering and Preservation. \n     . . .\n  There you have it. These were our forebears. The next year, these \nsame men and women established the custom of gathering together each \nyear to express their gratitude to God for protecting them, for the \nharvests that their labors had brought forth in the new land, and for \nthe preservation of their community.\n  In the middle of October of 1621, a group of hunters sent out by \nGovernor Bradford brought back a great store of wild turkeys. I can \njust see them. They wouldn't go the back streets with this big bundle \nof turkeys they had shot. No, they would go the front street, wouldn't \nthey? They would go right down front street so that everybody could see \nthe turkeys they had bagged, a great store of wild turkeys. When these \nwere added to the collection of lobsters and clams and fish and corn \nand green vegetables and dried fruits that the community had collected, \nthe Pilgrims had the makings of a great feast. Hot diggity dog, they \nhad it, didn't they. They had something good to eat. Yes, indeed. So \nthey invited their neighbors to join them in a day of celebration and \nworship and in a common giving of thanks.\n  Two years later, in 1623, the Pilgrims made this day of thanks, \nfeasting, and worship a tradition. The spirit of that glorious day, \nwhich some people recognize as the first official Thanksgiving, was \ncaptured in a proclamation attributed to Governor Bradford. That \nproclamation read in part--let us read it together:\n\n       Inasmuch as the Great Father has given us this year in an \n     abundant harvest of Indian corn, wheat, peas, squashes and \n     garden vegetables, and made the forest to abound with game \n     and the sea with fish and clams, and inasmuch as he has . . . \n     spared us from the pestilence and granted us freedom to \n     worship God according to the dictates of our own conscience, \n     now I, your magistrate, do proclaim that all ye Pilgrims, \n     with your wives and ye little ones, do gather at ye meeting \n     house, on ye hill, between the hours of nine and twelve in \n     the daytime on Thursday, November ye 29th, of the year of our \n     Lord one thousand six hundred and twenty-three, and the third \n     year since ye Pilgrims landed on ye Plymouth Rock, there to \n     listen to ye Pastor and render Thanksgiving to ye all \n     Almighty God for all his blessings.\n\n  ``Thanksgiving day,'' wrote President John Kennedy, ``has ever since \nbeen part of the fabric which has united Americans with their past, \nwith each other, and with the future of mankind.''\n  Thanksgiving has become one of America's oldest and most beloved \nholidays. It is one of our most important holidays. It has become a day \ndevoted to turkey, mashed potatoes, and cranberries. I can tell these \npages to savor that day when they can meet at mom's house and have all \nthese goodies. They are not going to Shoney's or some other restaurant. \nThey are going to eat with mother or grandmother, with their parents, \nwith their brothers, with their families.\n  It has become a day devoted to turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberries, \nfamily togetherness, football games, parades, and the beginning of the \nChristmas holiday season. But it also remains a day that should be \ndevoted to God and country because it always has been.\n  During the American Revolution, following the important American \nvictory over the British at the Battle of Saratoga in October 1777, \nwhich marked a turning point in the war, the Continental Congress \napproved a resolution proclaiming December 1 as a day of ``Thanksgiving \nand praise.'' You see, our fathers did not forget. Our fathers and \nmothers remembered the great God of heaven. They remembered the God who \nhad watched over them through that perilous trek across the deep waters \nand had protected them in their homes and the forests, had provided \nfood and sustenance for them. They remembered. They gave thanks to him.\n  Following the establishment of the new Government of the United \nStates in 1789, President George Washington issued a ``Thanksgiving \nProclamation'' designating Thursday, November 26, as a ``day of public \nthanks-giving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful \nhearts the many favors of Almighty God.'' This is George Washington. \nThis isn't Robert Byrd. This is George Washington, our first President, \nthe greatest of all, George Washington. ``By acknowledging with \ngrateful hearts,'' he said, ``the many favors of Almighty God, \nespecially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a \nform of government for their safety and happiness.'' Those were George \nWashington's words. At President Washington's request, Americans \nassembled in churches on the appointed day and thanked God for his \nblessings.\n  One thing, if I forget all else, that I will always remember about \nPresident Eisenhower is this: In his first inaugural address, he, \nDwight D. Eisenhower, prayed. In his first inaugural address, President \nEisenhower prayed. I shall never forget that, and I shall never fail to \nhonor him for that. Dwight D. Eisenhower prayed a prayer in his first \ninaugural address.\n\n  During the American Civil War, following the bloody battle of \nGettysburg that marked a turning point in that war, President Abraham \nLincoln asked the people of the United States to set\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\naside the last Thursday of November ``as a day of thanksgiving and \npraise to our beneficent Father.'' This was Lincoln, not Robert Byrd. \n``In the midst of a civil war of unequal magnitude and severity,'' \nPresident Lincoln proclaimed the country should take a day to \nacknowledge--listen to his words--the ``gracious gifts of the most high \nGod, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins, hath \nnevertheless remembered in mercy.''\n  Two towering Presidents, Washington and Lincoln, humbled themselves \nto call upon God's name and to give him thanks.\n  This year, as was 1863, has been a year of tragedy and adversity for \nour Nation. We again find ourselves at war. Because of this, on this \nThanksgiving, as in 1863, there will be too many empty chairs at the \ntable. Nevertheless, as in 1863, we should recognize that there is so \nmuch for which to be thankful.\n  While I recognize that today, as in 1863, we live in a time of \nuncertainty and danger, we should all be thankful that the American \npeople have the steadfastness and the determination to move forward.\n  While I recognize that many young American men and women will spend \nthis holiday in harm's way protecting our country and protecting the \nvalues we hold dear, we can all be thankful we do have the best, the \nbravest, and the most determined Armed Forces--and always have had--in \nthe world, Armed Forces that are now fighting the scourge of terrorism. \nI am thankful we live in a country that can confront a crisis with \nstrength and moral certainty, without forcing us to abandon the very \nprinciples and values that we hold most dear.\n  Like President Washington, I am thankful for ``the many favors of \nAlmighty God,'' including a government that ensures our ``safety and \nhappiness.''\n  Like President Lincoln, I am thankful for the ``gracious gifts of the \nmost high God, who, while dealing with us in anger for our sins''--and \nthere are many--``hath nevertheless remembered mercy.''\n  Finally, I am thankful for those men and women, who, 381 years ago, \nhad the courage, the faith, and the devotion to God to challenge the \nmost difficult and dangerous of journeys and face the darkest unknown. \nThey left friends and homes and warm hearths to launch out upon a \ndangerous, deep journey, led and guided only by the faith they had in a \nhigher power and a desire to create a new home where they could go to \nthe church of their choice. Thank God for them.\n  On this Thanksgiving, let us remember:\n\n     Our fathers in a wondrous age,\n       Ere yet the Earth was small,\n       Ensured to us an heritage,\n       And doubted not at all\n       That we, the children of their heart,\n       Which then did beat so high,\n       In later time should play like part\n       For our posterity.\n       Then fretful murmur not they gave\n       So great a charge to keep,\n       Nor dream that awestruck time shall save\n       Their labour while we sleep.\n       Dear-bought and clear, a thousand year\n       Our fathers' title runs.\n       Make we likewise their sacrifice,\n       Defrauding not our sons.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11896-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11896-S11899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SIGNIFICANT STRATEGIC ISSUES\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished leader--and \nhe is still my leader--the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, on his speech and his remembrance relative to \nThanksgiving.\n  I also rise to compliment him on his speech that I only heard in my \noffice relating to strategic doctrine and strategic weapons. Quite \nfrankly, I am a little embarrassed. I thought he was going to make the \nThanksgiving speech first. I wished to be here for his comments on what \nis going on now in Crawford, TX, with President Bush and President \nPutin.\n  Today, I think we all agree we have an opportunity to reach a \nreasonable agreement with the Russians on the three most significant \nstrategic issues of our day: missile defense, strategic arms \nreductions, and nonproliferation. Senator Byrd and I and others have \nhad a chance to meet with Mr. Putin in a larger group. Based on private \ndiscussions with him and on reports of what he has said in his meetings \nwith President Bush, it seems as though genuine progress has been made \nin the summit this week between President Bush and President Putin.\n  I respectfully suggest--and I believe the President would probably \nagree--that much more needs to be done. It seems to me that, in \nconjunction with what Senator Byrd said earlier, it is vital for us to \ncontinue to make progress, and it is equally vital that the United \nStates refrain from actions that would make further agreements on these \nvital issues difficult, if not impossible.\n  President Bush has made clear--in the ten months since he has been \nPresident--his determination to proceed on the development of a limited \nmissile defense system, despite any limitations in the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty of 1972. Now, we have had very conflicting accounts from \nhis representatives in the administration before the Intelligence \nCommittee, the Armed Services Committee, and the Foreign Relations \nCommittee as to whether or not they were ``prepared to break out of the \nABM treaty'' based on planned testing, or needed testing, to further \ndetermine the feasibility of a limited missile defense.\n  But one thing has come through consistently: President Bush has \nstated his determination to do whatever it takes to develop a limited \nmissile defense. Obviously, Russian officials have heard him, and they \nunderstand his determination to proceed.\n  But--and it is a big but--President Putin, in his discussion with \nsome of us Senators and in his public statements, has made it clear \nthat he still considers the ABM Treaty a critical element in the \nagreements that govern strategic relations between the United States \nand his country.\n  President Bush and President Putin seem to have achieved a personal \nrapport over the last 6 months that bolsters President Putin's \nconfidence that we mean no harm to Russia. I have said before, somewhat \nfacetiously but only somewhat, that as a student of history--although \nnot to the extent of my friend from West Virginia, and I mean that \nseriously--I cannot think of any Russian leader, other than a tsar \nPeter the Great, who looked further west than this gentleman, Mr. \nPutin, seems to be looking.\n  He seems to have made a very fundamental and significant decision \nthat the future of his country lies in the West. He has taken some \npolitical chances at home. How significant they are, we do not know, \nbut nonetheless, he has, to use the vernacular, stiffed both the browns \nand the reds, the nationalists and the former Communists, in making \nsuch a dramatic statement about his intentions to live and thrive in \nthe West. He has even dismantled Russia's listening post in Cuba as a \ndemonstration of the lack of feeling of hostility toward the United \nStates.\n  I will say that President Bush has succeeded in communicating to the \nPresident of Russia that we mean no harm; that the Cold War is over. In \nfact, Secretary Powell said in Asia that the post-Cold War is also \nover. This is the opportunity for a fundamental new beginning. But the \nbeginning does not necessarily mean the end, and clearly to Putin it \ndoes not mean the end, to the ABM Treaty. President Putin appears to \nhave internalized President Bush's assertion that he is not an enemy \nand that Russia is not an enemy--but President Putin is still unwilling \nto bend the ABM Treaty.\n  He is willing, however, to let the United States proceed with the \ntesting and development of missile defense, so long as the ABM Treaty \nremains in force. That seems to me to be a sensible arrangement.\n  The part that gets difficult is the part to which the Senator from \nWest Virginia spoke. If, in fact, we are, in practical terms, about to \namend the ABM Treaty--this is a government with equal branches--that is \nsomething about which we in the Senate get to have a say. We should be \nin on that deal, as Russell Long used to say. That is a deal we should \nbe in on.\n  I am very happy the President appears not to be intent at this moment \non withdrawing from the ABM Treaty,\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\nwhich I think would be a tragic mistake--not only substantively as it \nrelates to arms control but diplomatically as it relates to our \nrelations around the world. I am anxious to hear what the President has \nin mind, however, in terms of how, in effect, to ratify--not in the \nconstitutional sense, necessarily--but how to ratify whatever agreement \nhe reaches with Mr. Putin.\n  If I am not mistaken, my friend from West Virginia said that \nPresident Bush said--and I recall President Bush saying this, but I am \nparaphrasing--we can do this on a handshake.\n  Handshakes are great--and I admire and I trust the President's \nresolve and I trust his sense of honor and I believe he means what he \nsays and will stick to it when he shakes hands. I am even prepared to \nacknowledge that is probably true with President Putin as well--but a \nhandshake is not the stuff upon which these kinds of agreements should \nrest ultimately.\n  The goal of our policy should not be to withdraw from the ABM Treaty, \nas some continue to urge. I think they miss the point. The goal should \nbe to maximize our national security interests rather than to win some \ndebating point over the relevance of arms control agreements in this \npost-cold-war era.\n  With regard to strategic weapons, President Bush announced this week \nthat the United States will reduce its force level over the next 10 \nyears to somewhere between 1,700 and 2,200 deployed warheads.\n  The devil is in the details--for example, ``deployed warheads.'' To \ndate, I have not gotten an explanation of what is going to happen with \n``all the other warheads,''--roughly 4,000 additional warheads, not \njust ours, but the Russians' as well, because President Putin promised \nto do the same thing, to cut his forces as well. I assume--and this is \na little premature--but I assume he is also talking about ``deployed'' \nnuclear weapons, as opposed to all the nuclear weapons in your \npossession.\n  That is excellent progress as far as it goes, Mr. President, and I do \nnot mean to sound as if I am trying to rain on the President's parade. \nI think what he is doing is very helpful. Now, though, it seems to me--\nand obviously to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee--\nPresidents Bush and Putin should agree on a means by which they can \nverify that each country is complying with its promise.\n  Even if the Lord Almighty came down and stood in the well of the \nSenate and said: I guarantee to all you Senators and all America and \nall the world that both Putin and Bush will keep their agreements, that \nwould not be quite good enough for me. God willing, Presidents Bush and \nPutin will remain healthy, and I am sure President Bush expects to \nremain in power for 4 years beyond his term. But it may be that he will \nnot be President in 3 years, and Mr. Putin may not be President in 3 \nyears. For great countries to have such fundamental decisions rest upon \npersonal assurances between two honorable men is not sufficient--not \nbecause the men are not honorable, not because they are not intent on \nkeeping their promises, but because they are not immortal; they are not \ngoing to be around forever.\n  It seems to me they should make sure, whatever each side is \npromising, that it is able to be determined with some objectivity. This \nwould avoid significant misunderstandings of the sort that, I remind my \ncolleagues, have plagued us in the past regarding the Russian promises \non tactical nuclear weapons made a decade ago.\n  U.S. force planners benefit from predictability in Russian strategic \nforces. The more we know about what is going on in the Russian nuclear \nforce posture, the easier it is to determine how we should deal with \nthem, how we should counter them. With a handshake, all we know is what \nPresident Putin says to the press or in private to President Bush. That \nis all we know. With a written agreement, we have specific commitments. \nU.S.-Russian relations will benefit from knowing what each has \npromised--and what we and they have not promised.\n  I go back to the promises made by both Presidents Gorbachev and \nYeltsin. In fact, what happened was that Gorbachev and Yeltsin made an \nagreement they intended to keep, and they may, in fact, have kept it.\n  In January of this year, I remind my colleagues, some of our friends \nwho do not like arms control agreements and were much less trusting of \nRussia than they seem to be today raised questions over whether Russia \nhad violated its 1991 and 1992 promises to cut back on tactical nuclear \nweapons. That was an issue before this body in the beginning of this \nyear, discussed in this town among the nuclear theologians, discussed \nin this town among those interested in strategic doctrine and strategic \nweapons. Had the Russians kept their promise?\n  Part of the problem was that people were not sure what Gorbachev or \nYeltsin had actually promised to do. That was part of the problem.\n  Verification obviously helps. Without a formal agreement of some \nsort, however, generally one does not get verification.\n  The allegation in January of 2001 was that Russia was storing nuclear \nweapons in Kaliningrad and people wanted to inspect those sites. We \nheard some concern from my friends, saying the Russians have these \nmissiles hidden in barns and they took them out of silos but they have \nthem on rail, and on and on, trying to demonstrate a short 8 months ago \nthat we cannot trust the Russians.\n  It caused a bit of a furor because one of the arguments concerning \nwhy we should do away with the ABM Treaty was that we ought to do away \nwith this treaty because the Russians do not keep these treaties, and \nLord only knows what they are doing, and we have to build this national \nmissile defense. That was only in January of this year.\n  But when people suggested that we inspect those sites--because we \nthought, as some asserted, they had stored nuclear weapons there--there \nwere no grounds to request the inspection, let alone demand one, \nbecause there was no agreement attendant to the promise of Gorbachev \nand Yeltsin to, in fact, allow for verification.\n  Why do I bring this up? To say the Russians cannot be trusted? No.\n  What happens is that when there is doubt about issues such as nuclear \nweapons, people always err on the side of the worst case because we \nalmost cannot afford not to--because if we are wrong, we are, no pun \nintended, dead wrong; we are really wrong.\n  So what happened as a consequence of the January dispute about \nwhether or not they had kept their 1991 promise? What happened was it \nbred mistrust. Remember all the articles that occurred in January and \nFebruary and March and actually began during the last campaign? This \nadministration got off to an incredibly rocky start with Russia.\n  The President has made that right, and I compliment him for it, but \nnow we have stalled. We have sort of stumbled through 9 months of lost \nopportunity.\n  The point is, when there is no independent means to verify--when a \nnew President comes into office, the next President, whoever that is--\nhow does he or she judge whether or not the commitment is being kept? I \npromise he or she will be buffeted on every side by those within the \nDefense Department, the intelligence community and the think-tanks who \nare whispering in his or her ear saying: Hey, they are not keeping the \ndeal.\n  The same problems can and do occur regarding strategic weapons. How \nwill we know if Russia has reduced its weapons numbers? Will it remove \nthem from launchers and silos, or only say that certain weapons are no \nlonger operational? How will we know? That was the basis of a big \ndebate not too long ago, I remind my friend--although I do not have to \nremind my friend--from West Virginia. That was the basis of a big \ndebate.\n  How are we going to know? What is Russia really promising to do? The \nonly misunderstanding that is worse than one that was intended is one \nthat was unintended. Maybe they are going to be keeping their word, but \nhow will we know?\n  I promise, there will be many voices questioning whether the Russians \nare keeping the agreement, and if there is no independent means to \nverify it, our questioning then breeds distrust as to whether or not \nthe Americans really are looking for a way out: Are they really with \nus? Did they really mean to enter into this?\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\n  What is Russia really promising to do? That, I hope, will be made \nclear, because even that is in question.\n  It is not wise to make assertions that you will reduce weapons to \nbetween 1,700 and 2,200. I guarantee there will be people in this \nChamber saying the Russians really said they would be down to 1,700 by \nsuch and such a date, and there are 2,200.\n  I might add, what is going to happen to those warheads that are not \ndeployed? For that matter, how will Russia or the American people know \nif the United States reduces its arms? What are we promising to do? Are \nwe promising to destroy the weapons, as the START agreements require us \nto do, such that when we get the force numbers down, we get rid of the \nrest? Or are we only promising we will decommission them in the sense \nthat we will put them in a barn, we will put them in a hangar, able to \nbe reloaded, but we are not going to have them on station and targeted \nsomewhere?\n  Will Russia change its training doctrine in the absence of a formal \ntreaty? I remind people when Gorbachev and Yeltsin agreed with the \nfirst President Bush to reduce tactical nuclear weapons, they said that \nwithout a formal agreement they could not change Russian training.\n  What does that have to do with anything? Rather than deciding they \nwere going to act as if they had decommissioned the weapons, which they \nsaid they had, what did they do? They continued to train Russian forces \nto make war with the weapons they said were no longer deployed. So what \nthen happened?\n  I am sure my colleagues from West Virginia and Montana and I must \nhave attended intelligence meetings where we would be told the \nfollowing: They said they had decommissioned these weapons, but yet \nlook at the manual; their doctrine still says they are going to plan to \nuse them. So that must mean they have not decommissioned them. How do \nwe know? And yet Gorbachev and Yeltsin had said at the start, without a \nverifiable agreement we are not going to change our manual because we \nmay have to pull those suckers out of storage and use them if you guys \nturn out not to keep your side of the deal.\n  What will we do? Will we, too, train our troops to make war with \nweapons we say are no longer deployed? Will other countries take heart \nbecause we have fewer deployed weapons, or will they look at our total \nstockpile and say that our reductions are a sham?\n  Again, I have no doubt that President Bush will keep his word and do \nthe right thing, but we cannot, in my view, expect other countries to \nhave as much trust in us as we have in ourselves.\n  I will never forget the first time I was sent by the man who is now \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and who was then the \nleader of the U.S. Senate--he may remember--asked me as a relatively \nyoung Senator in 1979, when the SALT II agreement was under \nconsideration, to lead a group of new Senators who were uncertain about \nwhether or not they were for this new arms control agreement. It was in \nthe face of this scare that the Russians had bases in Cuba, and we were \ntrying to push the treaty through. The Carter administration wanted it. \nI led a delegation of 10 or 12 Senators--great Senators who are no \nlonger in the Senate, Bradley, Boren, Pryor, and a number of others, \nbecause they were just elected that year. We sat down with Leonid \nBrezhnev, who was the Russian President at the time. Brezhnev came into \ntheir Cabinet room. We were all on one side, and Brezhnev and Kosygin \non the other side, and it opened the following way: He welcomed us. We \nhad contemporaneous translation.\n  Brezhnev looked at me, and he said: ``Let's get two things straight, \nSenator. The first thing is, when I was your age I had an important \njob.'' He went on to tell me his job, along with Kosygin, was to supply \nLeningrad in the siege of Leningrad, making it clear ``you are a young \nman, Senator.'' He wanted me to know he had been important for a long \ntime. I got the message.\n  The second thing he said, and this is literally what he said: ``Let's \nagree that we do not trust each other, and we have good reason not to \ntrust each other.''\n  He went on to say: ``You Americans believe, with every fiber of your \nbeing, that you would never use nuclear weapons.'' You believe you \nwould never use them against us first. But I hope you understand why we \nthink you might.\n\n  Then he went on to say: ``You are the only nation in the history of \nmankind that has ever used nuclear weapons. You used them against \ncivilian populations.''\n  He quickly added: ``I am not second-guessing that, but you used them. \nSo you have to understand we might think you might use them again.''\n  A point well taken. No matter how well intended either side is, we \ncannot expect other nations to trust our resolve as much as we trust \nour resolve. So if we want others to trust us and we want to be able to \ntrust Russia in the years to come, we should remember Ronald Reagan's \nadvice: Trust but verify.\n  I am encouraged by President Bush's statement, following his force \nreductions announcement: If we need to write it down on a piece of \npaper, I would be glad to do that.\n  He should. I hope he will. I also hope that piece of paper comes our \nway for us to take a look at. A new START III treaty would not be \ndifficult to draft. It would ensure not only rigorous verification but \nalso proper respect for the constitutional role of the Senate regarding \ninternational agreements.\n  There are also grounds for hope regarding the problem of \nproliferation and Russia's relations with Iraq and Iran. For the first \ntime, Russians are saying there is no longer a strategic rationale for \nputting trade above nonproliferation in Russia's relations with Iran \nand Iraq. The question now is money. It is not a question of Russia's \nplace in the world. That place is clearly with us in the West and in \nopposition to proliferation.\n  We and our allies can provide the money that Russia needs to maintain \neconomic growth and well-being, in return for new Russian policies and \nactions that refrain from proliferating weapons in that part of the \nworld.\n  We can offer Russia debt relief on its Soviet-era obligations to the \nUnited States and other countries. Russia could use a significant \nproportion of the proceeds of that debt relief on non-proliferation \nprograms to secure its sensitive materials and to provide new, civilian \ncareers for its many weapons scientists who could otherwise become prey \nto offers from rogue states or terrorist groups.\n  Senator Lugar of Indiana and I have encouraged the Administration to \nconsider this option. We also have legislation to authorize such debt \nrelief, which the Foreign Relations Committee has approved unanimously.\n  The U.N. could authorize a major increase in the Iraqi Oil for Food \nprogram--which would revitalize Iraq's oil production infrastructure--\nin return for devoting the proceeds to payment of Iraq's foreign debt, \nespecially its debt to Russia. That would free Russia to pursue the \nissue of United Nations inspections on the basis of strategic concerns \nalone.\n  Senators Domenici and Lugar propose that we provide loan guarantees \nto Russia in return for Russia reducing its fissile material \nstockpiles.\n  Missile defense, strategic arms and non-proliferation affect not only \nRussia and the United States, but the future of the whole world. The \nopportunities for U.S.-Russian cooperation--if we seize them--hold the \npromise of a transformed world in which international cooperation is \nthe norm, with Russia and the United States leading the way.\n  But we must seize those opportunities.\n  And we must not waste those opportunities by engaging in purely \nideological actions, like withdrawing from the ABM Treaty when there is \nno rational need to do that.\n  I conclude by saying that I compliment my friend from West Virginia \nwho is, as usual, the first person to come to the floor and speak to \nthis issue. It is vitally important. I hope the President and the \nadministration listen to his advice. I think he is dead right.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware for his statement. I well remember in 1987, with respect to \nthe INF\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\nTreaty, the Reagan administration sought to reinterpret the provisions \nof the ABM Treaty--to reinterpret those provisions because the Reagan \nadministration did not want to live up to the ABM Treaty. They wanted \nto get away from that ABM Treaty. There were some people in that \nadministration who sought to reinterpret the ABM Treaty. But as we \nprepared for the subsequent approval by this U.S. Senate of the \nratification of the INF Treaty, the distinguished Senator from Delaware \nwas adamant in insisting that there be an amendment written to provide \nthat there be no reinterpretation of any treaty by a subsequent \nadministration; that the treaty had to be interpreted based on the four \ncorners of the treaty plus interpretation of the treaty as explained by \nwitnesses of the administration in power at the time the treaty was \nratified. Any new understanding would have to be agreed upon by the \nexecutive branch and the legislative branch.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware rendered a great service in \nthat instance, as did the then-Senator from Georgia, Mr. Nunn, who was \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee; the then-Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Boren, who was chairman of the Intelligence Committee; \nand the then-chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Pell.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Those three Senators and I insisted on having it in writing \nfrom the Soviets. And Secretary of State Shultz went to--I guess it was \nParis--went to Europe, at least, and worked with Mr. Shevardnadze, I \nbelieve, and came back with a document in writing saying that all \nparties agreed that that would be the interpretation, that there would \nnot be any subsequent reinterpretation by any administration, any \nsubsequent President. Because if that were the case, how could we ever \ndepend upon any treaty as having credibility, if a subsequent \nadministration could reinterpret it according to its own wishes?\n\n  How would a subsequent administration interpret an ``understanding'' \nthat was entered into by a handshake? All the more reasons for wanting \nto see it in writing and having it debated by the elected \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, to reaffirm what the Senator says, I do not \nthink anyone should read in this that the Senator from West Virginia \nand I aren't happy that the President wants to bring down the number of \nnuclear weapons.\n  Mr. BYRD. No.\n  Mr. BIDEN. We are very supportive of that. We want to make sure when \nit is done, it is done.\n  Mr. BYRD. It is done.\n  Mr. BIDEN. And we know it is done.\n  I thank the Senator and I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank \nSenator Baucus for his kindness in allowing us to proceed.\n  Mr. BYRD. I join in the thanks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from West \nVirginia as well as the Senator from Delaware. They as well as many \nothers over the years have provided terrific service to our country, \nkeeping their eye on this ball with respect to the former Soviet Union, \ncurrent Russia, and the key question of nuclear proliferation. I thank \nthem very much. On behalf of the American people, I thank them, too.\n  The Senator has done a terrific job.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, let me say I am deeply appreciative, and I \nthank the very able Senator from Montana for his observations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11899-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        WTO MINISTERIAL MEETING\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the just-concluded \nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial in Doha, Qatar.\n  The administration has announced that WTO members reached an \nagreement to launch new negotiations on a number of international trade \ntopics. Our trade negotiations hailed this as a major victory.\n  I recognize the considerable efforts of our trade negotiators in this \nprocess. That said, I am unsettled by the results of this session in \nseveral areas.\n  The agreement reached today in Doha makes it even more clear why \nCongress must have deeper involvement in our international trade \npolicy.\n  Without a doubt, there are positive items in the documents to launch \nthe negotiation. I am pleased that the United States was able to \nnegotiate forward-looking language on agriculture. There are some good \nthings there--for example, goals of improving market access and \nreducing market distortions, particularly export subsidies.\n  But these are vague commitments, and Europe and some of its allies \nhave already demonstrated their strident opposition to meaningful \nprogress in this area. The devil is in the details--and the details \nhave yet to be worked out.\n  On the other side of the ledger, I am extremely troubled by the \ndecision to re-open the agreements reached just a few years ago on \nantidumping and anti-subsidy measures. Both Houses of Congress have \nmade it clear that they oppose negotiations to further weaken U.S. \ntrade laws.\n  Let's be absolutely clear on this point. Our trading partners have \nonly one goal here: to weaken our trade laws. That is something the \nadministration should not tolerate--and that Congress will not \ntolerate.\n  These problems demonstrate why Congress must take a hard look at \ntrade negotiations. The Constitution assigns responsibility for \ninternational trade to the Congress. Yet the administration is now \nacting without a mandate from Congress.\n  Congress must have a more prominent role in trade negotiations. As \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, I plan oversight hearings on \nthese negotiations.\n  The problems I have outlined also make clear why any new grant of \nfast track negotiating authority must address the concerns of Congress \non issues like preservation of U.S. trade laws. It must also ensure \nthat Congress has an active role in trade negotiations.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11899-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11899-S11900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE STIMULUS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, let me talk just for a moment about \ninternational trade because there has been a trade conference in Doha, \nQatar. I expect the people who run the WTO chose that place largely \nbecause they did not want to have a trade conference where there were a \nlot of hotel rooms. Experiences in trade conferences in recent years \nhave not been good. Thousands and thousands of people from around the \nworld have come to demonstrate and express concerns about one thing or \nanother. So they decided to have a ministerial conference in Doha. My \nunderstanding is there are so few hotel rooms in Doha that they had to \nbring in cruise ships in order to provide lodging for visitors to Doha.\n  Because of other business this week, I didn't pay a lot of attention \nto what they did at Doha.\n  I do know that all these trade folks converged and they had a long \nvisit. I watched part of a similar visit in Montreal some years ago. I \nwatched part of the visit they had in Seattle. So I know they all get \ntogether. They have the same backgrounds, and they talk the same \nlanguage. They actually have shorthand for all the trade lingo that \nthey develop. Apparently now, from the experience of recent days in \nDoha, they have decided they have reached some agreements on a new \nround, and so forth.\n  So I want to point out just a couple of concerns I have about where \nwe are with international trade.\n  I have a chart that shows a series of balloons that represent the \nvery serious trade problem confronting us in this country. It is a \ntrade deficit that is ballooning, year after year after year. It is the \nlargest trade deficit in human history.\n  We spend a lot of time worrying about the fiscal policy budget \ndeficit that about 9 years ago was almost $300 billion a year. There \nwas hand wringing and teeth gnashing and people wiping their brow, and \nthey would come to the floor of the Senate, saying they wanted to \nchange the Constitution, they wanted to do this and that. Why? Because \nwe had this growing budget deficit, this tumor that was growing in the \nfiscal policy of this country. It was going to hurt this country.\n  It is interesting that there is a deafening silence in this country \nabout the trade deficit. It, too, is growing, much more rapidly, in \nmany ways, than the fiscal policy deficit did. It is much higher at \nthis point than our budget deficit was at its height. One can make the \ncase, as an economist, that the budget deficit is something we owe to \nourselves. This deficit we owe to others. This deficit will ultimately \nbe repaid by a lower standard of living in the United States.\n  My point is, this deficit is growing and growing and growing. After \nround after round of trade negotiations, we are in worse and worse \nshape. The question is, why?\n  It is interesting, if you ask economists, they all give you different \nanswers: It is because the dollar is too strong; the dollar is too \nweak; it is because our budget deficit is too high, not high enough; \nproductivity isn't high enough. It depends on the economist that you \nask.\n  Having both studied and taught economics in college, I understand \nthat the field of economics is certainly not a science. I consider it \npsychology pumped up with just a little bit of helium. All you have to \ndo is ask, and you get an answer. It does not mean it is an informed \nanswer. There are 100 different answers as to why our deficit is out of \ncontrol. Ask any economist. They don't have the foggiest idea. We had a \n$449 billion merchandise trade deficit last year in this country.\n  Now let me describe some of the details of trade. It is interesting \nthat everybody talking about trade, especially those at the ministerial \nconferences, want to talk about the big picture: global trade. They \nnever want to the talk about specifics. So here is a specific.\n  We trade with Korea, which is a good friend of ours. This chart shows \nthat last year Korea sent 570,000 automobiles to the United States to \nbe sold in the United States. Do you know how many automobiles the \nUnited States sent to be sold in Korea? Was it 570,000? No, not quite. \nThe answer: 1,700. So 570,000 cars coming our way and then we were able \nto export 1,700 cars to Korea. Get a Ford Mustang convertible here in \nthe United States, send it to Korea, and it costs twice as much for \na Korean consumer. Why? Because Korea does not want our cars. They do \nnot want our cars coming in and competing. They have all kinds of \nmechanisms and devices to discourage our ability to move a car to \nKorea. The result is, 570,000 Korean cars in the United States; 1,700 \nUnited States cars to Korea. Fair trade? I don't think so.\n\n  Is that something we ought to correct? In my judgment, it is because \nthese numbers translate to jobs. A working family, a man or a woman \ngetting a job on an assembly line in a manufacturing plant, a job that \npays well, a job with security, a job with benefits, these are good \njobs. This means we export these jobs to other countries that produce \nproducts and send them to us and then keep their market closed to our \nproducts, which means fewer manufacturing jobs in the United States.\n  I have another chart I did not bring to the Chamber. It shows T-bone \nsteaks in Tokyo. Do you know that 12 years after the last beef \nagreement we reached with Japan, the conclusion of which resulted in \nfeasting and rejoicing by everyone engaged in the trade negotiations--\nyou would have thought they just won the gold medal in the Olympics. \nThe headlines trumpeted the beef agreement with Japan. What a wonderful \nagreement. Twelve years later, by the way, every pound of American beef \nsent to Japan has a 38.5-percent tariff attached to it--every single \npound. Is that fair trade with Japan? No. Fair trade would be more T-\nbone steaks to Tokyo, in my judgment. But we have a 38.5-percent tariff \non every single pound.\n  Going back to Korea: What about potato flakes to Korea? Up in my part \nof the country, in the Red River Valley, where the Presiding Officer \nalso represents some potato growers, those potatoes are cut into \nflakes. Those potato flakes are sent around the world, and they are put \ninto chips in fast food. Potato flakes are used for fast food. Well, \nthat is probably a pejorative. I shouldn't say ``fast food.'' I should \nsay ``snacks.'' Potato flakes are used for snacks.\n  If you raise a potato in the Red River Valley and then turn it into \npotato flakes and send it to Korea, guess what happens to it? Korea \nslaps a 300-percent tariff on potato flakes.\n  Are potato flakes going to threaten the Korean food market? I do not \nthink so. Is it fair to an American potato farmer to confront a 300-\npercent tariff? Where I live, it is not fair.\n  I could spend a lot of time talking about these things.\n  China: We have a huge trade deficit with China. We also have a huge \ntrade deficit with Japan. We have a big deficit with Europe. We have a \nhuge deficit with Canada and Mexico. But China, we sent 12 American \nmovies into China in the last year. Why? That is all China would let \ninto their country, 12 movies. Fair trade? I don't think so.\n  Or how about this? In the last trade agreement we negotiated with \nChina, we sent our negotiators to China. Now, presumably, these are the \nbest negotiators we have. We sent them to China. I do not know how we \nsent them there, probably not on a slow boat, as the saying goes; \nprobably in an airplane.\n  They got to China and negotiated a bilateral agreement with China, \nwhich was the precursor to allowing China to join the WTO. They brought \nback the bilateral agreement, which we did not vote on because we do \nnot have a vote on a bilateral trade agreement with China. Guess what \nwe discovered?\n  Let me give you an example. Automobiles: After a long phase-in, we \nhave decided--our negotiators agreed with the Chinese negotiators--we \nwould have a 2.5 tariff on Chinese vehicles being sent into the United \nStates, and China could have a 25-percent tariff on the United States \nvehicles sent to China. In other words, our negotiators sat down with \nthe Chinese, with whom we had a $60 billion deficit, and we said to \nthem: OK, we will agree to this deal. You go ahead and impose a tariff \non U.S. cars sent to China that is 10 times higher than the tariff we \nwill impose on any Chinese cars you send to the United States, and we \nwill sign that agreement. That is what our negotiators said. So that is \nour agreement.\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\n  I don't know, my feeling is these negotiators need to wear jerseys. \nThey do in the Olympics. The jerseys should say: USA. At least they \ncould look down, from time to time, and understand on whose behalf they \nare negotiating. They can say: Oh, yeah, that is who I represent. That \nis whose interests I represent, and not be bashful about standing up \nfor our economic interests.\n  By what justification ever should we agree to this sort of one-sided \nagreement: T-bones in Tokyo, automobiles to Korea, potato flakes to \nKorea, high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico, durum wheat to Canada. I \ncould tell stories for an hour about this. In each and every \ncircumstance, it is this country signing up to a trade agreement that \nis fundamentally bad for our producers.\n  Our durum growers. I should, just for therapeutic purposes, spend 15 \nminutes to talk about unfair durum trade coming to us from the Canadian \nWheat Board, which would be an illegal entity in this country, a state-\nsponsored monopoly that sends durum wheat into this country to undercut \nAmerican farmers' prices, and then thumbs their nose at us when we say \nwe want to see the prices at which you are selling because we believe \nthey are violating our trade laws. I could spend a long time talking \nabout that, about the day I went to the Canadian border with Earl \nJensen in a 12-year-old, orange, 2-ton truck.\n  All the way to the Canadian border we met 18-wheel trucks carrying \nCanadian durum south into the United States.\n  So we got to the Canadian border, after meeting truck after truck, \nbringing Canadian durum south. We had 200 bushels of durum in Earl's \nlittle, orange truck, and the Canadians said: No, you can't come into \nCanada with 200 bushels of durum. Why not? Just because you can't. It \nis just the way life is. It is a one-way track across that border with \ndurum wheat.\n  I will not go on further. I know my colleague wants to speak. That is \nall a precursor to say this.\n  My colleague, Senator Byrd, the other day, spoke about trade \nprotection authority or fast track. In my judgment, what we ought to do \nis decide that we are going to stand up for this county's economic \ninterests in international trade.\n  Don't give anybody any fast-track trade authority. Say, go negotiate \nsome good trade agreements, bring them back here, and we will sign up \nto vote for them. First thing in the morning, count us as supporters. \nGo negotiate bad agreements, which you have done time and time and time \nagain, and understand they won't see the light of day here because we \nare sick and tired of it.\n  I will not support fast track. We have been fast-tracked right into a \nhuge hole, a trade deficit that has ballooned now to a $450 billion \nmerchandise trade deficit. I will not support fast track.\n  I agree with my colleagues, Senator Byrd and others: We need expanded \ntrade. There is no question about that. I want to see global markets \nthat are fair. I want to see opportunity for our farmers and our \nmanufacturers around the world. But I also demand that we see trade \nagreements that step forward and protect this country's interests \nrequiring fair trade. It is not fair trade with respect to movies in \nChina, durum in Canada, high-fructose corn syrup with Mexico, cars in \nKorea, potato flakes in Korea and Mexico. It is not fair trade with \nautos in China. None of that is fair trade. There ought not be anybody \nwho is nervous or worried about standing up and demanding fair trade \nwith our trading partners around the world.\n  I have not spent much time on this, but I intend to in the coming \ndays, if the House and the administration, buoyed by the success in \nDoha, Qatar, decide they want to try to bring enhanced trade authority \nto the Senate.\n  There is no problem at all negotiating trade agreements without fast \ntrack. The last administration wanted fast track. They didn't get it. \nBut they said they negotiated 300 trade agreements. That means you can \nnegotiate trade agreements without fast track. You just need to be \ncareful to negotiate good ones because if you don't, you won't get them \nthrough the House and Senate.\n  The inability to have fast track actually promotes more \nresponsibility on the part of those who are required to negotiate these \ntrade agreements.\n  I wanted to follow on the remarks of Senator Byrd of 2 days ago on \nthe subject of fast track. He and I and others will work very hard to \ntry to see if we can't make some sense out of this mess, this trade \nproblem that is now choking this country with very large trade deficits \nand is destroying manufacturing jobs and injuring this economy. We can \ndo better than that even as we expand opportunities, even as we expand \ninternational trade. We can do better than that by standing up for \nfairness for American producers and farmers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I did not intend to speak on this subject, \nbut since the Senator from North Dakota has raised it, it is important \nto put all of this in perspective. Matters could be much better, but \nthey are not quite as bleak as outlined by my good friend from North \nDakota, not in my judgment. It is clear that other countries still \nintend to take greater advantage of America in trade matters than we do \nof them.\n  We are a country of the world. There are other countries of the \nworld. We have our views. They have their views. We have our social \nstructure. They have theirs. It is incumbent upon us to find a way to \nbe effective in protecting our American interests.\n  Because the Senator from North Dakota might find this interesting, I \nwould like to talk about beef, and beef with Japan and Korea, for that \nmatter. I have forgotten how many years ago --it must have been maybe \n10, 12 years ago--Japan had a quota on foreign beef into Japan. It \namounted to, if I recall, about 28,000 tons of hotel/restaurant-cut \nbeef. That is a quota on all beef coming to Japan. That is American, \nAustralian, and Argentine beef. That amounted to one 6-ounce steak per \nJapanese person per year--a very strong, tight quota against American \nbeef sales in Japan.\n  At the same time, we Americans imported considerably more pounds of \nbeef than we exported worldwide. We imported far more beef worldwide--\nlower cut grades for hamburgers and other things--than we exported.\n  I decided I wanted to do something about the problem with Japan. I \ntried everything under the Sun. I remember in the Mike Mansfield Room--\nSenator Mansfield was Ambassador to Japan, very highly regarded, very \nrevered--I said: Why don't I invite the Japanese diplomatic corps up to \nthe Mansfield Room and we will show to them how good Montana beef is. \nWe will do all we can to get that quota reduced or eliminated.\n  That was naive. Nothing happened. I might say, one member of the \nJapanese Parliament had the audacity to say the reason they have a \nquota on foreign beef is that their digestive system can't handle \nforeign beef. It is total nonsense.\n  At the same time, maybe a few years earlier, we had a difficult time \nimporting American skis into Japan, and their excuse then was: Well, \nJapanese snow is a little different. That is why we can't take American \nskis. They were totally ludicrous arguments.\n  I decided I had had it with the Japanese on beef. So I had a press \nconference over in the Hart Building, and about 20 Japanese journalists \nshowed up. I had a button on me. The button said, ``I have a beef with \nJapan.'' And I said to the Japanese, very respectfully, trade has to be \na two-way street. I said: Japan, we take a lot of your products. We \ntake your VCRs, we take your Hondas, we take your Seiko watches, and \nyou don't take our beef. Trade has to be a two-way street. It can't be \none way. As you can see, it is one way. It is not right, and I am going \nto do what I can to stop that.\n  At about that time, there was legislation on the Senate floor called \ndomestic content legislation. That legislation required a certain \npercentage of content, manufacture, and assembly of autos in America to \nbe American content, not foreign. It was domestic content legislation. \nAt that point, I did not favor that legislation. I thought it was too \nprescriptive. It was wage/price controls--too controlling--although I \nagreed with the purport and the direction it was going.\n\n[[Page S11902]]\n\n  I said: If you don't take American beef, I am going to go right to \nthe Senate floor and do all I can to get that domestic content \nlegislation passed because that will be two way; that will be fair.\n  My gosh, I could see scribbling of all kinds of notes, cameras going \non. The next day there was a big article about my statement in the \nJapanese newspapers. My photo was in the Japanese newspapers. I can't \nread Japanese, but I know basically what I had said.\n  Guess what. Within a couple of weeks, the Japanese sat down at the \nbargaining table. Mike Armstrong was our trade negotiator at the time. \nThey needed to negotiate, and they agreed to eliminate that quota \nentirely. But they did replace it with a 70-percent tariff. That is \npretty high, but at least our industry said: That is great; the quota \nis eliminated. We can start importing beef into Japan.\n  I go over to Japan a couple, three times. I know about two words in \nJapanese. I learned this one. It is ``Oishii,'' which means delicious. \nI would stand in front of the Japanese cameras and say: American beef \nis Oishii, delicious. At the same time, a Japanese polling company \nshowed that the Japanese housewives and Japanese citizens of Tokyo \nwanted American beef by far. Under the Japanese constitution, because \nthe rural districts have disproportionate voting power, they want to \nprotect themselves. That is why they had that quota. The quota was \neliminated, replaced with a 70-percent tariff.\n  We also agreed to bring that tariff down. The Senator from North \nDakota says it is now down to around 28 percent. That could well be. It \nis my recollection that eventually that tariff will be down at a lower \nrate. The point is that we have made progress with Japan. We now, by \nthe way, export more beef overseas than we import. That line was \ncrossed about 2 years ago. So there is progress.\n  These things are more complicated than meets the eye. But we \ncertainly have a lot more to do and further to go. As in the Korean \nsituation, Korea had this provision--this was about 2 years ago--called \nthe shelf life law. They wouldn't let boats unload beef products, \ncanned beef, for over 2 weeks. Their distribution system wouldn't let \nforeign beef get to the grocery stores. That was bad beef under Korean \nlaw.\n  The Korean Prime Minister was, for about 2 or 3 months, coming over \nto the United States.\n  So I got ahold of him. I said: Mr. Ambassador, your Prime Minister is \ncoming over. I have a letter signed, with many Senators cosigning who \nare opposed to this. I don't think you want your Prime Minister to come \nover when we are getting up on the Senate floor being critical of \nKorea.\n  He got the message. Within 2 weeks, they repealed the provisions and \nallowed in American beef.\n  So it is important for us to think of how we can get this job done \nand make sure these other countries play fair. If we work well in a \nconcerted effort with the trade negotiators, we can get some things \ndone. But I have also learned deeply that no country altruistically is \ngoing to lower a trade barrier.

The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Since I see the Senator from North Dakota here, I suggest \nthat perhaps we could make our opening statements as part of the 60 \nminutes of debate on the Dorgan-Enzi amendment. If that is agreeable, I \nwould be glad to do that. I move to modify the agreement that we move \nimmediately to the Enzi-Dorgan amendment with the 60 minutes of debate \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withdraw that. I will proceed with my statement. I was \ntrying to save the Senate some time. Obviously, we will take more time \nin discussing whether I was saving the Senate time or not.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nStatement of Administration Policy concerning H.R. 1552, the Internet \nTax Nondiscrimination Act, from the President of the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             H.R. 1552--Internet Tax Nondiscrimination Act\n\n       The Administration supports Senate passage of H.R. 1552. \n     The Administration believes that government should be \n     promoting Internet usage and availability, not discouraging \n     it with access taxes and discriminatory taxes.\n       As passed by the House, H.R. 1552 extends the Internet tax \n     moratorium enacted by the Internet Tax Freedom Act for two \n     years. While a five-year extension would be preferable, a \n     two-year extension will provide additional time to analyze \n     the impact of e-commerce on local and State tax receipts \n     while ensuring that the growth of the Internet is not slowed \n     by new taxes.\n       The moratorium expired on October 21, 2001. The \n     Administration supports rapidly reinstating the moratorium. \n     The Administration encourages the Senate to pass H.R. 1552, \n     without amendment, to enable its expeditious enactment into \n     law.\n\n  It basically says that the administration supports Senate passage of \nH.R. 1552. He concludes by saying that the administration encourages \nthe Senate to pass H.R. 1552, without amendment, to enable its \nexpeditious enactment into law.\n  On Sunday, October 21, the Federal moratorium on Internet taxes \nexpired.\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\nState and local taxing jurisdictions, reportedly over 7,000 of them, \nare now free to tax Internet access, and to impose multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on e-commerce.\n  I strongly support H.R. 1552, which would extend the moratorium by 2 \nyears. This proposal for a simple, short-term extension of the \nmoratorium is supported by diverse interests, including, among many \nothers, the National Conference of State Legislatures, the United \nStates Conference of Mayors the Information Technology Association of \nAmerica, the American Electronics Association, and the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure that has already passed \nthe House of Representatives, and to oppose the Enzi/Dorgan amendment. \nLet me explain why.\n  There is broad consensus that the moratorium on the imposition of \naccess taxes should be extended. This has not been done, however, \nbecause of the separate issue of the collection of sales taxes on \nremote transactions. A number of Senators believe that this separate \nissue must be addressed if the moratorium is extended for more than a \nfew months.\n  State and municipal governments are concerned that they will lose \nsignificant revenue as more and more consumers buy goods on-line. Most \nof these consumers are required by state laws to pay taxes on these \ntransactions, but they seldom do. While the loss of tax revenue from \nremote catalog sales has been of concern to states for many years, the \nprospect of many more untaxed on-line transactions has worried main \nstreet merchants and state and local governments that rely on sales tax \nrevenue to support critical functions including education and emergency \nresponse. Their concerns are legitimate.\n  A group of Senators have tried, literally for years, to address these \nconcerns. Senators Dorgan, Enzi, Kerry, Voinovich, Hutchison, Wyden, \nand Allen, among others, have held countless meetings to try to balance \nconcerns about loss of State and local revenue with concerns about \nimposing unwarranted and perhaps unbearable burdens on remote \ntransactions. I have participated in many of these meetings at which \ncountless drafts of legislation have been circulated, and I have been \ncontinually impressed at how committed, creative, and open to \ncompromise these Senators have been.\n  Unfortunately, however, there is not yet a consensus on if or how \nCongress should permit states to require out-of-state retailers to \ncollect sales taxes on remote transactions. After the events of \nSeptember 11 refocused out efforts, it became clear that we would not \nresolve this issue before the moratorium on Internet taxes expired.\n  While we are much closer to an agreement on legislation relating to \nthe collection of sales taxes we are not yet there. In the past, \nCongress has held protracted debate on the question of Internet taxes. \nAlthough the issue is extraordinarily controversial, we don't have time \nto thoroughly consider the still-divergent proposals. This controversy, \nhowever, should not prevent us from proceeding on the separate, and \nnon-controversial issue of extending the moratorium on Internet access \ntaxes.\n  Just as there is agreement that the moratorium on Internet access \ntaxes should be extended, there is also agreement that state sales \ntaxes must be radically reconciled and simplified to remove both \npractical and legal barriers to remote collection and remission.\n  This simplification, however, has not yet occurred. And it is not the \nFederal Government's responsibility to see that it does.\n  Recognizing the need for simplifications, thirty-two states last year \njoined the Steamlined Sales Tax Project to develop a plan for \nsimplifying remote sales and use tax collection. The National \nConference of State Legislatures has since undertaken to develop model \nlegislation to create uniform definitions and remove the burden on \nretailers of collecting and remitting sales taxes. Next month, the 20 \nstates that have passed legislation this year indicating their intent \nto proceed on sales tax simplification will meet in Salt Lake City to \ndo this.\n  Although these efforts are underway, the simplification is complex \nand will not happen overnight. Reconciling definitions among states of \nwhat is or is not taxable, and resolving the allocation of tax revenues \namong localities within states will not happen in 8 months. Frankly, it \nprobably will not happen in 2 years. Nevertheless, I think that \nsubstantial progress toward simplification can be made in 2 years, and \nCongress will be in a much better position then to determine whether to \nconsent to allowing states to require out-of-state retailers to collect \nand remit sales taxes on remote transactions.\n  In the meantime, I think it is imperative that we extend the \nmoratorium on the separate issue of Internet access taxes.\n  The recent economic success experienced by the United States, the \nlongest economic expansion in U.S. history was due, in part, to the \nInternet. Now the sectors of the economy tied to this vehicle of growth \nare experiencing troubled times and the nation is spiraling into \nrecession. During times of economic uncertainty, we must restrain \nourselves from further burdening an already ailing sector, particularly \none which provides the most promise for successful recovery and further \ngrowth.\n  Prior to September 11, the high tech sector began to suffer dramatic \nlosses. Since the beginning of this year alone, revenue for U.S. \nTechnology sales, including computers, semiconductors, and \ncommunications equipment, had fallen by 35 percent. Mass layoffs \nplagued the sector with 479,199 high tech jobs eliminated since the \nbeginning of the year, 47,250 of which were eliminated in September \nalone.\n  Industry leaders such as AOL, Sun Microsystems, and Intel have seen \nboth stock prices and profits plunge. According to the research firm of \nThomson Financial/First Call the high technology companies on the \nStandard & Poor's 500 are expected to see fourth quarter profits fall \nto 58 percent of last year's levels.\n  This grim picture is expected to decline further, with tech profits \nexpected to fall sharply in the first quarter of 2002, before \nrecovering by the end of next year. Allowing access and multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce will inevitably lead to \nharder times for an ailing industry.\n  We are now faced with the choice, will we allow the Internet tax \nmoratorium to remain expired, further hampering the recovery of the \nhigh tech sector and the entire economy, or will we act now to extend \nthe moratorium and support the recovery of this economy.\n  Again, I reiterate my appreciation to the Senator from North Dakota, \nMr. Dorgan, who has, along with myself, the Senator from Oregon, the \nSenator from Virginia, and others, had countless meetings. We have \ntried to come to an agreement. I believe there will come a time when we \nreach agreement. There will come a time when there are enough States \nthat have come together to come up with a simplified system of sales \ntaxes that can be fair to everybody. But we are not there yet.\n  Other colleagues of mine will make arguments on both sides of this \nissue. I wish we could reach that stage because I am fully aware that \nState and local revenues are being unfairly diverted, or not collected \nbecause of the failure to have any taxes imposed on Internet \ntransactions. But we are not there yet. I believe, particularly at this \ntime when we are in an economic situation that is clearly unpleasant, \nit would not be the time for us to impose taxes on the Internet which \nis already in a state of fragility.\n\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his time. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, who is controlling time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has consumed his 5 \nminutes. There is 5 minutes to the chairman of the Commerce Committee \nand 5 minutes each to the chairman and ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Mr. McCAIN. In other words, there is no time available under the \nunanimous consent agreement, so we would have to move to the amendment \nin order for other Members to speak; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour available on the first-degree \namendment.\n\n[[Page S11904]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. On the amendment. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. \nI suppose the next speaker will then be taking time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the amendment is called up, time will be \navailable on the amendment.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will try to make the best use of those \n5 minutes.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of a simple 2 year extension of \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act. In my judgment, a short-term extension \nrepresents a reasonable, bipartisan compromise.\n  While I support a clean 2-year extension, we should be firm in our \nresolve that this will not be the first of an endless line of \nmoratorium extensions.\n  I make a strong plea that this be the last time we impose a \nmoratorium without taking the meaningful steps needed to bring \ninterstate tax rules into the 21st century.\n  While progress has been made on the issue of sales tax \nsimplification, State and local governments will certainly need more \nthan 6, 12, or even 18 months to come up with a system that works.\n  Moreover, we do not need a quick fix; we need a real solution. Let us \ncontinue to keep the parties at the table long enough to make a \nmeaningful change that works.\n  The debate and negotiations that occur from this point forward must \nbe about resolving issues regarding taxation of the Internet and not \nabout the length of any future extensions.\n  More importantly, the focus must be on how the traditional tax rules \nshould apply to ``new economy'' businesses. These are issues the \nFinance Committee has been and will continue to examine.\n  The States have been working hard to create a model simplified sales \nand use tax system. A limited extension of the moratorium for 2 years \nis needed in order to provide an adequate time to assess their \nprogress.\n  More importantly, as chairman of the Finance Committee I represent \nthe State of Montana, which does not have a sales tax.\n  As a Senator from Montana, I will work to ensure that any \nsimplification plan will not place a undue burden on Montana \nbusinesses. Sales tax simplification should also be truly simple, and \neasy for businesses to comply with.\n  Hopefully, by making this a short 2-year extension, we can encourage \nthe States and the business community to move expeditiously to resolve \noutstanding issues and design a truly simplified sales and use tax \nsystem.\n  This debate is not only about the structure of State sales and use \ntaxes. There is also concern with how States assert a direct tax \nliability on an out-of-State company.\n  States impose business activity taxes--corporate income and/or \nfranchise taxes--on corporations that have property or employees in the \nState. The businesses that pay these taxes receive some governmental \nbenefits and protections afforded by that State.\n  A similar situation exists internationally, where foreign \njurisdictions impose a direct tax liability on businesses operating \nwithin in the country.\n  Therefore, as the rules for sales and use taxes are simplified, it is \nalso important that we pay special attention to the rules regarding \nbusiness activity taxes.\n  What we used to think of when we heard ``property,'' ``goods,'' or \neven ``employees,'' is now very different in a world of digital goods, \nbits of electrons, and telecommuters.\n  I stress the need to sort through these issues because I am certain \nthat the rules we establish for ``interstate'' commerce will be the \nmodel for ``international'' commerce.\n  We need to be very careful we do not set up a system that makes U.S. \ncompanies a tax collector for every jurisdiction around the world.\n  On Internet access taxes, I believe we should look for ways to reduce \nbarriers to access, including taxes.\n  If our intention is to make Internet access tax-free, we must be \ncertain that an appropriate definition of access is developed. \nMoreover, it is important to ensure that otherwise taxable product \nprovided over the Internet are not inappropriately shielded from tax.\n  I appreciate the hard work of my friends, Senators Enzi, Graham, \nDorgan. They have worked hard. They have a proposal which may have \nmerit.\n  But the devil is always in the details, and the details have not been \nexamined by the Finance Committee, or any committee for that matter.\n  In fact, there have been no hearings on the Dorgan-Enzi amendment to \ngive interested parties, academics, and Members of the Senate the \nopportunity to discuss the consequences of this legislation and assess \nthe workability of this bill.\n  This amendment may be a reasonable starting point, but as with all \nlegislation of this magnitude, the Senate, through its committees, \nshould give it careful consideration.\n  Some people may say that we have talked too much already. They say \nthat the parties have already had three years to iron out their \ndifferences.\n  That may be, but we must be very careful because this bill raises \nmore questions than it answers.\n  For example, how does this legislation make sure that the uniform \nrates among states stay uniform over time?\n  Does the definition of ``Internet access'' allow nonincidental \ncontent, such as music and movies, to be provided tax free if bundled \nwith Internet access?\n  Are business activity taxes adequately addressed?\n  These are difficult issues, and they deserve serious and deliberative \nconsideration.\n  It is for this reason, that I encourage my colleagues to support a \nshort, 2-year clean extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n  In my judgment, 2 years is adequate time to give the Finance \nCommittee an opportunity to address these important, but difficult, tax \nissues.\n  I emphasize that the work remaining involves tax issues that must be \nresolved by the Finance Committee. There is a long-term precedent of \nthe Senate Finance Committee having jurisdiction over issues involving \nthe taxation of the Internet.\n  A 2-year extension of the Internet Tax Freedom Act is a reasonable \ncompromise and deserves the support of the Senate.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to add my support to promoting \nelectronic commerce and keeping it free from discriminatory and \nmultiple State and local taxes.\n  I strongly support the Senate quickly passing H.R. 1552 to extend the \nInternet tax moratorium for 2 years.\n  Last month, I was pleased to join the senior Senator from Oregon and \nthe senior Senator from Arizona as an original cosponsor of the \nInternet Tax Moratorium Extension Act, the Senate counterpart to H.R. \n1552. I commend Senator Wyden and Senator McCain for their continued \nleadership on Internet tax policy.\n  Although electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, it is still in \nits infancy. Stability is key to reaching its full potential, and \ncreating new tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing \nto do.\n  E-commerce should not be subject to new taxes that do not apply to \nother commerce.\n  Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are 30,000 different \njurisdictions around the country that could levy discriminatory or \nmultiple Internet taxes on e-commerce.\n  Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce, with its great \npotential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses, to be \ncrushed by the weight of discriminatory taxation.\n  Many Vermont companies have contacted me in the last month and weeks \nin support of extending the moratorium, including Green Mountain Coffee \nRoasters, the Army & Navy Store in Barre, and the Vermont Teddy Bear \nCompany.\n  Cyberselling is working for Vermonters.\n  We also need a national policy to make sure that the traditional \nState and local sales taxes on Internet sales are applied and collected \nfairly and uniformly. This 2-year extension of the current moratorium \ngives our Governors and State legislatures time to simplify their sales \ntax rules and reach consensus on a workable national system for \ncollecting sales taxes on e-commerce.\n  Indeed, the National Conference of State Legislatures has endorsed \nour legislation to extend the Internet tax\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\nmoratorium for two more years to give States time to complete work on \nsales tax simplification.\n  I must also raise some serious questions about the approach of some \nSenators to pass legislation to waive Congress's authority to carefully \nreview and approve interstate compacts. As chairman of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over interstate compacts, I \ncannot understand why we should recede congressional authority to \napprove an interstate compact on sales tax issues if 20 States join any \ncompact.\n  Despite good intentions of its proponents, this approach is asking \nthe Senate to buy a pig in a poke.\n  I am a strong supporter of interstate compacts where appropriate, \nsuch as the Northeast Dairy Compact, but the Senate should not approve \nof any interstate compact without carefully reviewing its details \nfirst. When the Northeast Dairy Compact was approved by the Congress, \nevery detail and every aspect of it was known far in advance.\n  It also raises constitutional questions for legislation to mandate \nthat Congress automatically approve an interstate compact on sales \ntaxes without reviewing its text since the Constitution explicitly \nrequires Congress to approve interstate compacts.\n  The Enzi amendment allows 11 jurisdictions to continue to tax \nInternet access, but permanently bans Internet access taxes everywhere \nelse in the country. By permanently prohibiting taxation of Internet \naccess in some States, but approving of such taxation in other States, \nthe Enzi amendment may violate the ``uniformity clause'' in Article I, \n8 of the United States Constitution.\n  The uniformity clause states that ``all Duties, Imposts and Excises \nshall be uniform throughout the United States.''\n  The uniformity clause requires that Federal legislation levying taxes \nfollow a consistent plan and apply in all portions of the United States \nwhere the subject of the tax is found.\n  In United States v. Ptasynski, the Supreme Court held that it will \nsubject geographic distinctions in Federal taxation to heightened \nscrutiny. In a unanimous decision, the Court stated that ``Where \nCongress does choose to frame a tax in geographic terms, we will \nexamine the classification closely to see if there is actual geographic \ndiscrimination.''\n  The Enzi amendment proposal to lock in discrimination between States \nin taxation of Internet access raises questions under the uniformity \nclause that require careful consideration.\n  In the case of a temporary moratorium, such as the one in the House \nbill, the grandfathering of Internet access taxes in a limited number \nof States may be explained as freezing the status quo while Congress \ncomes up with a permanent solution to the Internet tax issue. Thus, it \nis unlikely to raise the geographic discrimination problem the Supreme \nCourt discussed in Ptasynski, and would survive heightened scrutiny.\n  In contrast, the Enzi amendment's permanent discrimination on the \nbasis of where an Internet user lives is much harder to explain under \nthe heightened scrutiny required by the Supreme Court. If courts treat \nthe Federal Government's establishment of a discriminatory regime of \ntaxation by the States as raising the same uniformity clause issues as \nthe Federal Government's levying of discriminatory taxes, the Enzi \namendment's Internet access tax moratorium will be ruled \nunconstitutional.\n  As a result, this amendment appears to raise serious constitutional \nconcerns.\n  E-Commerce is growing, our moratorium law is working, and we should \nkeep a good thing going. I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax \nMoratorium Extension Act to encourage online commerce to continue to \ngrow with confidence and to continue to allow the States to move ahead \nwith sales tax simplification efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for a straight forward 2-year extension \nof the internet tax moratorium.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, multiple, confusing and inconsistent \nState tax rules impose an incredible burden on interstate commerce and \nthe economy, and therefore it is imperative that the Senate move \nquickly to extend the moratorium on Internet access taxes and to \ncontinue protecting electronic commerce from multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxation.\n  As a result of the U.S. Senate's failure to extend the moratorium \nbefore it lapsed on October 21, 2001, it is now possible for the more \nthan 7,600 State and local taxing jurisdictions to impose multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes on electronic commerce and taxes on internet \naccess.\n  On October 16, the House adopted H.R. 1552 under expedited floor \nprocedures. This bipartisan legislation would extend the current \nmoratorium created by the Internet Tax Freedom Act for 2 years. H.R. \n1552 is supported strongly by a wide range of groups, including the \nentire high-tech business community, the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, State and local municipal groups, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, and many other \nbusiness and retail groups that have put aside their differences in \nsupport of a clean, 2-year extension of the moratorium.\n  Given recent events and the current economy, this is the wrong time \nto saddle consumers with Internet access taxes or with multiple and \ndiscriminatory State taxes on electronic commerce. Enacting H.R. 1552 \nnow would provide us with additional time to continue to work together \nto try to reach consensus on clear and simple tax rules for a \nborderless marketplace.\n  We should not be focusing on how to make our tax codes less \ncumbersome for the purposes of Interstate sales tax collection, \nespecially at this late hour. That is why I ask that my colleagues \ntable this amendment.\n\n\n                            section 5(a)(8)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would like to have a discussion with \nthe managers that I hope will clarify the meaning of an important \nelement of this legislation. Section 5(a)(8) of the bill calls for \n``State administration of all State and local sales and use taxes'' to \nbe part of the streamlining process that would allow States and \nlocalities to be able to collect taxes due on remote sales. I believe \nit is important to make clear--in the legislation itself--that the \nrequirement for ``State administration'' applies only to those taxes on \nout-of-State remote sales. The fact that, in a particular State, a \nsingle locality might on its own continue to collect local taxes on \nother sales would not affect that State's eligibility to be part of the \nstreamline compact.\n  By way of example, the city of Chicago has a number of local use \ntaxes that are imposed on different types of transactions. The city \nboth imposes and collects those taxes from sellers wherever they are \nlocated in the State of Illinois. While the city and the State might \nagree to State administration of out of State remote sales, I would not \nwant to see this legislation mandate that only the State of Illinois \ncould collect these taxes on other sales.\n  I believe that this interpretation is intended by the legislation. \nSection 5(a) call for States and localities to work together to develop \na streamlined tax system ``in the context of remote sales.'' However, I \nam concerned that this intent is not clearly enough spelled out. When \nthe legislation returns from conference, I hope that this intent would \nbe made absolutely clear. This could be done by changing section \n5(a)(8) to read ``State administration of all State and local sales and \nuse taxes on remote sales.'' It would also help to add a general use \nclause that would state that ``nothing in this Act shall be construed \nto divest the authority of local governments to collect taxes on sales \nother than remote sales as defined in this Act.''\n  Would the managers agree to this interpretation and assure me that \nthe final legislation will make this interpretation absolutely clear?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator for his observations. I agree with \nhis interpretation that the requirement of State administration of \nsales and use taxes applies only to remote sales. While I believe that \nthis is the intent of the current wording, I will work in conference to \nassure that this point is absolutely clear.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am in agreement with both the Senator from Illinois and \nthe Senator from North Dakota. I also agree that the requirement for \nState administration of sales and use taxes applies only to remote \nsales, and that this is the intent of the current wording. However, I \nwill join with the Senator from North Dakota in working to\n\n[[Page S11906]]\n\nfurther clarify this language in conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime? The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2155\n\n  (Purpose: To foster innovation and technological advancement in the \ndevelopment of the Internet and electronic commerce, and to assist the \n            States in simplifying their sales and use taxes)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, apparently under the unanimous consent \nagreement, that brings us to the amendment itself. As such, I yield \nmyself 8 minutes, and I call up amendment No. 2155.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. ENZI], for himself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Graham, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. \n     Breaux, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Carper, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2155.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, 2 years ago we passed a simple extension \nof the moratorium. That is exactly what we did 2 years ago, and now we \nare saying there have been no hearings held on it and there has been no \ncommittee work on it.\n  There have been individuals working on this because 2 years ago there \nwere a number of us who were deeply concerned about what was going to \nhappen to revenues for cities, towns, counties, and States. We have \nbeen working on it in the meantime. We have been working with people \nfrom the committees. We have been having groups come in.\n  I particularly want to mention Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, \nSenator Graham of Florida, Senator Wyden of Oregon, Senator Voinovich \nof Ohio, Senator Allen of Virginia, and Senator Carper of Delaware. A \nlot of us have been working and meeting with any group that would meet \nwith us to talk about how we could handle this sales tax loophole.\n  There is pain out there, there is agony out there, and through a \nprocess--not a popular process because this amendment does not wind up \nwith what any one group wants. Usually the process around here is to \nsay: This group has enough votes to pass this, and I am going to join \nthat group and we will build in what we can for other people and expand \nthe vote. That is not what can happen because it does not put in any \ndegree of fairness for anybody who is involved in the system.\n  So what we tried to do with this bill was go into a leveling process, \none that would provide for sales tax collections so sales tax revenues \nwould not go down. It would take care of an extension of the access \ntax, and it would provide some encouragement for the States to do \nsomething to streamline and simplify their sales tax system.\n  A very important procedure in this provision is one that protects \nstart-up and small businesses, and that is an exclusion from having to \ncollect any tax, even should the Congress at a future date say that \nneeds to be done, on sales of less than $5 million. That is not a \nstart-up business. That is not a small business. So what this amendment \nactually does is extend the access taxes, in a very conservative way, \nso we would not overreach on access taxes, but so we would put a \nprohibition on access taxes.\n  Then it gives some encouragement to the States to simplify their tax \nsystems. It does not agree it will be done. It does not put any tax \ninto effect. It gives them encouragement, and that is something \nCongress has not been giving them for the last 2 years. We have not \nbeen giving them encouragement, other than a few meetings we have had \nwith them to see what kind of work they can do, and they have been \nmeeting. They have been streamlining. They have been working to come up \nwith a system that will make it possible for people to collect the \nsales tax in a way that will benefit the States and the marketers.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at the bill. I know this is \nsomething that has been talked about, reviewed by a lot of people, \nparticularly since we turned in this last version of the bill, but \nthrough all of the versions that we have worked on. I know the \nguidelines have been seen that are outlined for the States. There is \nsome flexibility for the States yet, and that is a necessity while they \nfinish out their work, but this bill contains some guidelines for them. \nThen it provides for us to vote on their provision when they get 20 \nStates together, if they can get 20 States together. That is a pretty \nlarge group of people to be able to get into a compact. The \nencouragement for them to join the compact is, even if Congress \napproves the compact, they cannot have remote sales tax collections \nwithout joining the compact. So we have some requirements we have asked \nfor them for the simplification, and then we have put a provision in if \nthey can get 20 States together--and again, I want to mention how hard \nthat is--the Congress will vote on whether they have simplified or not, \nwhether they have met criteria that we have imposed either in the bill \nor in our minds since that time. It will require a vote of Congress, \nand that complies with Federal and Supreme Court direction we have had \nbefore.\n  I have a bill. I am pleased with the support. I do want to mention it \nhas been a difficult process. We have worked with the National \nGovernors Association. We have worked with the National League of \nCities. We have worked with the International City-County Management \nAssociation. We have worked with the National Association of Counties \nand the Council of State Governments. All of those folks have endorsed \nwhat we have done and asked for Congress to take this step of extending \nthe moratorium with encouragement.\n  In their letter they state, irrespective of previous letters on the \nInternet tax moratorium and contrary to some dear colleague letters \ncirculating in the Senate, we do not support legislation to reinstate \nthe Internet tax moratorium for 2 additional years. The letter is from \nthose groups I mentioned.\n  Besides those groups, we have been working with retailers from \nvirtually every State. We have been working with direct marketers and \nthe Direct Marketing Association. We have been working with realtors. \nThey have a huge stake in this whole process as well.\n  I have to say there are not provisions in this bill that satisfy any \none of those groups, but they recognize the need to do this in order to \nget the States in a position where they can provide for the kinds of \nservices they have to provide in their communities.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, as the original Senate sponsor of the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act, I have spent 18 months trying to find common \nground on this issue. For hour after hour, we have gone at it, because \nobviously the technology sector is being pounded and local governments \nare understandably concerned about their revenues. Today, however, and \nI want to emphasize this to the Senate, many in both camps are in \nagreement on what the Senate should do. Groups as diverse as the \nAmerican Electronics Association and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures are in agreement.\n  There ought to be a simple 2-year extension of the current Internet \nTax Freedom Act. It would be a mistake to support the substitute, \nalthough well-intentioned, by the Senator from Wyoming. The current \nInternet Tax Freedom Act makes it illegal to discriminate against \nelectronic commerce, and no jurisdiction in the country has been able \nto show that they have been hurt by their inability to discriminate. I \nwant to emphasize to our colleagues tonight, a vote for the Enzi \nsubstitute means millions of Americans could be hit with new taxes for \nclicking on a Web page.\n  The substitute is bad news because it changes the definition of \nInternet access so if Internet access includes receipt of content or \nservices then Internet access can be taxed. That would mean, for \nmillions of Americans, the first thing they would get when they get on \nto the Web, news or weather or sports, that could be taxed. If this \nwere\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\nnot damaging enough, the substitute actually makes it possible to \ninflict those taxes retroactively to 1998.\n  I am of the view most Senators believe there ought to be a permanent \nban on Internet access taxes, that Internet access taxes widen the \ndigital divide, and yet the substitute goes in the opposite direction.\n  Our first economic responsibility ought to be to do no harm, but the \nsubstitute creates new opportunities for economic mischief.\n  For many Americans, basic Internet access is about plugging the \ncomputer into a plain old phone line, dialing an Internet Service \nProvider, such as Erol's or Earthlink, and logging on to the Internet. \nObviously, the blank screen does no one any good; most people when they \nclick on to the Net they get a Web page and start receiving information \nand content on that Web page. For that, the substitute opens those \nmillions of people up to new taxes.\n  The second flaw with the substitute is it would not prevent every tax \njurisdiction from imposing new taxes on the Internet. Any of the 7,600 \ntaxing jurisdictions in America could go out and concoct new taxes. For \nthe life of me, I cannot figure out why that would be good for the \neconomy right now.\n  The third flaw in the substitute is it allows discrimination against \nremote and on-line sellers, forcing them to pay different tax rates \nthan in-State businesses. The substitute permits the remote seller to \nbe taxed differently than an in-State business and, as a result, \nmillions of small businesses will face significant large, new burdens \ntrying to navigate a system of multiple and varying tax rates.\n  For example, in one part of Colorado there are five distinct tax \nrates within a single zip code. No software exists today that can help \nthe small businessperson navigate the sea of bureaucracy and redtape, \nand I hope the Senate won't force that daunting task on unsuspecting \nsmall businesses.\n\n  I will conclude with this comment. Tonight, the Senate is being \npresented with two different views of Federal policy towards the \nInternet. The first, which is contained in the underlying bill, \nstipulates that there ought to be a short, clean extension of current \nlaw barring discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce and nothing \nelse. The substitute--the Senate Finance chairman is absolutely right, \nand I am grateful for his support on this--hasn't had a hearing. It \nexposes millions of Americans to the prospects of new taxes, creates \nthe possibility of a crazy quilt of Internet regulation throughout the \ncountry, and looks to the possibility that we would see scores of forms \nand paperwork that would chew up a vast amount of time in compliance.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the underlying bill, will reject \nthe substitute, and join a diverse coalition that includes the American \nElectronics Association and the National Conference of State \nLegislatures, two groups that, on this issue, have in the past \ndisagreed again and again. Those two groups, the American Electronics \nAssociation and the National Conference of State Legislatures, are \nunited saying the way for the Senate to proceed is to go for a clean 2-\nyear extension of this moratorium and reject the substitute.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I request the Chair please notify me \nwhen I have used 4 minutes.\n  Madam President, we need to decide what this debate is about and what \nit is not about. This is not a debate about a new tax. It is not a \ndebate about a new tax. My colleague referred to that. That is not \naccurate, and I would be happy to have a long and extended debate about \nthat. But let's understand what it is and is not.\n  I support the Enzi-Dorgan substitute. I think it is an important \npiece of legislation. Let me describe what it does.\n  We have two problems. One of the problems is that more and more sales \nin this country now are being conducted by remote sellers--Internet, \ncatalog, and so on. On Main Streets of our communities we have sales \nbeing conducted by small business men and women. When they make those \nsales, they collect the tax. They compete against a remote seller who \nmakes a sale but does not charge the tax, even though a tax is owed on \nthe transaction. The tax is owed on a transaction with the remote \nseller, but it is never paid because it is a use tax and people don't \nfile millions and millions of use tax returns. The result is State and \nlocal governments are losing a substantial amount of money--$13 billion \nit is estimated this year; by the year 2006, $45 billion, most of which \ngoes to support local schools. So State and local governments are \nrightly concerned about funding for their schools.\n  There is also the issue of fairness for Main Street. That is a \nproblem: Lack of funding for schools, a tax that is owed but not paid, \nfairness for Main Street retailers.\n  The second problem is a problem for remote sellers. A remote seller \nsays: I don't want to have to collect a tax and submit it to 5,000 or \n7,000 jurisdictions. That is a fair point. They should not have to do \nthat. That is burdensome and too complicated. So we say solve both \nproblems.\n  Require State and local governments to make dramatic simplifications \nin their tax systems. When they do, through a compact, submit that \ncompact to the Congress for approval or disapproval. If the Congress \napproves that, then allow them to require remote sellers to collect the \ntax that is already owed on the transaction, solving both problems and \ndramatically simplifying compliance for the remote sellers. And we will \nnot approve it if it does not do that.\n\n  Second, at the same time, collect a tax that is already owed and make \nit much simpler for those who owe that tax to comply with current law.\n  We can do both of those. We can solve both of those by beginning with \nthis substitute. This substitute itself doesn't solve the problem, but \nwe have two choices. We can decide to ignore this problem and do \nnothing. But you know and I know it will not go away. We will be back \nhere next year or the year after or 5 years from now. This problem is \ngoing to grow, not recede. We can solve this problem now or we can just \ndo the moratorium, which, incidentally, I have supported and do \nsupport, but I support it with a solution to the other problem.\n  We can do these in tandem by providing support for the Enzi \nsubstitute, saying we want to do a number of things. We want to extend \nthis moratorium. We don't believe in punitive taxation. We don't \nbelieve in taxing access. We want to do all the things Senator Wyden \ntalked about with respect to the moratorium, but we want to do more \nthan that. We want to solve another problem out, festering, and \ngrowing. It is not a problem that deals with a new tax. Anybody who \ntalks about that is just dead wrong. It is a problem dealing with \nschool finance, with fairness on Main Street, a problem with ballooning \nrevenues that need to come to support our schools, revenues that are \nnow being lost because they are not being paid.\n  That is the choice, and I hope we make the right choice tonight.\n  Let me make one final point. When we pass the Enzi substitute, we \nhave not done anything except say to the States: You go ahead and \ndevelop this process and submit it to us later, and we will then make a \njudgment on whether we will allow you to impose this collection. But \nour judgment will be based on whether you substantially have simplified \nyour tax laws.\n  That is what the Enzi substitute does, and that is why I support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I yield myself 8 minutes off the time of \nthe opponents of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, the reality is, if we pass the Enzi-\nDorgan amendment, the substitute, what we are in effect doing is \nimposing Internet access taxes and allowing discriminatory taxes on the \nInternet. This is a measure on which I know Senator Enzi and Senator \nDorgan have worked hard. Nevertheless, it has been changing almost by \nthe day and certainly almost by the hour in recent weeks. There has not \nbeen any scrutiny to it.\n  Let me associate myself, though, with the remarks and observations of \nSenator Wyden of Oregon. This does complicate the Tax Code. It is a \nvery complex issue which actually makes it\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\nworse. There are unfair taxes that could occur even within a State if \nthis were adopted and, indeed, it has added taxes.\n\n  If we allow this amendment to be put on, let's have no doubt about \nit; the House is not going to conference. We will have this expired \nmoratorium continuing. There are already States that have access taxes \nthat are grandfathered. These are taxes, such as the Spanish-American \nwar tax that was put on for telephone service, a luxury. Once taxes are \nput on by a State or locality, it is very hard to get them off.\n  There are two sides. There is a choice Senators are going to need to \nmake. The opponents are for a tax-free Internet. The other side is on \nthe pro-tax-collector side. The first decision we need to make is \nwhether we extend the Internet access tax moratorium or do we vote for \nthe Enzi-Dorgan amendment which would result in allowing Internet \naccess taxes and discriminatory Internet taxes.\n  The opponents of this amendment side with individuals. We side with \nentrepreneurs rather than siding with the tax collectors.\n  We have heard that this is a loophole, the fact that someone who has \nno physical presence in a State, gets no benefits from fire or police \nservices, that they do not have to collect and remit sales and use \ntaxes to 7,600 jurisdictions--that that is not a level playing field, \nor it is a loophole.\n  I look at the Internet as an individualized enterprise zone where the \nconsumer, the individual, the human being is the one making the \ndecisions, not tax-collecting bureaucracies.\n  As far as this level playing field, let's assume you wanted to get \nyour son or daughter a Harry Potter CD. If you ordered it on line, it \nwould cost $16.26. That is including shipping and handling. That would \nbe getting it in 3 to 5 days in shipment. It would be 5 times more in \ncost of shipping if you wanted it overnight. Off line, at a store, it \nwould be $14.62.\n  With the velour dress, here are cowboy boots and a computer. Let me \ngo through the specification on each of these to show how this playing \nfield is relatively level and, in fact, you actually save money by \ngoing to a store, as well as convenience. Amazon.com on line, total \nprice, shipping and handling, is $16.26. If you go to Best Buy in \nSpringfield, VA, paying a sales tax, it is $14.62. Savings by going to \nthe store is $1.64. Again, we took the lowest shipping and handling.\n  Again, this is where we take the lowest shipping and handling.\n  Let's assume you wanted to buy yourself or your bride a dress. There \nis a velour dress from Spiegel.com, on line, at $89. The price at the \nstore is actually a little more. At Tyson's Corner, at Macy's, it is \n$95. But when you put in the tax versus shipping and handling, you save \nmoney by going to the store.\n  Say you wanted to buy yourself some boots. This is what it would cost \non line--$120. It is $121 at the store in Springfield. But, again, the \nsavings is $3.50 if you go to the store over shipping and handling.\n  If you buy a Dell computer on line, the price is exactly the same \nprice as it is at Circuit City in Charlottesville, VA. But you would \nsave money in that the sales tax is $71. Shipping and handling is $95. \nYou would save approximately $24.\n  Put all of that into context. If you are buying a dress, or somebody \nis buying boots, you may like to try them on. You may want to put them \non to see if they fit. That is the advantage those in the stores have \nover somebody buying on line. You can touch it. You can feel it. You \ncan see how they fit. If there is a problem, you bring them right back \nto that store. You don't have to pay handling and shipping and go \nthrough all that annoyance and aggravation of handling and shipping.\n  Say you wanted to buy your son or daughter the Harry Potter \nsoundtrack but didn't want to wait 5 days. Maybe you wanted to get an \nAllen Jackson soundtrack and listen to it driving home. You would want \nto get it right away. Again, the convenience is there.\n  The point is there is competition. The idea that this is not a level \nplaying field is not just borne out by the facts. While this is all \nvery well intentioned, the solution is not burdening the free \nenterprise system. The solution is not harming the Internet, and the \ncapabilities and potential and possibilities of the Internet for \neducation, communication, and commerce.\n  Indeed, what is being tried here with the Enzi-Dorgan amendment is to \nabrogate and negate a settled constitutional law from Supreme Court \ndecisions, whether it was the Quill decision or whether it was the \nBella Hess decision, which say there cannot be taxation without \nrepresentation.\n  I would like to work with the proponents of this amendment to find a \nsystem where the folks who care about their local schools, as Senator \nDorgan said, can pay those use taxes. But I am going to stand on the \nside of freedom--freedom of the Internet, trusting individuals and \nentrepreneurs--and not on the side of making this advancement in \ntechnology easier to tax for the tax collectors.\n  I reserve whatever time I may have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my \ncolleagues, Senators Enzi and Dorgan. Most experts agree that this \nexplosion in electronic commerce, made possible through the Internet, \nhelped fuel our most recent economic surge and contributed to the \ngreatest sustained period of growth in our nation's history. However, \nmost would agree that the current framework of thousands of state and \nlocal tax jurisdictions is now well-built for this ``new economy.'' \nTechnology has made it possible for commerce to transcend traditional \nlocal, state and even national borders.\n  The issue here is how can we continue to grow the Internet while at \nthe same time preserving state's rights to collect revenues on sales \nthat traditionally would be generate sales taxes. Frankly, I believe \nthat no state is in favor of creating new taxes so as to cripple the \ngrowth of the Internet. But I do feel that states and localities should \nbe able to collect taxes on legitimate transactions that have a \nsubstantial nexus with their state so that they would be able to \ncollect sales taxes on those transactions if they were to physically \ntake place in their state.\n  And many other organizations agree.\n  This legislation is supported by the National Governors Association, \nNational Association of Counties, National League of Cities, Council of \nState Governments, International City and County Management \nAssociation, National Retail Federation, National Association of \nRetailers, E-Fairness Coalition and companies such as Gateway, Compaq, \nVerticalNet, Walmart, Target, HomeDepot, and Circuit City.\n  This issue is truly about federalism--the delineation of the role the \nfederal government plays relative to state and local governments and \nthe people.\n  With regard to sales taxes, there are currently 45 states that rely \non some form of sales tax. These states receive, on average, almost 33 \npercent of their annual operating budgets from sales taxes. In my state \nof Ohio, it's 31.4 percent.\n  Our States are in a very serious situation. A recent study prepared \nby the University of Tennessee shows that states could lose nearly $440 \nbillion in sales tax revenue over the next decade in Internet tax \nrevenues if Congress does not empower our states to collect revenues \nfrom remote sales.\n  These are revenues that would not be available to build schools, pave \nroads, pay for emergency services or meet other fundamental \nresponsibilities.\n  In my home state of Ohio, our state government will lose more than \n$475 million in fiscal year 2002 and Ohio is projected to lose $596 \nmillion in fiscal year 2003 in revenue forgone from their ability to \nraise funds from Internet sales.\n  And as our economy moves more and more towards E-commerce, the fiscal \nimpact on Ohio and other states will continue to damage the abilities \nof our states to fund their own services. This lost revenue merely \nexacerbates the difficult fiscal challenges Ohio and other states face \nas they suffer revenues losses from the current economic downturn.\n  For the federal government to shield Internet sellers from state tax \ncollection responsibilities would usurp the autonomy of the states and \nforce them to cut services and/or raise revenue elsewhere through \nadditional taxes or fees.\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\n  In my view, preempting the states in such a critical area as e-\ncommerce without addressing the state and local revenue needs suggests \nthat Congress is not as committed to the principles of federalism.\n  And it could force the states to come to Washington in order to make \nup the funds we have taken away from them. For those concerned about \nthe growth of the federal government, as I am, it will be very \ndifficult to say ``no'' when states argue for more money if Congress by \ninaction has taken away a revenue source.\n  That is why this amendment by Senators Enzi and Dorgan is so \nimportant.\n  It provides a permanent extension of the moratorium on Internet \naccess taxes, and extends the moratorium on multiple and discriminatory \ntaxes for five years.\n  In addition, this amendment encourages states to develop a \nstreamlined system of sales and use taxes that provides: a centralized \nmulti-state registration system for sellers; uniform rules for \nattributing transactions to particular taxing jurisdictions; uniform \nprocedures for exempt purchases; uniform software certification \nprocedures; uniform tax return and remittance forms; consistent \nelectronic filing and remittance methods; and protections for consumer \nprivacy.\n  This amendment will also allow Congress to remain involved before any \nstate moves to tax any Internet transactions. Once 20 states have \ndeveloped and adopted an Interstate Simplified Sales and Use Tax \nCompact, the states will submit the Compact to Congress.\n  Our State and local governments are not interested in putting a \ndamper on the expansion of the Internet; they want it to prosper like \nall of us.\n  The real question before us is: how can we ensure that our businesses \nand our nation are able to compete in this new, technology driven \neconomy without sacrificing the principles of federalism which have \nserved us well for over 200 years? State economies benefit from the \nhealthy and unfettered growth of electronic sales. All they and \ntraditional retailers ask is fair treatment.\n  Federalism can adapt and even flourish when we remember to work as \npartners with our state and local governments. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Enzi-Dorgan amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes in opposition \nto the Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the Enzi amendment, and I hope we will \ndefeat it by a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  I have read this amendment over and over. It has changed mightily \nduring the last month or so. But it is very clear to me that if this \namendment were to become law--by the way, the House would never allow \nit to become law. But let's say it could become law. I think it would \nwreak havoc on Internet commerce. Let me tell you why.\n  Look at page 3 of the amendment. Look at section 3, and look at \nparagraph A. There is a 1, which clearly states that Internet service \nproviders could be forced to go back retroactively to 1998 and remit \nInternet access taxes to the States.\n  Can you imagine the burden that would put on this country at a time \nin our history when we are in a major recession?\n  Second, Senator Enzi's amendment would not prohibit new taxes on \nInternet access and, although it would keep the moratorium on \n``discriminatory and multiple'' taxes, it may not prevent ``new'' taxes \non electronic commerce.\n  Finally, I want to state that these are statements made by my friend \nand colleague from Oregon, Ron Wyden, in a far more articulate way than \nI. I am trying to underscore what he said.\n  If you look at page 4, you see that the Enzi proposal would allow \ntaxes on Internet content. It is very clear that the moratorium on \nInternet access taxes would no longer apply to Internet content.\n  Can you imagine people connecting to the Internet and suddenly being \ncharged every time perhaps they connected to the Web?\n  In my view, this is a very dangerous kind of amendment because if it \ndoes become law it will wreak havoc on business on the Internet, and \nnot only business, but just the right to get on the Web and read \ncontent and to be able to do that without extra charges. This is not \nthe time for that.\n  Madam President, this was updated as of October 5, 2001. The Wall \nStreet Journal has printed 30 pages of companies that have gone out of \nbusiness. I will give you some of them. AdMart: announced plans to shut \ndown, lay off 334 employees. Advertising.com: announced plans to lay \noff 72 employees, or 25 percent of its staff. And it goes on and on and \non.\n  You will remember some of these companies. We remember the Webvan \nthat went out of business. But it just goes on and on. You would \nrecognize some of these companies.\n  Is this a time, I would ask my colleagues, to go after this industry? \nIt is the wrong time. It is the wrong time, and it is a dangerous time. \nI will give you some more examples.\n  Barnes & Noble.com said in February 2001 it will cut 350 jobs, or 60 \npercent of its workforce.\n  Beautyjungle.com, a cosmetics seller, laid off 60 percent of their \nworkforce and then shut down.\n  I will go on. eToys: In January 2001, it said it would lay off 700 \npeople, or 70 percent of its workforce. In February 2001, it said it \nwould let go the remaining 293 employees by April. Later in February, \nit said it would file for bankruptcy protection.\n  Here is the Webvan Group story. Cut staff in April 2001 by 30 percent \nor 885 employees. They also closed operations in Sacramento, CA, and in \nAtlanta, the latest in a series of shutdowns. In July 2001, they \nannounced plans to close all remaining operations and terminate 2,000 \nemployees.\n  The general economy is in trouble. We have seen more layoffs in 1 \nmonth than we have in 21 years.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds \nto conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So, in closing, this amendment is flawed. It will allow \nnew Internet access taxes. It will force the collection of Internet \naccess taxes going back to 1998. It will allow taxing on content. And \nit comes at a time when the economy is tanking.\n  For goodness sakes, we cannot even get an economic stimulus package \npassed, and the first thing we do, late on a Thursday night, is look at \nways to get more people laid off.\n  I hope we will vote, in a bipartisan way, against the Enzi amendment.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield myself 5 minutes off the proponents' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this is the most important vote that we \nare going to take in this Congress, first or second session, on \neducation, on public services, and on fundamental fairness in America's \nmarketplace.\n  Why do I make that statement? I make that statement because, first, \nState and local governments are very dependent on the sales tax in \norder to fund their basic public service responsibilities, specifically \neducation, police, and fire.\n  Let me just give you some examples. The city of Boston: 10 percent of \nits revenue comes from its local sales tax. That represents \napproximately half of its annual cost of its police and fire services.\n  The city of Detroit: 10 percent of its total revenue comes from its \nlocal sales tax. That represents two-thirds of the cost of its police \nand fire services.\n  In Milwaukee, 23 percent of the local revenue comes from its sales \ntax which represents almost 100 percent of the cost of its police and \nfire.\n  At a State level, to use my State of Florida as an example, 73 \npercent of our general revenue comes from the sales tax, and 70 percent \nof that general revenue is used to finance education and the public \nemergency services, such as State police and our judicial system.\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n\n  If there were to be a significant erosion of our sales tax, in these \ncities in my State, and the other 45 States which are very dependent on \nthe sales tax, there would be an immediate impact on their primary \nresponsibilities of education and public services.\n  Second, State governments and local governments are facing a \nhemorrhaging of the sales tax. To use my State again as an example, the \nState of Florida collects approximately $30 billion a year in sales \ntax. The General Accounting Office has estimated that by the year 2003, \nthere will be a 4-percent erosion of that sales tax revenue by virtue \nof sales tax that will not be required to be collected because the sale \nwill be made by a distant seller.\n  Then, according to a study made by the University of Tennessee, 3 \nyears later, in the year 2006, that will go up from 4 percent to almost \n8 percent of our State's sales tax revenue.\n  That is what I call a hemorrhaging of the ability of a major State--\nillustrative of the other 45 sales tax States--to be able to finance \nbasic public services.\n  Third, there is no rationale for this discrimination in favor of one \ngroup of retailers over another group of retailers. This is not a new \ntax. This is a responsibility to collect a tax which is paid by the \nultimate consumer and which has been in place in most States, including \nmine, for over a half a century. This is not a new tax. It is a \nresponsibility for equality of treatment in the collection of an \nexisting tax.\n  This will do serious harm. It will do more harm to our traditional \nMain Street retailers. Why should we say to a local bookstore that they \nhave to collect the sales tax on the Harry Potter book, but that if you \nbuy it from a distant store, they do not have to collect the sales tax? \nThere is no rationale to that policy.\n  There have been, in the past, times in which there has been a public \npolicy that said, we will provide a lessened sales tax or some other \npreferential benefit in order to stimulate the sale of a product that \nwe consider to be in the public interest.\n\n  In my State, we did it, for instance, for solar energy. But we are \nnot talking about new products here; we are talking about books, we are \ntalking about clothes, we are talking about electronic items. It is not \nthe product; it is the method of sale of the product that is getting \nthe discriminatory beneficial treatment.\n  Finally, there have been statements made about all of the horrors \nthat are going to happen if we pass this amendment. People forget, this \namendment had no life, had no vitality until this Congress, by a \nseparate independent affirmative act, at some point in the future, \nvoted to institute this authority of the States to collect the sales \ntax through distant sellers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this is an extremely important issue for \nthe most important services rendered by our State and local \ngovernments. I urge a vote against the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment and \nyield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, there are a number of issues that are \nraised by this amendment which are very significant. It comes to us \ntonight without having any hearings, without having any airing in the \npublic sector of any significance. Yet it addresses some of the most \nfundamental issues of constitutional law, and the relationship between \nStates and between the Federal Government and States, that we could \nconfront as a Congress. It is simply precipitous to pass this amendment \nin this rushed format.\n  The amendment would go right at the heart of what has been a long \nhistory of case law settled by the Supreme Court and reverse it. It \nwould reverse the Bella Hess case and the Quill case which, \nessentially, are cases which said that there must be a nexus between \nthe seller of the goods and the State in which the goods are sold \nbefore a tax can be assessed against the seller of the goods.\n  This amendment would reverse that. That is the purpose of this \namendment. It does not affect just Internet transactions.\n  There is an equally large effort here to reverse the issue as it has \nbeen dealt with in catalog sales. Yet the proposal is going to be dealt \nwith in 2 hours in the Senate Chamber. Clearly, it is precipitous \nbecause the implications are huge.\n  The second major constitutional problem with the amendment is that it \ncreates this brandnew regime where 20 States can bind the other 30 \nStates. This is truly an excess of the minority over the majority. It \nreverses the concept of federalism and turns it on its head and says if \n20 States reach agreement, then the rest of the 30 States have to \nfollow that agreement. If you are going to change constitutional law, \nyou have to have a three-fifths vote. There is no way you can do it \nwith 20 States. And yet that is the attempt here.\n  This is a roundabout way of trying to amend what is essentially a \nconstitutional procedure without using the appropriate constitutional \nprocedures. If it were passed, it would truly set up a precedent which \nwould fundamentally harm the concept of federalism. If it is used here, \nI can see this concept of 20 States getting together and ganging up on \nthe rest of the States being used fairly regularly.\n  The amendment itself on the issue of substance is wrong and \ninappropriately presented. It certainly is wrong on the issue of the \nmanner in which it has been brought forward in that it should have \ngotten more hearings. If this idea makes sense, it should go through a \nproper hearing process before it comes to the floor. It would create an \natmosphere where 7,000 different jurisdictions across the States could \nend up taxing the Internet. That would be chaos and would fundamentally \nundermine this engine of prosperity and economic growth which we had \nand which we continue to have and which we continue to lead the world \nin, which is the Internet.\n  Those are the substantive reasons why this is a bad idea at this \ntime. There is probably an equally, if not more important procedural \nreason. If this amendment passes, it is a poison pill. It will kill the \nInternet tax moratorium. It will mean that there will be no moratorium \nfor the next 2 years.\n  The House has said it is not going to take this language. It is not \ngoing to conference this language. So as a practical matter, the \nInternet tax moratorium is dead. The underlying bill here would cause a \n2-year tax moratorium. And if the language of this amendment makes \nsense, that will give us more than ample time to proceed in the proper \ncourse through the proper hearing procedure to listen to the arguments \nfor this proposal. It can be passed any time during this next 2 years.\n  What can't be done during the next 2 years, if we don't have an \nInternet tax moratorium, is put back together Humpty Dumpty because we \nwill literally have thousands of jurisdictions which will put in place \ntaxes against the Internet as soon as they have that opportunity, as \nsoon as it is clear that there is going to be no moratorium. We will \nhave chaos which we will never be able to sort out.\n  The amendment, although obviously sincerely principled and \naggressively pursued, has serious substantive problems. I hope we will \nnot pass this amendment because it will represent a poison pill and it \nwill end up killing the Internet tax moratorium.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and \nyield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, Delaware is one of five States that has no \nsales tax. One might think as a result we have no dog in this fight. We \ndo. I think we all do, whether we happen to be from a sales tax State \nor not.\n\n  My colleague who spoke immediately before me said we haven't had \nhearings on this proposal. We have had discussion in this Chamber, in \nthe House, in State houses across the country, certainly in Governors' \nmeetings for the last 3 years. We don't need a hearing to know that \nStates are under duress. Their economies are struggling. Their revenue \ngrowth is down and in some cases negative. Spending is up. Unemployment \nis up. Out-of-pocket costs for\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nhealth care for Medicaid are up, and they are in between a rock and a \nhard place.\n  We have been debating this week how can we help those States in their \ntime of need. Some have said: Let's increase the Federal share for \nMedicaid. Others have said: Let's provide an extension of unemployment \ninsurance and pay for it with Federal dollars. Others have said: Let's \npass a stimulus package. Maybe we should provide a sales tax holiday \nand let the Federal Government pay for that--something I don't think is \na good idea, but that has been put forward.\n  A much better idea is the Enzi-Dorgan amendment that lies before us \ntoday, the product of many years work between the States, between \nGovernors, mayors, county executives, legislators here, and previous \nadministrations as well as the current administration. What does it do? \nAnybody listening to this debate has to be confused.\n  This amendment provides for extensions of bans on multiple and \ndiscriminatory taxes for 5 years, and it extends the ban on access \ntaxes permanently. That is what it does. What it also does is it \nempowers the States to work among themselves to see if 20 of them can \nagree on a simplified approach toward collecting taxes from remote \nsellers. If they can come to an agreement and provide that kind of a \nsimplified approach, then that plan would come to us and we would have \nthe opportunity to vote yes or no as to whether or not States can \nactually proceed. If we vote no, they can't proceed.\n  Our voting for this amendment today, even if it ended up in the final \nbill signed by the President, would not authorize the collection of a \nsales tax by remote vendors. It simply sets in motion a process which \ncould lead to another vote by us somewhere down the line.\n  My last point: If you happen to be a brick and mortar vendor in a \nState and you have a sales tax and you are required to collect a sales \ntax and are selling a piece of luggage or a shirt or wallet, a CD \nplayer, and you have to collect sales taxes on those items and charge \nmore for those items and there is somebody who is buying it remotely \nfrom another State, where are people going to shop? More and more they \nare shopping on the Internet. They are not going to the local vendor. \nIt is not fair to the local vendor who is collecting the taxes that pay \nfor the schools and public safety and transportation and other things. \nIt is just not fair.\n  One aspect of this amendment I am not comfortable with deals with \nAmazon.com and the eBay issue which I have discussed with Senators Enzi \nand Dorgan. I hope when we get to conference, we will have an \nopportunity to address those issues.\n  I yield to Mr. Enzi for whatever time he consumes.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Delaware, particularly since he is \nfrom a non-sales-tax State, for supporting this issue and realizing how \nimportant it is to other States. I will definitely work to get that \ndone. What we are trying to do is have an even playing field here. I \nwill work to get that as part of the definition and clarification.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator for his assurances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise as an opponent to \nthe amendment and yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment because e-commerce is at the very heart of our economy. \nIt brings billions of dollars in revenues, provides huge surpluses to \nlocal, State, and Federal coffers throughout the country. Why, \nparticularly in an economic slowdown, would we want to saddle an \nindustry with huge new tax increases and heavy bureaucratic and \nregulatory burdens? It does not make sense.\n  The National Bureau of Economic Research concludes that imposing \nthese multibillion dollar tax increases and government burdens would \nresult in a 30 percent reduction in purchases over the Internet. Think \nof what that would do to the economy. It would have a devastating \neffect.\n  For the first time in history, government bureaucrats in one State \nwill have the power to tax the people in another State. That is not \nright. The hours and capital required to comply with the Tax Code from \nthe IRS and State and local taxing agencies are going to be \noverwhelming under this amendment. Not only would businessowners be \nunder the glass with the usual suspects, but now they are going to be \nopen to thousands of bureaucratic agencies looking into their business \nto get a cut.\n\n  I can assure you if a State or local official spends money to come \nacross the country to audit you, he is going back with some money. In \nNew Hampshire, we don't have a sales tax, and I believe it is a \nregressive tax that disproportionately affects the poor and working \nclass. It is a State's decision as to whether they want to impose the \ntax. Under this legislation, New Hampshire residents would be forced to \npay these taxes to businesses all across the country. Due to the \nincreased costs of paying these out-of-State taxes, and the flood of \naudits, our residents would pay substantially higher prices for goods \nand services.\n  So allowing State and local governments the power to target taxpayers \noutside their own State, where those people have nothing to say at the \nballot box, would set a horrible precedent. Frankly, I believe it is \nunconstitutional.\n  States would then be able to use this new sword to target businesses \nand States that were competing with their own. Of course, with local \nbusinesses and consumers in an uproar, States would have to retaliate. \nThen we come to lawsuits. At some point, the Federal Government is \ngoing to step in and be called to set regulations and taxing levels, \nand here we go on down the road where the Government sets the sales tax \nrate. They would then have the venue they needed to have a national \nsales tax.\n  Some have argued for a national sales tax, but this would be on top \nof the income tax. If you don't like the income tax, you are not going \nto be too happy about having a sales tax on top of it.\n  This is a multibillion-dollar increase, a regulatory monster, and it \nmust be stopped. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Enzi \namendment and support Main Street and freedom.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, we are moving to wrap this up. I want to \ncome back to a couple points because I think there is confusion, for \nexample, on the Internet access charge issue. There is a sense among \nsome Senators that this is something that would have to be approved by \nthis body. That is not correct. This amendment--the substitute--changes \nthe definition of Internet access, and it can be applied to millions of \nAmericans without any further action by the Senate.\n  In particular, what the amendment says is that it would be possible \nto ``tax content or services.'' That is virtually everything. Nobody \nwants a blank screen on their computer. Of course, they are going to \nhave a Web page with news, weather, and basic information. The fact is \nthat the substitute means that millions of Americans could be hit with \nnew taxes just for clicking on a Web page, and this could be done \nwithout any further action by the Senate.\n  I think most Senators believe there ought to be a permanent ban on \nInternet access taxes, that Internet access taxes widen the digital \ndivide. Yet the substitute on the Internet access tax issue goes in \njust the opposite direction. A lot of Americans think Internet access \nis plugging the computer into a phone line, dialing up the Internet \nprovider, and logging onto the net. Then you would get a blank screen. \nOf course, you want information and content. People need to know, as \nthey move to this vote, that they could be taxed for getting those \nkinds of services that many of them believe are essential, such as the \nweather.\n  At the end of the day, I pledge to continue to work with the Senator \nfrom Wyoming. He has been extremely sincere and extremely dedicated. \nHowever this vote comes out, I want to make it clear that I will work \nclosely with him, Senator Dorgan, and all the Senators who see this \ndifferently than I, Senator Baucus, Senator McCain, and others. We are \ngoing to have to stay at it.\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\n  When you vote tonight, you are talking about two very differing \napproaches with respect to Internet policy. One approach that we \nadvocate tonight is backed by the American Electronics Association and \nthe National Conference of State Legislatures. The other is opposed by \nvirtually all of the technology groups in the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  I thank all of those people who have been dedicated in their work on \nthis issue. There have been innumerable meetings, and Senator McCain, \nSenator Dorgan, Senator Kerry, Senator Wyden, and I have been the \nprimary people. We have met with these different groups to see what \nparts of the Internet were their interests.\n  This bill is as close as we can come to pulling everybody to the \ncenter. No, it doesn't please everybody. Does it please most of the \npeople? I certainly hope so, and we will have a vote to determine \nwhether it does or not. But this does make permanent the Internet \naccess tax prohibition. Now that is something that Gateway, \nVerticalNet, Compaq, and other high-tech folks have wanted and do want.\n  This bill does not have new taxes in it. This bill has a provision so \nthat States will be encouraged to simplify their taxes and, at some \nfuture time, in order to comply with the Supreme Court decisions \nmentioned here, there will be a vote to see if Congress approves of \ntheir simplification. Unless the vast majority of the States are \ninvolved in that, I am sure they won't get approval.\n  We passed a moratorium 2 years ago, and we promised all of these \ngovernmental agencies and all of the other people with an interest in \nsales tax that we would put a bill together, solve their problem, bring \nthem a solution. Have there been hearings? Everybody says there have \nnot been hearings. There have been a lot of meetings. There has not \nbeen a bill produced other than what we have here.\n  This is a promise we made to local and State governments 2 years ago. \nThis is some action we can take on it. It doesn't make anything final, \nbut it provides incentive to get people together to work on a problem \nthat is necessary. Cities, towns, and counties, not to mention States, \nhave been put under some unusual circumstances just since September 11. \nWe need to have a mechanism for them to be able to fund them. We have \nnot promised funding for everything. We have made them do a lot. This \ngives them an opportunity to work out a system whereby they can \ncontinue to operate, continue to have revenues that are on a declining \nbasis at the moment, and this is something so that we can have a vote. \nThis just provides for a vote of Congress at a future date when there \nhas been streamlining.\n  The extension of the current moratorium of the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct of 1998 expired this past Sunday on October 21, 2001. I believe \nthis amendment would thoroughly address this issue as well as the \nsimplification of State and local use tax systems.\n  We had to take a look at the Internet sales tax issue for people who \nmight be using legislative vehicles to develop huge loopholes in our \ncurrent system. We need to preserve the system for those cities, towns, \ncounties, and states that rely on the ability to collect the sales tax \nthey are currently getting. I believe that the moratorium on Internet \naccess taxes and multiple and discriminatory taxes on the Internet \nshould not be extended without addressing the larger issue of sales and \nuse tax collection on electronic commerce.\n  Certainly, no Senator wants to take steps that will unreasonably \nburden the development and growth of the Internet. At the same time, we \nmust also be sensitive to issues of basic competitive fairness and the \nnegative effect our action or inaction can have on brick-and-mortar \nretailers, a critical economic sector and employment force in all \nAmerican society. In addition, we must consider the legitimate need of \nState and local governments to have the flexibility they need to \ngenerate resources to adequately fund their programs and operations.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate, I have a unique perspective on \nthe dozens of tax proposals that are introduced in Congress each year. \nIn addition, my service on the state and local levels and my \nexperiences as a small business owner enable me to consider these bills \nfrom more than one viewpoint.\n  I understand the importance of protecting and promoting the growth of \nInternet commerce because of its potential economic benefits. It is a \nvaluable resource because it provides access on demand. Therefore, I do \nnot support a tax on the use of Internet itself.\n  I do, however, have concerns about using the Internet as a sales tax \nloophole. Sales taxes go directly to state and local governments and I \nam very leery of any Federal legislation that bypasses their \ntraditional ability to raise revenue to perform needed services such as \nschool funding, road repair and law enforcement. I will not force \nstates into a huge new exemption.\n\n  While those who advocate a permanent loophole on the collection of a \nsales tax over the Internet claim to represent the principles of tax \nreduction, they are actually advocating a tax increase. Simply put, if \nCongress continues to allow sales over the Internet to go untaxed and \nelectronic commerce continues to grow as predicted, revenues to state \nand local governments will fall and property taxes will have to be \nincreased to offset lost revenue or States who do not have or believe \nin state income taxes will be forced to start one.\n  Furthermore, State and local revenues and budgets are especially \ncritical now as these governments are responding to protect the \nsecurity of all of our citizens and businesses. Any action to extend \nthe current moratorium without creating a level playing field would \nperpetuate a fundamental inequity and ignore a growing problem that \nwill gravely affect the readiness of the nation.\n  After months of hard work, negotiations, and compromise, this \namendment has been filed. I would like to commend several of my \ncolleagues for their commitment to finding a solution. I know this \namendment is the solution. The amendment makes permanent the existing \nmoratorium on Internet access taxes, but extends the current moratorium \non multiple and discriminatory taxes for an additional four years \nthrough December 31, 2005.\n  Throughout the past several years, we have heard that catalog and \nInternet companies say they are willing to allow and collect sales tax \non interstate sales, regardless of traditional or Internet sales, if \nstates will simplify collections to one rate per state sent to one \nlocation in that state. I think that is a reasonable request. I have \nheard the argument that computers make it possible to handle several \nthousands tax entities, but from an auditing standpoint as well as \nsimplicity for small business, I support one rate per State.\n  I think the States should have some responsibility for redistribution \nnot a business forced to do work for government. Therefore, the \namendment would put Congress on record as urging states and localities \nto develop a streamlined sales and use tax system, which would include \na single, blended tax rate with which all remote sellers can comply. \nYou need to be aware that states are prohibited from gaining benefit \nfrom the authority extended in the bill to require sellers to collect \nand remit sales and use taxes on remote sales if the states have not \nadopted the simplified sales and use tax system.\n\n  Further, the amendment would authorize states to enter into an \nInterstate Sales and Use Tax Compact through which members would adopt \nthe streamlined sales and use tax system. Congressional authority and \nconsent to enter into such a compact would expire if it has not \noccurred by January 1, 2006. The amendment also authorizes states to \nrequire all other sellers to collect and remit sales and use taxes on \nremote sales once Congress has acted to approve the compact by law \nwithin a period of 120 days after the Congress receives it.\n  The amendment also calls for a sense of the Congress that before the \nend of the 107th Congress, legislation should be enacted to determine \nthe appropriate factors to be considered in establishing whether nexus \nexists for State business activity tax purposes.\n\n[[Page S11913]]\n\n  I strongly support this amendment because I do not think there is \nadequate protection now. It is very important we do not build \nelectronic loopholes on the Internet, an every-changing Internet, one \nthat is growing by leaps and bounds, one that is finding new technology \nvirtually every day.\n  Mr. President, I recognize this body has a constitutional \nresponsibility to regulate interstate commerce. Furthermore, I \nunderstand the desire of several senators to protect and promote the \ngrowth of Internet commerce.\n  I am very concerned, however, with any piece of legislation that \nmandates or restrict State and local governments' ability to meet the \nneeds of its citizens. This has the potential to provide electronic \nloopholes that will take away all of their revenue. This amendment \nwould designate a level playing field for all involved--business, \ngovernment, and the consumer.\n  The States, and not the Federal Government, should have the right to \nimpose, or not to impose, consumption taxes as they see fit. The \nreality is that emergency response personnel, law enforcement \nofficials, and other essential services are funded largely by states \nand local governments, especially through sales taxes. Passing an \nextension of the current moratorium without taking steps toward a \ncomprehensive solution would leave many states and local communities \nunable to fund their services. I urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment.\n  In the current definition in Sec. 1104(5) of the ITFA:\n\n       The term ``Internet access'' means a service that enables \n     users to access content, information, electronic mail, or \n     other services offered over the Internet, and may also \n     include access to proprietary content, information, and other \n     services as part of a package of services offered to users. \n     Such term does not include telecommunications services.\n\n  I do want to address one very important issue that has not been \naddressed in this amendment. One of the most important aspects of this \nlegislation deals with State and local taxation of Internet access \nservices. There is general agreement in this body that there should be \nno new State and local taxes on basic Internet access as a way to \nassist every American to be able to take advantage of the Internet and \nits resources. That is a goal I obviously support, and my amendment \nwill do that.\n  As you know, however, I have serious concerns with the current \ndefinition of Internet access. I am concerned that without further \nwork, it will subvert our intent, discriminate against some Internet \nService providers, and impact state and local governments. Thus, I want \nto continue to work with my colleagues at a later date to refine that \ndefinition so that we accomplish our aim without doing harm.\n  The problem is that the current definition is so broad, and \ntechnology is changing so fast that the current definition could \nunfairly discriminate against many businesses that provide similar \ncontent or services over the counter, over a cable wire, or via any \nother means. The discrimination could affect a variety of products and \nservices that I don't think any of us envisioned as part of access to \nthe Internet. In a nutshell, the current definition essentially \nincludes anything and everything, except telecommunications that could \nbe offered as a part of a package of Internet access services, \nincluding television programs, radio broadcasts, games, books, music, \nmotion pictures and other such products and services.\n  Following mergers of Internet service providers and media and \nentertainment companies, it is not hard to envision an ISP that \nprovides these services and includes all of the items in one bill to a \ncustomer. For example, an ISP could provide downloadable movies to \ncustomers--allowing a customer to download a set number of movies each \nmonth includable in their monthly fee for Internet access, while paying \nextra for any movies beyond the included amount. This sets up some \nperverse and discriminatory situations. First, for example, someone who \npays $9.95 for basic Internet service that doesn't include movies would \nhave to rent movies separately and pay tax on those rentals, while \ncustomers of an ISP that include movies in its $21.95 service would not \npay tax on those movies. Second, the tax-exempt benefit of purchasing \nmore expensive Internet access services doesn't stop at just movies. \nProviders could also include music, publications--and someday soon, \ndownloadable nightly cable broadcasts--and under the current definition \nthese would also be exempt from tax. I don't think any of us ever \nenvisioned when we first debated and enacted a temporary moratorium \nthat the scope of services provided over the Internet was intended to \ncover anything beyond basic access.\n\n  I believe that the current definition of Internet access needs to be \nexamined closely by the Congress so that we don't do damage where we \nintend to do good. I have tried a number of different approaches to \ndefining it, and each of them has issues and problems. I am not ready \nto give up, however.\n  Furthermore, there are also some that believe the current definition \nof Internet access needs to be changed because it unfairly \ndiscriminates among providers of Internet access and gives some \nproviders advantages over others. The current definition favors large \ncompanies over small. It also excludes telecommunications services from \nthe definition of access. In doing so, the language could be \ninterpreted to exclude Wireless Web Access because all services \nprovided by wireless companies are considered ``telecommunications.'' \nThus, Internet access purchased from one company might be exempt, but \nit could be taxable if purchased from a wireless provider. I know our \nintent is not to discriminate among Internet access providers, but that \nis the effect of current law.\n  If we don't continue to work on this definition, we will go contrary \nto the findings in the legislation we are considering. If we allow the \ncurrent definition of Internet access to remain unchanged, we will be \nauthorizing the disparate treatment of the sales of identical products \ndepending on whether the sale occurs online or not. In simplest terms, \nthe current definition of Internet access would exempt the sales of \nmany products and services that would be taxed if sold in any other \nway. Besides the fiscal problem this would cause for states, this is \nalso fundamentally unfair, and should be prevented. I think formulating \na good definition of Internet access presents a host of opportunities \nthat we should not let pass by. It gives us an opportunity to define a \ncritical component of the infrastructure of our new economy--and, in \ndoing so, provide a definition that allows all new economy companies, \nboth large and small, to operate on a level playing field. It provides \nus with an opportunity to provide a clear definition that reduces the \nprobability of litigation over the exact meaning of the statute. And, \nit provides us with an opportunity to insure that we do no harm to the \nfiscal stability of many levels of government--while providing a \npositive environment in which business can survive.\n  I hope to continue to work with my colleagues at a later date to \ndevelop a definition of Internet access that preserves the tax-\nexemption for access to the basic services and resources of the \nInternet.\n  The Internet is such a powerful tool of education and commerce that \nwe should do everything we can to make sure that each American can take \nadvantage of it. At the same time, we need to insure that our goal \nassisting in the provision of basic access is not subverted by an \noverly broad definition of access that allows a host of digital goods \nand services to be bundled together and sold tax exempt. Such \nsubversion would only serve to weaken state and local governments at \nthis important time in our nation's history.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National Governors \nAssociation, National League of Cities, International City/County \nManagement Association, National Association of Counties, and Council \nof State Governments be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         National Governors Association, National League of \n           Cities, International City/County Management \n           Association, National Association of Counties, Council \n           of State Governments,\n                                                 November 6, 2001.\n     Hon.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the debate. I appreciate the \nefforts made on both sides of this very difficult issue. The closeness \nof it really dictates that we do sit down and work something out on \nthis issue with Senator Dorgan, Senator Kerry, Senator Allen--all of \nthose with whom we have met in numerous, countless hours on this issue. \nIt is very clear we need to come to some kind of agreement rather than \ngo through moratorium after moratorium.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I conclude by saying I think we should \nbegin meetings as soon as possible so we can resolve this issue so \nthere is a reasonable resolution. I know the proponents of this \namendment which was just defeated spent great labor and effort on it. I \ncongratulate them for their arguments. I look forward to working with \nthem. This is an issue that needs to be resolved.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished Senator from \nArizona, we spent a lot of hours working through this with Senator \nEnzi, Senator Dorgan, Senator McCain, myself, and many others. This was \na very difficult vote for many of us. We do not support any tax on the \nInternet itself. We don't support access taxes. We don't support \ncontent taxes. We don't support discriminatory taxes. Many of us would \nlike to see a permanent moratorium on all of those kinds of taxes.\n  At the same time, a lot of us were caught in a place where we thought \nit important to send the message that we have to get back to the table \nin order to come to a consensus as to how we equalize the economic \nplaying field in the United States in a way that is fair.\n  I hope the Senator from Arizona will follow up with us, so we can \ncome back to that table to do what is sensible and fair. I look forward \nto the chance to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Massachusetts \nleaves, I want him to know, as the original Senate sponsor, I want to \nredouble my efforts to work with him and Senator Enzi and all of our \ncolleagues. We may be able to see that there is a technological fix \nhere that is going to make it possible to collect taxes owed.\n  There is a lot of good will on both sides. This is by no means the \nend of the issue. I am very pleased the Senator from Massachusetts is \nending this discussion in a conciliatory way because we are going to \nhave to stay at it. He has my pledge as the original sponsor of this \neffort to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as an original author and cosponsor of the \nmoratorium, which I believe in, I appreciate the comments. I had hoped, \nand in many ways thought this was not ripe for this vote, but I think \nit was important for us to have gone through the process. I look \nforward to seeing if we can come up with a sensible resolution.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my colleagues, who have just spoken, for their \ncomments, for the effort they put forth. I thank all the people for \nallowing the debate that happened. That had to be done by unanimous \nconsent.\n  Now we know our work is cut out for us. Two years ago we passed a \nmoratorium. Tonight we passed a moratorium. Hopefully before 2 years is \nup we will have done something that will solve the problem. I \nappreciate the commitment of the chairman of the Commerce Committee to \nmake that happen. I am sure all the people who are involved in this \nissue will be extremely happy that some work will be done on it. The \nhearings will be held. The consensus will be arrived at because it is \nnecessary for our cities, towns, counties, and States.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have been involved in a number of issues \nin\n\n[[Page S11915]]\n\nmy time here. I know of no two people who have worked harder on an \nissue than the Senator from Wyoming and the Senator from North Dakota.\n  That renews my commitment to try as hard as I can to come to an \nagreement because they deserve an all-out effort on an issue on which \nwe are fundamentally in agreement.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank all of those Senators who were \ninvolved in the array of legislative items that we have taken up today. \nThis has been quite a busy day, with a lot of coordination and a \ntremendous amount of work. I think we have accomplished a good deal \ntoday.\n  I also report that the Commerce Committee has completed its work. I \ncompliment the chair and ranking member of the Commerce Committee for \ntheir work on the aviation security bill.

Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \nask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered and agreed to, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2161) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate has \napproved a modified version of S. 1389, the Homestake Mine Conveyance \nAct of 2001.\n  This important legislation will enable the construction of a new, \nworld-class scientific research facility deep in the Homestake Mine in \nLead, SD. Not only will this facility create an opportunity for \ncritical breakthroughs in physics and other fields, it will provide \nunprecedented new economic and educational opportunities for South \nDakota.\n  Just over a year ago, the Homestake Mining Company announced that it \nintended to close its 125-year-old gold mine in Lead, SD, at the end of \n2001. This historic mine has been a central part of the economy of the \nBlack Hills for over a century, and the closure of the mine was \nexpected to present a significant economic blow to the community.\n  In the wake of this announcement, you can imagine the surprise of \nSouth Dakotans to discover that a committee of prominent scientists \nviewed the closure of the mine as an unprecedented new opportunity to \nestablish a National Underground Science Laboratory in the United \nStates. Because of the extraordinary depth of the mine and its \nextensive existing infrastructure, they found that the mine would be an \nideal location for research into neutrinos, tiny particles that can \nonly be detected deep underground where thousands of feet of rock block \nout other cosmic radiation.\n  Recently, I received a letter from Dr. John Bahcall. Dr. Bahcall is a \nscientist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, NJ. He was \nawarded the National Medal of Science in 1998, and is a widely \nrecognized expert in neutrino science and an authority on the potential \nof an underground laboratory. In a recent letter to me, he explained, \n``There are pioneering experiments in the fields of physics, astronomy, \nbiology, and geology that can only be carried out in an environment \nthat is shielded from the many competing phenomena that occur on the \nsurface of the earth. These experiments concern such fundamental and \napplied subjects as: How stable is ordinary matter? What is the dark \nmatter of which most of our universe is composed? What new types of \nliving organisms exist in deep underground environments from which \nsunlight is excluded? How are heat and water transported underground \nover long distances and long times?''\n  This research, as well as other research that could be conducted in \nthe mine, has the potential to answer fundamental questions about our \nuniverse. The National Science Foundation is already considering a $281 \nmillion proposal for the construction of this laboratory.\n  I want to thank all of those who have been involved in the \ndevelopment of this legislation. I particularly appreciate the hard \nwork and support of Governor Bill Janklow of South Dakota and officials \nwith the Homestake and Barrick mining companies, who helped us to reach \nagreement on this legislation. I also want to thank my colleague, \nSenator Johnson, a cosponsor of this bill, for all of his work. In \nparticular, Senator Johnson's ability to secure the $10 million in \ntransition funds that will bridge the gap between Homestake's closure \nand the establishment of the laboratory has been critical to this \neffort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Dr. John Bahcall be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Professor John N. Bachall,\n\n\n                                 Institute for Advanced Study,\n\n                                  Princeton, NJ, November 8, 2001.\n     The Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Tom Daschle: I would like to summarize for you \n     the scientific importance of the National Underground Science \n     Laboratory to be located in the Homestake Gold Mine near \n     Lead, South Dakota.\n       There are pioneering experiments in the fields of physics, \n     astronomy, biology, and geology that can only be carried out \n     in an environment that is shielded from the many competing \n     phenomena that occur on the surface of the earth. These \n     experiments concern such fundamental and applied subjects as: \n     How stable is ordinary matter? What is the dark matter of \n     which most of our universe is composed? What new types of \n     living organisms exist in deep environments from which \n     sunlight is excluded? How are heat and water transported \n     underground over long distances and long times?\n       American scientists have been among the world leaders in \n     research in these underground studies. But we have had to \n     travel to Japan, to Italy, to Russia, to South Africa, to \n     Finland, to India and to other countries in order to carry \n     out our experiments. During the past year, I had the \n     privilege of chairing a national committee of distinguished \n     research scientists that was charged with the task of \n     recommending whether or not the United States should develop \n     its own national laboratory to support the underground \n     scientific work of physicists, astronomers, biologists, and \n     geologists. We were also asked to make a recommendation as to \n     whether the expenditure of funds for this purpose would, in a \n     highly constrained budgetary situation, be beneficial to the \n     scientific enterprise.\n       The committee had many meetings in this country and in \n     other countries where major underground scientific facilities \n     are currently active. The committee reached two conclusions. \n     First, it is in the best interest of the United States to \n     develop a national underground science laboratory only if \n     this facility would be the best in the world. Secondly, the \n     Homestake Gold Mine could be converted into the premier \n     underground laboratory in the world. The recommendations of \n     the committee have been endorsed by panels of scientists \n     representing different disciplines.\n       I hope that these remarks are useful to you and to your \n     colleagues.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     John Bahcall,\n                                  National Medal of Science, 1998.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and that any \nstatements thereon be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1389), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

FINDINGS; DEFINITION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On the field of battle, the members of the Armed Forces \n     who defend the Nation are honor-bound to leave no one behind \n     and, likewise, the Nation is honor-bound to leave no veteran \n     behind.\n       (2) The Department of Veterans Affairs report known as the \n     Community Homeless Assessment, Local Education, and \n     Networking Groups for Veterans (CHALENG) assessment, issued \n     in May 2000, reports that during 1999 there were an estimated \n     344,983 homeless veterans, an increase of 34 percent above \n     the 1998 estimate of 256,872 homeless veterans.\n       (3) The 1996 National Survey of Homeless Assistance \n     Providers and Clients found that, although veterans \n     constitute only 13 percent of the adult population, veterans \n     comprise 23 percent of homeless clients.\n       (4) Homelessness among veterans is persistent despite \n     unprecedented economic growth and job creation and general \n     prosperity.\n       (5) While there are many effective programs that assist \n     homeless veterans to again become productive and self-\n     sufficient members of society, current resources provided to \n     such programs and other activities that assist homeless \n     veterans are inadequate to provide all needed essential \n     services, assistance, and support to homeless veterans.\n       (6) The CHALENG assessment referred to in paragraph (2) \n     reports--\n       (A) that Department of Veterans Affairs and community \n     providers were responsible for establishing almost 500 beds \n     for homeless veterans during 2000, including emergency, \n     transitional, and permanent beds; and\n       (B) that there is a need for about 45,724 additional beds \n     to meet current needs of homeless veterans.\n       (7) Nearly four decades ago, the Nation established a goal \n     of sending a man to the moon and returning him safely to \n     earth within a decade and accomplished that goal, and the \n     Nation can do no less to end homelessness among the Nation's \n     veterans.\n       (b) Homeless Veteran Defined.--In this Act, the term \n     ``homeless veteran'' means a veteran who is homeless (as that \n     term is defined in section 103(a) of the McKinney-Vento \n     Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11302(a)).\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL GOAL TO END HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS.\n\n       (a) National Goal.--Congress hereby declares it to be a \n     national goal to end homelessness among veterans within a \n     decade.\n       (b) Cooperative Efforts Encouraged.--Congress hereby \n     encourages all departments and agencies of Federal, State, \n     and local governments, quasi-governmental organizations, \n     private and public sector entities, including community-based \n     organizations, and individuals to work cooperatively to end \n     homelessness among veterans within a decade.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I urge the Senate to pass S. 739, the proposed \n``Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance Act of 2001,'' a \nbill that enhances VA's efforts to combat homelessness among our \nNation's veterans.\n  On July 19, 2001, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing \non S. 739 as originally introduced by my good friend and colleague on \nthe Committee, Senate Paul Wellstone. The Department of Veterans \nAffairs and homeless advocate shared their views on what could be done \nto help VA treat the unique problems faced by homeless veterans. \nWitnesses testified that homelessness remains a prevalent problem among \nveterans, with roughly one-third of the total homeless population \nconsisting of veterans. Members of the Committee were told that more \nneeds to be done to help these men and women get back on their feet.\n  I will highlight a couple of the provisions included in the bill and \nrefer my colleagues to the report accompanying this legislation for \nmore detail.\n  The pending measure contains many provisions seek to enhance programs \nthat VA currently administers to homeless veterans, most notably the \nGrant and Per Diem Program. This program offers grants to nonprofit \ncommunity-based organizations that serve homeless veterans. \nSpecifically, the bill authorizes up to $55 million a year in funding \nfor the program.\n  In addition, the bill would link the daily per diem rates provided to \nthese community-based organizations for the care of homeless veterans \nto the rate already provided to state veterans homes for domiciliary \ncare. This would increase the daily rate from $19 to $24, giving those \nwho are truly combating homelessness the appropriate resources with \nwhich to work.\n  Another important aspect of this legislation is the establishment of \nan Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans within VA. This 12-15 member \ncommittee would evaluate and report directly to the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs on all matters related to homeless veterans. This \nensures that there is always a voice for this segment of the veteran \npopulation at the highest level within VA.\n  With regard to the overall evaluation of homeless programs--often \ncited as one of the biggest impediments to properly serving the \nhomeless--the pending legislation would encourage the continued support \nof at least one evaluation center within VA. Currently, VA's Northeast \nProgram Evaluation Center in Connecticut conducts such research, and \nit's important to ensure that all research efforts receive needed \nresources to pursue valuable work.\n  Evaluation needs to be conducted so that VA policy makers and Members \nof Congress know what works and what does not. Therefore, the pending \nmeasure would require two annual reports to Congress from VA on the \nactivities of both the health care and benefits-related aspects of \ntheir treatment of homeless veterans.\n  Yet another key aspect of the pending measure is the required \nestablishment of at least five new Comprehensive Service Centers. These \ncenters would be located in the metropolitan areas found by VA to have \nthe greatest demand for homeless services. Existing centers, such as \nones located in Brooklyn, NY, and Dallas, TX, provide the full spectrum \nof care for homeless veterans, including transitional housing and \nsubstance abuse treatment.\n  In closing, I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication \nof the namesake of this bill, Miss America 2000, Heather French Henry. \nHer focus on homeless veterans during her reign and subsequent to the \nend of her tenure as miss America brought significant attention to this \nimportant issue. Ms. Henry's advocacy for homeless veterans is truly \nadmirable.\n  It is my sincere hope this bill will give VA greater ability to treat \nhomeless veterans, and thereby contribute toward eradicating this \nnational share. I urge my colleagues on the House Veterans's Affairs \nCommittee, who have also been active on this issue, to work with \nSenator Wellstone, the other members of our Committee, and me, to help \nthose who have sacrificed for our country and now need our help.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of S. 739 be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     Summary of S. 739: The Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans \n                         Assistance Act of 2001\n\n       The Committee bill incorporates provisions from S. 739, as \n     originally introduced. It seeks to enhance and provide \n     additional support for VA programs that combat homelessness \n     among veterans.\n       The following is a summary of key provisions in the \n     Committee bill, S. 739:\n       Programmatic Expansions: Authorizes VA to spend up to $55 \n     million per year on the transitional housing Grant and Per \n     Diem program. Requires VA to establish at least five new \n     comprehensive service centers for homeless veterans in those \n     metropolitan areas found to have the greatest need. Extends \n     the Homeless Chronically Mentally Ill and Comprehensive \n     Homeless Programs until December 31, 2006.\n       Advisory Committee on Homeless Veterans: Establishes a \n     Committee that will examine and report to the Secretary no \n     various services provided to homeless veterans.\n       Interagency Council on the Homeless: Requires annual \n     meetings of the Interagency Council on the Homeless, as the \n     Council has yet to get underway.\n       Evaluation on Homeless Programs: Encourages the continued \n     support of at least one evaluation center to monitor the \n     effectiveness of VA's various homeless programs. Requires VA \n     to report on both the benefits and health care aspects of \n     combating homelessness.\n       Life Safety Code: Requires that real property of grantees \n     under VA's homeless Grant and Per Diem program meet fire and \n     safety requirements applicable under the Life Safety Code of \n     the National Fire Protection Association.\n       Technical Assistance Grants: Authorizes the Secretary to \n     conduct a technical assistance grants program to assist \n     nonprofit groups in applying for grants relating to \n     addressing problems of homeless veterans. Provides $750,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006 for these \n     purposes.\n       Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program: Extends the \n     Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program and authorizes $50 \n     million a year for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, yesterday's action by the Senate to \nblock the consideration of an economic stimulus package was \nunfortunate, untimely, and unnecessary. For the third time in 2 months, \nwe missed an opportunity to bring desperately needed assistance to \nunemployed workers. We were also blocked from providing tax relief to \nbusinesses to encourage new investment, and we were not even permitted \nto consider a homeland security initiative to meet the safety needs of \nour homes and communities.\n  But the resumption of negotiations on an economic stimulus package \nbetween congressional leaders and the administration is a positive \nsign. I say ``resumption of negotiations'' because there were \nproductive talks last month between administration officials and \ncongressional leaders. These talks resulted in an agreement on the size \nof the stimulus package and consensus was beginning to build.\n  The Democratic and Republican leaders of the Budget Committee also \nagreed upon a set of guidelines to develop this legislation. They said \nit should be immediate, that it should provide a temporary stimulus. \nThey also said it should focus on those who would be most likely to \nspend the money, and all that was left was to fill in the details.\n  Unfortunately, the sensible process was abandoned. The House of \nRepresentatives pushed through a tax bill that was not temporary, did \nnot provide immediate stimulus, and did not put money into the hands of \nthose most likely to spend it. The House bill was bloated well beyond \nthe size of the package that had been agreed upon, and the permanent \nchanges it would make to the Tax Code would return us to the days of \ndeficit spending and high interest rates.\n  The bill passed by a slim margin on a partisan vote. The fact that \nthe administration has endorsed this effort is a grave disappointment. \nNow that we are back at the negotiating table, it is time to return to \nthe bipartisan Budget Committee principles. It should be stimulative, \nimmediate, and temporary.\n  Nobody can doubt that our economy is in trouble. The employment rate \njumped 5.4 percent in October; nearly 8 million workers are unemployed. \nWe must rise above our differences and focus on the priorities that \nunite us.\n  Three things are of paramount importance. It is important that we get \nbusiness growing again. There are a variety of good tax cut proposals \nfor businesses on the table. They would cause immediate investment and \ngrowth without busting the budget. Identifying the best set of \nincentives should not be a difficult task. But it is also important \nthat we invigorate consumer demand. Both sides of the aisle have \nproposed tax rebate checks to those Americans who did not receive a \nrebate earlier this year. We know that a $300 rebate to low-income \npersons would create economic activity because this money will be spent \nto make ends meet. But it is also important to provide temporary \nassistance to those who have lost their jobs. As we have in previous \nrecessions, Congress should extend unemployment benefits.\n  The claim that these benefits would be a disincentive to work is an \ninsult to our workers. I have never met anyone who would rather receive \na meager unemployment check than hold a job. But we need to provide \nunemployment benefits for a longer time than usual because the economy \nsimply is not producing new jobs.\n  Republicans and Democrats agree that those who have lost their jobs \nshould not also lose their health insurance. But there are many \ndifferent ideas on the best way to provide health insurance to \nunemployed workers. Whether it is a tax credit or a subsidy, I am open \nto these ideas. The important thing is that we not add millions of \nworkers to the ranks of the unemployed and uninsured.\n  We should also take care that our actions do not compound the fiscal \nwoes of our State and local governments. Many States were already \nexperiencing large budget deficits even before September 11. Since the \nattacks, there has been a sharp reduction in revenues. There has been \nan increased burden on essential Government services. If the Federal \ntax cuts we enact result in a reduction in State revenue, we must find \na way to fill the gap for our States.\n  If we stay focused on our core priorities, we can come to an \nagreement. We can also be sure that we don't bust the budget in the \nlong run.\n  Economists have warned us that if we abandon fiscal discipline, we \nwill force long-term interest rates to rise. If we push up home \nmortgage rates, then any other stimulus we provide will be futile.\n  Keeping interest rates low is especially important in my State. \nMissouri has one of the highest rates of home ownership in the country. \nSeventy-four percent of Missourians own their own homes, and they are \ncounting on us to act responsibly. They are counting on our national \nleaders to step forward.\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\n  The President has shown bold leadership in the war against terrorism, \nand now they are counting on him to show bold leadership on the \neconomic front as well.\n  A bipartisan agreement in the Senate is within reach. It is up to the \nPresident to bring all parties together for a sensible, balanced \neconomic package that is good for America. That is the challenge. \nAmericans are watching and waiting.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, I will not take the full period of \ntime. I want to make an announcement and inform the Senate family of \nsomething. Last night, we cleared through the Senate a national day of \nreconciliation to take place in the Senate and the House on December 4.\n  When we come back, hopefully we will not be in session too much past \nthat, but at least on December 4, there will be a gathering between the \nHouse and Senate, and hopefully members of the Cabinet, as a time to \nsupport one another and to reconcile.\n  Historically, this was done 100 years ago, in particular at this time \nof the year, between Thanksgiving and Christmas. We will try to see the \nminor differences that have separated us and see if we really cannot \nmake amends with each other, and seek amends with our Creator, if there \nare things that separate us from Him as well. This is going to take \nplace on December 4. It has passed the House and the Senate as a \nconcurrent resolution. There is a group that is planning on working \ntogether to do this, along with the Chaplains of the two bodies.\n  I wanted to announce that to the Senate. Hopefully, there are people \nwho will want to participate in this gathering. It is voluntary. It \nwill be a private session. Nobody from outside the House, the Senate, \nor the administration, other than the two Chaplains, will participate. \nThere will be no media present. It is a private, closed session. It \nwill take place in the Rotunda.\n\n  It will take place between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m. on December 4. I hope \npeople will mark it on their calendars. This can be a special time \ngiven the nature of what has happened in our country, this year in \nparticular, with the events of September 11, with the anthrax scares, \nand with the plane that went down this week out of New York. We have \nhad a lot of trial and trauma in this Nation. It has called upon us to \nunify and pull together. We need to continually do that.\n  This will be an effort for us to do just that--to reconcile with one \nanother, to reconcile with our Creator. I think it is an important \nmodel for us to show to the Nation. I hope people can participate in \nthat as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Afghan Women and Children \n     Relief Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In Afghanistan, Taliban restrictions on women's \n     participation in society make it nearly impossible for women \n     to exercise their basic human rights. The Taliban \n     restrictions on Afghan women's freedom of expression, \n     association, and movement deny women full participation in \n     society and, consequently, from effectively securing basic \n     access to work, education, and health care.\n       (2) Afghanistan has one of the highest infant (165 of 1000) \n     and child (257 of 1000) mortality rates in the world.\n       (3) Only 5 percent of rural and 39 percent of urban Afghans \n     have access to safe drinking water.\n       (4) It is estimated that 42 percent of all deaths in \n     Afghanistan are due to diarrheal diseases caused by \n     contaminated food and water.\n       (5) Over one-third of Afghan children under 5 years of age \n     suffer from malnutrition, 85,000 of whom die annually.\n       (6) Seventy percent of the health care system in \n     Afghanistan is dependent on foreign assistance.\n       (7) As of May 1998, only 20 percent of hospital medical and \n     surgical beds dedicated to adults were available for women, \n     and thousands of Afghan women and girls are routinely denied \n     health care.\n       (8) Women are forbidden to leave their homes without being \n     escorted by a male relative. This prevents many women from \n     seeking basic necessities like health care and food for their \n     children. Doctors, virtually all of whom are male, are also \n     not permitted to provide certain types of care not deemed \n     appropriate by the Taliban.\n       (9) Before the Taliban took control of Kabul, schools were \n     coeducational, with women accounting for 70 percent of the \n     teaching force. Women represented about 50 percent of the \n     civil service corps, and 40 percent of the city's physicians \n     were women. Today, the Taliban prohibits women from working \n     as teachers, doctors, and in any other occupation.\n       (10) The Taliban prohibit girls and women from attending \n     school. In 1998, the Taliban ordered the closing of more than \n     100 privately funded schools where thousands of young women \n     and girls were receiving education and training in skills \n     that would have helped them support themselves and their \n     families.\n       (11) Of the many tens of thousands of war widows in \n     Afghanistan, many are forced to beg for food and to sell \n     their possessions because they are not allowed to work.\n       (12) Resistance movements courageously continue to educate \n     Afghan girls in secrecy and in foreign countries against \n     Taliban law.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (b), the President \n     is authorized, on such terms and conditions as the President \n     may determine, to provide educational and health care \n     assistance for the women and children living in Afghanistan \n     and as refugees in neighboring countries.\n       (b) Implementation.--(1) In providing assistance under \n     subsection (a), the President shall ensure that such \n     assistance is provided in a manner that protects and promotes \n     the human rights of all people in Afghanistan, utilizing \n     indigenous institutions and nongovernmental organizations, \n     especially women's organizations, to the extent possible.\n       (2) Beginning 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and at least annually for the 2 years thereafter, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit a report to the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee \n     on International Relations of the House of Representatives \n     describing the activities carried out under this Act and \n     otherwise describing the condition and status of women and \n     children in Afghanistan and the persons in refugee camps \n     while United States aid is given to displaced Afghans.\n       (c) Availability of Funds.--Funds made available under the \n     2001 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Recovery \n     from and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States \n     (Public Law 107-38), shall be available to carry out this \n     Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11922-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY, DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND LEGAL REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is very important that we pass S. 1196, \nthe Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001, today. \nUntil this legislation is enacted, the SBA cannot provide any leverage \nto the SBICs to make investments. We need to vote, send it to the House \nand on to the President's desk for signature.\n  I joined Senator Bond in introducing this bill in July and all 19 \nmembers of our committee have agreed unanimously in favor of its \npassage. Why does it enjoy so much support? For anyone who missed the \narticle in the Washington Post on November 1, let me talk about the \ntrack record of SBA's venture capital program and the role it plays in \nour economy.\n  Last year, the Agency financed 4,600 venture capital deals, investing \n$5.6 billion in our fastest-growing small businesses. Over the last 5 \nyears, investing by SBIC-licensed firms has accounted for half of all \nventure-financing deals. Since its inception, the program has also \nreturned $700 million directly to Federal coffers. Despite this \nimpressive track record, the President's budget eliminated funding for \nthe SBIC participating securities program and reduced the program level \nfor the debenture program, which requires no appropriations. With \nventure capital having all but dried up, this is no time to eliminate \nfunding and restrict activity for the SBIC programs. As I have said so \nmany times, the programs at the SBA are a bargain. For very little, \ntaxpayers leverage their money to help thousands of small businesses \nevery year and fuel the economy.\n  In the SBIC participating securities program last year, taxpayers \nspent $1.31 for every $100 leveraged for investment in our fastest-\ngrowing companies--companies like Staples, Callaway Golf, Federal \nExpress, and Apple Computer.\n  The main purpose of this act is to adjust the fees charged to \nParticipating Security SBICs from 1 percent to 1.38 percent. The change \nis necessary because, at the President's request, all funding for this \nprogram was eliminated. I disagree with that. I preferred to show \nfiscal responsibility by level funding the program and then increasing \nthe fees only as much as necessary to raise the program level from $2 \nbillion to $3.5 billion. Consistent with that opinion, as my colleagues \nmay remember, Senator Bond and I offered an amendment to the Budget \nResolution, Amendment No. 183, that did just that. It was agreed to in \nthe Senate by voice vote in April and retained in the final budget \nresolution. Unfortunately, the appropriators had very tough decisions \nto make and the funding agreed to in our budget amendment was not \nincluded in the appropriations process. Despite my disagreement, I am \nsupporting S. 1196 and joining Senator Bond in offering this amendment \nbecause if we want to continue this program, it must be funded entirely \nthrough fees, which forces us to authorize the fee change.\n  For the record, let me state that the National Association of Small \nBusiness\n\n[[Page S11924]]\n\nInvestment Companies testified before both the Senate and House \nCommittees on Small Business in favor of increasing the program level \nfrom $2 billion to $3.5 billion. As I just explained, this legislation \nmakes that possible.\n  The other modifications strengthen the oversight and authority of the \nSBA to take action against bad actors, protect the integrity of the \nprogram, and streamline operations.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to pass the ``Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act \nof 2001,'' S. 1196. This bill is important for one simple reason: once \nenacted it paves the way for more investment capital to be available \nfor more small businesses that are seeking to grow and hire new \nemployees.\n  There has been a significant growth in the small business sector of \nthe U.S. economy over the past two decades. Today, small businesses \nmake up over \\1/2\\ of the entire U.S. economy. Over 99 percent of all \nemployers in the United States are small businesses. They employ over \n50 percent of workers and provide 75 percent of the net new jobs each \nyear. Small businesses generate 51 percent of the Nation's private \nsector output. In light of the ongoing dip in the U.S. economy with the \naccompanying retrenchment by many businesses, both large and small, S. \n1196 will serve as part of the solution to move us toward a recovery.\n  Before voting on S. 1196, I will offer an amendment that will permit \nthe Small Business Administration to increase fees paid by Small \nBusiness Investment Companies up to 1.38 percent. When the Committee on \nSmall Business unanimously approved the bill on July 19, 2001, the \nCommittee adopted a fee increase from 1.0 percent to 1.28 percent. At \nthat time, some members of the committee believed they could obtain an \nappropriation for the SBIC Participating Securities Program that would \noffset part of the fee increase. At this time, it appears unlikely that \nthe Conferees on the Commerce Justice State Appropriations bill will \napprove any funds for the SBIC program. Consequently, it is critical \nthat the Senate approve a fee increase to 1.38 percent, as required by \nthe Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990; otherwise, the SBIC \nParticipating Securities Program will be shut down.\n  In 1958, Congress created the SBIC program to assist small business \nowners in obtaining investment capital. Forty years later, small \nbusinesses continue to experience difficulty in obtaining investment \ncapital from banks and traditional investment sources. Although \ninvestment capital is readily available to large businesses from \ntraditional Wall Street investment firms, small businesses seeking \ninvestments in the range of $500,000-$3 million have to look elsewhere. \nSBICs are frequently the only sources of investment capital for growing \nsmall businesses.\n  Often we are reminded that the SBIC program has helped some of our \nNations best known companies. It has provided a financial boost at \ncritical points in the early growth period for many companies that are \nfamiliar to all of us. For example, Federal Express received a needed \ninfusion of capital from two SBA-licensed SBICs at a critical juncture \nin its development stage. The SBIC program also helped other well-known \ncompanies, when they were not so well-known, such as Intel, Outback \nSteakhouse, America Online, and Callaway Golf.\n  What is not well known is the extraordinary help the SBIC program \nprovides to Main Street America small businesses. These are companies \nwe know from home towns all over the United States. Main Street \ncompanies provide both stability and growth in our local business \ncommunities. A good example of a Main Street company is Steelweld \nEquipment Company, founded in 1932, which designs and manufacturers \nutility truck bodies in St. Clair, Missouri. The truck bodies are \nmounted on chassis made by Chrysler, Ford, and General Motors. \nSteelweld provides truck bodies for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., \nTexas Utilities, Paragon Cable, GTE, and GE Capital Fleet.\n  Steelweld is a privately held, woman-owned corporation. The owner, \nElaine Hunter, went to work for Steelweld in 1966 as a billing clerk \nright out of high school. She rose through the ranks of the company and \nwas selected to serve on the board of directors. In December 1995, \nfollowing the death of Steelweld's founder and owner, Ms. Hunter \nreceived financing from a Missouri-based SBIC, Capital for Business, \nCFB, Venture Fund II, to help her complete the acquisition of \nSteelweld. CFB provided $500,000 in subordinated debt. Senior bank debt \nand seller debt were also used in the acquisition.\n  Since Ms. Hunter acquired Steelweld, its manufacturing process was \nredesigned to make the company run more efficiently. By 1997, \nSteelweld's profitability had doubled, with annual sales of $10 million \nand 115 employees. SBIC program success stories like Ms. Hunter's \nexperience at Steelweld occur regularly throughout the United States.\n  In 1991, the SBIC program was experiencing major losses, and the \nfuture of the program was in doubt. Consequently, in 1992 and 1996, the \nCommittee on Small Business worked closely with the Small Business \nAdministration to correct deficiencies in the law in order to ensure \nthe future of the program.\n  Today, the SBIC Program is expanding rapidly in an effort to meet the \ngrowing demands of small business owners for debt and equity investment \ncapital. And it is important to focus on the significant role that is \nplayed by the SBIC program in support of growing small businesses. When \nFortune Small Business compiled its list of 100 fastest growing small \ncompanies in 2000, 6 of the top 12 businesses on the list received SBIC \nfinancing during their critical growth years.\n  The ``Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001,'' as \namended, would permit the annual interest fee paid by Participating \nSecurities SBICs to increase from 1.0 percent to no more than 1.38 \npercent. In addition, the bill would make three technical changes to \nthe Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (`58 Act) that are intended \nto make improvements in the day-to-day operation of the SBIC program.\n  Projected demand for the Participating Securities SBIC program for FY \n2002 is $3.5 billion, a significant increase over the FY 2001 program \nlevel of $2.5 billion. It is imperative that Congress approve this \nrelatively small increase in the annual interest charge paid by the \nParticipating Securities SBICs before the end of the fiscal year. The \nfee increase included in the bill, 1.38 percent, will allow the program \nto operate at its authorized level--$3.5 billion--an amount needed to \nhelp support small businesses as they help lead out country to an \neconomic recovery.\n\n  The ``Small Business Investment Company Amendments Act of 2001'' \nwould also make some relatively technical changes the `58 Act that are \ndrafted to improve the operations of the SBIC program. Section 3 would \nremove the requirement that the SBA take out local advertisements when \nit seeks to determine if a conflict of interest exists involving an \nSBIC. This section has been recommended by the SBA, that has informed \nme that it has never received a response to a local advertisement and \nbelieves the requirement is unnecessary.\n  The bill would amend Title 12 and Title 18 of the United States Code \nto insure that false statements made to the SBA under the SBIC program \nwould have the same penalty as making false statements to an SBIC. This \nsection would make it clear that a false statement to SBA or to an SBIC \nfor the purpose of influencing their respective actions taken under the \n`58 Act would be a criminal violation. The courts could then assess \ncivil and criminal penalties for such violations.\n  Section 5 of the bill would amend Section 313 of the `58 Act to \npermit the SBA to remove or suspend key management officials of an SBIC \nwhen they have willfully and knowingly committed a substantial \nviolation of the `58 Act, any regulation issued by the SBA under the \nAct, a cease-and-desist order that has become final, or committed or \nengaged in any act, omission or practice that constitutes a substantial \nbreach of a fiduciary duty of that person as a management official.\n  The amendment expands the definition of persons covered by Section \n313 to be ``management officials,'' which includes officers, directors, \ngeneral partners, managers, employees, agents or other participants in \nthe management or conduct of the SBIC. At the time Section 313 if the \n`58 Act was enacted in November 1966, an SBIC was organized as a \ncorporation. Since that\n\n[[Page S11925]]\n\ntime, SBIC has been organized as partnerships and Limited Liability \nCompanies (LLCs), and this amendment would take into account those \norganizations.\n  Time is of the essence. We need to act promptly and pass the Small \nBusiness Investment Company Act of 2001 today, so that the House of \nRepresentatives has time to act before the Congress adjourns in the \ncoming weeks.\n  The bill was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, we began debate about the \neconomic stimulus package. We know the economy is in trouble, and we \nknow we have to act. Clearly, by any standard, we face an economic \nemergency that demands responsible action by Congress.\n  The American people want action by Congress too. They strongly \nsupport our Democratic proposals to provide unemployment insurance and \nhealth insurance to laid-off workers, and Federal assistance to States. \nThey know it's an emergency in the economy and they know it is an \nemergency for the hundreds of thousands of men and women without \nunemployment insurance or health insurance.\n  Yet, some of our colleagues in Congress oppose this action. Instead, \nthey support a bill that would retroactively repeal the corporate \nminimum tax and give the largest corporations $25 billion in direct \npayments from the U.S. Treasury. They don't think laid-off workers who \ncan't afford, or don't have, health insurance are an emergency. \nInstead, they support spending $120 billion to accelerate the reduction \nof upper income tax rates, 80 percent of which won't go into the \neconomy until after next year.\n  Our economy is in trouble. There is no denying it. Just ask the men \nand women who have lost their jobs and have to tell their families \nevery week that they cannot find new employment. They will tell you how \nhard it is to put food on their families' tables each week. They will \ntell you how hard it is to watch their bills piling up with no end in \nsight.\n  If that's not enough, look at the numbers.\n  Only 38 percent of unemployed workers receive unemployment insurance. \nThis figure is down from 75 percent in 1975. And, the figure is much \nworse for low-wage workers. According to a new study by the National \nCampaign for Jobs and Income Support, only 20 percent of unemployed \nlow-wage workers will qualify for benefits during a recession.\n  These workers are least likely to qualify for unemployment benefits, \nand they are most likely to be laid off. They are struggling to keep a \nroof over their families' heads and to afford food for their children. \nWe know that the number of hungry children has grown in recent years. \nUnless we do more to help, the number will continue to grow.\n  Yesterday, America's Second Harvest released the largest, most \ncomprehensive report on the plight of hungry Americans. Last year, 23 \nmillion Americans, including 9 million children, sought emergency food \nrelief through America's Second Harvest. The current downturn in the \neconomy means that even more families are facing the difficult choice \nbetween feeding their children and paying the rent, a choice no person \nshould have to make.\n  These findings demonstrate the dramatic rise in hunger and related \nhealth problems among children. They demonstrate that current \nunemployment benefits are not adequate to help working families during \nthe current economic downturn. We need to do more to see that families \ncan afford to put food on their tables. Our Democratic plan provides \nunemployment benefits to 600,000 more low-wage and part-time workers \nand increase these benefits by at least $25 a week.\n  The economy needs stimulus now. Workers need assistance now.\n  The best way to accomplish both of these goals is to get relief to \nthe families who need it the most. Economists across the country agree \nthat providing relief to low- and moderate-income families is one of \nthe most effective ways to stimulate the economy.\n\n  The Democratic plan would stimulate the economy right away, by \nputting money in the hands of the people most likely to spend it--\ndislocated workers and their families. We do that by strengthening the \nunemployment insurance system, improving workers' ability to afford \nhealth care, and providing a tax rebate for those who did not receive a \nfull rebate earlier this year.\n  Unemployment insurance is the Nation's first line of defense in an \neconomic recession. By putting UI trust fund dollars into the declining \neconomy, we automatically boost consumer spending in communities \naffected by rising unemployment, while meeting essential needs of \nhouseholds hurt by layoffs.\n  A recent study by the Department of Labor shows that every $1 \ninvested in unemployment insurance generates $2.15 for the Nation's \neconomy. That same study estimated that unemployment insurance \n``mitigated the real loss in GDP by 15 percent'' in the last five \nrecessions.\n  According to Joseph Stiglitz, ``we should extend the duration and \nmagnitude of the benefits we provide to our unemployed. This is not \nonly the fairest proposal, but also the most effective. People who \nbecome unemployed cut back on their expenditures. Giving them more \nmoney will directly increase expenditures.''\n  The Congressional Research Service agrees: ``Extending unemployment \ncompensation is, in fact, likely to be a more successful policy for \nstimulating aggregate demand than many other . . . changes.''\n  The Republican plan will put very little money into the hands of \nunemployed workers. It offers no guarantees of extended benefits in \nmost states. In fact, the States with the highest unemployment rates \nare the least likely to receive help under that plan. Even for those \nfew workers who will be helped, the plan won't provide any benefits \nuntil next spring. America's working families must not be left behind \nwhen Congress acts on an economic recovery package.\n  We must also help families afford health insurance. It is also the \nright thing to do for them, and it is the right thing to do for \neconomy. Providing health insurance for laid-off workers improves the \nhealth of our economy. When a parent is forced to choose between health \ninsurance and food on their table, it is unfair for their family, and \nit undermines the economy.\n  On average, health insurance premiums for these families cost nearly \ntwo-thirds of their unemployment insurance. That is why only 18 percent \nof workers eligible for COBRA use this coverage. And millions of \nworkers are not eligible for COBRA at all.\n  This is no time to accept an increase in the uninsured. It is wrong \nfor families and wrong for hospitals, nursing homes, health care \nworkers and many others in the health care sector, which makes up one-\nseventh of our economy.\n  The Democratic economic recover plan provides temporary health \ninsurance for workers who have been laid off in the slowing economy. \nCurrently, workers must pay 65 percent of their unemployment check to \npurchase COBRA health insurance coverage. Our plan to subsidize COBRA \ncoverage would make health care affordable for all displaced workers. \nStates also could receive Federal Medicaid matching payments to cover \nother laid-off workers who do not qualify for COBRA.\n  By protecting both workers eligible for COBRA coverage and increasing \nthe Medicaid matching payments, the Senate Democratic plan provides \nmeaningful health coverage for unemployed Americans while the \nRepublican plan will leave families behind. For unemployed workers who \nare eligible for COBRA, the Senate Democratic plan provides health \ncoverage for 12 months during the economic downturn. The Senate \nRepublican plan provides enough for only 2 weeks of coverage. For \nunemployed Americans who are not eligible for COBRA, the Democratic \nplan again provides coverage for 1 year, while the Republican plan \noffers no assistance.\n\n  The plan to provide unemployed workers with health insurance coverage \nwill also be good for the economy by helping to stop a decline in the \nhealth care sector. If unemployed individuals who lack health insurance \nforgo health care, the health care sector will be hurt during the \ndownturn. The health care system has been one of the most vibrant \nsectors of the economy in recent years. It has been responsible for 30 \npercent of the real growth in gross domestic product and 45 percent of \nthe net increase in jobs in\n\n[[Page S11928]]\n\nthe past year. A reduction in the purchase of health care services has \nan effect on the economy similar to that of other reductions in \nconsumer spending, it dampens economic activity.\n  Finally, a federal stimulus package will do no good if States have to \nmake spending cuts or raise taxes. The current recession is already \nhaving an impact on state budgets. In fact, 35 States have reported \nbudget shortfalls--a shortfall that already totals more than $15 \nbillion and will grow to $30 billion if unemployment continues to \nincrease.\n  This means that states across the country will have to make drastic \ncuts. In particular, they are cutting back on Medicaid. In fact, 20 \nStates are already planning to cut Medicaid. At the same time, the \nnumber of people on Medicaid is expected to grow by as much as 3 \nmillion during this recession, about 2 million of them could be \nchildren.\n  If States cut Medicaid just as more people need it, we are going to \nsee an increase in the uninsured. Also, leading economists believe \nsubstantial cuts in state Medicaid budgets would have dramatic ripple \neffects on the national economy.\n  Our plan provides financial assistance to States to help avoid \ndevastating cuts in Medicaid, cuts that will hurt State economies and \nreduce health coverage. States would receive $5.5 billion through an \nincreased Federal Medicaid matching rate, providing an immediate influx \nof cash into States suffering from the recession-driven budget crisis.\n  The Senate Republican alternative is unacceptable. It fails to \naddress aid to the States, health care or unemployment insurance in any \nmeaningful way.\n  The Democratic plan is a fair balance between tax incentives and \nspending incentives for the economy. The tax incentives in the plan \nmeet the three essential criteria for a stimulus: They will put money \ninto the economy now; they do not impose substantial new long-term \ncosts on the federal budget; and they treat fairly those who are most \nin need.\n  Seventy percent of Americans today pay more in payroll taxes than in \nincome taxes. Yet many of them received no tax rebate earlier this \nyear. The rebate unfairly ignored these low and moderate income \nfamilies. A one-time rebate of payroll taxes to them now will \nimmediately inject $15 billion into the economy, placing the dollars in \nthe hands of people who are likely to spend them immediately. \nEconomists tell us that families with modest incomes are likely to \nspend the extra money they receive right away on needed consumer goods. \nThose with higher incomes are more likely to save it.\n  The Democratic bill also includes temporary, targeted tax cuts to \nstimulate immediate business activity. These changes provide more \nfavorable treatment for new investments now, and they deserve to be \nsupported.\n  Because the tax cuts in the Democratic plan are truly designed to be \nan immediate economic stimulus, they do not incur any substantial cost \nbeyond 2003. This point is vital to our economic recovery. Enacting new \npermanent tax cuts which can trigger large long-term Federal deficits \nwould be counter-productive. Permanent new tax cuts, on top of the \nnearly $2 trillion in tax cuts enacted earlier this year, would \nactually hurt the economy now, by raising the cost of long-term \nborrowing and discouraging the kinds of investment we need most today.\n  The House of Representatives passed, by the narrowest of margins, a \nso-called stimulus package that will not stimulate economic growth in \nthe short term, and will not be affordable in the long term. It merely \nrepackages old, unfair, permanent tax breaks, which were rejected by \nCongress last spring, under the new label of ``economic stimulus.'' The \nAmerican people deserve better.\n  The long-term cost of the House plan is too high, and less than half \nof the dollars would reach the economy next year. The House plan offers \n$46 billion in tax breaks to big businesses by permanently repealing \nthe corporate alternative minimum tax and by giving permanent new tax \ncuts for multinational corporations. These provisions are an \nunacceptable giveaway of public resources.\n  The alternative suggested by our Republican colleagues in the Senate \nis also flawed. Their proposal to accelerate the reduction of upper \nincome tax rates would cost $120 billion over the next decade. Only a \nsmall percentage of these dollars, less than one dollar in four, would \ngo into the economy in 2002. And these dollars would go to those least \nlikely to spend them. The result would be little immediate stimulus, \nlarge long-term costs, and a grossly unfair distribution to the \nwealthiest individuals in our society.\n  In fact, the House Republican proposal gives $115 billion in \npermanent new tax breaks to wealthy individuals and corporations, while \nthe Senate plan would give them $142 billion in new tax breaks. Yet \neach of the Republican tax plans provide only $14 billion for low and \nmoderate income families. Under the GOP plan, the tax cuts for \ncorporations and wealthy individuals are permanent, while the cuts for \nworking families are limited to just one year. The result is unfair, \nand it won't provide the economic stimulus that the nation urgently \nneeds now.\n  Perhaps never before in history has our nation faced such grave \nchallenges. The tragedy of September 11 has touched us all. Together, \nwe witnessed a horror we could not have imagined, and bravery which \ninspires us all. The tragedy may have shaken our basic assumptions \nabout the world in which we live. But, Americans have not retreated in \nfear. Instead, they have risen to meet these new challenges. The spirit \nof September 11 has compelled vast numbers of our fellow citizens to \nask what they can do for their communities and our country.\n  It is time for Congress to do its part to respond to the emergency we \nface. We must respond to the economic crisis the Nation faces. As we do \nso, we must show our dedication to America's best ideals. As we fight \nfor a safer society, we can also create a more just society at the same \ntime. September 11 has taught all Americans that we need to help each \nother as never before.\n  We will not ignore the plight of millions of Americans hurt by this \ntragedy and by economic forces beyond their control. As we work \ntogether to get our economy moving again, we can also work together to \nsee that none are left behind.\n  We have a unique opportunity to give help and hope to every American \nas we enact a stimulus plan that puts America back to work.\n  The American people are meeting this challenge, and we must \ndemonstrate to them that Congress is capable of meeting it too. The \ntest we face now is to pass a stimulus package that truly lifts the \neconomy, and lifts it fairly and responsibly. We do have an emergency, \nand we must address it. The American people are watching this debate \nclosely, and they are waiting for our answer.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, President Bush has asked us to send him an \neffective, anti-recession stimulus package. In the spirit of \nbipartisanship and good faith, he proposed a series of provisions that \nenjoyed both Republican and Democratic support. After much foot-\ndragging, the Democratic majority has finally produced a bill. \nUnfortunately, it appears to be nothing more than a collage of special \ninterest wish lists, from livestock assistance to new entitlements--\nwith very little if anything that will actually stimulate the economy.\n  It is fat on claims but thin on data. It struts around in the light \nof day as a bipartisan package, but makes deals in the dark of night to \nsecure votes. The bill before us is an embarrassment to the Senate; it \nis no good for our country, and it is certainly no good for our \neconomy. There may be many good political reasons for Congress to pass \nan economic stimulus package, but when pet projects trump fiscal \nprudence, we miss a historic opportunity to help the American people \nduring a time of great need. We must improve the incentives to work, \nsave, and invest--the real catalysts of economic growth--and the \nDemocratic bill fails on all three counts.\n  Instead, Democrats insist that increased Government spending serves \nas the primary tool for boosting economic activity. But look what they \nare spending money on--sugar beet disaster programs, rural \ntelecommunications infrastructure, and water-treatment and waste \ndisposal facilities. It is no mystery to leading economists, although \nmy colleagues across the aisle will tell you otherwise, that the better \napproach is to lower tax rates and the tax burden on labor and capital \nto improve\n\n[[Page S11929]]\n\nincentives for workers and business owners. This produces more jobs and \ngenerates higher incomes, which in turn translate into higher \ninvestment and consumer spending.\n  Democrats prefer to add new health-care entitlements and massive \npork-barrel spending items rather than accelerate tax cuts for \nbusinesses and individuals. Given the amount of money that would be \nspent under this bill, we would be better off passing no bill at all. \nThe Republican minority strongly supports the President's proposal, and \nhas crafted a bill that reaffirms his principles for economic recovery. \nAs such, criticism of the Republican bill is direct criticism of the \nPresident, because it is his bare-bones proposal we introduced. To my \nDemocratic friends, I say, don't take refuge in calling Republicans \npartisan; if you object to our bill, criticize the President--it's his \nproposal. The truth is: he's right, and you're wrong.\n  The American economy is starved for business investment. The \nPresident's proposals are designed to stimulate business investment. My \nDemocratic friends say rich people don't spend, only poor people do. \nNow that is real voodoo economics. Alternative Minimum Tax relief for a \nbusiness provides money for reinvestment. Neither rich people nor \ncorporations hide their money in a mattress. They invest it, which does \n. . . what? It creates jobs. What do we need to do today? Create jobs. \nAnd what happens when we do that? People have more money to spend. I \nwould rather people have a job than an unemployment check. I would \nrather they spend their paycheck than an unemployment check.\n  I recently read an article in which a key Democratic political \noperative said, in effect, we will stand with the President in the war, \nbut on the domestic front, we'll use issues to our political advantage. \nRighting our economy is critical to our war effort. We shouldn't be \nplaying politics with it.\n  So let's stop the political games. Time is short. The President has \nasked us to produce a bill for him by the end of the month, and the \nminority intends to do so. We have already come a good distance toward \nthe other side. It is time for Democrats to do the same, and converge \nupon what the President and the American people think is best.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Economic \nRecovery and Assistance to American Workers Act. This legislation is \nabout security, economic security and physical security. This bill will \nhelp us achieve two national priorities: homeland defense and economic \nrecovery.\n  I have four principles for economic stimulus. First, any measure \nshould have a strong, immediate impact. Next, economic recovery \nprovisions should be temporary--sunsetting within one or two years. The \noverall package should be fiscally responsible to ensure long-term \ninterest rates are not negatively affected. And, lastly, the proposal \nshould be focused on those who need the help the most.\n  I also have four principles for homeland defense legislation. First, \nit must give law enforcement the tools they need to prevent attacks. \nNext, it must give first responders the tools they need to respond to \nan act of terrorism. Also, it must improve security of our \ninfrastructure. Lastly, it must provide for greater public information, \nsince information is the antidote for panic.\n  The legislation we're considering today meets my principles.\n  Our Nation is fighting a war against terrorism. This war is on two \nfronts: in Afghanistan, and in every community in America. Our military \nhas the right stuff to defeat our enemies. They have honor, courage and \npatriotism. They also have the best training, best intelligence, best \nequipment.\n  Yet on the home front, our communities are foraging. They are forced \nto choose between keeping communities safe from drug dealers and other \nthugs, and keeping key infrastructure safe--like bridges, power plants \nand stadiums.\n  I recently held a hearing in the VA-HUD Subcommittee to hear the \nmayors perspective on homeland defense. What did we learn at the \nhearing? We learned that our local governments are on the front lines \nof homeland defense. We learned that they are responsible for the \nprotection of our infrastructure, including our bridges, tunnels, and \nmass transit as well as our first responders, our police and fire \nfighters.\n  Yet their resources don't match their responsibilities.\n  What will happen if we don't pass this homeland security bill?\n  Costs are shifted to local governments who must forage for funds from \nlocal programs. That means higher local taxes and lower security across \nour Nation.\n  What does this legislation do? It provides the resources we need to \nsecure our homeland. Local law enforcement is essential to our fight \nagainst terrorism. They are our front line of defense. There are \n650,000 local police officers and only 11,000 FBI agents. This \nlegislation will provide $2 billion that will go to states to be used \nfor counter-terrorism training for police to train them to prevent and \nrespond to terrorist attacks and for new equipment.\n  Our firefighters are our protectors. We must protect the protectors. \nSimply put, that means making sure they have the equipment they need to \nsave lives. Yet fire equipment is very expensive. A new fire engine \ncosts $300,000. A new rescue vehicle costs $500,000. A suit of \nprotective gear for our firefighters costs $1,000 and wears out \nquickly.\n  Each year we provide funds for grants to local fire companies, but \nthe funding has been spartan and skimpy. Over 30,000 fire companies \nrequested almost $3 billion dollars worth of equipment this year, \nincluding $400 million just for personal protection equipment. In \nMaryland, 198 fire companies applied for funds so far this year, and \nyet only 5 received funding.\n  Clearly, we need to do better.\n  Even before the tragedy of September 11th, I was fighting for our \nfirefighters. We were able to increase funding for the fire grant \nprogram by 50 percent to $150 million in the VA-HUD bill. The Homeland \nSecurity bill does even better by providing $600 million for our \nfirefighters.\n  The Homeland Security bill provides $4 billion for our nation's \nbioterrorism preparedness and response needs. Our country's ability to \nrecognize and respond to a bioterrorist attack depends on a strong, \ncoordinated public health system. This bill gives state and local \npublic health departments additional resources to prepare for this new \ngerm warfare. State and local public health departments have already \nbeen stretched thin. This bill gives them the resources to detect, \nrespond, and contain a possible bioterrorist attack.\n  This bill recognizes the important role the CDC plays in a public \nhealth emergency. It expands CDC's laboratory capacity so public health \nofficials can quickly and accurately identify a suspected biological \nagent.\n  To prepare our Nation for a bioterrorist attack, this bill upgrades \nState and local public health departments; expands laboratory capacity \nand surveillance at the State, local, and Federal level; and trains \nfirst responders to recognize the signs and symptoms of a bioterrorist \nattack. The bill also improves State and local communications systems; \nensures that hospitals and emergency rooms have the expertise and \nequipment to handle a surge in patients from a bioterrorist attack; \nincreases our nation's supply of antidotes and vaccines against \npossible biological agents; and, provides significant new resources so \nthat the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) can protect the safety of \nour nation's food supply with more inspectors and additional tools.\n  Investments in the fight against bioterrorism will help in our \nbattles against infectious disease and antimicrobial resistance. Our \nnation's public health system is on the front lines of this new \nbiological war. This bill will make sure they are combat ready and fit-\nfor-duty.\n  Our Coast Guard used to focus on drug and migrant interdiction, and \nsearch and rescue. Today, it's primary role is national security by \nkeeping our ports safe, patrolling around power plants and under \nbridges, and searching suspicious vessels.\n  This bill provides $177 million in operating funds. These funds will \nbe used to improve training, and allow for increased patrols without \nforcing the Coast Guard to cut back on it's other missions.\n  Terrorists look for weaknesses. We can not let them find these \nweaknesses on our nation's railroads. We must ensure the safety of all \nthe components of our rail system. This means providing\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\ntunnel security which means preventing people from entering tunnels. It \nincludes terminal safety--the fact that most terminals are intermodal, \nbringing together different forms of transportation which means that \nit's hard to screen passengers. It means providing bridge security and \nthe protection of track switchboards.\n  Why is railroad security so important? Because each day, 350,000 \npeople ride on our railroads. That's over 20 million people a year. \nForty percent of all freight is transported on our rails which is more \nthan any other mode of transportation.\n  A terrorist attack on our rails could result in a catastrophic loss \nof life and paralyze our economy. Amtrak is ready and willing to \nimprove rail safety, but it must also address its critical \ninfrastructure needs.\n  For example, the tunnels that run through Washington, Baltimore, and \nNew York accommodate trains that carry roughly 350,000 people a day. \nThese tunnels don't meet minimum safety standards. They do not have \nproper ventilation, and there is not adequate lighting.\n  Rail safety requires Federal help. Yet Federal support for Amtrak has \nbeen cut by eighty percent in the last three years eighty percent. \nAnnual appropriations for Amtrak is frozen at $521 million. That's only \nabout half of what Congress authorized in the TEA-21 bill.\n  What does this legislation do? It enables Amtrak to enhance security \nof their overall network by providing $300 million and enabling Amtrak \nto upgrade it's most dangerous tunnels by providing $760 million for \ntunnel safety.\n  As stated before, I have four principles for economy recovery. These \nprinciples have been widely adopted. When I compare the different \nproposals for economic recovery to these principles, the answer is \nclear.\n  The Economic Recovery package proposed by Senator Baucus meets my \nprinciples and provides real and effective measures for economic \nrecovery.\n  This package provides real economic recovery that benefits working \nAmericans who have lost their jobs, helps businesses recover from the \nrecent attacks and the economic downturn, and provides real the boost \nthat this economy needs.\n  The Economic Recovery bill will provide tax relief to nearly 44 \nmillion working Americans who were left out of the last round of \nrebates. This bill will provide the same $300 checks to individuals or \n$600 checks to married couples who tend to pay only payroll taxes. \nThese are the people who live paycheck to paycheck. These are the \nworking Americans who will benefit most from a rebate check.\n  Often times, these hard working Americans have trouble making end \nmeet. This Democratic proposal will help them make ends meet thus \nensuring that the vast majority of these rebates will actually be spent \nwhich will help provide the real boost this economy needs.\n  The Democratic proposal also contains provisions that would help \nbusinesses invest in the new equipment and infrastructure needed to \nrebuild, would help small businesses acquire new equipment, and would \nprovide rebates to companies quickly.\n  The Economic Recovery bill will also help unemployed working \nAmericans by providing a 13 week extension of the period during which \nthey can collect unemployment insurance, by increasing the amount that \nunemployed workers can collect, and by including more displaced workers \nin the unemployment insurance program.\n  I am sure that many will ask how does this help the economy recover? \nThese Americans do not even have a paycheck to live on anymore. But \nthey still have to meet their basic needs of food and shelter. For \nexample, the average unemployment benefits in Maryland are about $950 \nper month, the average rent in Baltimore is about $500/month, and the \naverage grocery bill for a family is about $475. Thus, under the \ncurrent benefit levels families are falling behind and could not \ncontinue their health care which costs at an estimated average cost of \n$ 650/month in my State.\n  Unemployment Insurance is an essential part of the valuable social \nsafety net. In every recession over the past thirty years, unemployment \ninsurance has been extended. It is absolutely crucial to continue this \ngood practice. The Democratic proposal would also expand the \neligibility of those qualifying for benefits. For example, this would \nallow working mothers to look for part-time work.\n  The Economic Recovery proposal would also increase benefits by 15 \npercent or at least $25 a week. This is enough for a couple of bags of \ngroceries or two tanks of gas.\n  President Bush has a proposal that would address unemployment \nbenefits. But the devil is in the details. The Democratic plan helps \nthe 3.2 million already unemployed workers left out by the Bush plan. \nUnder the Bush proposal, about 25,000 to 30,000 more Marylanders would \nhave to lose their jobs and wait until March 2002 before Maryland's \nworkers would qualify for any extensions under the Bush proposal.\n  The Economic Recovery bill provides guaranteed benefits to workers \nlaid off prior to September 11 who may be having difficulty finding \ntheir next job. It would extend benefits to part-time workers, low-wage \nworkers, and would help most hospitality and airline workers that have \nbeen especially hard hit.\n  The Economic Recovery bill would also help provide health care to \ndisplaced workers who have lost their jobs since September 11th through \nthe coming year. So that just because they temporarily lose their job \nthey do not also lose their health care.\n  The economic recovery bill provides a 75 percent COBRA subsidy for up \nto 12 months for workers to continue health insurance through their \nformer employer's plan. It allows States to cover the remaining 25 \npercent of the premium for low-income workers.\n  For unemployed workers who are not eligible for COBRA, it gives \nStates the option to provide Medicaid coverage for these workers for up \nto 12 months. These proposals are temporary; they end on Dec. 31, 2002.\n  Under the Democratic Economic Recovery plan, unemployed workers will \nget the health care they need, temporarily, and this will help \nstimulate the economy. Unemployed workers with health insurance will \nhave more money to spend on other items because they won't have to pay \nhigh out-of-pocket health care costs.\n  For example, a mom or dad in Prince George's County can afford to buy \na refrigerator to replace the broken one or buy school clothes for \ntheir growing child because they did not have to pay lots of money to \ntake their child to the emergency room for a severe earache.\n  Unemployed workers will spend money on health care because if you \nhave health insurance, you are more likely to go to the doctor to get \nthe treatment you need.\n  Finally, the Democratic proposal temporarily strengthens the Medicaid \nsafety net when unemployed workers will need it the most. States across \nthe country are facing budget shortfalls and are considering Medicaid \ncuts at the same time more unemployed workers will need health care \nthrough Medicaid. This provision provides additional resources to \nstates so that states don't have to resort to serious cutbacks in their \nMedicaid program in order to balance their budgets this year. This \nprovision is important to Maryland and has the strong support of the \nNational Governors' Association.\n  During times of crisis, our Nation comes together. We have seen that \nsince the terrible events of September 11th. The terrorists thought \nthey would cripple us, but they have only made us stronger. We want to \nhelp those in need.\n  Yet volunteers and philanthropy cannot take the place of public \npolicy. The Economic Recovery and Homeland Security bill puts our \nvalues into action to help our fellow citizens to get back on their \nfeet and to protect our citizens from the evil acts of our enemies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a matter that \nshould be intertwined with any economic stimulus package that passes \nthis Chamber--providing airline depreciation on the sale of new and \nrefurbished aircraft.\n  The aviation industry and the industry's employees have been hit \nespecially hard in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. The \neconomic woes reach far beyond slumping ticket sales and the layoff of \nairport personnel. These difficult times are stretching to\n\n[[Page S11931]]\n\nthe heart of the aviation industry, to the companies that manufacture, \nreconstruct, and refurbish aircraft.\n  By providing a depreciation allowance for the aviation industry, we \nwill avert the loss of more jobs in this major industry.\n  Kansas is a state that has a tremendous interest in the aviation \nindustry. Boeing, Cessna, Raytheon, and Bombardier, which all have \nmajor plants based in Wichita, employ tens of thousands of Kansans. \nWhile the airline bailout package will go a long way toward preventing \nimmediate mass layoffs, it is not doing enough to ensure that the sale \nof aircraft will rebound from their current lulls.\n  If we provide a depreciation allowance equal to 40 percent of the \nadjusted basis for the qualified property acquired by those purchasing \naircraft, we will provide a strong incentive for individuals and \ncorporations to increase their purchases from the aviation industry. In \nso doing, we would provide an immediate boost to the economy, while at \nthe same time providing security for aviation-industry employees beyond \nthe 1-year period of the airline bailout.\n  Moreover, it is important that we extend this depreciation allowance \nto include not only new orders, but also aircraft that have been \npurchased or taken in a trade and refurbished or reconstructed, and \nsold to a third party.\n  By taking such steps, production orders will increase, and we will be \nable to ensure that hard-working Americans have jobs beyond the time-\ntable of the airline bailout package.\n  This is good for America. It is good for Kansas, and it is something \nthat I will be working to see implemented as part of an economic \nstimulus package.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I was hoping to make a statement yesterday \non this important subject, but I was tied up chairing the Agriculture \nCommittee in consideration of our new farm bill. I would like to speak \nbriefly on the subject of bioterrorism and the economic stimulus/\nhomeland security proposal considered by the Senate. The defeat of this \nlegislation on a budget point of order was especially disappointing to \nme because it included a crucial $4 billion initiative to combat \nbioterrorism. Senator Specter and I worked closely with Senator Byrd to \ndevelop this funding proposal, which is a comprehensive plan to better \nprotect Americans from anthrax, smallpox, and other bioterrorism \nthreats.\n  I have the privilege to chair the appropriations subcommittee which \nfunds our health programs. Our subcommittee has for the past several \nyears provided increased funding to combat bioterrorism. We have made \nreal progress as a result. However, much more remains to be done. To \ndetermine what additional steps are necessary, our subcommittee has \nheld three hearings during the past 2 months.\n  We heard from our top Federal officials, including the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, the head of the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention, and head of FBI bioterrorism efforts. We also heard \nfrom distinguished State and local officials and top scientists from \nthe public and private sectors. Their testimony made clear that we are \nnot adequately prepared for this threat. We do not have enough vaccines \nto respond to an attack. Our public health system has been allowed to \ndecay, and needs more help to detect an outbreak quickly, to treat a \nlarge number of infectious patients, and to vaccinate large parts of \nthe country.\n  As I said before, to put the state of our public health system into \nmilitary terms, our troops are ill-trained, our radar is out of date, \nand we are short on ammunition.\n  The plan we developed and which was included in the stimulus package \nis a thoughtful, bipartisan approach. It closely follows the 7 point \nplan I outlined last month. It provides more than twice the resources \nof the President's to bolster our Nation's defenses against a \nbioterrorist attack.\n  In contrast to the President's plan, our proposal prioritizes funding \nto ``first responders'' at the State and local level. We have put the \nbulk of the funding, $1.3 billion, into improving our public health \ndepartments, beefing up local lab capacity and expanding the Health \nAlert Network. We desperately need to make these investments if we want \nto quickly identify, track and contain a bioterrorist attack should we \never be confronted with one. The President's plan neglects this vital \npiece of our response system.\n  Our proposal also includes funding for the production of enough \nsmallpox vaccine for every American should that ever be necessary. As \nwe have seen in recent press reports, the administration's request is \ntoo low to produce enough smallpox vaccine for all Americans.\n  We also allocate $116 million for research on new vaccines. Earlier \nthis month my subcommittee heard testimony from Dr. Fauci at NIH about \nthe promising future of antivirals against smallpox. The \nadministration's plan devotes no money to developing these new drugs.\n  Our plan also provides more money than the President to bolster the \nwork of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We need to \nupgrade their overburdened lab capacity and their disease surveillance \nsystems.\n  It also includes $650 million to improve safety and to safeguard our \nanimal disease labs.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Byrd for the opportunity to work with \nhim on this important funding package. Our Nation's public health \nsystem is now the front lines in our war against terrorism; it should \nbe prepared accordingly.\n  I believe that we cannot leave this year without addressing the \nbioterrorism threat. Whether our package is included in the stimulus \nplan or another appropriations bill, we must get it done.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the stimulus \npackage we recently considered in the Senate, and the disturbing new \ndefinition of patriotism that was associated with it. As I think most \nof my colleagues are aware, the bill we considered was laden with \nrewards for wealthy donors. Now, I think these days we would hardly be \nable to recognize a stimulus package, or any kind of emergency \nspending, if it weren't loaded down with provisions designed to benefit \nspecial interests. This practice certainly isn't new. But what is new, \nis the attempt to cloak these giveaways in a kind of patriotism.\n  A recent Washington Post editorial quoted a lobbyist for \nPricewaterhouseCoopers, who has been pushing tax breaks in the bill \nthat would profit clients such as GE and IBM, saying that it would have \nbeen ``irresponsible'' and even unpatriotic for him to behave \notherwise.\n  Patriotic to push for a taxbreak for major corporations? I never \nthought I'd see the day. But here we are, in the midst of the war on \nterrorism, trying to stop a deepening recession, and we were faced with \na stimulus package that was designed to reward wealthy interests, but \ndid very little to boost the economy. And now, to add insult to injury, \nwe've been told that this isn't merely pork barrel politics, but that \nit is downright patriotic. I find that appalling, and I'm sure many of \nmy colleagues did as well.\n  Because today this country is brimming with real patriotism, and I \nthink many of us draw strength from that shared sense of pride in our \ncountry. But some versions of the stimulus bill were nothing to be \nproud of.\n  At this moment I believe that we may well need a stimulus package. \nBut that's not what we were considering; instead we were faced with the \nsame kind of pork-barrel spending we have seen year in and year out, \nexcept that now these provisions were dressed up in red, white and \nblue. That kind of opportunism, at a time like this, is an affront to \nthe American people, and it should be unwelcome in this Chamber.\n  The stimulus bill, and in particular, the House-passed version of the \nbill, represents a lost opportunity for the Nation, and I think the \nAmerican people have the right to ask what went wrong. How, at a time \nwhen the Nation needs a strong stimulus package, did we end up with \nthis pile of pork? And when I say pile of pork, I'm being kind. The St. \nLouis Post Dispatch called it chicken manure. From time to time I like \nto Call the Bankroll on legislation, and talk about the potent mix of \nmoney and influence that results in the kind of legislation that's \nbefore us today. I think it's appropriate to review the donations given \nby the interests that could reap such tremendous benefits from this \nbill.\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\n  According to information from Common Cause and Citizens for Tax \nJustice, just 14 corporations alone would reap a $6.3 billion windfall \nfrom the retroactive repeal of the alternative minimum tax in the \nHouse-passed package. Enron, which has given more than $3.7 million in \nsoft money from 1991 through 2000, will get an estimated $254 million \nrefund under this bill. Chevron Texaco, which gave more that $3.6 \nmillion in soft money over the last 10 years, will get an estimated \nrefund of $572 million. General Electric gave $1.3 million, and they'll \nget $671 million. And this list goes on. Billions upon billions of \ndollars being funneled back to big donors at a time when more and more \nAmericans are out of work, lacking health care coverage and struggling \nto pay their bills.\n  The House package also gave a temporary tax break to multinational \ncorporations on some profits from their foreign operations. As the \nWashington Post pointed out, ``it's hard to see how this measure, which \nwould encourage firms to keep money outside the country, would do \nanything to stimulate the American economy.'' This measure rewards some \nof the biggest donors in the banking, investment and life insurance \nindustries. Some of the biggest donors in these industries include \nMerrill Lynch, which has given more than $2.2 million in soft money \nover the last 10 years, and Citigroup, which has given more than $2.1 \nmillion during the last 10 years, according to Common Cause.\n  The House-passed package even included Medical Savings Accounts, \nwhich soft money donor Golden Rule Financial Corporation and other \ninsurance interests have lobbied for for many years. Golden Rule gave \njust shy of $1.3 million in soft money in the last ten years.\n  The stimulus bill should have been an opportunity to stimulate the \neconomy; instead it turned out to be a chance for special interests to \nadd the provisions they've been pushing for all these years. Wealthy \ninterests haven't hesitated to take this difficult period for the \ncountry and exploit it for their own gain. And if this version of the \nbill ever passes, they will reap an enormous financial windfall.\n  In the last few months, the Nation has endured a great deal, and we \nwill continue to face enormous challenges. As a Congress, we must \naddress the issues before us with the kind of integrity that these \nchallenges will demand. But we can't meet those challenges when the \nlegislative process is hobbled by the clout of special interests. The \nstimulus bill was a sobering example of a bill that went through that \nprocess, and fell far short of its goal.\n  The stimulus bill was a missed opportunity that the Nation may pay \ndearly for down the road. We've missed an opportunity, but we don't \nhave to miss another one. I hope when Congress returns next year, we \nwill rise to meet the next challenge before us: getting campaign \nfinance reform to the President's desk. The Nation is closely watching \nour work here, more now than ever in the wake of September 11. And \nbills like the stimulus package would make any American wonder whether \nwe are truly conducting the people's business on this floor. We must \nrestore integrity to legislative process, and restore the people's \nfaith in us and what we do.\n  I think we can start by voting against this bill, if it comes to us \nin a form like the House-passed bill. But we must do much more, we must \nabolish soft money and shut down the issue ad loophole, and it can't \nwait another year. Campaign finance reform should be one of the first \norders of business when we return next year. The American people are \nlooking to us for leadership, and I believe that this Senate can \nprovide that leadership. We can show the American people that we have \nthe courage and leadership they seek, and we can start by making \ncampaign finance reform the law of the land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11932-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO KEVIN P. POWER, NASA FELLOW\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding NASA Manager, Kevin P. Power, upon his \ndeparture from my staff. Mr. Power was selected as a Congressional \nFellow to work in my office because of his knowledge of the aerospace \nindustry, NASA programs, and the John C. Stennis Space Center in my \nhome State of Mississippi. It is a privilege for me to recognize the \nmany outstanding achievements he has provided for the U.S. Senate, \nNASA, and our great Nation.\n  During his NASA fellowship, Mr. Power worked on legislation affecting \nNASA and the aerospace industry. He worked hard to ensure that the NASA \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 2002 included legislative \nprovisions that will support specific programs aimed at fostering the \ndevelopment of a robust U.S. space propulsion industry, which includes \nrocket engine testing at Stennis Space Center. Specifically, he helped \nensure that NASA's rocket engine test facilities are ready to provide \ncontinued support for testing under NASA's Space Launch Initiative.\n  Mr. Power also worked to ensure that adherence to past legislative \nprovisions affecting land remote sensing data buys are being met to \ncontinue the stimulation of a private sector remote sensing industry \nwithout competition from the U.S. Government.\n  Mr. Power graduated from the University of New Orleans, where he \nreceived a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering, prior \nto beginning his engineering career with the U.S. Navy in Annapolis, \nMD, as a civilian engineer working on submarine acoustics. He \ntransitioned to an aerospace career as a contract engineer supporting \nSpace Shuttle launches at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida and \nthen joined NASA shortly after the Shuttle's return to flight following \nthe Challenger disaster.\n  As a project engineer with NASA, he supported various propulsion \ndevelopment programs at Stennis Space Center, including the Air Force's \nNew Launch System, NASA's Advanced Solid Rocket Motor, the NASA/Air \nForce National Aerospace Plane, and the NASA X-33 Aerospike Engine. \nDuring this time he attended Florida Tech, where he received a Master \nof Science in Management degree and eventually transitioned to a job \nwith more responsibilities as a NASA project manager for Boeing's \nEvolved Expendable Launch Vehicle and NASA's Rocket Based Combined \nCycle test facility.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Power is married to the former Susan Foreman of \nCrowley, LA. They have two children, a 7-year-old-son Brandon and a 5-\nyear-old daughter Madison, and are expecting their third child next \nyear in March. Mr. Power will return to NASA Stennis Space Center to \ncontinue his endeavors in the area of rocket propulsion testing. I will \ntruly miss his experience and assistance he has provided to me, and I \nwish him all the very best as he helps NASA advance its efforts in the \nareas of space propulsion and remote sensing in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11932-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11932-S11933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECLASSIFICATION OF SCRANTON-WILKES BARRE-HAZLETON, WILLIAMSPORT, AND \n                 SHARON METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania for working with me on this very important issue of \nMedicare provider payment policy, particularly in light of the unique \nfinancial pressures being faced by the hospitals in Scranton-Wilkes \nBarre, Williamsport, and Sharon metropolitan statistical areas, MSAs, \nwhich emanate in part from some glaring disparities in Medicare's \npayment formulas.\n  As I travel around the Commonwealth, many health care leaders have \nconveyed to me their continued concerns about the impact of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997, BBA, on their health care delivery \noperations. Our Pennsylvania constituents, who represent rural, urban \nand community hospitals and systems, have shared with us detailed \ninformation about the financially strained health care delivery \nenvironment under the BBA.\n  We are all aware of the administrative and financial challenges that \nhealth care providers all across the country face, particularly in \ntheir service to our Nation's elderly population. But the environment \nin which the hospitals in these three areas of Pennsylvania are seeking \nto deliver quality health care to their respective communities is even \nmore challenging given that their MSAs contain areas or border on areas \nfrom which higher compensated providers, with similar health care \ndelivery costs, draw their patients, and more importantly, their\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\nworkforce. Facilities located in these areas must compete for workers \nand patients against hospitals in neighboring MSAs with drastically \nhigher wage indices, even when labor and health care delivery costs are \nvirtually identical. This situation is simply not sustainable.\n  And these problems are only exacerbated by our Nation's ongoing \nnursing shortage, and the scarcity of other skilled care givers. Health \ncare workforce shortages are particularly acute in these areas of the \nCommonwealth, and they have the effect of driving up the cost of health \ncare and precipitating the need to increase wages. And although these \nhospitals have taken the step of increasing wages, further reductions \nin the wage index will make it impossible for the hospitals to retain \nor recruit all the caregivers that the communities require.\n  Other regions near the Scranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazleton MSA, including \nNewburgh, Allentown and Harrisburg, continue to recruit workers from \nits skilled workforce.\n  Likewise in the Sharon MSA: All of the hospitals in the Sharon MSA \ncompete with the Youngstown, OH, MSA for nurses, pharmacists, radiology \ntechnicians, and other allied health professionals. As Senator Specter \nhad mentioned, Youngstown pays nurses $2 to $3 more per hour than \nhospitals in Sharon, yet those hospitals receive the lowest area wage \nindex in Pennsylvania.\n  I have been working on this unique Medicare payment problem for more \nthan 2 years now, seeking to enact at least a temporary \nreclassification of several Northeastern Pennsylvania counties into the \nNewburgh, NY--Pennsylvania MSA; Northumberland County into the \nHarrisburg-Lebanon-Carlisle MSA; and Mercer County into the Youngstown-\nWarren, OH, MSA. As Senator Specter had mentioned, there are other \nareas around the country where glitches such as these can be found. And \nwhat we seek to do with the submission of this legislative language is \nto put our colleagues on notice that we are determined to work on a \nbipartisan basis to bring much needed relief to our negatively affected \nhospitals, and to do the same for other areas around the country where \nthese circumstances have caused similar problems and merit similar \nresponse.\n  I have recently spoken directly with Senate Finance Committee Ranking \nMember Grassley about this very issue, and my strong desire to achieve \na legislative fix as soon as possible. I am also a strong supporter of \nlegislation to set the rural wage index nationally at a uniform and \nhigher rate. However, whether or not Congress considers a national \nsolution to this area of Medicare law is unclear, and our hospitals \ncannot afford to wait for a national solution that may be a year or two \naway.\n  In closing, I wish to relay to our colleagues that achieving this \nfinancial relief for these hospitals in Pennsylvania is of utmost \nimportance to myself and Senator Specter. We are willing to work with \nour colleagues in any way in order to bring about stability in the \nfunding of these community health care providers and to ensure that the \nmany Medicare beneficiaries living in the Commonwealth have access to \nneeded care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11933-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING MONTANANS FACING THE SEPTEMBER 11TH TRAGEDY\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, some time has passed since the tragic \nevents that took place in New York, Washington, DC, and Pennsylvania. \nNevertheless, I want to reflect upon the events of that day and draw \nattention to the tremendous good that has evolved in the face of evil. \nSince that time, it has become evident that the American public is the \nmost patriotic and resilient group the world will ever see. Those who \nmay have been strangers are now confidants, those who were \nacquaintances are now considered family.\n  During this trying time, I want both to express my heartfelt \ncondolences to all those directly involved in this tragedy, and to \ncommend and honor those who have devoted their soul to working to \nrestore tranquility and normalcy to the Nation. From firehouses to \nschoolhouses, from New York City to San Francisco and everywhere in \nbetween, Americans have repeatedly demonstrated their capacity for \ncompassion.\n  I want to begin by addressing the families of those who lost their \nlives on United flight 93. I cannot begin to comfort them in their \ngrief, but I must say that they have every reason to be extremely proud \nof the bravery shown by those on Flight 93. Their efforts are commended \nby all who stand here in Congress. As Americans, we all recognize, that \nwe owe your family a debt that cannot be repaid.\n  Montanans have been deeply affected by this tragedy; they have \ncontacted me with their grief, their hope for victory, and their desire \nto aid in the relief effort. Tragically, Adam Larson of Choteau, MT, \nwas an employee of Aon Corp., located on what was the 103rd floor of \nthe World Trade Center. In the midst of the attacks, he phoned his wife \nPatti and told her the building was being evacuated and he was on his \nway to safety. He was last seen by his co-workers following them down \nthe stairs to exit the building, a building he never escaped. Adam \nLarson was 37 years old, and senior vice president for Aon. Many think \nthat because of his outwardly giving personality, he may have stopped \nto help someone in need. I, along with Montanans everywhere grieve with \nthe Larson family, pray for hope, and express our sincere support in \nenduring a set of circumstances that is difficult to comprehend.\n  In addition to grief, Montanans have also displayed the \ncharacteristic resolve that has defined us since our statehood. From \nLibby to Great Falls to Alzada, Montana has joined together to show \npatriotism and support for the American effort. Blood drives are going \non at Malmstrom Air Force base in Great Falls, MT, as I speak today. \nPercentages of all sales in the town of Conrad, MT, are being \ndesignated for the relief effort.\n  I also want to point out the efforts of Burlington Elementary School \nin Billings. The motivation of one 3rd grade cub scout named Jim Rubich \nto raise pennies for the recovery of the WTC and the Pentagon has spun \ninto a full scale effort on the part of many Montana elementary \nschools. Jim, in true Montana spirit, marched up to his teacher's desk \nwith a bag full of pennies and demanded that an effort be enacted to \nraise pennies for the victims of this terrible attack. His message was \nheard loud and clear, and now what began as a penny drive, started by \nthe innocent and unwavering patriotism of one little boy, is on pace to \nraise $18,000. This is the next generation of American workers, \nsoldiers, carriers of freedom, and already in their young life they are \nstrong contributors. I think the promise that is displayed here speaks \nfor itself. We must protect these young people so that they may pick up \nthe torch when it is their time. We cannot and will not fail them. I \npledge to Jimmy Rubich that 20 years from now, his great Nation, the \nUnited States of America, will still be the beacon of freedom that it \nis today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11933-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11933-S11934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE WTO MEETING IN QATAR, TAIWAN'S ACCESSION TO THE WTO, AND TRADE \n                          PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to note that yesterday the WTO \nconcluded its fourth ministerial meeting in Doha, Qatar.\n  Circumstances leading to this meeting were not auspicious. There is a \nwar on, after all, and the Middle East is not the most comfortable \nplace for the champions of globalization and progress.\n  With the global economic slowdown, protectionism is on the rise. Not \nexactly the best time to undertake talks to expand global trade.\n  Many of us remember that in 1999, the WTO met in Seattle in very \ndifficult circumstances. The city was rocked by rioting, the \nparticipants failed to reach consensus, and the basic assumptions \nunderlying international trade were left in tatters. In sharp contrast \nand against some tough odds, the WTO ministerial meeting was a great \nsuccess.\n  The WTO initiated a new Round of international trade negotiations, \nsetting forth an ambitious agenda by overcoming difficult objections \nfrom the EU, the developing world, and even those in this country who \nare less-than-appreciative of the importance of international trade.\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\n  I believe United States Trade Negotiator Robert Zoellick and his team \ndeserves much of the credit for the success of Doha.\n  By skillfully engineering compromise where compromise did not appear \npossible, Ambassador Zoellick has helped to set the table for important \ngains to come in international trade.\n  Thanks to Ambassador Zoellick and President Bush's leadership on \ntrade, the future for US agricultural exporters is brighter, prospects \nfor improvement in the transparency of the WTO are better, and the \ncommitment of all nations to help end the scourge of HIV/AIDS and other \nis more secure. The liberalization of international trade is back on \ntrack.\n  He and his staff were also instrumental in achieving the accessions \nof China and Taiwan at the Doha Ministerial Meeting.\n  I also want to highlight two important other achievements of the Doha \nMinisterial.\n  First, China acceded to the WTO. This culminates the more than 20 \nyears of economic reform in that country, and, I think, places China \nsquarely on the path toward greater political reforms. We should \ncongratulate Ambassador Zoellick for his leadership on that score.\n  Finally, I want to say a special word of congratulation to the people \nof Taiwan for achieving WTO accession at Doha. Taiwan's membership in \ninternational organizations such as the WTO is an important recognition \nof her current and future contributions.\n  Taiwan is a critical member of the international community. The WTO, \nand other global institutions, are better off for Taiwan's membership.\n  Ambassador Zoellick and Assistant USTR Jeff Bader deserve special \nrecognition for ensuring Taiwan's entry into the WTO over the potential \nobjections of the other newest member of that organization.\n  This was a good week for international trade. I hope that the United \nStates Congress will follow up on the successes of this week and \nprovide the President with the authority he needs to negotiate new \ntrade agreements.\n  We need to capitalize on the gains made at Doha, and Trade Promotion \nAuthority for the President is the critical tool he needs to do just \nthat.\n  I am hopeful that the House will act on a bill to provide the \nPresident TPA this session, and that the Finance Committee will have \nthe opportunity to mark-up that bill for a vote on the floor before we \nleave for the holidays.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11934-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise today to express the deep sadness \nand anger that I and many of my Vermont constituents feel about the \nsenseless, cold-blooded murder of one of Mexico's most respected and \ncourageous human rights lawyers, Digna Ochoa y Placido.\n  On October 20, 2001, Ms. Ochoa was shot at near point blank range in \nher office. At her side was a note that threatened other human rights \nactivists who have defended environmentalists, labor leaders, or other \nunjustly imprisoned or tortured by the Mexican army and police. A \nformer nun, Ms. Ochoa was a role model for all human rights defenders, \nbecause of her extraordinary courage, dedication, and commitment to \nsome of the most disadvantaged members of Mexican society.\n  Ms. Ochoa frequently put the people she represented ahead of her own \npersonal safety, and was an easy target for those who represent the \nworst of society, who would threaten or kill the downtrodden to protect \ntheir own crimes. She had received many death threats, and in 1999 she \nwas kidnapped twice. During one of those abductions, her kidnappers \ntied her to a chair, opened a gas canister, and left her to die as the \nfumes slowly filled the room--from which she narrowly escaped.\n  Digna Ochoa's death is a tragedy for all Mexicans. But it is \nparticularly outrageous because it could have been avoided. Although it \nwas widely known that threats and acts of violence were being carried \nout against her and other members of Prodh--the human rights \norganization where she worked--Mexican officials failed to investigate \nor prosecute those crimes.\n  It would be hard to overstate the optimism I felt when Vicente Fox \nwas elected Mexico's President after 70 years of misrule by the PRI. \nThis election meant that Mexico could begin to overcome years of \nofficial corruption, police brutality, injustice and poverty suffered \nby the fast majority of Mexico's population.\n  When President Fox took office, he promised to end the long history \nof abuses by the Mexican army and police. No one expected miracles. No \none expected him to transform those secretive, corrupt and brutal \ninstitutions overnight. But it is the Government's first duty to \nprotect its citizens, and people did expect him to make justice a \npriority, get rid of the old guard, and demand accountability.\n  That has not happened, at least not yet, and Digna Ochoa's death has, \ntragically, focused attention again on this festering problem. There \nare undoubtedly many others who have suffered similar fates--faceless \nMexican who are not widely known, who have been threatened or murdered, \nor who languish in prison without access to justice.\n  To his credit, on November 9 President Fox ordered the release from \nprison of two ecologists, represented by Ms. Ochoa in the past, who \nnever should have been imprisoned in the first place. For possessing \nthe courage to try to stop the destruction of forests where they lived, \nthey were arrested and allegedly tortured.\n\n  The destruction of tropical forests is an urgent problem from \nIndonesia to Latin America, as logging companies compete for profits \nuntil the forests are completely destroyed. Often, the militaries in \nthese countries are directly involved in these destructive, yet \nlucrative, schemes, and do not hesitate to kill or frame those who get \nin their way because they have known only impunity.\n  However, besides releasing these two men, the Mexican Government has \ndone little to respond to Ms. Ochoa's death. A truth commission to \nexamine past human rights abuses has not been established. That is \npresumably because it requires challenging some of the most entrenched, \npowerful, and dangerous forces within Mexican society. Nevertheless, \nPresident Fox made this promise, and that is what is urgently needed.\n  Another troubling case is the imprisonment of Brigadier General Jose \nFrancisco Gallardo, who was convicted of corruption based on evidence \nthat is, at best, inconclusive. Many observers feel that the main \nreason he is in prison and the Mexican Government continues to oppose \nhis release is because he spoke out about abuses in the military. \nPresident Fox must deal with this case immediately.\n  I am convinced that President Fox is the right leader for Mexico at \nthis critical time, and I have confidence in him and his advisors. I do \nnot minimize the herculean tasks they face--political, economic and \nsocial reform on a national scale. But there is no way democracy can \nsucceed in Mexico without the rule of law. And there is no better place \nto start than by tracking down Digna Ochoa's killers, and bringing them \nto justice for all to see.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a piece written by Digna \nOchoa, about her life, which was included in Kerry Kennedy Cuomo's \nextraordinary book ``Speak Truth To Power,'' be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Digna Ochoa\n\n       I am a nun, who started life as a lawyer, I sought a \n     religious community with a social commitment, and the \n     protection of human rights is one of the things that my \n     particular community focuses on. They have permitted me to \n     work with an organization that fights for human rights, \n     called Centro Pro, supporting me economically, morally, and \n     spiritually. This has been a process of building a life \n     project, from a social commitment to a spiritual one with a \n     mystical aspect.\n       My father was a union leader in Veracruz, Mexico. In the \n     sugar factory where he worked, he was involved in the \n     struggles for potable water, roads, and securing land \n     certificates. I studied law because I was always hearing that \n     my father and his friends needed more lawyers. And all the \n     lawyers charged so much. My father was unjustly jailed for \n     one year and fifteen days. He was then disappeared and \n     tortured--the charges against him were fabricated. This led \n     to my determination to do something for those suffering \n     injustice, because I saw it in the flesh with my father.\n       When I first studied law, I intended to begin practicing in \n     the attorney general's office, then become a judge, then a \n     magistrate. I thought someone from those positions could help \n     people. After I got my degree, I became a prosecutor. I \n     remember a very clear issue of injustice. My boss, who was \n     responsible for all of the prosecutions within the attorney \n     general's office, wanted me to charge someone whom I knew to \n     be innocent. There was no evidence, but my boss tried to make \n     me prosecute him. I refused, and he prosecuted the case \n     himself.\n       Up until that time, I was doing well. The job was \n     considered a good one, because it was in a coffee-producing \n     area and the people there had lots of money. But I realized \n     that I was doing the same thing that everyone did, serving a \n     system that I myself criticized and against which I had \n     wanted to fight. I decided to quit and with several other \n     lawyers opened an office. I had no litigation experience \n     whatsoever. But I was energized by leaving the attorney \n     general's office and being on the other side, the side of the \n     defense.\n       The first case I worked on was against judicial police \n     officers who had been involved in the illegal detention and \n     torture of several peasants. We wanted to feel like lawyers, \n     so we threw ourselves into it. Our mistake was to take on the \n     case without any institutional support. I had managed to \n     obtain substantial evidence against the police, so they \n     started to harass me increasingly, until I was detained. \n     First, they sent telephone messages telling me to drop the \n     case. Then by mail came threats that if I didn't drop it I \n     would die, or members of my family would be killed. I kept \n     working and we even publicly reported what has happening. The \n     intimidation made me so angry that I was motivated to work \n     even harder. I was frightened, too, but felt I couldn't show \n     it. I always had to appear--at least publicly--like I was \n     sure of myself, fearless. If I showed fear they would know \n     how to dominate me. It was a defense mechanism.\n       Then, I was disappeared and held incommunicado for eight \n     days by the police. They wanted me to give them all the \n     evidence against them. I had hidden the case file well, not \n     in my office, not in my house, and not where the victims \n     lived, because I was afraid that the police would steal it. \n     Now, I felt in the flesh what my father had felt, what other \n     people had suffered. The police told me that they were \n     holding members of my family, and named them. The worst was \n     when they said they were holding my father. I knew what my \n     father had suffered, and I didn't want him to relive that. \n     The strongest torture is psychological. Though they also \n     gave me electric shocks and put mineral water up my nose, \n     nothing compared to the psychological torture.\n       There was a month of torture. I managed to escape from \n     where they were holding me. I hid for a month after that, \n     unable to communicate with my family. It was a month of \n     anguish and torture, of not knowing what to do. I was afraid \n     of everything.\n       I eventually got in touch with my family. Students at the \n     University, with whom I had always gotten along very well, \n     had mobilized on my behalf. After I ``appeared'' with the \n     help of my family and human rights groups in Jalapa, \n     Veracruz, I was supported by lawyers, most of whom were \n     women. The fact that I was in Veracruz caused my family \n     anguish. At first I wanted to stay, because I knew we could \n     find the police who detained me. We filed a criminal \n     complaint. We asked for the police registries. I could \n     clearly identify some of the officers. But there was a lot of \n     pressure about what I should do: continue or not with the \n     case? My life was at risk, and so were the lives of members \n     of my family. After a month of anguish, my family, \n     principally my sisters, asked me to leave Jalapa for a while. \n     For me, but also for my parents.\n       I came to Mexico City. The idea was to take a three-month \n     human rights course for which I had received a scholarship. I \n     met someone at the human rights course who worked at Centro \n     Pro, one of the human rights groups involved on my behalf. \n     One day he said, ``Look, we're just setting up the center and \n     we need a lawyer. Work with us.'' I had never dreamed of \n     living in Mexico City, and I didn't want to. But I accepted, \n     because the conditions in Jalapa were such that I couldn't go \n     back. Two really good women lawyers in Jalapa with a lot of \n     organizational support took up the defense case I had been \n     working on. This comforted me, because I knew the case would \n     not be dropped--I had learned the importance of having \n     organizational backup. So I started to work with Centro Pro \n     in December 1988. Since I began working with the \n     organization, I've handled a lot of cases of people like my \n     father and people like me. That generates anger, and that \n     anger becomes the strength to try to do something about the \n     problem. At work, even though I give the appearance of \n     seriousness and resolve, I'm trembling inside. Sometimes I \n     want to cry, but I know that I can't, because that makes me \n     vulnerable, disarms me.\n       At this time, because of what happened to me, I needed the \n     help of a psychoanalyst, but I wasn't ready to accept it. The \n     director of Centro Pro prepared me to accept that support. He \n     was a Jesuit and psychologist. For six months, I didn't know \n     he was a therapist. When I found out, I asked him why he \n     hadn't told me. ``You never asked,'' he said. We became very \n     close. He was my friend, my confessor, my boss, and my \n     psychologist, too, although I also had my psychoanalyst.\n       The idea of a confessor came slowly to me. In Jalapa, I had \n     been supported by some priests. When I first ``appeared,'' \n     the first place I was taken was a church. I felt secure \n     there, though as a kid, I had never had much to do with \n     priests, besides attending church. To me they were people who \n     accepted donations, delivered sacraments, and were power \n     brokers. It made an impression on me to see priests \n     committed to social organizations, supporting people.\n       Since I've been at Centro Pro, we've gone through some \n     tough times, like the two years of threats we received \n     beginning in 1995. Once again it was me who was being \n     threatened. My first reaction was to feel cold shivers. I \n     went to the kitchen with a faxed copy of the threat and said \n     to one of the sisters in the congregation, ``Luz, we've \n     received a threat, and they're directed at me.'' And Luz \n     responded, ``Digna, this is not a death threat. This is a \n     threat of resurrection.'' That gave me great sustenance. \n     Later that day another of my lawyer colleagues, Pilar, called \n     me to ask what security measures I was taking. She was--\n     rightfully--worried. I told her what Luz had said and Pilar \n     responded, ``Digna, the difference is that you're a religious \n     person.'' And I realized that being a person of faith and \n     having a community, that having a base in faith, is a source \n     of support that others don't have.\n       Now, some people said to me that my reaction was \n     courageous. But I've always felt anger at the suffering of \n     others. For me, anger is energy, it's a force. You channel \n     energy positively or negatively. Being sensitive to \n     situations of injustice and the necessity of confronting \n     difficult situations like those we see every day, we have to \n     get angry to provoke energy and react. If an act of injustice \n     doesn't provoke anger in me, it could be seen as \n     indifference, passivity. It's injustice that motivates us to \n     do something, to take risks, knowing that if we don't, things \n     will remain the same. Anger has made us confront police and \n     soldiers. Something that I discovered is that the police and \n     soldiers are used to their superiors shouting at them, and \n     they're used to being mistreated. So when they run into a \n     woman, otherwise insignificant to them, who demands things of \n     them and shouts at them in an authoritarian way, they are \n     paralyzed. And we get results. I consider myself an \n     aggressive person, and it has been difficult for me to manage \n     that within the context of my religious education. But it \n     does disarm authorities. I normally dress this way, in a way \n     that my friends call monklike. That's fine. It keeps people \n     off guard. I give a certain mild image, but then I can, more \n     efficiently, demand things, shout.\n       For example, one time there was a guy who had been \n     disappeared for twenty days. We knew he was in the military \n     hospital, and we filed habeas corpus petitions on his behalf. \n     But the authorities simply denied having him in custody. One \n     night we were informed that he was being held at a particular \n     state hospital. We went the next day. They denied us access. \n     I spent the whole morning studying the comings and goings at \n     the hospital to see how I could get in. During a change in \n     shifts, I slipped by the guards. When I got to the room where \n     this person was, the nurse at the door told me I could not go \n     in. ``We are not even allowed in,'' she said. I told her that \n     I would take care of myself; all I asked of her was that she \n     take note of what I was going to do and that if they did \n     something to me, she should call a certain number. I gave her \n     my card. I took a deep breath, opened the door violently and \n     yelled at the federal judicial police officers inside. I told \n     them they had to leave, immediately, because I was the \n     person's lawyer and needed to speak with him. They didn't \n     know how to react, so they left. I had two minutes, but it \n     was enough to explain who I was, that I had been in touch \n     with his wife, and to get him to sign a paper proving he was \n     in the hospital. He signed. By then the police came back, \n     with the fierceness that usually characterizes their \n     behavior. Their first reaction was to try to grab me. They \n     didn't expect me to assume an attack position--the only \n     karate position I know, from movies, I suppose. Of course, I \n     don't really know karate, but they definitely thought I was \n     going to attack. Trembling inside, I said sternly that if \n     they laid a hand on me they'd see what would happen. And they \n     drew back, saying, ``You're threatening us.'' And I replied, \n     ``Take it any way you want.''\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\n       After some discussion, I left, surrounded by fifteen police \n     officers. Meanwhile I had managed to record some interesting \n     conversations. They referred to ``the guy who was \n     incommunicado,'' a term that was very important. I took the \n     tape out and hid the cassette where I could. The police \n     called for hospital security to come, using the argument that \n     it wasn't permitted to have tape recorders inside the \n     hospital. I handed over the recorder. Then they let me go. I \n     was afraid that they would kidnap me outside the hospital, I \n     was alone. I took several taxis, getting out, changing, \n     taking another, because I didn't know if they were following \n     me. When I arrived at Centro Pro, I could finally breathe. I \n     could share all of my fear. If the police knew that I was \n     terrified when they were surrounding me, they would have been \n     able to do anything to me.\n       Sometimes, without planning and without being conscious of \n     it, there is a kind of group therapy among the colleagues at \n     Centro Pro. We show what we really feel, our fear. We cry. \n     There's a group of us who have suffered physically. On the \n     other hand, my religious community has helped me manage my \n     fear. At times of great danger, group prayer and study of the \n     Bible and religious texts helps me. Praying is very \n     important. Faith in God. That has been a great source of \n     strength. And I'm not alone anymore. As a Christian, as a \n     religious person, I call myself a follower of Christ who died \n     on the cross for denouncing the injustices of his time. And \n     if He had to suffer what he suffered, what then can we \n     expect?\n       For years after my father was tortured, I wanted revenge. \n     Then, when I was the torture victim, the truth is that the \n     last thing I wanted was revenge, because I feared that it \n     would be an unending revenge. I saw it as a chain. Three \n     years after coming to Mexico City I remember that a person \n     came to tell me that they had found two of the judicial \n     police officers who tortured me.\n       The person asked if I wanted him to get them and give them \n     their due. At first, I did have a moment when I thought yes. \n     But I thought about it and realized that I would simply be \n     doing what they did. I would have no right to speak about \n     them as I am talking about them now. I would have been one of \n     them.\n       I rarely share my own experience of torture. But I remember \n     talking to a torture victim who was very, very angry, for \n     whom the desire for revenge was becoming destructive. I \n     shared my own experience, and that made an impression on him. \n     But if we don't forgive and get over the desire for revenge, \n     we become one of them. You can't forget torture, but you have \n     to learn to assimilate it. To assimilate it you need to find \n     forgiveness. It's a long-term, difficult, and very necessary \n     undertaking.\n       If you don't step up to those challenges, what are you \n     doing? What meaning does your life have? It is survival. When \n     I began to work, when I took that case in which they made me \n     leave Jalapa, I was committed to doing something against \n     injustice. But there was something else that motivated me, \n     and I have to recognize it, even though it causes me shame. \n     What motivated me as well as the commitment was the desire to \n     win prestige as a lawyer. Thanks to the very difficult \n     situation that I lived through, I realized what was wrong. \n     What a shame that I had to go through that in order to \n     discover my real commitment, the meaning of my life, the \n     reason I'm here. In this sense, I've found something positive \n     in what was a very painful experience. If I hadn't suffered, \n     I wouldn't have been able to discover injustice in such \n     depth. Maybe I wouldn't be working in Centro Pro. Maybe I \n     wouldn't have entered the congregation. Maybe I wouldn't have \n     learned that the world is a lot bigger than the very small \n     world that I had constructed. Thanks to a very difficult, \n     painful experience for me and my family and my friends, my \n     horizons were broadened.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Charles Krauthammer \nfor his fine article in the November 12 issue of The Weekly Standard, \ntitled ``The Real New World Order.'' Not only does Mr. Krauthammer's \narticle present the flawed assumptions and philosophical underpinnings \nof the foreign policies of the Clinton administration--particularly his \ndenunciation of that administration's fealty to the notion of an \noverriding international order defined by treaties and designed to \ninsulate the world from the burden of American hegemony--but also the \ndemands placed upon the administration of George W. Bush in the wake of \nthe events of September 11. It is a compelling piece, and deserves \nnotice.\n  Krauthammer's article was written prior to the dramatic events of the \npast week in Afghanistan. That some of his analysis is out of date in \nlight of the battlefield successes of the so-called Northern Alliance \ndoes not, however, detract from the validity of the main thesis he \npresents in his typically articulate and knowledgeable style. \nKrauthammer argues that the United States, as a result of the terrorist \nattacks that killed thousands of Americans, is confronted with an \nepochal opportunity that, if seized, will facilitate one of the most \nfar-reaching transformations in the history of international relations. \nRather than facing the rising tide of anti-Americanism postulated to be \nthe natural result of the United States' unique status as the world's \nsole superpower, much of the world has actually aligned itself with \nU.S. interests in the face of an elusive enemy brandishing an \napocalyptic view of the current global structure, radical Islamic \nfundamentalism.\n  The developments of the past several days have caught many of us off-\nguard. Little that was known about the Taliban indicated that it would \ncountenance its own defeat as swiftly as has occurred. I do not believe \nthat could have happened had the President not made clear, in word and \ndeed, his commitment to prevail over that brutal regime and the \nterrorist organization it protects and that was responsible for the \nterrible events of September 11. The imperative of victory not yet \nachieved, however, remains. The momentous reaction of the world's major \nregional powers, as well as of governments throughout the Middle East, \nto the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon will prove \nephemeral should we fail to continue to wage this war, and to define \nits parameters, with the determination and clarity evident in the \nPresident's splendid address to the nation before the joint session of \nCongress.\n  I commend Charles Krauthammer for this thoughtful and compelling \narticle, and highly recommend it to my colleagues in the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nKrauthammer article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Weekly Standard, Nov. 12, 2001]\n\n                        The Real New World Order\n\n\n             the american empire and the islamic challenge\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n     I. The Anti-Hegemonic Alliance\n       On September 11, our holiday from history came to an abrupt \n     end. Not just in the trivial sense that the United States \n     finally learned the meaning of physical vulnerability. And \n     not just in the sense that our illusions about the permanence \n     of the post-Cold War peace were shattered.\n       We were living an even greater anomaly. With the collapse \n     of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and the emergency of \n     the United States as the undisputed world hegemon, the \n     inevitable did not happen. Throughout the three and a half \n     centuries of the modern state system, whenever a hegemonic \n     power has emerged, a coalition of weaker powers has \n     inevitably arisen to counter it. When Napoleonic France \n     reached for European hegemony, an opposing coalition of \n     Britain, Prussia, Russia, and Austria emerged to stop it. \n     Similarly during Germany's two great reaches for empire in \n     the 20th century. It is an iron law: History abhors hegemony. \n     Yet for a decade, the decade of the unipolar moment, there \n     was no challenge to the United States anywhere.\n       The expected anti-American Great Power coalition never \n     materialized. Russia and China flirted with the idea \n     repeatedly, but never consummated the deal. Their summits \n     would issue communiques denouncing hegemony, unipolarity, and \n     other euphemisms for American dominance. But they were \n     unlikely allies from the start. Each had more to gain from \n     its relations with America than from the other. It was \n     particularly hard to see why Russia would risk building up a \n     more populous and prosperous next-door neighbor with regional \n     ambitions that would ultimately threaten Russia itself.\n       The other candidate for anti-hegemonic opposition was a \n     truncated Russia picking up pieces of the far-flug former \n     Soviet empire. There were occasional feints in that \n     direction, with trips by Russian leaders to former allies \n     like Cuba, Iraq, even North Korea. But for the Russians this \n     was even more a losing proposition than during their first \n     go-round in the Cold war when both the Soviet Union and the \n     satellites had more to offer each other than they do today.\n       With no countervailing coalition emerging, American \n     hegemony had no serious challenge. That moment lasted \n     precisely ten years, beginning with the dissolution of the \n     Soviet Union in December 1991. It is now over. The challenge, \n     long-awaited, finally declared itself on September 11 when \n     the radical Islamic movement opened its world-wide war with \n     a, literally, spectacular attack on the American homeland. \n     Amazingly, however, this anti-hegemonic alliance includes not \n     a single Great Power. It includes hardly any states at all, \n     other than hostage-accomplice Afghanistan.\n       That is the good news. The bad news is that because it is a \n     sub-state infiltrative entity, the al Qaeda network and its \n     related\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\n     terrorists around the world lack an address. And a fixed \n     address--the locus of any retaliation--is necessary for \n     effective deterrence. Moreover, with the covert support of \n     some rogue regimes, this terrorist network commands \n     unconventional weapons and unconventional tactics, and is \n     fueled by a radicalism and a suicidal fanaticism that one \n     does not normally associate with adversary states.\n       This radicalism and fanaticism anchored in religious \n     ideology only increased our shocked surprise. We had given \n     ourselves to believe that after the success of our classic \n     encounters with fascism and Nazism, then communism, the great \n     ideological struggles were finished. This was the meaning of \n     Francis Fukuyama's End of History. There would, of course, be \n     the usual depredations, invasions, aggressions, and simple \n     land grabs of time immemorial. But the truly world-historical \n     struggles were over. The West had won. Modernization was the \n     way. No great idea would arise to challenge it.\n       Radical Islam is not yet a great idea, but it is a \n     dangerous one. And on September 11, it arose.\n     II. The American Mind\n       It took only a few hours for elite thinking about U.S. \n     foreign policy to totally reorient itself, waking with a jolt \n     from a decade-long slumber. During the 1990s, American \n     foreign policy became more utopian and divorced from reality \n     than at any time since our last postwar holiday from history \n     in the 1920s. The liberal internationalists of the Clinton \n     era could not quite match the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact \n     abolishing war forever for sheer cosmic stupidity. But they \n     tried hard. And they came close.\n       Guided by the vision of an autonomous, active, and norm-\n     driven ``international community'' that would relieve a \n     unilateralist America from keeping order in the world, the \n     Clinton administration spent eight years signing one treaty, \n     convention, and international protocol after another. From \n     this web of mutual obligations, a new and vital \n     ``international community'' would ultimately regulate \n     international relations and keep the peace. This would, of \n     course, come at the expense of American power. But for those \n     brought up to distrust, and at times detest, American power, \n     this diminution of dominance was a bonus.\n       To understand the utter bankruptcy of this approach, one \n     needs but a single word: anthrax. The 1972 Biological Weapons \n     Convention sits, with the ABM treaty and the Chemical Weapons \n     Convention, in the pantheon of arms control. We now know that \n     its signing marks the acceleration of the Soviet bioweapons \n     program, of which the 1979 anthrax accident at a secret \n     laboratory at Sverdlovsk was massive evidence, largely \n     ignored. It was not until the fall of the Soviet Union that \n     the vast extent of that bioweapons program was \n     acknowledged. But that--and the post-Gulf War evidence \n     that Iraq, another treaty signatory in good standing, had \n     been building huge stores of bioweapons--made little \n     impression on the liberal-internationalist faithful. Just \n     before September 11, a serious debate was actually about \n     to break out in Congress about the Bush administration's \n     decision to reject the biological weapons treaty's new, \n     and particularly useless, ``enforcement'' protocol that \n     the Clinton administration had embraced.\n       After the apocalypse, there are no believers. The Democrats \n     who yesterday were touting international law as the tool to \n     fight bioterrorism are today dodging anthrax spores in their \n     own offices. They very idea of safety-in-parchment is \n     risible. When war breaks out, even treaty advocates take to \n     the foxholes. (The Bush administration is trying to get like-\n     minded countries to sign onto an agreement to prevent \n     individuals from getting easy access to the substrates of \n     bioweapons. That is perfectly reasonable. And it is totally \n     different from having some kind of universal enforcement \n     bureaucracy going around the world checking biolabs, which \n     would have zero effect on the bad guys. They hide \n     everything.)\n       This decade-long folly--a foreign policy of norms rather \n     than of national interest--is over. The exclamation mark came \n     with our urgent post-September 11 scurrying to Pakistan and \n     India to shore up relations for the fight with Afghanistan. \n     Those relations needed shoring up because of U.S. treatment \n     of India and Pakistan after their 1998 nuclear tests. Because \n     they had violated the universal nonproliferation ``norm,'' \n     the United States automatically imposed sanctions, blocking \n     international lending and aid, and banning military sales. \n     The potential warming of relations with India after the death \n     of its Cold War Soviet alliance was put on hold. And \n     traditionally strong U.S.-Pakistani relations were cooled as \n     a show of displeasure. After September 11, reality once again \n     set in, and such refined nonsense was instantly put aside.\n       This foreign policy of norms turned out to be not just \n     useless but profoundly damaging. During those eight Clinton \n     years, while the United States was engaged in (literally) \n     paperwork, the enemy was planning and arming, burrowing deep \n     into America, preparing for war.\n       When war broke out, eyes opened. You no longer hear that \n     the real issue for American foreign policy is global warming, \n     the internal combustion engine, drug traffic, AIDs, or any of \n     the other transnational trendies of the '90s. On September \n     11, American foreign policy acquired seriousness. It also \n     acquired a new organizing principle: We have an enemy, \n     radical Islam; it is a global opponent of worldwide reach, \n     armed with an idea, and with the tactics, weapons, and \n     ruthlessness necessary to take on the world's hegemon; and \n     its defeat is our supreme national objective, as \n     overriding a necessity as were the defeats of fascism and \n     Soviet communism.\n       That organizing principle was enunciated by President Bush \n     in his historic address to Congress. From that day forth, \n     American foreign policy would define itself--and define \n     friend and foe--according to who was with us or against us in \n     the war on terrorism. This is the self-proclaimed Bush \n     doctrine--the Truman doctrine with radical Islam replacing \n     Soviet communism. The Bush doctrine marks the restoration of \n     the intellectual and conceptual simplicity that many, \n     including our last president, wistfully (and hypocritically) \n     said they missed about the Cold War. Henry Kissinger's latest \n     book, brilliant though it is, published shortly before \n     September 11, is unfortunately titled Does America Need a \n     Foreign Policy? Not only do we know that it does. We know \n     what it is.\n     III. The New World Order\n       The post-September 11 realignments in the international \n     system have been swift and tectonic. Within days, two Great \n     Powers that had confusedly fumbled their way through the \n     period of unchallenged American hegemony in the 1990s began \n     to move dramatically. A third, while not altering its \n     commitments, mollified its militancy. The movement was all in \n     one direction: toward alignment with the United States. The \n     three powers in question--India, Russia, and China--have one \n     thing in common: They all border Islam, and all face their \n     own radical Islamic challenges.\n       First to embrace the United States was India, a rising \n     superpower, nuclear-armed, economically vibrant, democratic, \n     and soon to be the world's most populous state. For half a \n     century since Nehru's declaration of nonalignment, India had \n     defined itself internationally in opposition to the United \n     States. As one of the founders in 1955 of the nonaligned \n     movement at Bandung, India helped define nonalignment as \n     anti-American. Indeed, for reasons of regional politics \n     (Pakistan's relations with China and with the United States) \n     as well as ideology, India aligned itself firmly with the \n     Soviet Union.\n       That began to fade with the end of the Cold War, and over \n     time relations with the United States might have come to full \n     flower. Nonetheless, September 11 made the transition \n     instantaneous. India, facing its own Taliban-related \n     terrorism in Kashmir, immediately invited the United States \n     to use not just its airspace but its military bases for the \n     campaign in Afghanistan. The Nehru era had ended in a flash. \n     Nonalignment was dead. India had openly declared itself ready \n     to join Pax Americana.\n       The transformation of Russian foreign policy has been more \n     subtle but, in the long run, perhaps even more far-reaching. \n     It was symbolized by the announcement on October 17 that \n     after 37 years Russia was closing its massive listening post \n     at Lourdes, Cuba. Lourdes was one of the last remaining \n     symbols both of Soviet global ambitions and of reflexive \n     anti-Americanism.\n       Now, leaving Lourdes is no miracle. It would likely have \n     happened anyway. It is a $200 million a year luxury at a time \n     when the Russian military is starving. But taken together \n     with the simultaneously reported Russian decision to leave \n     Cam Ranh Bay (the former U.S. Naval base in South Vietnam, \n     leased rent-free in 1979 for 25 years), it signaled a new \n     orientation of Russian policy. On his trip to European Union \n     headquarters in early October, President Vladimir Putin made \n     clear that he sees Russia's future with the West--and that he \n     wants the West to see its future including Russia.\n       This shift is tactical for now. America needs help in the \n     Afghan war. Russia can provide it. It retains great influence \n     over the ``-stans,'' the former Soviet Central Asian \n     republics. From their side, the Russians need hands off their \n     own Islamic problem in Chechnya. Putin came in deal. In \n     Brussels, he not only relaxed his opposition to NATO's \n     expansion to the borders of Russia, not only signaled his \n     willingness to compromise with the United States on missile \n     defense, but broadly hinted that Russia should in essence \n     become part of NATO.\n       Were this movement to develop and deepen, to become \n     strategic and permanent, it could become one of the great \n     revolutions in world affairs. For 300 years since Peter the \n     Great, Russia has been unable to decide whether it belongs \n     east or west. But in a world realigned to face the challenge \n     of radical Islam, it is hard to see why Russia could not, in \n     principle, be part of the West. With the Soviet ideology \n     abandoned, Russia's grievances against the West are reduced \n     to the standard clash of geopolitical ambitions. But just as \n     France and Germany and Britain have learned to harmonize \n     their old geopolitical rivalries within a Western structure, \n     there is no reason Russia could not.\n       Cam Ranh Bay and Lourdes signal Russia's renunciation of \n     global ambitions. What remain are Russia's regional \n     ambitions--to protect the integrity of the Russian state \n     itself, and to command a sphere of influence including its \n     heavily Islamic ``near abroad.'' For the first decade of the \n     post-Cold War era, we showed little sympathy for the first of \n     these goals and none for the second. We looked with suspicion \n     on Russia's reassertion of hegemony over once-Soviet space. \n     The great fight over Caspian oil, for example, was intended \n     to ensure that no pipeline\n\n[[Page S11938]]\n\n     went through Russia (or Iran), lest Russia end up wielding \n     too much regional power.\n       That day may be over. Today we welcome Russia as a regional \n     power, particularly in Islamic Central Asia. With the United \n     States and Russia facing a similar enemy--the radical Islamic \n     threat is more virulent towards America but more proximate to \n     Russia--Russia finds us far more accommodating to its \n     aspirations in the region. The United States would not mind \n     if Moscow once again gained hegemony in Central Asia. Indeed, \n     we would be delighted to give it back Afghanistan--except \n     that Rusia (and Afghanistan) would decline the honor. But \n     American recognition of the legitimacy of Russian Great Power \n     status in Central Asia is clearly part of the tacit bargain \n     in the U.S.-Russian realignment. Russian accommodation to \n     NATO expansion is the other part. The Afghan campaign marks \n     the first stage of a new, and quite possibly historic, \n     rapprochement between Russia and the West.\n       The third and most reluctant player in the realignment game \n     is China. China is the least directly threatened by radical \n     Islam. It has no Chechnya or Kashmir. But it does have \n     simmering Islamic discontent in its western provinces. It is \n     sympathetic to any attempt to tame radical Islam because of \n     the long-term threat it poses to Chinese unity. At the just \n     completed Shanghai Summit, China was noticeably more \n     accommodating than usual to the United States. It is still no \n     ally, and still sees us, correctly, as standing in the way of \n     its aspirations to hegemony in the western Pacific. \n     Nonetheless, the notion of China's becoming the nidus for a \n     new anti-American coalition is dead. At least for now. There \n     is no Russian junior partner to play. Pakistan, which has \n     thrown in with the United States, will not play either. And \n     there is no real point. For the foreseeable future, the \n     energies of the West will be directed against a common enemy. \n     China's posture of sympathetic neutrality is thus a passive \n     plus: It means that not a single Great Power on the planet \n     lies on the wrong side of the new divide. This is \n     historically unprecedented. Call it hyper-unipolarity. And \n     for the United States, it is potentially a great gain.\n       With Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa on the sidelines, \n     the one region still in play--indeed the prize in the new \n     Great Game--is the Islamic world. It is obviously divided on \n     the question of jihad against the infidel. Bin Laden still \n     speaks for a minority. The religious parties in Pakistan, for \n     example, in the past decade never got more than 5 percent of \n     the vote combined. But bin Ladenism clearly has support in \n     the Islamic ``street.'' True, the street has long been \n     overrated. During the Gulf War, it was utterly silent and \n     utterly passive. Nonetheless, after five years of ceaseless \n     agitation through Al Jazeera, and after yet another decade of \n     failed repressive governance, the street is more radicalized \n     and more potentially mobilizable. For now, the corrupt ruling \n     Arab elites have largely lined up with the United States, at \n     least on paper. But their holding power against the radical \n     Islamic challenge is not absolute. The war on terrorism, and \n     in particular the Afghan war, will be decisive in determining \n     in whose camp the Islamic world will end up: ours--that of \n     the United States, the West, Russia, India--or Osama bin \n     Laden's.\n     IV. The War\n       The asymmetry is almost comical. The whole world against \n     one man. If in the end the United States, backed by every \n     Great Power, cannot succeed in defeating some cave dwellers \n     in the most backward country on earth, then the entire \n     structure or world stability, which rests ultimately on the \n     pacifying deterrent effect of American power, will be fatally \n     threatened.\n       Which is why so much hinges on the success of the war on \n     terrorism. Initially, success need not be defined globally. \n     No one expects a quick victory over an entrenched and shadowy \n     worldwide network. Success does, however, mean demonstrating \n     that the United States has the will and power to enforce the \n     Bush doctrine that governments will be held accountable for \n     the terrorists they harbor. Success therefore requires making \n     an example of the Taliban. Getting Osama is not the immediate \n     goal. Everyone understands that it is hard, even for a \n     superpower, to go on a cave-to-cave manhunt. Toppling regimes \n     is another matter. For the Taliban to hold off the United \n     States is an astounding triumph. Every day that they remain \n     in place is a rebuke to American power. Indeed, as the war \n     drags on, their renown, particularly in the Islamic world, \n     will only grow.\n       After September 11, the world awaited the show of American \n     might. If that show fails, then the list of countries lining \n     up on the other side of the new divide will grow. This \n     particularly true of the Arab world with its small, fragile \n     states. Weaker states invariably seek to join coalitions of \n     the strong. For obvious reasons of safety, they go with those \n     who appear to be the winners. (Great Powers, on the other \n     hand, tend to support coalitions of the weak as a way to \n     create equilibrium. Thus Britain was forever balancing power \n     on the Continent by supporting coalitions of the weak against \n     a succession of would-be hegemons.) Jordan is the classic \n     example. Whenever there is a conflict, it tries to decide who \n     is going to win, and joins that side. In the Gulf War, it \n     first decided wrong, then switched to rejoin the American \n     side. That was not out of affection for Washington. It was \n     cold realpolitik. The improbable pro-American Gulf War \n     coalition managed to include such traditional American \n     adversaries as Syria because of an accurate Syrian \n     calculation of who could overawe the region.\n       The Arab states played both sides against the middle during \n     the Cold War, often abruptly changing sides (e.g., Egypt \n     during the '60s and '70s). They lined up with the United \n     States against Iraq at the peak of American unipolarity at \n     the beginning of the 1990s. But with subsequent American \n     weakness and irresolution, in the face both of post-Gulf War \n     Iraqi defiance and of repeated terrorist attacks that \n     garnered the most feckless American military responses, \n     respect for American power declined. Inevitably, the pro-\n     American coalition fell apart.\n       The current pro-American coalition will fall apart even \n     more quickly if the Taliban prove a match for the United \n     States. Contrary to the current delusion that the Islamic \n     states will respond to American demonstrations of \n     solicitousness and sensitivity (such as a halt in the \n     fighting during Ramadan), they are waiting to see the success \n     of American power before irrevocably committing themselves. \n     The future of Islamic and Arab allegiance will depend on \n     whether the Taliban are brought to grief.\n       The assumption after September 11 was that an aroused \n     America will win. If we demonstrate that we cannot win, no \n     coalition with moderate Arabs will long survive. But much \n     more depends on our success than just the allegiance of that \n     last piece of the geopolitical puzzle, the Islamic world. The \n     entire new world alignment is at stake.\n       States line up with more powerful states not out of love \n     but out of fear. And respect. The fear of radical Islam has \n     created a new, almost unprecedented coalition of interests \n     among the Great Powers. But that coalition of fear is held \n     together also by respect for American power and its ability \n     to provide safety under the American umbrella. Should we \n     succeed in the war on terrorism, first in Afghanistan, we \n     will be cementing the New World Order--the expansion of the \n     American sphere of peace to include Russia and India (with a \n     more neutral China)--just now beginning to take shape. Should \n     we fail, it will be sauve qui peut. Other countries--and not \n     just our new allies but even our old allies in Europe--will \n     seek their separate peace. If the guarantor of world peace \n     for the last half century cannot succeed in a war of self-\n     defense against Afghanistan(!), then the whole post-World War \n     II structure--open borders, open trade, open seas, open \n     societies--will begin to unravel.\n       The first President Bush sought to establish a New World \n     Order. He failed, in part because he allowed himself to lose \n     a war he had just won. The second President Bush never sought \n     a New World Order. It was handed to him on Sept. 11. To \n     maintain it, however, he has a war to win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11938-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11938-S11939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GIVE IT UP FOR BUCK O'NEIL\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a true \nhero on the occasion of his 90th birthday.\n  John Jordan O'Neil, Jr. was born on November 13, 1911 in Carrabelle, \nFL. Over the years he has been given many nicknames including Jay, \nFoots, Country, Cap, even Nancy and Old Relic, but the one that endures \nis Buck.\n  As a teenager, he worked in the Sarasota celery fields. The job was \nmiserable, toiling in the oven-hot dirt and muck. He knew there had to \nbe something better, and fortunately for us, he was right. Buck O'Neil \nloves baseball. It's that simple. In his own words he describes what a \nwonderful thing baseball is. ``There is nothing greater for a human \nbeing than to get his body to react to all the things one does on a \nballfield . . . It's as good as music. It fills you up.''\n  You see, by studying the history of baseball one discovers a great \ndeal about the sport's hidden history. Biographer Ken Burns said, ``By \nlifting the rug of our past, we find not only the sins we hoped we had \nconcealed beneath it, but also new and powerful heroes who thrived in \nthe darkness and can teach us much about how to live in the light.''\n  Living through the bitter experiences that our country reserved to \nmen of his color, Buck reflects only gold and light out of despair and \nsuffering. He knows he can go farther with generosity and kindness than \nwith anger and hate. He knows what human progress is all about.\n  When asked to tell of his journey from the Negro Leagues to the \nMajors, Buck's eyes light up. Though he has been telling the story for \nthe past fifty years, he never tires of recounting the playing days and \nthe men who lived it--men like Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Cool Papa \nBell. Like many a good story and storyteller, it's interesting to see \nhow much they've improved over the years.\n\n[[Page S11939]]\n\n  When others would have preferred to live in a more enlightened time, \nBuck has no regrets. ``Waste no tears on me,'' he says. ``I didn't come \nalong too early. I was right on time.'' What a lesson we can learn from \nthis great hero. ``Give it up''--that's Buck's way. Don't be so formal. \nDon't hide behind polite conversations. Don't be afraid to show someone \nsome love. Show what's in your heart, always; don't keep it inside. On \nthis special occasion I urge us all to ``Give it up.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11939-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11939-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/15/senate-section/article/S11939-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE SEVENTH BIENNIAL REVISION (2002-2006) TO THE UNITED \n     STATES ARCTIC RESEARCH PLAN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 59\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the provisions of the Arctic Research and Policy Act of \n1984, as amended (15 U.S.C. 4108(a)), I transmit herewith the seventh \nbiennial revision (2002-2006) to the United States Arctic Research \nPlan.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe establishment of a homeland security academic centers for public \nhealth preparedness network; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill I call the \n``The Homefront Medical Preparedness Act.''\n  In the past century we have witnessed unprecedented advances in \nscience, technology and medicine and have seen limitless potential to \nimprove the human condition, cure disease, and advance human health in \nways that were once unimaginable. Yet, at the same time we have seen \nsome of these very advances have spawned new threats, threats that were \nsimply inconceivable 100 years ago. The recent outbreaks of anthrax in \nFlorida, New York City, and Washington, DC, coupled with the terrorist \nattack of September 11 have brought to light the compelling need to \nproperly prepare our communities for the threat of bioterrorists \nattacks.\n  A strong public-health infrastructure is the best defense against any \nbioterrorism attack. As a Nation we remain highly vulnerable, not \nbecause we are unprepared, but because we are under-prepared. The \nDepartment of Health and Human Services has made tremendous advances \nover the past few years. However, while significant progress has been \nmade, there are still large gaps in our current approach. Our goal must \nbe to eliminate these gaps and reduce the risk to our Nation and our \ncommunities. As a nation, we must prepare our communities, and improve \nour capacity to respond. Central to an effective response to a \nbioterrorist attack are detection, treatment and containment of a \ndisease epidemic and our Nation's public-health system is on the front \nline in this effort.\n  The Nation's public health system is a complex network of people, \nsystems, and organizations working at the local, State and national \nlevels. The Nation is served by more then 3,000 county and city health \ndepartments, more than 3,000 local boards of health, 59 State and \nterritorial-health departments, tribal-health departments more than \n160,000 public and private laboratories. Current estimates suggest that \nthe public-health workforce includes 500,000 professionals employed at \nthe local, State and national levels. According to the Health Resource \nand Services Administration in 1989 only 44 percent of these 500,000 \nworkers had formal, academic training in public health and those with \ngraduate public health degrees were an even smaller fraction. As of \n1997, 78 percent of local health departments executives did not have \ngraduate degrees in public health. Changes on the public health system \nhave brought new demands on the workforce and identified a need for \nadditional training and education. Many public-health workers do not \nhave the necessary skills and knowledge base to meet the needs of the \nemerging public-health system and public-health threats. These \nstatistics highlight the critical need to provide these professionals \nwith the most up-to-date training, technology, and tools necessary to \nmeet the increasing demands and emerging needs.\n  An important first step has already been taken. The Centers for \nDisease Control has created Centers for Public Health Preparedness \nacross the country. There are currently 14 centers total: 7 Academic \nCenters, 4 Speciality Centers, and 3 Local Exemplar Centers. The \nAcademic Centers link schools of public health, State and local-health \nagencies and other academic and community health partners to foster \nindividual preparedness on the front line. The Speciality Centers focus \non a topic, professional discipline, core public-health competency, \npractice setting or application of learning technology. And finally, \nthe Local Exemplar Centers develop advanced applications at the \ncommunity level in three areas of key importance to preparedness for \nbioterrorism and other urgent health threats: integrated communications \nand information systems across multiple sectors; advanced operational \nreadiness assessment; and comprehensive training and evaluation.\n\n  In Missouri we are fortunate to have not one, but two centers in St. \nLouis at St. Louis University School of Public Health: an Academic \nCenter the Heartland Center for Public Health Preparedness as well as a \nSpeciality Center The Center for the Study of Bioterrorism and Emerging \nThreats. The School of Public Health at St. Louis University has \nclearly been on the forefront of this issue. I was honored to have \nsecured Federal appropriations dollars necessary for startup costs for \nthe Center for the Study of Bioterrorism, the only specialty center \nwith a primary focus on bioterrorism in the country. The center \nprovides public-healthcare providers and healthcare facilities with the \ntools needed for preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation of \nintentional or naturally occurring outbreaks. Under the leadership of \nDr. Evans, the center has developed training curriculum that is being \nused nationwide to train healthcare providers and public-health \ndepartments. In fact, the center's training materials were used by the \nCDC to train emergency health personal, healthcare providers and other \npublic-health workers in New York to respond to the September 11 \nattack.\n  But more can and must be done. Today I introduced legislation which \nwill expand the national network of Centers of Public Health \nPreparedness by adding new centers across the country as well as \nfunneling more valuable resources to existing centers to meet urgent, \npublic-health training needs. This bill will authorize $50 million and \nwould instruct the Director of the Centers for Disease Control to \nestablish a\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\nnational network of Centers for Public Health Preparedness utilizing \nthe existing Centers for Public Health Preparedness Program to train \nand to prepare the national public-health workforce, healthcare \nproviders and the general public to respond to bioterrorist threats.\n  Each center, housed at an accredited school of public health will 1. \nprovide training and education to local and state health department \nstaff, emergency first responders, and primary and acute care providers \non the best practices necessary to protect against, and respond to the \narray of potential threats facing the American public, including \nbioterrorism, infectious disease and weapons of mass destruction; 2. \nprovide information to healthcare [providers and other components of \nthe healthcare industry to protect against and respond to the threat of \nbioterrorism, infectious disease and weapons of mass destruction; and \n3. provide information and education on relevant bioterrorist threats \nto the public.\n  Under my legislation each center, both new and existing, will receive \nat least $1 million per year, but may receive additional sums per year \nif the CDC deems additional resources are necessary to carry out \nregional or national training activities at a particular center.\n  I believe that our schools of pubic health across the country, \nworking in conjunction with the CDC can provide training and education \nto local and State health department staff, emergency first responders, \nand primary and acute-care providers on the best practices necessary to \nprotect against, identify and respond to the wide array of potential \nthreats facing the American public, including bioterrorism, infectious \ndisease and weapons of mass destruction. The capacity and competency of \nour healthcare workforce is a critical component of the basic public-\nhealth infrastructure necessary to protect our communities. As with our \nmilitary, our public-health system must be prepared at all times to \nward off threats and respond to crises. Our national public-health \ninfrastructure is the first and in some cases the only line of defense. \nLike our military, our public-health system must be at a constant state \nof readiness nationwide and this legislation will enable our public \nhealth system to better achieve this goal. If the public-health system \nis fully prepared then communities across the country will be better \nprotected.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1706. A bill to provide for the enhanced control of biological \nagents and toxins; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, in May 1995, Larry Wayne Harris of Ohio \nordered three vials of the bacterium that causes bubonic plague to be \nFedEx'ed from a company in Rockville, MD. At the time, all he needed \nwas a credit card and letterhead. He invented both the letterhead and \nthe lab he claimed to be from. In fact he was a member of a white \nsupremacist group who would later tell of plans to kill hundreds of \nthousands of Americans with the plague. But when he was arrested with \nthe vials, he was only charged with mail fraud for misrepresenting \nhimself. No Federal license, registration, or even notification was \nrequired to obtain, own, or work with the plague.\n  Partly as a result of this incident, Congress in 1996 passed \nprovisions in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act to \nclose the specific loophole. This bill required the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to regulate transfer of a select list of biological \nagents. But it did not regulate possession or use of the agents. The \nsubsequent regulations incorporated safety standards for labs receiving \nthese agents, but set virtually no security standards to make sure \nthese agents don't end in the wrong hands. They carved out broad \nexemptions, including all certified clinical laboratories. And they \nincluded little means of enforcement.\n  I think most Americans would be shocked to learn that we still have \nno idea who has anthrax, plague, or other biological agents in their \nfreezer. Labs have had to register only if they have sent or received \none of the agents since 1996. We know the recent attacks with anthrax \nused the so-called ``Ames'' strain of anthrax, which was identified at \nIowa State University some decades ago, but we don't know how many labs \nin the United States have samples of this strain today. If we had that \ninformation before the next attack, especially if a less common agent \nor strain were used, it could be the starting point for the next \ninvestigation.\n  We can and we must do better. We have long had relatively tight \ncontrols on materials that can be used in nuclear weapons. You must \nhave a license from the NRC or an agreement state to possess these \nnuclear materials. There are strict safety and security requirements on \nthe licensees, and a small army of inspectors to make sure they comply. \nLicensees must report all shipments and receipts, and report any losses \nfrom their inventory of a gram or more of the most dangerous materials. \nBioweapons have been called ``the poor man's nuclear bomb'' because \nthey could cause similar devastation, but are easier and cheaper to \nobtain. It's time we place reasonable controls on biological agents \ntoo.\n  That is why I am introducing the Bioweapons Control and Tracking Act \nof 2001. This bill would for the first time impose five important \ncontrols on dangerous biological agents and toxins to reduce the risk \nof an accident or terrorist attack. First, the bill would direct the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to regulate the possession and \nuse of select biological agents as well as their transfer.\n\n  Second, the regulations would require registration with the \nDepartment for possession, use, and transfer of select agents and \ntoxins. The registration would include known characterization of the \nagents, such as the strains, in order to facilitate their traceability. \nThe Department would be required to maintain a database of locations \nand characterizations of the agents using the registration information.\n  Third, the regulations would also have to include safeguards and \nsecurity standards, as well as safety standards. Labs would be required \nto restrict access to the agents to people who need to handle them. And \na process would be set up to screen people who do have access to the \nagents.\n  Fourth, the bill requires that any exemptions from these regulations \nbe consistent with public health and safety. Any exemptions from \nregistration requirements would have to still allow a complete database \nof agents of concern, but exemptions could be allowed either for a lab \nthat only temporarily possesses the agent or for samples that could not \nbe useful for making a weapon. These exemptions are intended to avoid \nan unnecessary burden on thousands of clinical labs that receive \ndiagnostic samples for testing and, if the test is positive for a \nselect agent, quickly pass the sample on to a government lab or destroy \nit.\n  Fifth, the bill includes strong enforcement measures. The bill \nspecifically authorizes inspections to ensure compliance. To give teeth \nto the enforcement, it enacts a civil penalty for violating the \nregulations of up to $250,000 for an individual of $500,000 for a \ngroup. And it enacts a criminal penalty up to 5 years in prison for \npossession or transfer of select agents by someone who is not \nregistered, and also for transfer to a person who is not registered.\n  In addition, the bill exempts information about specific labs from \ndisclosure under the Freedom of Information Act to prevent one-stop-\nshopping for information by would-be bioterrorists. It requires \nbiennial review of the list of biological agents and toxins of concern. \nAnd it codifies the law in Public Health Service Act, maintains current \nregulations until the Secretary issues new ones, and sets a deadline \nfor the registration and associated penalties.\n  I have been working with several of my colleagues on a $4 billion \npackage to strengthen our response to a possible bioterrorism attack, \nso that we can stop a terrible attack from becoming a national or world \ncalamity. We need these funds to strengthen the public health \ninfrastructure, monitor food safety, and build our capacity for \nvaccinations. But for just a few millions dollars we may be able to \nprevent an attack, to stop bioterrorists before they even get hold of \nthe necessary agents. We must no delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1708. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to ensure the\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\ncontinuity of medical care following a major disaster by making private \nfor-profit medical facilities eligible for Federal disaster assistance; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parity in \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Act of 2001. The horrific attacks \nof September 11 and subsequent anthrax exposures have focused our \nattention on the need to prepare and respond to emergencies, whether \nthey result from acts of nature or the misdeeds of man. The legislation \nI introduce today will correct a provision in current law that prevents \nmany hospitals from working with the Federal Government to prevent and \nrespond to disasters. When tragedy strikes, the most important \nconsideration shouldn't be a hospital's tax status, but rather its \nability to care for the injured.\n  In 1974, Congress enacted the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act, commonly referred to as the Stafford Act. \nThis important legislation helps States and communities plan for \nemergencies and take steps to minimize the damage inflicted by a \npotential disaster. Once a disaster strikes, the Stafford Act \nauthorizes the President to provide communities the resources they need \nto respond quickly and recover completely.\n  While the Stafford Act has helped countless communities respond to \ndisasters, it has one glaring shortcoming, it prohibits the President \nand Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, from offering assistance \nto hospitals that are owned or managed by private companies. As a \nresult, there are 36 hospitals in my home State of Kentucky which are \nineligible to receive Federal disaster mitigation and recovery funds.\n  I find it incomprehensible that the Federal Government would deny \nneeded disaster assistance to a county hospital, simply because of its \nownership, management structure, or tax status. Is a tornado any less \ndevastating in one community than another, simply because of a local \nhospital's tax status? Are they any less deserving of the Federal \nGovernment's support? I think not.\n  What I find most troubling about this disparity is that it \ndisproportionately affects rural communities, whose hospitals are \nfrequently owned by the community but operated by private companies. \nMany small towns and rural counties prefer this sort of relationship \nbecause it allows them to ensure their citizens have access to needed \nhealth care services, while relieving themselves of the burdens of \noperating a modern hospital. In the rural Kentucky communities of \nCaldwell, Cumberland, Crittenden, Fleming, Marshall, Monroe, Ohio and \nBell Counties, the community owns the hospital but contracts with a \nprivate management firm to direct the hospital's day to day operations. \nAs a result of this relationship, these publicly owned hospitals are \nnot eligible for Federal disaster mitigation or recovery assistance.\n  Hospitals are critical community resources which must be able to \nprovide services in an emergency, regardless of their ownership or \nmanagement structure. That is why I am proud to introduce the Parity in \nEmergency Preparedness and Response Act with my colleague from \nLouisiana, Ms. Landrieu. This legislation would eliminate the disparity \nwhich exists between nonprofit and investor-owned hospitals and allow \nall eligible hospitals to apply for disaster mitigation and recovery \nfunds. Our bill does not create an entitlement for hospitals that are \nowned or operated by private companies. The Stafford Act is clear in \nstating the President ``may make contributions'' to help damaged \nhospitals respond to and recover from an emergency, and this \nlegislation does nothing to diminish the President's discretion in this \nregard.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the need to ensure that our Nation's public \nhealth infrastructure is capable of responding to unanticipated \nemergencies has received renewed attention in Congress. In fact, the \nSenate will soon consider comprehensive legislation to address the \ngrowing threat of bioterrorism and protect the safety of our food \nsupply. While I strongly support the intent of this legislation, it \nwill be woefully incomplete if it does not allow all hospitals, \nincluding investor-owned hospitals, to apply for disaster assistance.\n  Hospitals play a vital role in responding to emergencies, regardless \nof their management structure. I look forward to working with Ms. \nLandrieu and our colleagues in the Senate to pass this legislation and \nensure that all of America's hospitals are prepared to respond to \ndisasters.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of hospitals which would become \neligible for disaster assistance under my legislation be printed in the \nRecord, and I ask unanimous consent the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1708\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the James Peak Wilderness and the James \nPeak Protection Area in the State of Colorado, and for other purposes; \nto the\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the ``James Peak \nWilderness and Protection Area Act.'' This language is the product of \nyears of detailed negotiations regarding an area of great majesty in my \nhome State of Colorado.\n  When discussing public lands issues, the potential uses for land are \nas varied and numerous as the diverse groups of users. Oftentimes, one \ncamp is pitted against another, each convinced that its view is right \nto the point that it necessarily excludes the other interested party. \nAnd the result is that nothing viable happens. No land is protected and \nno uses of land are preserved. Instead, we read of angry exchanges, \nthat if it were not for one side being so stubborn in its view, then we \nwould have had a bill, while ignoring their own immobile position.\n  This bill, I am very proud to say, is different from the all-too-\ncommon discourse that I described.\n  This bill stands as a testament to what can be achieved when \ninterested parties stop for a moment and listen to each other. I would \nlike to take this moment to commend the work of my friends in the \nHouse, Representatives Udall and McInnis for their efforts on this \nissue.\n  The ``James Peak Wilderness and Protection Area Act'' respects the \ndiverse uses of Colorado's lands and recognizes those differences \naccordingly. This bill designates about 14,000 acres in Boulder, Clear \nCreek, and Gilpin Counties as Wilderness, and enlarges the existing \nIndian Peaks Wilderness by an additional 3,195 acres. Further, this \ncarefully balanced approach designates 16,000 acres of national forest \nland as the ``James Peak Protection Area.'' The Protection Area in \nGrand County would disallow development of the land, but would permit \nrecreational use for the public's continued enjoyment.\n  I am pleased with the careful compromises that were necessary in \ncrafting this bill and proudly introduce it today. I only wish this \nkind of cooperation was more evident in the other discussions about \npublic lands in America.\n  I hope for quick passage of this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the procedures that apply to consideration \nof interstate class actions to assure fairer outcomes for class members \nand defendants, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2001.'' I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nKohl, Hatch, Carper, Thurmond, Chafee and Specter. The Class Action \nFairness Act of 2001 will help curb class action lawsuit abuses and \nprotect consumers who find themselves as potential members of class \naction lawsuits. At the same time, the bill will preserve class action \nlawsuits as an important tool that brings representation to the \nunrepresented.\n  In the last Congress, Senator Kohl and I introduced S. 353, the \n``Class Action Fairness Act of 1999.'' We worked diligently and in good \nfaith to address concerns expressed by members of the Judiciary \nCommittee, as well as others interested in this issue. The Judiciary \nCommittee marked up and favorably voted out a Hatch/Grassley/Kohl \namendment in the nature of a substitute. Unfortunately, S. 353 was not \nconsidered by the full Senate in the 106th Congress because of the \npress of other legislative business.\n  Today, we are introducing the bill that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee agreed to in the last Congress, with minor modifications. We \nhave also included a few more provisions that will better protect class \nmembers. I am hopeful that in this Congress, the Senate will consider \nthis bill promptly and enact the much needed changes to the current \nsystem.\n  Presently, the class action system is awash with problems. More and \nmore class action lawsuits are being filed to the benefit of attorneys, \nwhere attorneys agree to settlements that give them huge fees while \ntheir clients get little of value or nothing. A 1999 Rand Report on \nclass actions found that state courts often give most of the money in a \nsettlement to the lawyers, not the class members they supposedly \nrepresent. The Judiciary Committee held hearings where we heard about \nsettlement after settlement where class members got coupons or nothing, \nbut the lawyers got millions of dollars in attorneys' fees. We heard \nabout class members being awarded restrictive coupons for airline \ntickets, as well as class members who received a lawyers' bill that was \nhigher than the compensation for their injury. But the lawyers got all \nthe money in fees.\n  Is this fair? I thought the lawyers were supposed to represent their \nclients, not themselves. I am not saying that attorneys should not be \npaid for their work, but it seems to me that lawyers have found class \nactions to be an easy way for them to make money.\n  The Judiciary Committee also heard that lawyers game the class action \nrules to keep class actions in certain State courts, particularly \ncourts that are quick to certify a class without adequately considering \nthe interests of all class members or courts that aren't careful in \nevaluating whether the proposed class meets the required class \ncriteria. Those State courts are also more likely to rubber-stamp \nsettlement proposals without scrutinizing them for fairness. For \nexample, we learned that in some cases members of a class that lived \ncloser to the courthouse in which the settlement was filed got a larger \nrecovery than others. We also learned about settlements where a bounty \nwas paid to class representatives which was disproportionately larger \nthan that provided to absent class members.\n  It's easy for lawyers to forum-shop and keep these cases in State \ncourt, for example, attorneys name irrelevant parties to their class \naction suits in an effort to destroy diversity. Attorneys make \ninaccurate statements about the jurisdictional amount to keep the \ndefendant from transferring the case to Federal court, but then retract \nthem one year later when removal is barred. In addition, similar class \nactions are filed in many State courts and cannot be consolidated, \nincreasing the chances for collusive settlements or situations where \nthere is a ``race to settlement'' by the attorneys. This also creates \nsignificant inefficiencies and waste of court resources.\n  A much more troublesome effect of this problem is the fact that State \ncourts are making decisions for the entire country. The 1999 Rand Study \nand a more recent study by the Manhattan Institute found that most of \nthe increase in class action lawsuits is occurring in State courts. \nWith this happening, basically State courts are dictating national \npolicy. Class actions are usually the cases that involve the most \npeople, the most money, and the most interstate commerce issues. But it \nis clear that these cases really belong in Federal court. And there is \na constitutional basis for this. Article 3, section 2 of the \nConstitution states that controversies between citizens of different \nStates should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts. \nHowever, the present Federal jurisdiction statutes were originally \nenacted over a century ago, so they do not take the modern day class \naction into account and basically exclude them from the Federal court \nsystem.\n  Consequently, the current system produces aberrant results as to what \ncan or cannot proceed in Federal court. For example, right now, a slip \nand fall case worth $75,001 involving two residents from different \nStates can be heard in Federal court. But a nationwide class action \nthat involves millions of citizens residing in all 50 States, that \nseeks billions of dollars in damages, implicates the laws of every \nState, and involves interstate commerce issues, is mainly confined to \nthe State courts. Why should a State county court with an elected judge \ndecide these cases, but not a Federal judge?\n  By only allowing State courts to hear nationwide class actions, State \ncourts can dictate national policy or improperly impose their State's \nlaws on the citizens of other States. Let me illustrate this serious \nproblem with the State Farm case. In a large class action case brought \nagainst State Farm on the issue of auto insurers' use of \n``aftermarket'' auto parts in automobile repairs, an Illinois court \napplied Illinois auto insurance law to the other 49 States. Several \nState attorneys general intervened in the case and expressed their \nopposition to the court's application of Illinois law to their \ncitizens. The National Association of State Insurance Commissioners and \nPublic Citizen also expressed concern over the outcome of this case. \nThe reason for this opposition was because State laws and policy on the \nuse of aftermarket parts varies widely State by State, yet the Illinois \nState court imposed its auto insurance laws on the other States. The \nability of a State court to have such a monumental impact on the laws \nof other States, by basically overturning national policy and the laws \nor regulations of the other 50 States is more than troubling.\n  So, there are compelling reasons for us to take remedial steps \nregarding the class action system. The Class Action Fairness Act of \n2001 takes a good first step at addressing some of the problems we have \nidentified. To address the problem of class members not knowing\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nwhat is going on in a class action or settlement, or not being clear as \nto what their rights are, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 has a \nprovision that notice to class members needs to contain an explanation \nof their rights and other matters concerning settlement terms, \nincluding attorneys' fees, in a plain and easy to understand language.\n  To address the problem where class members get nothing and attorneys \nget millions, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 provides that \nnotification of any proposed settlements must be given to the State \nattorneys general or the primary regulatory or licensing agency of any \nState whose citizens are involved. This is so that the State attorney \ngeneral or responsible agency can intervene in the case to ensure that \nsettlements are fair. To address the problem of special bounties that \nunfairly impact the absent members of a class, the bill contains a new \nprovision that would prohibit the payment of bounties to class \nrepresentatives that are disproportionately larger than that provided \nto absent class members. To address the problem of discrimination \nbetween class members based on geographic location, the bill contains a \nnew provision that prohibits courts from approving settlements that \naward some class members a larger recovery than others based on \ngeography.\n  To start responding to the issue of outrageous attorneys fees, the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2001 asks the Judicial Conference to \nreport back to Congress in a year after studying attorneys' fees in \nclass actions and how judges can do a better job in making sure that \nclass action settlements are fair. The bill also includes new \nprovisions that protect class members against net losses and require \nthe courts to make specific findings as to the fairness of coupon and \nother non-cash class action settlements.\n  To respond to the problem where plaintiff lawyers game the system to \nimproperly keep class action cases in State court, or where similar \nclass action suits are being filed in different State courts, or where \nState courts are imposing their laws on citizens of other States and \nformulating national policy, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2001 \nloosens diversity and removal requirements so that class action cases \nwith national ramifications can be heard in Federal courts and similar \nclass actions can be consolidated. The bill is crafted so that it will \nnot harm federalism or deprive State courts of their ability to \nadjudicate cases for their own citizens. That is because there is a \nconstitutional basis for class actions to proceed in Federal court. \nClearly, the Federal courts are a better forum for these kinds of cases \nthat are of nationwide importance.\n  In conclusion, there is substantial evidence that class action abuse \nis going on and we should do something about it. I think that the Class \nAction Fairness Act of 2001 is a good, balanced bill that addresses \nsome of the problems that we've identified. Moreover, there has been a \nlot of compromise to address concerns about the bill. We have also \nimproved the bill by adding additional consumer protections. So, the \nClass Action Fairness Act of 2001 will preserve the class action \nprocess, but put a stop to the more egregious abuses in the system.\n  In addition, I'd like to thank my friend Senator Kohl, who has worked \nso closely with me over the years in bringing the issue of class action \nabuse to the forefront. We both share a deep concern over protecting \nthe rights of consumers, while making sure that the due process rights \nof all litigants are preserved. I'd also like to thank Senator Hatch, \nwho worked with us to move this bill forward in the Judiciary Committee \nlast year, and worked on improvements to the bill.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join Senators Kohl, Hatch, Carper, \nThurmond, Chafee and Specter in supporting this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Class action lawsuits are an important and valuable \n     part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \n     efficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties \n     by allowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action \n     against a defendant that has allegedly caused harm.\n       (2) Over the past decade, there have been abuses of the \n     class action device that have--\n       (A) harmed class members with legitimate claims and \n     defendants that have acted responsibly; and\n       (B) undermined public respect for our judicial system.\n       (3) Class members often receive little or no benefit from \n     class actions, and are sometimes harmed, such as where--\n       (A) counsel are awarded large fees, while leaving class \n     members with coupons or other awards of little or no value;\n       (B) unjustified awards are made to certain plaintiffs at \n     the expense of other class members; and\n       (C) confusing notices are published that prevent class \n     members from being able to fully understand and effectively \n     exercise their rights.\n       (4) Abuses in class actions undermine the national judicial \n     system and the concept of diversity jurisdiction as intended \n     by the framers of the United States Constitution, in that \n     State and local courts are--\n       (A) keeping cases of national importance out of Federal \n     court;\n       (B) sometimes acting in ways that demonstrate bias against \n     out-of-State defendants; and\n       (C) making judgments that impose their view of the law on \n     other States and bind the rights of the residents of those \n     States.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) assure fair and prompt recoveries for class members \n     with legitimate claims;\n       (2) restore the intent of the framers of the United States \n     Constitution by providing for Federal court consideration of \n     interstate cases of national importance under diversity \n     jurisdiction; and\n       (3) benefit society by encouraging innovation and lowering \n     consumer prices.\n\n      SEC. 3.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to any civil \n     action commenced on or after the date of enactment of this \n     Act.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Grassley, \nHatch, Carper, and Thurmond in introducing the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 2001. This legislation addresses the growing problems in class \naction litigation, particularly unfair and abusive settlements that \nshortchange plaintiff class members.\n  We have worked together on this legislation in past Congresses. In \nfact, last year a similar version of class action reform passed the \nHouse of Representatives and was approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. Unfortunately, the session ended before we could bring it to \na vote of the full Senate.\n  The problem that this bill addresses is simple. Too often, the class \naction procedure is being hijacked by unscrupulous parties who are more \ninterested in making a dollar for themselves than helping the plaintiff \nclass members remedy a legitimate harm. Let me give you just one well \nknown example of the unfairness this bill attempts to correct.\n  A few years ago, a class action lawsuit was begun against the Bank of \nBoston. Martha Preston from Baraboo, WI was an unnamed class member of \nthat suit against her mortgage company. The case involved allegations \nthat the bank had overcharged its mortgage customers and had kept \nexcess money in their escrow accounts. It was ultimately settled. Ms. \nPreston was represented by a group of plaintiffs' lawyers who she had \nnever met. The settlement they negotiated for her was a bad joke. She \nreceived four dollars and change in the lawsuit, while her attorneys \npocketed $8 million in fees.\n  Soon after receiving her four dollars, Ms. Preston discovered that \nher lawyers helped pay for their fees by taking $80 from her escrow \naccount. Naturally shocked, she and the other plaintiffs sued the \nlawyers who in turn sued her in Alabama, a State she had never visited, \nfor $25 million. Not only was she $75 poorer for her class action \nexperience, but she also had to defend herself against a $25 million \nsuit by the very people who took advantage of her in the first place.\n  In response to this case and many more like it, we developed a \nmeasured, reasoned response to protect class action plaintiffs against \na system which is subject to abuse. As in past years, the bill can be \ndivided into three main sections, all of which provide enhanced \nprotections for individual plaintiffs.\n  First, the bill provides that every class action notice be written in \nplain, easily understandable English. Too many of the class action \nnotices are written in legalese, designed to make it impossible for the \naverage American to comprehend his rights and responsibilities as a \nmember of the plaintiff class. The bill requires that a statement be \nincluded at the beginning of the notice written in large, bold type \nalerting the plaintiff that he is involved in a class action lawsuit \nand that his legal rights are affected by the contents of the notice. \nThis means that every class member will understand the subject matter \nof the case and his rights and responsibilities as a participant in the \nlawsuit.\n\n  Further, if the case were settled, the notice to the class members \nwould clearly describe the terms of the settlement, the benefits to \neach plaintiff and a summary of the attorneys fees in the case and how \nthey were calculated. Currently, none of this information is clearly \ncommunicated to the class members.\n  Second, the bill requires that notice be given to State Attorneys \nGeneral or the appropriate State regulatory authorities about proposed \nclass settlements in Federal court which affect their constituents. \nThis encourages a neutral third party to weigh in on whether a \nsettlement is fair and to alert the court if they do not believe that \nit is. The Attorney General review is an extra layer of security for \nthe plaintiffs and is designed to ensure that abusive settlements are \nnot approved without a critical review by one or more experts.\n  Third, the bill makes it easier to move State class action cases to \nFederal court by changing the diversity rules governing these actions. \nClass action cases often have national implications and are joined by \nplaintiffs from many, if not most, States. Currently, class actions are \nfrequently heard by a State court judge in a venue chosen by the \nplaintiffs' attorneys to maximize the chance that the class action will \nbe certified.\n  For class actions, the certification process is usually more than \nhalf the battle. Once a set of plaintiffs succeeds in getting a judge \nto certify them as a class, the defendants are often faced with \nextraordinary costs associated with preparing for trial and dealing \nwith a multitude of plaintiffs. So, the defendants settle the case at \nterms beneficial to the plaintiffs' attorneys, often at the expense of \nthe plaintiffs themselves.\n  A recent study on the class action problem by the Manhattan Institute \ndemonstrates that class action cases are being brought \ndisproportionately in a few counties where plaintiffs expect to be able \nto take advantage of lax certification rules.\n  The study focused on three county courts, Madison County, IL; \nJefferson County, TX; and Palm Beach County, FL, that have seen a steep \nrise in class action filings over the last several years that seems \ndisproportional to their populations. They found that rural Madison \nCounty, IL ranked third nationwide, after Los Angeles County, \nCalifornia and Cook County, Illinois, in the estimated number of class \nactions filed each year, whereas rural Jefferson County and Palm Beach \nCounty ranked eighth and ninth, respectively. As plaintiff attorneys \nfound that Madison County was a welcoming host, the number of class \naction suits filed there rose 1850 percent between 1998 and 2000.\n  Another trend evident in the research was the use of ``cut-and-\npaste'' complaints in which plaintiffs' attorneys file a number of \nsuits against different defendants in the same industry challenging \nstandard industry practices. For example, within a one-week period \nearly this year, six law firms filed nine nearly identical class \nactions in Madison County alleging that the automobile insurance \nindustry is defrauding Americans in the way that they calculate claims \nrates for totaled vehicles.\n\n  The system is not working as intended and needs to be fixed. The way \nto fix it is to move more of these cases currently being brought in \nsmall state courts like Madison County, IL to Federal court.\n  The Federal courts are better venues for class actions for a variety \nof reasons articulated clearly in a RAND study. RAND proposed three \nprimary explanations why these cases should be in federal court. \n``First, Federal judges scrutinize class action allegations more \nstrictly than State judges, and deny certification in situations where \na State judge might grant it improperly. Second, State judges may not \nhave adequate resources to oversee and manage class actions with a \nnational scope. Finally, if a single judge is to be charged with \ndeciding what law will apply in a multistate class action, it is more \nappropriate that this take place in federal court than in State \ncourt.''\n  We all know that class actions can result in significant and \nimportant benefits for class members and society, and that most class \nlawyers and most state courts are acting responsibly. Class actions \nhave been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain \nredress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate \nindividuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursue claims that collectively would otherwise be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is \nweeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation we \npropose attempts to do this.\n  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this legislation. We do not \nclose the\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\ncourthouse door to any class action. We do not require that State \nattorneys general do anything with the notice they receive. We do not \ndeny reasonable fees for class lawyers. And we do not mandate that \nevery class action be brought in Federal court. Instead, we simply \npromote closer and fairer scrutiny of class actions and class \nsettlements.\n  Right now, people across the country can be dragged into lawsuits \nunaware of their rights and unarmed on the legal battlefield. What our \nbill does is give back to regular people their rights and \nrepresentation. This measure may not stop all abuses, but it moves us \nforward. It will help ensure that unsuspecting people like Martha \nPreston don't get ripped off.\n  We believe this is a moderate approach to correct the worst abuses, \nwhile preserving the benefits of class actions. It is both pro-consumer \nand pro-defendant. We believe it will make a difference.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, there is little doubt that serious problems \nexist within our Nation's judicial system, especially in the way that \ninterstate class action lawsuits are handled and administered in local \ncourtrooms across this country. Increasingly, parties to class actions \nhave taken to forum shopping to pick sympathetic local courts where, \nmore and more often, plaintiffs are offered coupon settlements and \nlawyers are awarded enormous fees.\n  According to recent studies, while Federal class action filings over \nthe past 10 years have increased over 300 percent, class action filings \nin State courts have increased over 1,000 percent. However, interstate \nclass actions involve more citizens in more States, more money, and \nmore interstate commerce ramifications than any other type of civil \nlitigation. They are the paradigm of what our Framers envisioned when \nthey invented Federal diversity jurisdiction, as reflected in Article \nIII of the Constitution. These State court statistics are even more \ntroubling in light of the fact that many State courts have crushing \ncaseloads and far fewer resources available to them than their Federal \ncounterparts to manage these important and complex cases.\n  The primary reason that interstate class actions have remained in \nState court despite their complex nature is because it is relatively \neasy for plaintiffs' class attorneys to defeat both the statutory \n``complete diversity'' requirement by adding non-diverse parties and \nthe $75,000 ``amount in controversy'' requirement by aggregating \nindividual claims to be less than this amount. Interestingly, the \n``complete diversity'' requirement was adopted by Congress in the late \n1700s, well before the development of modern class action lawsuits.\n  Simply put, the Class Action Fairness Act would allow Federal courts \nto adjudicate class actions where the collective amount in controversy \nis more than $2 million, and where any member of the class of \nplaintiffs is from a different State than any defendant. This means \nthat many State class actions may be removed to Federal court. \nNonetheless, the bill does not extend Federal jurisdiction to encompass \nintrastate class actions, where the claims are governed primarily by \nthe laws of the State in which the case is filed and the majority of \nthe plaintiffs and the primary defendants are citizens of that State. \nSo there is no federalism issue here. All the bill does is to protect \nconstitutionally mandated diversity jurisdiction--``suits between \nCitizens of different States.''\n  I am aware that there are those that say that the bill would \n``flood'' Federal courts. But, again, according to Article III of the \nConstitution and our Founding fathers, these cases belong in Federal \ncourt. Critics making the judicial overload argument also ignore the \nfact that this bill does not require that interstate class actions be \nheard in Federal courts. It simply provides the option for either side. \nIn jurisdictions where the State courts provide a relatively level \nplaying field, there is no reason to believe that all class actions \nwill be removed to Federal court.\n  I should also point out that this bill would not prohibit any class \naction from being filed. It is merely a process or procedural bill. It \nsimply determines the court in which interstate class actions with \nsignificant national implications should be adjudicated--that is, in \nFederal court.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this common-sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1714.

A bill to improve the ability of the United States to \nprepare for and respond to a biological threat or attack; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Kennedy, and a number of our colleagues to introduce \nvitally important legislation, the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of \n2001.'' This bipartisan bill, which represents the very best effort of \na number of our colleagues in the Senate, responds to the threat of \nbioterrorism by focusing our Nation's efforts to prevent, prepare for \nand respond to any future bioterrorist attacks.\n  Events of recent weeks have made clear the danger we currently face. \nIn the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center \nand Pentagon, terrorists have used the mail to deliver anthrax to \ncommunities across America. In doing so, they have also spread fear \nacross our great nation and have underscored the threats that \nbioterrorism poses. If they had employed a more sophisticated delivery \nmechanism, or weaponized smallpox or another communicable virus, our \nhealth care system may have been overwhelmed.\n  Last year, Congress enacted bipartisan legislation to revitalize our \npublic health defenses at the local, State and national levels. The \nFrist-Kennedy ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' \nauthorized a series of important initiatives to strengthen the Nation's \npublic health system, improve hospital response capabilities, upgrade \nthe rapid identification and early warning systems at the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC, improve the training of health \nprofessionals to diagnose and care for victims of bioterrorism, enhance \nour research and development capabilities, and take additional steps \nnecessary to prevent, prepare for and respond to biological attacks.\n  Today's legislation, the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001,''\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\nbuilds on the foundation laid by the Public Health Threats Act, a \nfoundation built on prevention, preparedness, and response.\n  The ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act'' takes a number of steps to \nprepare our Nation for these threats. It includes important measures to \nimprove our health system's capacity to respond to bioterrorism, \nprotect the Nation's food supply, speed the development and production \nof vaccines and other countermeasures, enhance coordination of \ngovernment agencies responsible for preparing for and responding to \nbioterrorism and increase our investment in fighting bioterrorism at \nthe local, State, and national levels.\n  The bill authorizes roughly $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2002 \nemergency funding toward these critical activities. I believe it is \nimportant that this funding be considered in the context of the \nexisting agreement limiting overall appropriations this year to $686 \nbillion in addition to the $40 billion emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill. I will work very hard to ensure that \nthe priorities outlined in this authorization legislation are included \nwithin this framework.\n\n  The ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001'' is a comprehensive bill \nthat takes a major step toward better preparing our nation to respond \nto the special challenges posed by biological weapons. We have worked \ndiligently with many of our colleagues and the administration over the \nseveral weeks, and I believe that the product of those efforts \nrepresents a strong bill that includes some of the best ideas of both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  I know the bill is stronger due to the input of so many of our \ncolleagues and the leadership and guidance of the administration, and I \nwould like to thank several of my colleagues for their efforts. \nSpecifically, I would like to thank Senator Collins for her \ncontributions regarding food safety and the appropriate emphasis on \nchildren, Senator Hutchinson for his assistance with the provisions \nrelated to vaccine development and production, Senator Roberts and \nMajority Leader Daschle for their contributions to this bill in the \narea of agricultural safety, and many of our other colleagues who \ncontributed in a bipartisan way--Senators Gregg, Hagel, DeWine, Hatch, \nMikulski, Dodd, and Clinton.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that this \nimportant legislation becomes law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecords.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Summary--The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001\n\n       The ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001'' is designed \n     to address gaps in our nation's biodefense and surveillance \n     system and our public health infrastructure. This new \n     legislation builds on the foundation laid by the ``Public \n     Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' by authorizing \n     additional measures to improve our health system's capacity \n     to respond to bioterrorism, protect the nation's food supply, \n     speed the development and production of vaccines and other \n     countermeasures, enhance coordination of federal activities \n     on bioterrorism, and increase our investment in fighting \n     bioterrorism at the local, state, and national levels. The \n     legislation would authorize approximately $3.2 billion in \n     funding for Fiscal Year 2002 (and such sums in years \n     thereafter) toward these activities.\n\n\n         Title I--National Goals for Bioterrorism Preparedness\n\n       Title I of the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness Act'' states \n     that ``the United States should further develop and implement \n     a coordinated strategy to prevent and, if necessary, to \n     respond to biological threats or attacks.'' It further states \n     that it is the goal of Congress that this strategy should: \n     (1) provide federal assistance to state and local governments \n     in the event of a biological attack; (2) improve public \n     health, hospital, laboratory, communications, and emergency \n     response preparedness and responsiveness at the state and \n     local levels; (3) rapidly develop and manufacture needed \n     therapies, vaccines, and medical supplies; and (4) enhance \n     the safety of the nation's food supply and protect its \n     agriculture from biological threats and attacks.\n\n\n        Title II--Improving the Federal Response to Bioterrorism\n\n       Title II requires the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services (HHS) to report to Congress within one year of \n     enactment, and biennially thereafter, on progress made toward \n     meeting the objectives of the Act. It provides statutory \n     authorization for the strategic national pharmaceutical \n     stockpile, provides additional resources to the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to carry out education \n     and training initiatives and to improve the nation's federal \n     laboratory capacity, and establishes a National Disaster \n     Medical Response System of volunteers to respond, at the \n     Secretary's direction, respond to national public health \n     emergencies (with full liability protection, re-employment \n     rights, and other worker protections for such volunteers \n     similar to those currently provided to those who join the \n     National Guard).\n       The bill further amends and clarifies the procedures for \n     declaring a national public health emergency and expands the \n     authority of the Secretary during the emergency period. In \n     declaring such an emergency, the Secretary must notify \n     Congress within 48 hours. Such emergency period may not be \n     longer than 180 days, unless the Secretary determines \n     otherwise and notifies Congress of such determination. During \n     that emergency period, the Secretary may waive certain data \n     submittal and reporting deadlines.\n       A recent report by the General Accounting Office raised \n     concerns about the lack of coordination of federal anti-\n     bioterrorism efforts. Therefore, the bill contains a number \n     of measures to enhance coordination and cooperation among \n     various federal agencies. Title II establishes an Assistant \n     Secretary for Emergency Preparedness at HHS to coordinate all \n     functions within the Department relating to emergency \n     preparedness, including preparing for and responding to \n     biological threats and attacks.\n       Title II also creates an interdepartmental Working Group on \n     Bioterrorism that includes the Secretaries of HHS, Defense, \n     Veteran's Affairs, Labor, and Agriculture, the Director of \n     the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Attorney General \n     of the United States, and other appropriate federal \n     officials. The Working Group consolidates and streamlines the \n     functions of two existing working groups first established \n     under the ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of \n     2000.'' It is responsible for coordinating the development of \n     bioterrorism countermeasures, research on pathogens likely to \n     be used in a biological attack, shared standards for \n     equipment to detect and protect against from biological \n     pathogens, national preparedness and response for biological \n     threats or attacks, and other matters.\n       Title II also establishes two advisory committees to the \n     Secretary. The National Task Force on Children and Terrorism \n     will report on measures necessary to ensure that the health \n     needs of children are met in preparing for and responding to \n     any potential biological attack or event. The Emergency \n     Public Information and Communications Task Force will report \n     on appropriate ways to communicate to the public information \n     regarding bioterrorism. Both of these committees sunset after \n     one year.\n       The title also contains a Congressional recommendation that \n     there be established an official federal internet website on \n     bioterrorism to provide information to the public, health \n     professionals, and others on matters relevant to \n     bioterrorism. The title further requires that states have a \n     coordinated plan for providing information relevant to \n     bioterrorism to the public.\n       Additionally, Title II helps the federal government better \n     track and control biological agents and toxins. The Secretary \n     of HHS is required to review and update a list of biological \n     agents and toxins that could pose a severe threat to public \n     health and safety and to enhance regulations regarding the \n     possession, use, and transfer of such agents or toxins. \n     Violations of these regulations could trigger civil penalties \n     of up to $500,000, and criminal sanctions may be imposed. \n     Existing law already regulates the transfer of these \n     pathogens.\n\n\n     title iii--improving state and local preparedness capabilities\n\n       Numerous reports in recent years have found the nation's \n     public health infrastructure lacking in its ability to \n     respond to biological threats or other emergencies. For \n     example, nearly 20 percent of local public health departments \n     have no e-mail capability, and fewer than half have high-\n     speed Internet or broadcast facsimile transmission \n     capabilities. Before September 11, only one in five U.S. \n     hospitals had bioterrorism preparedness plans in place.\n       Title III addresses this situation by including several \n     enhanced grant programs to improve state and local public \n     health preparedness. In addition to converting the current \n     public health core capacity grants established under the \n     ``Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000'' to non-\n     competitive grants, the bill replaces the current 319F \n     competitive bioterrorism grant with a new state bioterrorism \n     emergency program that provides resources to states based on \n     population and that would guarantee each state a minimum \n     level of funding for preparedness activities. States must \n     develop bioterrorism preparedness plans to be eligible for \n     such funding. Activities funded under this grant include \n     conducting an assessment of core public health capacities, \n     achieving the core public health capacities, and fulfilling \n     the bioterrorism preparedness plan. This program would only \n     be authorized for two years.\n       The bill also establishes a new grant program for hospitals \n     that are part of consortia with public health agencies, and \n     counties or cities. To be eligible for the grant, the \n     hospital's grant proposal must be consistent with their \n     state's bioterrorism preparedness plan. Using these grants, \n     hospitals with acquire the capacity to serve as regional \n     resources during a bioterrorist attack. This program is \n     authorized for five years.\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\n      title iv--developing new countermeasure against bioterrorism\n\n       To better respond to bioterrorism, Title IV expands our \n     nation's stockpile of smallpox vaccine and critical \n     pharmaceuticals and devices. The bill also expands research \n     on biological agents and toxins, as well as new treatments \n     and vaccines for such agents and toxins.\n       Since the effectiveness of vaccines, drugs, and \n     therapeutics for many biological agents and toxins often may \n     not ethically be tested in humans, Title IV ensures that the \n     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will finalize by a date \n     certain its rule regarding the approval of new \n     countermeasures on the basis of animal data. Priority \n     countermeasures will also be given enhanced consideration for \n     expedited review by the FDA.\n       Because of the lack of or limitations on a market for \n     vaccines for these agents and toxins, Title IV gives the \n     Secretary of HHS authority to enter into long-term contracts \n     with sponsors to ``guarantee'' that the government will \n     purchase a certain quantity of a vaccine at a certain price. \n     The government has the authority, through an existing \n     Executive Order, to ensure that sponsors through these \n     contracts will be indemnified by the government for the \n     development, manufacture and use of the product as prescribed \n     in the contract.\n       Title IV also provides a limited antitrust exemption to \n     allow potential sponsors to discuss and agree upon how to \n     develop, manufacture, and produce new countermeasures, \n     including vaccines, and drugs. Federal Trade Commission and \n     the Department of Justice approval of such agreements is \n     required to ensure such agreements are not anti-competitive.\n\n\n              Title V--PROTECTING OUR NATION'S FOOD SUPPLY\n\n       With 57,000 establishments under its jurisdiction and only \n     700-800 food inspectors, including 175 import inspectors for \n     more than 300 ports of entry, FDA needs increased resources \n     for inspections of imported food. The President's emergency \n     relief budget included a request for $61 million to enable \n     FDA to hire 410 new inspectors, lab specialists and other \n     experts, as well as invest in new technology and equipment to \n     monitor food imports.\n       Title V grants FDA needed authorities to ensure the safety \n     of domestic and imported food. It allows FDA to use qualified \n     employees from other agencies and departments to help conduct \n     food inspections. Any domestic or foreign facility that \n     manufacturers or processes food for use in the U.S. must \n     register with FDA. Importers must provide at least four hours \n     notice of the food, the country of origin, and the amount of \n     food to be imported. FDA also receives authority to prevent \n     ``port-shopping'' by making food shipments denied entry at \n     one U.S. port to ensure such shipments to do reappear at \n     another U.S. port.\n       The bill gives additional tools to FDA to ensure proper \n     records are maintained by those who manufacture, process, \n     pack, transport, distribute, receive, hold or import food. \n     The FDA's ability to inspect such records will strengthen \n     their ability to trace the source and chain of distribution \n     of food and to determine the scope and cause of the \n     adulteration or misbranding that presents a threat of serious \n     adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals. \n     Importantly, the bill also enables FDA to detain food after \n     an inspection for a limited period of time if such food is \n     believed to present a threat of serious adverse health \n     consequences or death to humans or animals. The FDA may also \n     debar imports from a person who engages in a pattern of \n     seeking to import such food.\n       Title V also includes several measures to help safeguard \n     the nation's agriculture industry from the threats of \n     bioterrorism. Toward this end, it contains a series of grants \n     and incentives to help encourage the development of vaccines \n     and antidotes to protect the nation's food supply, livestock, \n     or crops, as well as preventing crop and livestock diseases \n     from finding their way to our fields and feedlots.\n       It also authorizes emergency funding to update and \n     modernize USDA research facilities at the Plum Island Animal \n     Disease Laboratory in New York, the National Animal Disease \n     Center in Iowa, the Southwest Poultry Research Laboratory in \n     Georgia, and the Animal Disease Research Laboratory in \n     Wyoming. Also, it funds training and implements a rapid \n     response strategy through a consortium of universities, the \n     USDA, and agricultural industry groups.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Frist, to introduce this bipartisan \nlegislation to respond to one of the most severe dangers of terrorism, \nthe grave threat of bioterrorist attacks. I commend Senator Frist for \nhis impressive continuing leadership on this vital issue.\n  We are all well aware of the emergency we face. In recent weeks, 15 \nanthrax cases stretched our health care system to the breaking point. A \nlarger attack could be a disaster for whole communities of Americans. \nThe anthrax attack of the past weeks has sounded the alarm. The clock \nis ticking on America's preparedness for a future attack. We've had the \nclearest possible warning, and we can't afford to ignore it. We know \nthat hundreds, even millions, of lives may be at stake--and we're not \nready yet.\n  The needs are great. A summit meeting of experts in bioterrorism and \npublic health concluded that $835 million was needed just to address \nthe most pressing needs for public health at the State and local \nlevels.\n  The National Governor's Association has said that states need $2 \nbillion to improve readiness for bioterrorism. John Hopkins is spending \n$7.5 million to improve its ability to serve as a regional bioterrorism \nresource for Baltimore. Equipping just one hospital to this level in \neach of 100 cities across America would cost $750 million.\n  Clearly, our legislation is an important downpayment on preparedness. \nBut we must make sure that our commitment to achieving full readiness \nis sustained in the weeks and months to come.\n  Since September 11, the American people have supported our commitment \nof billions of dollars and thousands of troops to battle terrorism \nabroad. But Americans also want to be safe at home. We have an \nobligation to every American that we will do no less to protect them \nagainst terrorism at home than we do to fight terrorism abroad.\n  The need for help at the State and local level is especially urgent. \nIn the first 3 weeks of October alone, State health departments spent a \nquarter billion dollars responding to the anthrax attack. Many \ndepartments were forced to put aside other major public health \nresponsibilities.\n  Hospitals across the country have immediate needs. According to the \nAmerican Public Health Association, hospitals are hard-pressed even \nduring a heavy flu season, and could not cope with a lethal contagious \ndisease like smallpox.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act we are proposing will address these \ndeficiencies. It provides new resources for bioterrorism preparedness \nto the States under a formula that guarantees help to each State. These \nresources will be available to improve hospital readiness, equip \nemergency personnel, enhance State planning, and strengthen the ability \nof public health agencies to detect and contain dangerous disease \noutbreaks.\n  Federal stockpiles of antibiotics, vaccines, and other medical \nsupplies are an essential part of the national response. We have a \nstrategic petroleum reserve to safeguard our energy supply in times of \ncrisis. We need a strategic pharmaceutical reserve as well, to ensure \nthat we have the medicines and vaccines stockpiled to respond to \nbioterrorist attacks. Our legislation establishes this reserve, and \nauthorizes the development of sufficient smallpox and other vaccines to \nmeet the needs of the entire U.S. population.\n  The legislation will also help protect the safety of the food supply, \nthrough increased research and survelliance of dangerous agricultural \npathogens.\n  Every day we delay means that States can't buy the equipment to \nimprove their labs and hire the personnel they need. It means another \nday in which hospitals can't purchase stocks of antibiotics or add \nemergency room capacity. It means further delay in building up \npharmaceutical stockpiles and producing essential vaccines. We face an \nextraordinary threat, and we must take immediate action to combat it.\n  Our legislation draws on the work and suggestions of numerous \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. One of the important areas \naddressed in the legislation is the threat of agricultural \nbioterrorism. Deliberate introduction of animal diseases could pose \ngrave dangers to the safety of the food supply. Such acts of \nagricultural bioterrorism would also be economically devastating. The \noutbreaks of ``mad cow'' disease in Europe cost over $10 billion, and \nthe foot and mouth outbreak cost billions more. We must guard against \nthis danger.\n\n  Protecting the safety of the food supply is a central concern in \naddressing the problem of bioterrorism. Senator Clinton, Senator \nMikulski, Senator Harkin, Senator Collins and Senator Durbin have all \ncontributed thoughtful proposals about food safety. Our bill will \nenable FDA and USDA to protect the Nation's food supply more \neffectively.\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\n  We're grateful for the leadership of other Senators who have made \nsignificant contributions to this legislation. Senator Bayh and Senator \nEdwards contributed important proposals on providing block grants to \nstates, so that each State will be able to increase its preparedness. \nTheir proposal ensures that each state will receive at least a minimum \nlevel of funding.\n  We're also grateful for the contributions that many of our \ndistinguished colleagues have made to address the special needs of \nchildren. Senator Dodd, Senator Collins, Senator Clinton, Senator \nDeWine and Senator Murray have emphasized the crucial needs of children \nrelating to bioterrorism. The legislation includes important \ninitiatives to provide for the special needs of children and other \nvulnerable populations.\n  The events of recent weeks have shown the importance of effective \ncommunication with the public. Our legislation incorporates proposals \non improving communication offered by several of our colleagues. \nSenator Carnahan has recognized the importance of the internet in \nproviding information to the public. The legislation includes the \nprovisions of her legislation to establish the official Federal \ninternet site on bioterrorism, to help inform the public.\n  Senator Mikulski also contributed provisions on improving \ncommunication with the public. The high level, blue ribbon task force \ncan provide vitally needed insights on how best to provide information \nto the public. Senator Mikulski also recommended ways to ensure that \nstates have coordinated plans for communicating information about \nbioterrorism and other emergencies to the public.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have a leading role in \nresponding to bioterrorism. Senator Cleland has been an effective and \nskillful advocate for the needs of the CDC. Our legislation today \nincorporates many of the proposals introduced by Senator Cleland in his \nlegislation on public health authorities.\n  Hospitals are also one of the keys to an effective response to \nbioterrorism. We must do more to strengthen the ability of the nation's \nhospitals to cope with bioterrorism. Senator Corzine has proposed to \nstrengthen designated hospitals to serve as regional resources for \nbioterrorism preparedness, I commend him for his thoughtful proposal, \nwhich we have incorporated into the legislation.\n  We must also ensure that we monitor dangerous biological agents that \nmight be used for bioterrorism. There is a serious loophole in current \nregulations, and we are grateful for the proposals offered by Senator \nDurbin and Senator Feinstein to achieve more effective control of these \npathogens.\n  In a biological threat or attack, mental health care will be \nextremely important. We are indebted to Senator Wellstone for his \nskillful and compassionate advocacy for the needs of those with mental \nillnesses. In the event of a terrorist attack, thousands of persons \nwould have mental health needs, and our legislation includes key \nproposals by Senator Wellstone to address these needs.\n  Mobilizing the nation's pharmaceutical and biotech companies so that \nthey can fully contribute to this effort is critical. Senators Leahy, \nHatch, DeWine, and Kohl made thoughtful contributions to the antitrust \nprovisions of the bill, which will help encourage a helpful public-\nprivate partnership to combat bioterrorism.\n  This legislation is urgent because the need to prepare for a \nbioterrorist attack is urgent. I look forward to its prompt passage so \nthat the American people can have the protection they need.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthe Bioterrorism Preparedness Act, a comprehensive package of measures \nto improve our Nation's capability to respond to a future biological \nweapons attack against the United States. This bill, introduced by \nSenators Kennedy and Frist, would authorize $3.25 billion in funding \nfor fiscal year 2002, a substantial boost in resources for the measures \noutlined in the bill. I applaud Senators Kennedy and Frist for coming \ntogether in a bipartisan spirit and putting forth a bill that takes the \nfirst important step towards truly protecting our Nation against future \nacts of bioterrorism. When Sam Nunn testified in early September before \nthe Foreign Relations Committee on the threat posed by biological \nweapons, he was very clear, bioterrorism is a direct threat to the \nnational security of the United States and we need to invest the \nnecessary resources to counter this threat accordingly.\n  As troubling as the recent spate of anthrax by mail attacks was, we \nwere very fortunate that this was a comparatively small-scale attack. \nSeventeen Americans contracted inhalation or cutaneous anthrax; \nunfortunately, four individuals died. The next time a biological \nweapons attack occurs, we may not be so fortunate in dealing with a \nsmall number of victims who emerge over a period of weeks. Instead, we \nmay face thousands of victims flooding local emergency rooms and \noverwhelming our hospitals in a matter of hours. Let's be real here, \nthe anthrax attacks, as small-scale as they have been, have greatly \nstressed our national public health infrastructure. One out of every \neight Centers for Disease Control employees at their headquarters in \nAtlanta is working on the current anthrax outbreak, forcing the CDC to \nsideline other essential core activities for the time being. Folks, \nwhat we have just been through is small potatoes compared to what we \npotentially will face. Plain and simple, we can't afford to be so \nunderprepared in the future.\n  Among Sam Nunn's recommendations for countering biological terrorism, \nhe declared, ``We need to recognize the central role of public health \nand medicine in this effort and engage these professionals fully as \npartners on the national security team.'' There are many good things in \nthis bill, ranging from the expansion of the National Pharmaceutical \nStockpile to efforts to enhance food safety, but I am especially please \nthat the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act provides direct grants to \nimprove the public health infrastructure at the State and local level. \nOur doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians, and other public \nhealth personnel are our eyes and ears on the ground for detecting a \nbiological weapons attack. We can't afford not to do everything we can \nto make sure they have the necessary tools and resources in containing \nany BW attack. This bill goes a long way towards fulfilling that core \ncommitment.\n\n  So I strongly support the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act and I look \nforward to its early passage and entry into law before the Congress \nadjourns for the year. But I am deeply concerned that the bill ignores \nthe international aspects to any effective response to potential \nbioterrorism. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I know \nthat we cannot address the threat of bioterrorism within the borders of \nthe United States alone.\n  Let me be clear, a biological weapons attack need not originate in \nthe United States to pose a threat to our Nation. A dangerous pathogen \ndeliberately released anywhere in the world can quickly spread to the \nUnited States in a matter of days, if not hours. The scope and \nfrequency of international trade, travel, and migration patterns offer \nunlimited opportunities for pathogens to spread across national borders \nand even to move from one continent to another. Therefore, we need to \nview all infectious disease epidemics, wherever they occur, as a \npotential threat to all nations.\n  It is for this reason that Senator Helms, the distinguished ranking \nmember on the Foreign Relations Committee, and I worked together in \nseeking to insert provisions in this bill to enhance global disease \nmonitoring and surveillance. With Senator Kennedy's strong backing, we \nwanted to ensure the full availability of information, i.e. disease \ncharacteristics, pathogen strains, transmission patterns, on infectious \nepidemics overseas that may provide clues indicating possible illegal \nbiological weapons use or research. Even if an infectious disease \noutbreak occurs naturally, improved monitoring and surveillance can \nhelp contain the epidemic and tip off scientists and public health \nprofessionals to new diseases that may be used as biological weapons in \nthe future.\n  The World Health Organization, WHO, established a formal worldwide \nnetwork last year, called the Global Alert and Response Network, to \nmonitor and track infectious disease outbreaks in every region of the \nworld.\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\nThe WHO has done an impressive job so far working on a shoestring \nbudget. But this global network is only as good as its components, \nindividual nations. Many developing nations simply do not possess the \npersonnel, laboratory equipment or public health infrastructure to \ntrack disease patterns and detect traditional and emerging pathogens. \nIn fact, these nations often just seek to keep up in treating those who \nhave already fallen ill.\n\n  Doctors and nurses in many developing countries only treat a small \nfraction of the patients who may be ill with a specific infectious \ndisease--in effect, they are only witnessing the tip of a potentially \nmuch larger iceberg. According to the National Intelligence Council, \ngovernments in developing countries in Africa and Asia have established \nrudimentary or no systems at all for disease surveillance, response or \nprevention. For example, in 1994, an outbreak of plague occurred in \nIndia, resulting in 56 deaths and billions of dollars of economic \ndamage as trade and travel with India ground to a halt. The plague \noutbreak was so severe because Indian authorities did not catch the \nepidemic in its early stages. Authorities had ignored or failed to \nrespond to routine complaints of flea infestation, a sure warning \nsignal for plague.\n  Owing to the lack of resources, developing nations are the weak spots \nin global disease monitoring and surveillance. Without shoring up these \nnations' capabilities to detect and contain disease outbreaks, we are \nleaving the entire world vulnerable to either a deliberate biological \nweapons attack or an especially virulent naturally occurring epidemic.\n  Therefore, Senator Helms and I worked together in proposing language \nfor this bill to authorize $150 million in fiscal year 02 and fiscal \nyear 03 to strengthen the capabilities of individual nations in the \ndeveloping world to detect, diagnose, and contain infectious disease \nepidemics. The proposed title would have helped train entry-level \npublic health professionals from developing countries and provide \ngrants for the acquisition of modern laboratory and communications \nequipment essential to any effective disease surveillance network. Upon \nfirst glance, $150 million is chump change in a bill that authorizes \nmore than $3 billion. But I have been assured by public health experts \nthat $150 million alone can go a long ways in making sure that \ndeveloping countries acquire the basic disease surveillance and \nmonitoring capabilities to effectively contribute to the WHO's global \nnetwork. The bottom line is that these provisions would have offered an \ninexpensive, commonsense solution to a problem of global proportions.\n  I was greatly disappointed, therefore, when the White House weighed \nin late in the negotiations and expressed its strong insistence that \nthe language Senator Helms and I worked out should be dropped from this \nbill. While administration officials assured me that they liked our \nideas, they asserted any bioterrorism bill passed this year should only \ninclude those provisions that carry a domestic focus and meet the test \nof urgency.\n\n  Let me respond to those arguments. It is extremely short-sighted to \ndraw artificial boundaries between ``domestic'' and ``international'' \nresponses to bioterrorism. I have already pointed out that pathogens \ndeliberately released in an attack anywhere in the world can quickly \nspread to the United States if we are unable to contain the epidemic at \nits source. The National Intelligence Council has concluded that \ninfectious diseases are a real threat to U.S. national security. To \nignore the international arena in favor of domestic solutions alone is \nprofoundly misguided. As for urgency, I can think of few things more \nurgent than taking the necessary steps to respond to bioterrorism in a \nglobal context. Americans have been repeatedly warned by their \ngovernment leaders to expect other terrorist attacks in the near \nfuture; we cannot limit ourselves to thinking these attacks will occur \nin a conventional form or location. Just this fall, the WHO has had to \nrespond to natural outbreaks of hemorrhagic fever in Pakistan and \nyellow fever in the Ivory Coast. An effective global disease \nsurveillance network cannot come into existence soon enough.\n  I therefore intend to offer an amendment, when this bill comes to the \nfloor later this year, to re-insert the provisions to enhance the \ncapabilities of developing nations to track, diagnose, and contain \ndisease outbreaks resulting from both BW attacks and naturally \noccurring epidemics. It is not my intention to slow down this overall \nbill or raise any obstacles; on the contrary, I want to see \ncomprehensive bioterrorism legislation reach the President's desk this \nyear. But we cannot address the full scope of the threat posed by \nbiological weapons without including the international component of the \nsolution.\n  Let me close with an excerpt of testimony from the Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing on bioterrorism in September from Dr. D.A. Henderson, \nthe man who spearheaded the international campaign to eradicate \nsmallpox in the 1970s. Today, he is the director of the newly-formed \nOffice of Emergency Preparedness in the Department of Health and Human \nServices, which has the mandate to help organize the Federal \nGovernment's response to future bioterrorist attacks. Dr. Henderson was \nvery clear on the value of global disease surveillance: ``In \ncooperation with the WHO and other countries, we need to strengthen \ngreatly our intelligence gathering capability. A focus on international \nsurveillance and on scientist-to-scientist communication will be \nnecessary if we are to have an early warning about the possible \ndevelopment and production of biological weapons by rogue nations or \ngroups.'' I am hopeful that a majority of my colleagues will recognize \nwe cannot leave the rest of the world to fend for itself in combating \nbiological weapons and infectious diseases in general if we are to \nensure America's security as well.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nBioterrorism Preparedness Act. I am proud to join Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Frist, and Senator Gregg as an original cosponsor of this \ntimely bipartisan legislation. Senator Kennedy and Senator Frist have \nbeen leaders on this issue even before the events of September 11. In \nJune of 2000, they introduced the Public Health Threats and Emergencies \nAct, which was enacted into law last year.\n  The recent anthrax attacks have shown that Congress must do much more \nto prepare our country for possible future bioterrorist attacks. We \nneed to e4nsure that all of our communities across the country, both \nrural and urban, are equipped to respond to a bioterrorism attack in \nthe event that such an unfortunate act should occur.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act would put in place a comprehensive \nnational strategy to combat bioterrorism. This legislation would \nimprove preparedness at the Federal, State, and local levels. It would \nincrease investments in public health surveillance systems and public \nhealth laboratories to improve our ability to detect an attack. \nMoreover, the Act would strengthen our ability to contain the spread of \na bioterrorism attack by increasing the Nation's stockpile of vaccines \nand treatments.\n  One critical component of a national strategy on bioterrorism is \ncommunication between the government and the public. Americans have \nmany questions about what bioterrorism is and how they can protect \ntheir families. They need a reliable source of information where they \ncan go to get accurate answers to their questions, thereby alleviating \nsome of their anxiety and fears. Several weeks ago, I introduced the \nBioterrorism Awareness Act, S. 1548, to address this need. S. 1548 \ncalls for the creation of a single website containing information on \nbioterrorism that would serve as the official federal government source \nof information for the public. This website will provide ``one-stop \nshopping'' for people who need to find answers to questions about \nbioterrorism. For so many of us, the fear of bioterrorism is a fear of \nthe unknown. Knowledge is power, and the more knowledge we have about \nterrorism, the more power we have to overcome our fears.\n  I am pleased that my proposal has been included as a key part of the \nnational communications strategy in the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act. \nThis legislation calls for the creation of a new official Federal \nwebsite to serve as the definitive source of bioterrorism for the \npublic and other targeted populations. For example, farmers and others \nindividuals involved in the Nation's\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\nfood supply need accurate information on bioterrorism. This website \nwould include information geared specifically towards the needs of \nagricultural workers and the unique challenges they might encounter in \nthe event of a bioterrorism attack on our food supply. I encourage the \ndevelopment of this website as soon as possible.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act also contains other provisions \naimed at protecting our food supply. It recognizes that our Nation's \nfood supply cannot be left vulnerable to a terrorist attack. The bill \nwould authorize funds to increase the Food and Drug Administration's \nauthority to perform food inspections. It would also authorize funds to \nimprove security at facilities belonging to the Department of \nAgriculture, the Department of Health and Human Services, and \nuniversities across the country, where potential animal and plant \npathogens are housed or researched.\n  I know that farmers in Missouri, as well as across the country, are \nconcerned about protecting their crops and livestock. A terrorist \nattack on these targets has the potential to not only disrupt the food \nsupply in the U.S., but throughout the world. The potential economic \nimpact on farmers' livelihood would be devastating to them and their \nfamilies. The food safety provisions in this bill go far in protecting \nthis essential national resource.\n  Another key component in dealing with bioterrorism is providing \nstates with the resources to be equipped to respond. The bill would \naward block grants to states for improving preparedness and \ncoordination in the event of an attack. These grants would allow States \nto improve their surveillance and detection capabilities. Further, they \nwould allow states to bolster their public health infrastructure to \nbest protect the public from an attack.\n  These block grants are especially important because when it comes to \nprotecting our nation from terrorism, the Federal Government cannot do \nit alone. We need the cooperation and support of State and local \ngovernments to protect the citizens at all levels. These funds will \nhelp ensure that State governments have the resources they need to \nprevent and respond to a bioterrorism attack.\n  This bipartisan legislation would allow our Nation to improve its \nability to prevent, detect, contain, and respond to a possible \nbioterrorist attack. In this time of uncertainty, preparation is our \nbest defense. This bill provides the necessary resources to strengthen \nthat defense throughout all levels of government--Federal, State, and \nlocal. I urge my colleagues to support the ``Bioterrorism Preparedness \nAct'' and to act on it expeditiously.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, along with Senators Frist, Roberts, \nCollins, Bond, Hagel, Snowe, DeWine, and other colleagues, I rise today \nin support of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001.\n  As the fight against terrorism heats up, it is critical that we \ndedicate sufficient resources to the growing threat of bioterrorism. \nThis legislation will enhance the capabilities of Federal, State, and \nlocal governments to coordinate emergency preparedness efforts, \nstockpile vaccines and medical supplies, link channels of \ncommunication, modernize biosecurity facilities, and ensure the safety \nof America's health and food supply. In other words, it will help the \nU.S. protect its citizens.\n  I am proud to have worked with my colleague, Senator Roberts, to \naddress the concerns about our food supply and vital agricultural \neconomies. The agricultural bioterrorism provisions in this legislation \nwill authorize the U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, to strengthen \nits capacities to identify, prepare for, and respond to such \nbioterrorism threats to our farms, ranches, livestock, poultry, crops, \nand food processing, packaging, and distribution facilities and \nsystems.\n  We have a clear priority to ensure the safety of our food, and to \nmaintain the public's confidence regarding this. To do so, we must \nidentify and quickly control the threats to our food supply, currently \nthe world's safest and most abundant and affordable.\n  Bioterrorism has always been a question of when it would strike, not \ncould it occur, especially since the cold war. During the cold war, it \nwas known that the former Soviet Union had a bio-weapons program that \nincluded bio-agents aimed at agriculture, while during the gulf war our \nown soldiers have shown evidence of possible use of biological weapons. \nFrom the terrorist attacks on Japan's subway system to the foot-and-\nmouth and ``mad-cow'' disease outbreaks in Europe to the recent anthrax \nattacks here, even the public is now acutely aware of this threat.\n  For this reason, this bill is critical, both for the results it will \nachieve and the reassurance it will provide. USDA will be expanded to \nenhance inspection capability, implement new information technology, \nand develop methods for rapid detection and identification of plant and \nanimal disease. USDA's Veterinary Services will be authorized to \nestablish cooperative agreements with state animal health commissions \nand regulatory agencies for livestock and poultry health, and private \nveterinary practitioners to enhance its ability to respond to outbreaks \nof animal disease.\n  We must emphasize and promote collaboration to strengthen America's \nresearch and development capacity. Therefore, USDA is instructed to \nestablish a Consortium for Countermeasures Against Agricultural \nBioterrorism to form long-term programs of research and development to \nenhance the biosecurity of U.S. Agriculture. America's institutes of \nhigher education that have a demonstrated expertise in animal and plant \ndisease research, strong linkages with diagnostic laboratories, and \nstrong coordination with state cooperative extension programs will \nprovide the resources and expertise that will prove invaluable in the \nwar on agricultural bioterrorism.\n  This is the first modern war where the front lines lie on our own \nshores, farms and fields, but I know we are up to the challenge, \nespecially as Texas will proudly serve as one of the States on the \nfirst lines of defense for our entire country. States where agriculture \nis critical are vulnerable to a bioterrorism attack, but they will also \nprove invaluable in the war on bioterrorism when they provide the first \nevidence of an attack.\n  To protect our citizens, our economy and our food supply, I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inouye, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1716. A bill to speed national action to address global climate \nchange, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise before you today to introduce the \nGlobal Climate Change Act of 2001. I am pleased to have Senators \nStevens, Hollings, Inouye, and Akaka join me as original cosponsors.\n  We face a fundamental environmental challenge. Scientists have warned \nthat pollution and deforestation are raising atmospheric concentrations \nof greenhouse gases, raising global temperatures and altering the \nworld's climate system with adverse and potentially catastrophic \nimplications for the global environment. And, while sea levels rise, \nspecies extinction, drought, disease migration and other potential \nimpacts cannot be known with certainty, we know enough to understand \nthat the threat of harm is real and that worst-case scenarios under \ncurrent ``business-as-usual'' practices are disastrous.\n  The best indicator that other nations believe action is desperately \noverdue is the conclusion of an agreement to implement the Kyoto \nProtocol last week in Marrakesh, Morocco. Incredibly, the Marrakesh \nAccords, under which rules for compliance and international greenhouse \ngas emissions trading were reached, were concluded without U.S. \nsupport.\n  Although the Administration abandoned the Kyoto process in March, to \nour national detriment, it is critical that the United States map out a \nclear path to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. In \nthe Commerce Committee we have held several hearings to examine the \nscience and the solutions to global warming. We have heard testimony \nabout the potential for wind and other renewable energy to provide our \nnation the power it needs emissions free. We have heard from companies \nleading the push for hydrogen fuel cells to provide distributed \ngeneration and transportation energy with low emissions. And we've\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\nheard from automakers designing the technology for more fuel efficient \ncars. The Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over of the Corporate \nAverage Fuel Economy, CAFE, program and will continue a series of \nhearings on the issue that was delayed by the attacks of September 11. \nThe United States must assert itself as a leader in research, \ndevelopment and deployment of these and other technologies.\n  The Global Climate Change Act of 2001 would help us move down a path \nof scientific understanding, research, policy innovation and \ntechnological innovation. The bill will complement other legislation \nunder consideration in other Senate committees for reducing our \ngreenhouse gas emissions, as well as legislation to improve CAFE in the \nCommerce Committee. The Global Climate Change Act of 2001 will also \nprovide a solid technical basis upon which to build any future \ngreenhouse emissions tracking, reduction, or trading programs.\n  The bill contains provisions aimed at bringing the world-class \nscience, technology, and planning expertise of the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, the National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, NIST, and other Department of Commerce programs to bear \non this problem, whether it is in climate observation, measurement and \nverification, information management, modeling and monitoring, \ntechnology development and transfer, or hazards planning and \nprevention.\n  First, the bill would endorse the elevation of climate change issues \nin the Administration, identifying the Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy, OSTP, as the coordinating entity in the White House. An \ninteragency task force on global climate change action chaired by the \nSecretary of Commerce would be responsible for developing a multi-\nfaceted climate change action strategy, including development of \nmitigation approaches.\n  Second, it would create an emissions reporting system to ensure \naccurate measurement, reporting, and verifica-tion of greenhouse gas \nemissions, which is essential to any efforts to reduce our emissions. \nThe bill utilizes the technical capabilities of the NIST and NOAA to \nestablish uniform and credible new measurement methods and \ntechnologies. It establishes a mandatory reporting system for \ngreenhouse gas emissions for entities operating in the U.S. with \nsignificant emissions. The system will maximize completeness, accuracy \nand transparency and minimize costs for covered entities. It will be \ndesigned to ensure interoperability of any U.S., state or international \nsystem of reporting and trading greenhouse gas emissions. It would also \nrequire Commerce to issue annual reports showing greenhouse gas \nemissions and trends, including areas where reductions have occurred.\n  Third, the bill would ensure that we in Congress get the best \nindependent scientific and technical expertise in our climate change \noversight role. The bill would create a Science and Technology \nAssessment Service that would provide ongoing science and technology \nadvice to Congress. Since the Office of Technology Assessment, OTA, was \neliminated in 1995, experts agree that Congress has suffered from lack \nof ongoing, credible advice. While some objected to the OTA structure, \nall agree that expert technical advice for Congress is essential to \nensuring we hold up our end in efforts to make progress on this \nimportant issue. Congressional requests for advice are overburdening \nthe National Academy of Sciences and threatening to compromise its \nindependent stature. The bill would economize on resources and \npersonnel by utilizing the administrative services of the Library of \nCongress and the expertise of the National Research Council, and \nprovide an ongoing separate service to Congress that will not threaten \ncompromise NAS's independent role.\n\n  Fourth, the bill revises the Global Change Research Act of 1990 and \nthe National Climate Program Act, so that interagency and Commerce \nDepartment programs focus on improving detection, modeling and regional \nimpact assessments and are better managed to provide useful information \nto government decisionmakers and managers. In addition, the legislative \nchanges would direct improvements in atmospheric monitoring and \nestablish a new integrated coastal and ocean observing system to ensure \nwe understand and predict the role of oceans in climate. Finally, it \nwould create an integrated program office for the USGCRP within the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy to ensure budget coordination, \nusing models established under the multiagency National Oceanographic \nPartnership Program and the NPOESS, polar satellite, convergence \nprocess.\n  Fifth, the bill addresses a critical component of reducing greenhouse \ngas emissions: technology innovation. The bill is aimed at increasing \nthe Department of Commerce's technology innovation role in reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, it would utilize the Advanced \nTechnology Program, ATP, to promote and commercialize energy efficient \ntechnologies and the Manufacturing Extension Program for small \nmanufacturers. This section would also direct NIST to develop methods \nand technologies, including process improvements, that can be used in a \nvariety of sectors to reduce production of greenhouse gases.\n  Finally, we must admit that even if we stopped all greenhouse gas \nemissions tomorrow, the effects of climate change and variability will \nnot end. It is in our interest to undertake assessments and actions now \nthat will help us address safety and infrastructure issues that will \nlikely accompany climate variability and change in the future. There is \ncurrently no way for State governments or coastal communities to plan \nfor change on a 20-50 year time horizon. The bill would require NOAA to \nevaluate vulnerability of regions of the United States, particularly \ncoastal regions, to effects of climate change, including drought and \nsea level rise, and develop a strategy for helping states deal with the \nissues. The bill also directs NOAA to work with NASS to develop remote \nsensing technologies that will help coastal managers identify hazards \nand make intelligent planning decisions.\n  This legislation neatly rolls into one package key components of any \nnational plan to address climate change: coordinated research, \nmonitoring, reporting and verification, mitigation technology, impact \nassessment, and adaptation planning. This package is but one of many I \nhope to see my colleagues in Congress develop to help the United States \nreduce the threat of global climate change now. The Climate Change \nmeetings in Marrakesh last week show that other nations are ready to \nact. We can, and must, do the same, even without leadership from this \nAdministration.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kerry as a \ncosponsor of the Global Climate Change Act of 2001. The Senate Commerce \nCommittee has worked hard to ensure that the Federal Government has the \nbest research and information possible about global warming, as well as \nother types of climate changes. Our investments are bearing fruit and \nwe are identifying ways to focus our research to help us make decisions \nnow and in the decades ahead.\n  During the 1980s, a number of us on the Committee became increasingly \nconcerned about the potential threat of global warming and loss of the \nozone layer. In 1989, I sponsored the National Global Change Research \nAct, which attracted support from many members still serving on the \nCommerce Committee. In 1990, after numerous hearings and roundtable \ndiscussions, Congress enacted the legislation, thereby creating the \nU.S. Global Climate Research Program.\n  When we passed the Global Change Research Act, we knew it was the \nfirst step in investigating a very complex problem. We placed a lot of \nresponsibility in NOAA, the scientific agency best suited to monitor \nand predict ocean and atmospheric processes. We need to renew this \nocean research commitment to ensure we better understand the oceans, \nthe engines of climate. The so-called ``wild card'' of the climate \nsystem, the oceans are capable of dramatic climate surprises we should \nstrive to comprehend.\n  I am glad to report that the research accomplished under the National \nGlobal Change Research Act has led to increased understanding of global \nclimate change, as well as regional climate phenomena like El Nino/\nSouthern Oscillation, ENSO. We now have a better understanding of how \nthe Earth's oceans, atmosphere, and land surface\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\nfunction together as a dynamic system, but we cannot stop there. Only \nrecently, NOAA measured an important increase in temperature in all the \nworld's oceans over a 40 year period. We need to understand the causes \nand how that will affect us. All this research ensures that federal and \nstate decision-makers get better information and tools to cope with \nsuch climate related problems as food supply, energy allocation, and \nwater resources.\n  While we have learned an astonishing amount about climate and other \nearth/ocean interactions in only a decade, we have other critical \nquestions that require further research to answer. Many of these \nquestions are relevant not only to improving our scientific \nunderstanding, but also to contributing to our future social and \neconomic well-being. For example, climate anomalies during the past two \nyears, most directly related to the 1997-1998 El Nino event, have \naccounted for over $30 billion in impacts worldwide. When impacts from \nthe recent floods in China are included, these direct losses could rise \nto $60 billion. This most recent El Nino claimed 21,000 lives, \ndisplaced 4.5 million people, and affected 82 million acres of land \nthrough severe flood, drought, and fire. When we better understand the \nglobal climate system, and its relationship to regional climate events \nlike El Nino, we may be able to find ways, such as improved forecasting \nand early warning--to avoid some of the severe impacts.\n  Understanding these and other impacts of climate change at the \nregional level is a critical step in preparing for these changes. We \nmust maintain our commitment to research and further refine our \nexisting modeling capabilities. The second critical need is planning \nfor sea level rise and other inevitable results of climate change. It \nis costly in human lives and real dollars to manage our response in a \ncrisis mode. Just as we needed to modernize our National Weather \nService, we need to strengthen and modernize our National Climate \nService, which can help the U.S. predict and plan for climate events. \nThis includes establishing a national ocean and coastal observing \nsystem using the expertise and resources of a variety of federal \nagencies. In addition, this bill will help our coastal communities at \nrisk from future climate-related hazards create plans that will help us \nadapt to such changes without catastrophic disruptions experienced in \nAlaska by my friend Senator Stevens.\n  Not only do we need continued support for technological research and \ndevelopment, we must also consider the method in which this information \nis delivered to Congress. Before it was abolished in 1995, the Office \nof Technology Assessment, OTA, was responsible for providing Congress \nwith balanced, independent scientific and technological advice. Since \n1995, the function of the National Academy complex, particularly the \nNational Research Council, NRC, has been forced to expand its role in \nproviding research and information to Congress. However, the NRC \nstudies have their limitations. The reports, often slow and expensive, \nprovide limited opportunity for formal input and review by affected \nparties. Furthermore, unlike OTA, they often make specific \nrecommendations rather than laying out a range of alternative policy \noptions.\n  The problems addressed by Congress are becoming increasingly complex. \nScience and technology play a crucial role in addressing problems in \nenergy, defense, aviation and the environment. Without a permanent, \nnon-partisan source of independent scientific and technical policy \nanalysis, Congress become lost in the wealth of information provided by \nscientists, think tanks, and interest groups. The Global Climate Change \nAct of 2001 addresses this problem by creating a service that would \nprovide ongoing science and technology advice to Congress, but avoid \nthe criticisms leveled at OTA. It would economize on resources and \npersonnel by utilizing the administrative services of the Library of \nCongress and the expertise of the National Research Ccouncil. \nCongressional requests for advice are overburdening NRC and threatening \nto compromise its independent stature as it is increasingly asked to \nfill the role of OTA. This provision would defer to NRC as the source \nof outside, unbiased advice and experts, but also provide an ongoing \nseparate service to Congress. This service would also be asked to \nreview the report of the Climate Change Action Task Force.\n  The Global Climate Change Act of 2001 demonstrates that the Committee \non Commerce, Science and Transportation is serious about climate \nchange, and I commend this Act to you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/02/senate-section/article/S11945-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\nSenate\n\n\n(Legislative day of Friday, September 22, 2000)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/02/senate-section/article/S11945-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11945-S11946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE COMMITTEE ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nsummarize for my colleagues, and for the public, the activities and \naccomplishments of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs during the 106th \nCongress. I am pleased to report, as chairman of the committee, that \nthis Congress has been one of significant accomplishment.\n  When this Congress convened, it was determined that three veterans' \npriorities needed to be met. We had to increase the availability of \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA)-provided health care services, \nparticularly long-term care services, to World War II veterans. We had \nto improve educational assistance benefits--so-called Montgomery GI \nbill or MGIB benefits--made available by VA to veterans, principally \nyoung veterans, newly released from service. And we had to address and \nrectify vestigial elements of discrimination against women contained in \nveterans' statutes. With the assistance of the committee's ranking \nminority member, Senator John D. (``Jay'') Rockefeller IV, and in \nbipartisan partnership with all of the committee's members, we have \nachieved all three of these goals--and more.\n  First, with the enactment of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and \nBenefits Act of 1999, Public Law 106-117 (Millennium Act), the Congress \nprovided for the first time that the most deserving of veterans--those \nwith severe service-connected disabilities--will be assured of \nreceiving nursing home care should they need it--and so long as they \nneed it. Under the terms of the Millennium Act, any veteran who needs \nnursing home care to treat a service-connected disability will get it. \nSimilarly, any veteran who is rated as 70 percent disabled or higher by \nVA due to a service-connected cause will be provided with needed \nnursing home care--even if the condition which causes the need for such \ncare is not itself service-connected. Further, all veterans who are \nenrolled for VA care--even those who do not have service-connected \ndisabilities--will, under the terms of the Millennium Act, receive any \nand all non-institutional alternatives to inpatient long-term care--\nservices such as home health aide services, adult day health care \nservices, and the like--as they might need to forestall the day on \nwhich they will have to resort to inpatient long-term care. Finally, \nthe Millennium Act mandates that VA maintain the nursing home capacity \nthat it now has, and that it initiate pilot programs to determine, \nfirst, the most cost-effective ways of providing more nursing home care \nto more veterans and, second, the feasibility of providing to veterans, \nand their spouses, assisted living services.\n  With enactment last month of the Veterans Benefits and Health Care \nImprovement Act of 2000, Public Law 106-419, the other two priorities \nwhich had been identified at the outset of the 106th Congress were also \nmet. Under that statute, a veteran who has served a three-year \nenlistment and who returns to school after service will be eligible to \nreceive as much as $800 per month in assistance payments while he or \nshe is in school. In January 1997, when I assumed the chairmanship of \nthe committee, veteran-students could receive no more than $427 per \nmonth in Montgomery GI bill assistance; thus, in four years, assistance \nto full time veteran students has been increased by 87 percent.\n  The Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act also addressed \ntwo issues of importance to women veterans: It provided that special \ncompensation benefits--those provided to male veterans when they lose, \ndue to a service-connected cause, a so-called creative organ--will also \nbe afforded to women veterans who sustain the service-connected loss of \na breast. And it provided--based on sound scientific evidence--that \nchildren with birth defects of women Vietnam veterans will be provided \ncompensation, health care, and job training benefits.\n  These three measures--addressing the disparate needs of older, \nyounger, and women veterans--are not the only veterans-related \nlegislative accomplishments of the 106th Congress. To the contrary, the \nlist of other legislative achievements is long. In addition to \nproviding the long-term care benefits I have already outlined, the \nMillennium Act also specifies that VA will itself provide, or reimburse \nthe uninsured costs of, emergency care needed by any veteran enrolled \nfor VA care. It mandates, further, that VA enhance the services it \nprovides to homeless veterans, and to veterans with post-traumatic \nstress disorders, drug abuse disorders, and injuries from sexual \ntrauma. It provides, in addition, that higher priority access to VA \ncare will be provided to veterans who were wounded in combat and are, \nas a consequence, recipients of the Purple Heart. And, finally, it \nauthorizes VA to provide enhanced care, as space is available, to \nactive duty service personnel and military retirees (who normally \nreceive care from their respective military services), and reauthorizes \nthe provision of health care evaluations to the spouses and children of \nPersian Gulf war veterans.\n  Further in the area of health care benefits, the Millennium Act and \nthe Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act jointly enhance \nservices provided to veterans by improving VA assistance to State-run \nveterans' nursing home facilities; by authorizing 13 major hospital \nconstruction projects; by improving provisions of law relating to \nnurse, dentist, and pharmacist pay and the recruitment of\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\nphysician assistants, social workers, and medical support staff; by \nincreasing VA incentives to collect reimbursements from non-service-\ndisabled veterans' health insurance carriers--funds that are not \nremitted to the Treasury but are funneled back into VA hospitals; and \nby encouraging increased VA and Department of Defense cooperation in \nthe procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. And last, but \nsurely not least in the area of health care, VA's health care system \nreceived the two greatest increases ever in funding for fiscal years \n2000 and 2001, increases of $1.7 billion and $1.4 billion respectively. \nThe ranking member and I very much appreciate that the chairman and \nranking member of the VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senators Bond and Mikulski, heard our call for such \nfunding increases.\n\n  In the area of veterans' readjustment benefits and other non-\nhealthcare-related benefits provided by VA, I have already outlined the \nsignificant increases in monthly Montgomery GI bill benefits that have \nbeen gained since 1997, and the improvements in women veterans' \nbenefits. Beyond these accomplishments, there is a lengthy and strong \nrecord of accomplishment. In addition to increasing veterans' \neducational assistance allowances, the Veterans Benefits and Health \nCare Improvement Act also increased education assistance benefits \nprovided to the widows and surviving children of persons who were \nkilled in service or who died after service from service-connected \ncauses. And these survivors' educational assistance benefits were, for \nthe first time, ``indexed'' by the Veterans Benefits and Health Care \nImprovement Act so that they will keep pace with inflation. The \nVeterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act and the Millennium \nAct also improved VA educational assistance programs by allowing \nbenefits to be paid to students taking test preparation courses and \ncertification or licensing examinations, and by paying benefits to \nstudents during term breaks and, retroactively, to students who are \nveterans' survivors and who are deemed eligible for such benefits only \nafter their educations have begun. In addition, those statutes also \nexpanded eligibility standards applicable to post-Vietnam era veterans \nby allowing those who had participated in the less generous Veterans \nEducational Assistance Program or VEAP program of the late 1970's and \nearly 1980's to convert to Montgomery GI bill eligibility. Finally, the \nVeterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act liberalized MGIB \nparticipation rules so that officer candidates and veterans serving \nsecond enlistments would not, due to technicalities in the law, be \ndenied Montgomery GI bill eligibility.\n  Benefits other than educational assistance benefits were also \nimproved by the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act, the \nMillennium Act, and other committee-approved legislation. Compensation \nbenefits provided to radiation-exposed veterans were modified by the \naddition, under the Millennium Act, of bronchiolo-alveolar cancer to \nthe listing of diseases that are presumed to be service-connected if \nthey are contracted by radiation-exposed veterans. The Veterans \nBenefits and Health Care Improvement Act specifies that compensation \nwill be provided, for the first time, to reservists who suffer heart \nattacks or strokes while on active duty and to veterans who are injured \nwhile participating in VA-sponsored compensated work therapy programs. \nIn addition, that statute provides for a long-overdue increase in the \nnet worth threshold at which compensation payments are suspended in \ncertain cases involving veterans who are hospitalized on a long term \nbasis, though I hasten to add that a repeal of this limitation--which, \nunder current law, applies to mentally incompetent hospitalized \nveterans but not to other hospitalized veterans--will remain a top \npriority of mine. And benefits provided to veterans' widows were \nimproved by liberalizing eligibility for survivors of former prisoners \nof war and widows who have remarried. In addition, the Veterans Claims \nAssistance Act of 2000, Public Law 106-475, reinstated and improved \ncourt-struck provisions of law requiring that VA assist veterans and \nother claimants--principally, widows and surviving children--in the \npreparation of their claims to VA for benefits. And Public Laws 106-118 \nand 106-413 increased VA compensation, survivors' benefits, and other \ncash-transfer benefits by 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, \nthereby assuring that VA benefits keep pace with inflation.\n  In the area of insurance benefits, the Veterans Benefits and Health \nCare Improvement Act increased the amount of life insurance available \nto service members from $200,000 to $250,000, and authorized insurance \nprogram participation by members of the Reserves. That statute also \nfreezes premiums paid by certain insured veterans who have reached the \nage of 70. And, in the area of housing benefits, the Veterans Benefits \nand Health Care Improvement Act improved remodeling grant programs to \nassist disabled veterans in making their homes accessible, and the \nMillennium Act extended mortgage loan guarantee benefits to members of \nthe Reserves.\n  In order to assist veterans in gaining meaningful post-service \nemployment, the Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act \nextends eligibility for Federal contractor outreach programs to \nrecently-separated veterans. In addition, the Veterans Entrepreneurship \nand Small Business Development Act of 1999, Public Law 106-50, provides \ntechnical, financial, and procurement assistance to veteran-owned small \nbusinesses.\n  Finally, in the area of memorial affairs, the Millennium Act mandates \nthat VA establish six new national cemeteries in areas which VA had \nidentified as being underserved. In addition, the Millennium Act \nfacilitated last month's dedication of the World War II Memorial on the \nNational Mall by authorizing the American Battle Monuments Commission \nto borrow funds needed to proceed now while World War II veterans \nremain alive to see the memorial they earned. Finally, the Veterans \nBenefits and Health Care Improvement Act extended eligibility for \nburial, and funeral expense and plot allowances, to certain U.S.-\ncitizen Filipino veterans, improved VA assistance to States in \nestablishing State cemeteries, and extended job-protection benefits to \nReserve and Guard members who take leave from their civilian jobs to \nhonor veterans by serving in burial details.\n  Mr. President, I commend and thank the ranking minority member of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee, and all of the committee's members, for \ntheir extraordinary diligence and cooperation in assisting me in \npressing forward the numerous improvements to veterans programs that I \nhave outlined in this statement. The Veterans' Affairs Committee \noperates in an unusually bipartisan way--a way that might be a model \nfor constructive activity in the 107th Congress. We will continue to so \nact, and we anticipate that the 107th Congress will show a record of \naccomplishment similar to that which characterizes the 106th.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/02/senate-section/article/S11946-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11946-S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE COMMODITY FUTURES MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask to print in the Record a \nletter from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets strongly \nsupporting the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000.\n  The act provides certainty for over-the-counter swaps and authorizes \na new financial product, the ``security future,'' to be traded under a \nregulatory scheme that protects investors against fraud, market \nmanipulation and insider trading.\n  The act contains three principal components. It would provide legal \ncertainty that specified types of swaps which are traded over-the-\ncounter are not regulated as futures. The Report of the President's \nWorking Group on Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets and the Commodity \nExchange Act, issued in November 1999, strongly recommended that \nCongress enact legislation to provide OTC swaps with legal certainty in \norder to ``reduce systemic risk in the U.S. financial markets and \nenhance the competitiveness of the U.S. financial sector.''\n  In addition the act would authorize trading in futures on single \nstocks and narrow-based stock indices. These are new investment \nproducts which, until now, have been prohibited from trading by the \nShad-Johnson Accord, which this act would repeal. By authorizing\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nsecurities futures, the act would allow financial markets to increase \nthe number of products they trade and give investors additional \ninvestment options. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission negotiated the proposed regulatory \nregimen over securities futures, which is designed to protect investors \nagainst fraud, insider trading and market manipulation. The regulatory \nregimen will call for joint regulation by both the SEC and CFTC of \nthese markets and the intermediaries that trade in them. Imposing \nstrong investor protections is absolutely necessary if we are to allow \ntrading in these new investment products.\n  The act also contains regulatory relief provisions for the futures \nmarkets that would codify recent CFTC regulations.\n  I would like to highlight certain important aspects of titles III and \nIV of the act.\n  Title III addresses the SEC's authority over security-based swap \nagreements. It carefully carves out products traditionally viewed as \nsecurities in exclusions from the definition of swap agreements. It is \nimportant to note that title III does not eliminate the SEC's existing \nauthority to regulate products that are securities.\n  Title III applies anti-fraud and anti-manipulation provisions of the \nFederal securities laws to securities-based swap agreements, including \nthose entered into by banks. Title III amends section 10(b) of the \nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and its anti-fraud protections to apply \nto ``any securities-based swap agreement.'' In extending these \nprotections, the act makes explicit that rules promulgated under \nsection 10(b) to address fraud, manipulation, or insider trading apply \nto securities-based swap agreements. Thus, current and future anti-\nfraud rules will apply to swap agreements to the same extent as they do \nto securities. This will enhance protection for investors and for the \nfinancial markets, and will permit the SEC to respond as necessary to \ndevelopments in these markets.\n  Title III states that existing judicial precedent relating to various \nsecurities statutes and rules is applicable to securities-based swaps \nto the same extent as it is to securities. Thus, for example, cases \ninterpreting these statutory provisions which establish theories of \nliability and private rights of actions would apply directly to \nsecurities-based swaps.\n  Title IV, Legal Certainty for Bank Products Act of 2000, clarifies \nthe current law, under which the CFTC does not regulate traditional \nbanking products. Such products include deposit accounts, CDs, banker's \nacceptances, letters of credit, loans, credit card accounts, and loan \nparticipations. When a question arises, title IV provides a mechanism \nfor determining whether a product is an ``identified,'' or traditional, \nbanking product. To qualify as an identified banking product, section \n403 requires two conditions to be met: (1) that the product cannot have \nbeen either prohibited by the Commodity Exchange Act or regulated by \nthe CFTC on or before December 5, 2000, and (2) that the bank has \nobtained a certification from its regulator that the bank product was \ncommonly offered by any bank prior to December 5, 2000. The latter test \nrequires that the product was actively bought, sold, purchased, or \noffered by or to multiple customers and is not just a transaction \ncustomized for a single client or handful of clients.\n  Section 405 excludes a hybrid product from the Commodity Exchange Act \nif under a ``predominance test'' it is primarily an identified banking \nproduct and not a contract, agreement or transaction appropriately \nregulated by the CFTC. The act dictates how to resolve disputes about \nthe application of this test.\n  The bill's definition of ``security future'' does not include \nproducts excluded under title IV and other sections of the Commodity \nExchange Act, e.g., certain swaps, identified banking products, etc. \nThus, the new grants of authority of this act to the SEC would not \nextend to these products. However, these exclusions do not limit the \ndefinition of ``security'' or the SEC's jurisdiction under existing \nstatutes. For example, the SEC has, and will continue to have, \njurisdiction over all over-the counter options.\n  The act will have a significant impact on the futures markets as well \nas on the securities markets and investors. The United States \ninvestment markets are the envy of the world. This act is intended to \nstrengthen those markets as it provides legal certainly for over-the-\ncounter swaps, authorizes the trading of futures on single stocks and \nnarrow-based stock indices, and gives regulatory relief for the futures \nmarkets.\n  The letter from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets \nfollows:\n\n                                                December 15, 2000.\n     Hon. Paul S. Sarbanes,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sarbanes: The Members of the President's \n     Working Group on Financial Markets strongly support the \n     Commodities Futures Modernization Act. This important \n     legislation will allow the United States to maintain its \n     competitive position in the over-the-counter derivative \n     markets by providing legal certainty and promoting \n     innovation, transparency and efficiency in our financial \n     markets while maintaining appropriate protections for \n     transactions in non-financial commodities and for small \n     investors.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence H. Summers,\n       Secretary, Department of the Treasury.\n     Alan Greenspan,\n       Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve.\n     Arthur Levitt,\n       Chairman, Securities and Exchange Commission.\n     William J.

Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Carper) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1552, to extend the moratorium \nenacted by the Internet Tax Freedom Act through 2006, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Moratorium and \n     Equity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The moratorium of the Internet Tax Freedom Act on new \n     taxes on Internet access and on multiple and discriminatory \n     taxes on electronic commerce should be extended.\n       (2) States should be encouraged to simplify their sales and \n     use tax systems.\n       (3) As a matter of economic policy and basic fairness, \n     similar sales transactions should be treated equally, without \n     regard to the manner in which sales are transacted, whether \n     in person, through the mails, over the telephone, on the \n     Internet, or by other means.\n       (4) Congress may facilitate such equal taxation consistent \n     with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Quill \n     Corp. v. North Dakota.\n       (5) States that adequately simplify their tax systems \n     should be authorized to correct the present inequities in \n     taxation through requiring sellers to collect taxes on sales \n     of goods or services delivered in-state, without regard to \n     the location of the seller.\n       (6) The States have experience, expertise, and a vital \n     interest in the collection of sales and use taxes, and thus \n     should take the lead in developing and implementing sales and \n     use tax collection systems that are fair, efficient, and non-\n     discriminatory in their application and that will simplify \n     the process for both sellers and buyers.\n       (7) Online consumer privacy is of paramount importance to \n     the growth of electronic commerce and must be protected.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT MORATORIUM.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. \n     151 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Moratorium.--No State or political subdivision \n     thereof shall impose--\n       ``(1) any taxes on Internet access during the period \n     beginning after September 30, 1998, unless such a tax was \n     generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n     1998; and\n       ``(2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic \n     commerce during the period beginning on October 1, 1998, and \n     ending on December 31, 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Such term does not include receipt of such content \n     or services.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Development of Streamlined System.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that States and localities should work together to \n     develop a streamlined sales and use tax system that addresses \n     the following in the context of remote sales:\n       (1) A centralized, one-stop, multi-state reporting, \n     submission, and payment system for sellers.\n       (2) Uniform definitions for goods or services, the sale of \n     which may, by State action, be included in the tax base.\n       (3) Uniform rules for attributing transactions to \n     particular taxing jurisdictions.\n       (4) Uniform procedures for--\n       (A) the treatment of purchasers exempt from sales and use \n     taxes; and\n       (B) relief from liability for sellers that rely on such \n     State procedures.\n       (5) Uniform procedures for the certification of software \n     that sellers rely on to determine sales and use tax rates and \n     taxability.\n       (6) A uniform format for tax returns and remittance forms.\n       (7) Consistent electronic filing and remittance methods.\n       (8) State administration of all State and local sales and \n     use taxes.\n       (9) Uniform audit procedures, including a provision giving \n     a seller the option to be subject to no more than a single \n     audit per year using those procedures; except that if the \n     seller does not comply with the procedures to elect a single \n     audit, any State can conduct an audit using those procedures.\n       (10) Reasonable compensation for tax collection by sellers.\n       (11) Exemption from use tax collection requirements for \n     remote sellers falling below a de minimis threshold of \n     $5,000,000 in gross annual sales.\n       (12) Appropriate protections for consumer privacy.\n       (13) Uniform enforcement criteria and a process for \n     ensuring compliance by those States that adopt the \n     streamlined sales and use tax system.\n       (14) A process for resolving conflicts of law among States \n     in the interpretation or application of statutory or \n     regulatory provisions implementing the system.\n       (15) Such other features that the States deem warranted to \n     promote simplicity, uniformity, neutrality, efficiency, and \n     fairness.\n       (b) Study.--It is the sense of Congress that a joint, \n     comprehensive study should be commissioned by State and local \n     governments and the business community to determine the cost \n     to all sellers of collecting and remitting State and local \n     sales and use taxes on sales made by sellers under the law as \n     in effect on the date of enactment of this Act and under the \n     system described in subsection (a) to assist in determining \n     what constitutes reasonable compensation.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Mr. ENZI (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nGraham, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Carper) \nproposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 1552, to extend the moratorium \nenacted by the Internet Tax Freedom Act through 2006, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the first word and insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Moratorium and \n     Equity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The moratorium of the Internet Tax Freedom Act on new \n     taxes on Internet access and on multiple and discriminatory \n     taxes on electronic commerce should be extended.\n       (2) States should be encouraged to simplify their sales and \n     use tax systems.\n       (3) As a matter of economic policy and basic fairness, \n     similar sales transactions should be treated equally, without \n     regard to the manner in which sales are transacted, whether \n     in person, through the mails, over the telephone, on the \n     Internet, or by other means.\n       (4) Congress may facilitate such equal taxation consistent \n     with the United States Supreme Court's decision in Quill \n     Corp. v. North Dakota.\n       (5) States that adequately simplify their tax systems \n     should be authorized to correct the present inequities in \n     taxation through requiring sellers to collect taxes on sales \n     of goods or services delivered in-state, without regard to \n     the location of the seller.\n       (6) The States have experience, expertise, and a vital \n     interest in the collection of sales and use taxes, and thus \n     should take the lead in developing and implementing sales and \n     use tax collection systems that are fair, efficient, and non-\n     discriminatory in their application and that will simplify \n     the process for both sellers and buyers.\n       (7) Online consumer privacy is of paramount importance to \n     the growth of electronic commerce and must be protected.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF INTERNET TAX FREEDOM ACT MORATORIUM.\n\n       Section 1101(a) of the Internet Tax Freedom Act (47 U.S.C. \n     151 note) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Moratorium.--No State or political subdivision \n     thereof shall impose--\n       ``(1) any taxes on Internet access during the period \n     beginning after September 30, 1998, unless such a tax was \n     generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n     1998; and\n       ``(2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic \n     commerce during the period beginning on October 1, 1998, and \n     ending on December 31, 2005.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Such term does not include receipt of such content \n     or services.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the enactment of the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX SYSTEM.\n\n       (a) Development of Streamlined System.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that States and localities should work together to \n     develop a streamlined sales and use tax system that addresses \n     the following in the context of remote sales:\n       (1) A centralized, one-stop, multi-state reporting, \n     submission, and payment system for sellers.\n       (2) Uniform definitions for goods or services, the sale of \n     which may, by State action, be included in the tax base.\n       (3) Uniform rules for attributing transactions to \n     particular taxing jurisdictions.\n       (4) Uniform procedures for--\n       (A) the treatment of purchasers exempt from sales and use \n     taxes; and\n       (B) relief from liability for sellers that rely on such \n     State procedures.\n       (5) Uniform procedures for the certification of software \n     that sellers rely on to determine sales and use tax rates and \n     taxability.\n       (6) A uniform format for tax returns and remittance forms.\n       (7) Consistent electronic filing and remittance methods.\n       (8) State administration of all State and local sales and \n     use taxes.\n       (9) Uniform audit procedures, including a provision giving \n     a seller the option to be subject to no more than a single \n     audit per year using those procedures; except that if the \n     seller does not comply with the procedures to elect a single \n     audit, any State can conduct an audit using those procedures.\n       (10) Reasonable compensation for tax collection by sellers.\n       (11) Exemption from use tax collection requirements for \n     remote sellers falling below a de minimis threshold of \n     $5,000,000 in gross annual sales.\n       (12) Appropriate protections for consumer privacy.\n       (13) Uniform enforcement criteria and a process for \n     ensuring compliance by those States that adopt the \n     streamlined sales and use tax system.\n       (14) A process for resolving conflicts of law among States \n     in the interpretation or application of statutory or \n     regulatory provisions implementing the system.\n       (15) Such other features that the States deem warranted to \n     promote simplicity, uniformity, neutrality, efficiency, and \n     fairness.\n       (b) Study.--It is the sense of Congress that a joint, \n     comprehensive study should be commissioned by State and local \n     governments and the business community to determine the cost \n     to all sellers of collecting and remitting State and local \n     sales and use taxes on sales made by sellers under the law as \n     in effect on the date of enactment of this Act and under the \n     system described in subsection (a) to assist in determining \n     what constitutes reasonable compensation.\n\n     SEC. 6.
