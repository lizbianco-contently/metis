We remember the suffering of the Jews in this century. \nForgive any prejudice in our own hearts and purge from us any vestige \nof imperious judgmentalism of people whose expression of faith in You \ndiffers from our own.

Mr. President, this brownfields legislation is important. \nIt provides three important steps to directly spur cleanup and reuse of \nthese abandoned and contaminated sites.\n  No. 1, it provides critically needed money to assess and clean up \nabandoned and underutilized sites which will create jobs and increase \ntax revenues and preserve great parks and open space. It is estimated \nthis legislation will bring tax revenues to local governments of up to \n$2.4 billion.\n  No. 2, it encourages cleanup and redevelopment by providing legal \nprotections for innocent parties, such as contiguous property owners, \nprospective purchasers, and innocent landowners.\n  Under the present state of the law, these places are left abandoned \nbecause people are afraid if they purchase these properties or lease \nthem, they will be subject to Superfund liability. This legislation \nnegates all that.\n  No. 3, it further provides for funding and enhancement of State \ncleanup programs and a balance between providing ``certainty'' for \ndevelopers and others but still ensuring protection of public health.\n  We reported this bill out of committee by a vote of 15-3. A couple of \nSenators had some problems. We worked literally day and night on a \nstaff level to resolve those problems. For example, the Senator from \nOhio had some suggestions. I told him at the committee that we would \nwork with him, and we have. We have satisfied Senator Voinovich's \nproblems with this legislation.\n  We need to do this. The reason I am so frustrated is that yesterday \nwe did nothing, and today we are going to stand around and be in \nmorning business. There is no reason we cannot do this. We have agreed \non this side to 2 hours of debate evenly divided. I do not know why in \nthe world we cannot move forward with this legislation. It is extremely \nimportant.\n  I believe President Bush is a good person, and I believe he means \nwell and wants to do the right thing. He stated during the campaign \nthat he supports brownfields legislation.\n  His environmental record has been abysmal this first 100 days. Why \ndoesn't he lend his prestigious efforts to this legislation that he \nsays he supports?\n  I cannot understand why we do not move forward with this legislation. \nThis legislation is important. It is important to the State of Nevada. \nIt is important to every State in the Union.\n  As we all know, this issue has wide support from groups including \nenvironmentalists, the Mayors' Association, businesses, the real estate \ncommunity. This bill is a meeting of minds from all sectors of American \nsociety and from both sides of the aisle.\n  S. 350 is a model of how an evenly divided committee can work \ntogether. I urge the Republican leadership in the Senate to show this \nSenate can recognize good legislation when it sees it and prove to \nAmericans a 50/50 Senate can be productive and we can enact good laws.\n  I urge my friend, the junior Senator from Mississippi, the majority \nleader, to allow us to debate this bill and move forward on it. We will \ndo it with a short agreement. We agreed to 2 hours.\n\n  This bill will pass overwhelmingly. Work done by the Presiding \nOfficer and the Senator from California has been exemplary, and the \nwork the full committee did is excellent. I urge my colleagues to work \ntoward moving this forward. Hard work has been done. The cooperation of \nthe Republicans and Democrats on the committee was noticeable. It is a \nshame at this time we don't move forward with this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week we were all witnesses to \nheadlines in the newspapers about a meeting held in Quebec City, \nCanada. The newspaper headlines talked about tear gas, chain link \nfences, police lines, demonstrators, 30,000 people marching down \nstreets. It also discussed anarchists.\n  What is this all about, 30,000 people demonstrating in the streets of \na major city in our hemisphere? It is about international trade. The \nsame sort of thing happened in Seattle a year and a half ago. The \nfuture WTO ministerial meeting will be held not in a major city but in \na place called Qatar. Why? Because no city wanted to host it, as I \nunderstand it. They will have to even bring in cruise ships for hotel \nrooms. They feel if the ministers of trade from around the world can \nhold a meeting in an isolated place, no one will show up to protest \ntheir closed door meeting.\n  Last week's demonstrations in Quebec City underscored again that \nworld leaders are not going to hold trade talks without attention being \npaid to the issues concerns of the people and the problems related to \nglobal trade. It is not that global trade ought to be stopped. It is \nthat global trade has marched relentlessly forward without the rules of \ntrade keeping pace. There is a relentless accelerated march toward \nglobalization. However our world leaders have not develop acceptable \nrules, so people demonstrate in the streets.\n  I want to make two points this morning: One, trade is very positive \nfor our country when it occurs in circumstances where it is fair. It \nmakes sense for us to do that which we do best and trade with others \nwho in their comparative advantage are doing what they do best. That \nmakes sense on the world stage. Our country has been a leader in world \ntrade, a leader in expanded trade, and it does make sense to expand our \ntrade opportunities as long as doing so represents the values that this \ncountry considers important in the development of our economy and in \nthe development of our international relationships.\n\n  It is also the case that while all say that expanded trade is good \nfor this country, it is also the case that we ought not allow the \ninternational corporations in this world to pole vault over all the \nissues that relate to labor, the environment and of production simply \nby saying: We are going to produce in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Bangladesh, \nor China, and we will ship back into the United States. So what if they \nhire 12-year-olds and pay them 12 cents an hour, working them 12 hours \na day. So what. They would like us to think that is fair trade.\n  It is not fair trade. That is why people are marching in the streets. \nIt is not fair trade when corporations are able to become international \ncitizens and decide to circle the globe in their airplanes and evaluate \nwhere they can produce the cheapest, where they can employ kids, where \nthey can dump pollution in the water and the air, where they can have \nfactories without the barriers and problems of making them safe and \nproduce there, create a cheap product and send it to a department store \nin Pittsburgh or Los Angeles, or Butte, MT.\n  The question is, Is it fair trade when that happens? This country has \nfought for a century over these issues. All of those fights were \nagonizing. Many occurred in this Chamber. The fight about whether we \nought to be able to employ children, so we have child labor laws saying \nwe don't want you to send 12-year-olds into coal mines. We don't want \n12- and 14-year-olds put on a factory floor to work 12 hours a day. We \nhave child labor laws.\n\n  The question of safe workplace, demanding that those who employ \npeople employ them in safe workplaces that are not going to pose risks \nto the life and safety of workers. We have fought, and made laws to \nprotect our people.\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\n  The issue of fair compensation, we have fought for a long while in \nthis country about that issue. We have collective bargaining and the \nability of employees to form and join unions. We have minimum wages. We \nfought about that and continue to fight about that from time to time in \nthis country, but we have settled part of it. Now, some say that \ndoesn't matter; we can go elsewhere. We can produce elsewhere, where \npeople can't join a labor union, they are illegal. We can produce where \nwe can hire a 12-year-old child and pay 16 cents an hour, and we can \nmake a pair of shoes that has an hour and a quarter direct labor, with \n20 cents labor costs in a pair of shoes, and ship that to New York City \nfor a department store shelf because we are saying to the American \nconsumer, this is better for you because it is cheaper for you.\n  So people demonstrate in the streets because they say that is not \nfair trade. That is not what we mean by expanding the opportunities of \ntrade.\n  We have had some experience in this country recently with our trade \nissues and that is not a pleasant experience. This chart shows what has \nhappened to this country's trade deficit. There has been a great deal \nof good news on the issue of deficits in this country. The fiscal \npolicy and the budget deficits have diminished year after year, and we \nnow have surpluses. Look what has happened to the trade deficits of \nthis country.\n  In 1993, we had merchandise trade deficits of $132 billion. It is now \n$449 billion and growing. This trade deficit is mushrooming. If there \nare people who think it doesn't matter, think again. This is like the \nrunup of dot com companies in the stock market. Everybody thought \nNASDAQ would continue to increase forever. These values are perfectly \nunderstandable. We had people on Wall Street who made a lot of money \nthat were justifying and explaining why the values made sense.\n  They didn't make sense. This doesn't make sense. This ballooning, \nmushrooming trade deficit will cause serious problems to this country \nunless it is addressed. This country must repay these trade deficits. \nWith a budget deficit, you can make the case that it is a deficit, you \nowe it to yourself. You cannot do that with trade deficits. This is a \ndeficit we owe to others.\n  Inevitably, they are repaid with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry. That is an action in economics that no one disputes. This is a \nvery serious growing, abiding problem.\n  With whom are our trade deficits? Our trade deficits are with Canada. \nWe passed a U.S.-Canada trade agreement. We had a reasonably small \ntrade deficit with Canada. We quickly doubled it, very quickly doubled \nour trade deficit with Canada. What an incompetent trade agreement. We \nought to haul those negotiators to the well of the Senate to explain to \nus what they did in public and in secret to undercut this country's \ninterests in the U.S.-Canada agreement. I could talk about some of \nthose issues, but I don't have time today.\n  China, the China trade deficit, the trade deficit we now have with \nChina is an $83 billion merchandise trade deficit, and growing rapidly; \nthe European Union, $55 billion trade deficit, and growing; Japan, $81 \nbillion trade deficit, and growing. And we have had a trade deficit \nwith Japan of $50 billion a year plus now for a long time.\n  Mexico, by the way, prior to the U.S.-Canada and Mexico trade \nagreement, something called NAFTA, North American Free Trade Agreement, \nwe had a surplus trade balance with Mexico. We had a surplus. It is now \nnearly a $25 billion deficit. Talk about colossal incompetence. The \ntrade agreements we have negotiated in recent years have undercut this \ncountry's interests in fair trade. In every set of circumstance, our \ncountry bows to trade agreements that undercut our workers and our \nproducers all in the name of free trade.\n  Quebec City hosted a big meeting last week. The President went to \nQuebec City and talked about the desire for expanded trade agreements. \nHe said Congress must give him what is called trade promotion \nauthority. That is just new language for fast track. What the President \nis saying is: I want fast-track trade authority.\n  To the extent I have the capability of involving myself in this, I \nwill say to the President: You are not going to get fast-track trade \nauthority. We wouldn't give it to President Clinton, and we won't give \nit to you. Your first job is not to create new trade agreements when \nevery agreement in recent years has undercut this country's interests \nand resulted in larger and larger trade deficits. Your first job is to \nfix the problems that have been created in the last decade and a half. \nFix these problems, then come to us. Then we can talk about trade \npromotion authority.\n\n  Do you want to hear some problems? We have a huge, growing trade \ndeficit with Japan. Do you know what the tariff is on a T-bone steak we \nsend to Tokyo, American beef sent to Japan? There is nearly a 40-\npercent tariff on every single pound of American beef sent to Japan--40 \npercent. That would be declared a huge problem if the United States \nimposed a 40-percent tariff, but we will allow our allies to do that, \nour trading partners. Why? Because we are poor negotiators and we do \nnot have backbone and we do not have the nerve and we do not have the \nwill to stand up for this country's economic interests. So T-bones to \nTokyo are just a small example, just one small example.\n  How about going from T-bones to apples? Try sending apples to Japan. \nDo you know what Japan will tell apple growers in this country? They \nsay the apples that are shipped in Japan must be shipped from trees in \nthe United States that are separated by at least 500 meters from the \nother trees in the orchard. Does it sound goofy to you? It does to me. \nHow do they get by with it? They get by with it because we negotiate \nincompetent agreements, incompetent bilateral agreements with these \ncountries.\n  China? Well, China has a huge and growing trade surplus with us--or \nwe a deficit with them. They ship us their trousers and their shirts \nand their shoes and their trinkets--they flood our country with their \ngoods. But try to get American wheat into China these days. Ask what \nChina is buying from the United States. See whether our trade agreement \nwith China is fair.\n  Let me just give one example. We just sent negotiators to negotiate \nwith China. When they finished--I will just talk about automobiles for \na moment. China has 1.1 billion people. When our negotiators finished, \njust a year and a half ago, negotiating a bilateral agreement with \nChina, here is what they said: China, it is all right for you, after a \nrather lengthy phase-in, to impose a 25-percent tariff on any \nautomobiles the United States sends into China. And, by the way, for \nour part, we will impose a 2.5-percent tariff on any automobiles China \nwould send to the United States.\n  We sent negotiators to sit down with the Chinese to negotiate a \nbilateral agreement and said what we will agree to, with a country with \n1.3 billion people that is going to need a lot of automobiles in the \nfuture, we will agree you can impose a 10-times higher tariff on \nautomobiles that we would send to China versus the automobiles they \nmight send to the United States.\n  I would like to find the people who agreed to that on behalf of this \ncountry and ask them how do they justify their public service by such \nincompetence. It makes no sense to me that we engage with other \ncountries on trade and are not hard-nosed and strong negotiators, \nsaying we are all for trade so let's have reciprocal trade policies: We \nmust say you treat us like we treat you, we treat you like you treat \nus. Let's treat each other fairly.\n  But that is not the way our trade negotiators see it. Every single \ntime they get involved in a negotiation, our farmer, ranchers, and \nsmall businesses lose. I talked about having our trade negotiators wear \njerseys as they do in the Olympics. At least they could look down and \nsee the initials on the jerseys and see for whom they are working.\n  What is happening with trade with China, Canada, EU, Japan, and \nMexico? There is now a merchandise trade deficit of over $450 billion a \nyear, a deficit every single day of goods going into our country that \nexceeds goods going out, and this $450 billion in accumulated \nmerchandise deficits is part of our account that has to be settled at \nsome point, and it will weaken this country's economic strength when we \ndo it.\n  The question for this administration--and I have asked exactly the\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nsame question with the previous administrations--is: Are you going to \nstand up for this country's economic interests? President Bush went to \nCanada. He said at the outset that we have to recognize the issues of \nlabor and the environment in trade agreements. Then later in the week \nhe said: Trade agreements must be commercial--commercial interests, \nand, by the way, what I want is trade promotion authority--which, as I \nsaid, is a new term for fast track.\n  For those who do not know what fast-track authority is, it means our \nnegotiators shall go negotiate an agreement with another country, bring \nit back as a treaty to this Senate, and the provisions under fast track \nwould be we can debate it but cannot amend it; no Senator has the right \nto offer any amendments at any time under any circumstances.\n  It is fundamentally undemocratic. Had we had the opportunity to offer \namendments to NAFTA, we would not be in this situation with Mexico and \nCanada, just as a example, with respect to our current trade agreement \nwith our neighbors.\n  The big study on Mexico and Canada was by Hufbauer and Schott study, \nwhich everybody used. The Chamber of Commerce and all our colleagues \nused it. They said if we do this trade agreement, we will have 350,000 \nnew jobs in this country. And they said here are the imports and \nexports between the United States and Mexico that we expect after this \nagreement.\n  It turns out they said the principal imports from Mexico would be \nimports of largely unskilled labor. What are the three largest imports \nfrom Mexico? The three largest imports are automobiles, automobiles \nparts, and electronics, all of which come from skilled labor, all of \nwhich mean the Hufbauer and Schott study missed its mark. We didn't \ngain jobs, we lost jobs with that trade agreement and turned a surplus \ninto a fairly large trade deficit.\n  Who is going to be called to account for that? Nobody. Because that \nis exactly what the international companies wanted. They do not get up \nin the morning and say the Pledge of Allegiance. They are international \nentrepreneurs, and they are interested in producing anywhere in the \nworld where they can find the fewest impediments to production and the \ncheapest place to produce. They don't want to have to worry about the \nchild labor laws, pollution and the standards that countries impose in \npreventing companies from dumping into the air and water. They don't \nwant to have to worry about worker safety. They don't want to have to \nworry about fair compensation. They had those fights and lost them in \nthis country, and now they want to go elsewhere and say: We want to be \nable to ignore that.\n  The people in the streets are saying: Wait a second, there needs to \nbe some basic set of standards. What does it mean when someone ships \ncarpets to this country and the carpets are made by kids, 10- and 12-\nyear-old kids, some of whom have had gunpowder put on their fingertips \nto have them burned off so they have permanent scarring, so 10- and 12-\nyear-old kids can make carpets and run needles through the carpets, and \nwhen they stick the top of their fingers, it doesn't hurt them because \nthey have already been scarred by burning.\n  That is part of the testimony before Congress about child labor. It \nis happening in this world. Is it fair trade for those carpets to come \ninto our country and be on our store shelves? Would anybody be proud to \nbuy from countries where the circumstances of production are \nrepresented by that kind of behavior? The answer is no.\n  What I want to say today is very simple. The example in Quebec City \nlast week is an example that is going to continue. I do not support the \nanarchists and others who show up for those events to cause trouble, \nbut I understand why protesters come to those events, peaceful \nprotesters--and most of the 30,000 people who showed up were peaceful. \nI believe we should expand trade. I believe expanded trade is important \nfor this country. But I also believe this country ought to be a world \nleader, promoting and standing up for the values for which we fought \nfor over a century to protect. Those are the values of dealing \nthoughtfully with the rules of production dealing with the hiring of \nchildren, with safe workplaces, dealing with the environment and \ncontrolling the emission of pollutants.\n  If this is, indeed, a global economy and if it matters little where \npeople are producing, then you have to have some assurance, if they are \ngoing to close a plant in Toledo or Fargo and move to Guangzhou, they \nare not going to be able to do that because in Guangzhou they can hire \nkids and pollute the water and air and not have a safe workplace and \nproduce a cheaper product and represent to the people of the world: We \nhave done it all for you. That is not doing anybody a favor. That is a \nretreat from the standards for which we fought for a century in this \ncountry.\n  People will demonstrate in the streets on trade issues because they \nwant the rules to keep pace with the relentless march of globalization. \nI want globalization to continue, but I want it done under rules that \nare fair. Coming from a small State in the northern part of this \ncountry, North Dakota, that borders a friendly nation, Canada, I know \nfull well what happens when we are sold out and undercut by our trade \nnegotiators. It happened to us with the trade negotiations with Canada. \nWe sent a trade ambassador to Canada. They negotiated a trade \nagreement, and they essentially said to family farmers: Your interests \nare unimportant to us, so we will sell those interests out in order to \nget concessions for other industries. And we have family farmers going \nbroke in my State because we have an avalanche of unfairly traded durum \nwheat coming into this country. We produce 80 percent of that in the \nState of North Dakota. Durum wheat is used to produce semolina flour \nwhich makes pasta, so most everyone has eaten semolina which comes from \nthe fields of North Dakota in the form of our pasta. But durum growers \nwere severely undercut. Their interests were severely undercut by our \nformer trade ambassador who not only made a bad agreement but then made \na private side deal that he didn't disclose to Congress, and he pulled \nit right out from under our producers. That is not fair.\n\n  Neither is it fair that we will negotiate with a country such as \nCanada that has a monopoly state trading enterprise and that sells \ntheir wheat on what is called the Canadian Wheat Board, which would be \nillegal in this country. They say: We will have a trade arrangement \nunder which we will sell in the U.S. market at practically secret \nprices and refuse to disclose it to anyone. It is fundamentally unfair \ntrade.\n  We sent people to Canada to say we want to evaluate the prices at \nwhich you sell to determine whether you are dumping in the American \nmarketplace. They thumb their noses, saying: We don't intend to show \nyou one piece of paper about what we are doing in United States.\n  To allow that to happen is unfair. It is unfair to farmers, it is \nunfair to producers, and it is unfair to workers. On a broader level, \nit is unfair to corporations that are doing business in this country \nand producing for our marketplace.\n  I hope it is not lost on this administration--I have said the same \nthing to previous administrations--that they should not hold trade \nagreements or trade negotiations, or trade conferences for that matter, \nin cities around the world without, in my judgment, opening the \ndiscussion for a lot of people who want to raise questions about what \nthe fair rules are for international trade. Globalization will \ncontinue, and should. But it must be attended by rules of fair trade, \nand people ought to understand that and know that.\n  Second, finally, when we negotiate trade agreements, we ought not to \nbe afraid to stand up for this country's economic interests. It is \nabout time to be a bit hard nosed, and have a backbone that serves to \nstand up for this country's interests.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3801-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3801-S3802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n                     EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are, of course, poised this week to \ntake on one of the most important issues we will face during this year. \nThat is the issue of education.\n  As we talk about issues over the country and as we take polls, \neducation is the first issue the American people are interested in, and \nvery understandably so. Certainly there is nothing more important to us \nthan education. I think nothing is more important than the future of \nour country with respect to the training of our children who obviously \nwill be the leaders of the country. I am looking forward to that. I \nthink certainly there are many things that can be done and that \nCongress can do.\n  Clearly, in my view, the principal responsibility for public \neducation lies with the States, with the communities, and the decisions \nthat are made with respect to the schools ought to be made primarily \nbased on the needs of those schools as defined by the local leadership.\n  The role of the Federal Government then is one that is always debated \nin the Senate, and properly so. It is one on which there are different \nviews as to what the role of the Federal Government is and should be. \nThe amount of financial contribution made to the elementary and \nsecondary schools is approximately 6 percent to 7 percent of the total \ncost. It is relatively small, but it is very important. Often it is \noriented specifically to special education--to a particular need, and \nso on. That is good. We will, hopefully, have a bill before us that \nwill provide for some commonsense education and a reform plan that will \nhelp all children attain their potential so they can be successful.\n  In increasing the accountability for student performance, money is \nobviously the key factor. Money alone, however, is not enough. Money \njust doesn't do it unless there is some other accountability there so \nwe can measure performance. We need to support the programs that work \nand take a look at those that do not work. Obviously, there are some of \neach.\n  I think we need to reduce the bureaucracy so that officials in \nWashington are not deciding what we ought to do in Sundance, WY, or \nPhiladelphia. The people in other parts of the country ought to have \nthe opportunity.\n  We need to empower parents to be able to make decisions with respect \nto their own children's future. Part of what we will be talking about \nin consideration of the bill will be to hold schools accountable with \nannual reading and math assessments and annual testing that gives \nparents the information they need to be able to determine whether or \nnot their children are learning.\n  Testing is somewhat controversial, particularly national testing. I \nhope we can give the States as much flexibility as possible as to how \nthey do that. On the other hand, with the kind of movement we have \namong children as they get out of school and go to other places, we \nneed to ensure that as they are trained in Colorado, they are prepared \nto work in California; that their educational background will give them \nthe ability to do that.\n  Testing gives educators the information they need to know what works, \nto see what is working in classroom and to improve skills and improve \nteaching effectively. That is part of what we will be doing. Federal \ndollars should not follow failure. We need to ensure that the programs \nthat are funded by Federal dollars are programs that are useful and \nprograms that are producing results. I think we need to make sure we \nsupport the programs that are effective and that are research-based \nprograms. Schools need to be held accountable, of course. School boards \nneed to do a lot of that. Parents need to do a great deal of that.\n\n  We need flexibility, of course, As I mentioned, school districts are \nquite different. They need to know that school districts are different. \nIt is really not appropriate to send dollars, saying they have to be \nused to reduce the size of the class when in fact the size of the class \nis not the issue; computers are the issue or the building is the issue \nor teacher training is the issue. We need to do that.\n  Parents need to be empowered, of course, to be able to determine the \nquality of education the children are receiving so they can make some \ndecisions. I think there has to be clear accountability. In many cases, \nI think the idea that you can have some choice among public schools is \nthe way parents can have some accountability as well. In my hometown of \nCasper, WY, we have a number of charter schools--schools that are \ndifferent from public schools--so that children have a chance to go to \ndifferent places and do different things.\n  We will be talking about the Educational Opportunities Act. We will \ntry to respond to the declining student performance we all hear about \nin our public schools. We need to change what is going on if our \npurpose is to have higher performance. The Educational Opportunities \nAct is designed to support learning efforts in all 50 States and \nhelping local leaders determine what those programs need to have.\n  Also, we will be talking about how to help disadvantaged children \nmeet the high standards and providing schools and teachers with greater \ndecisionmaking authority to make the changes that will result in better \nperformance and schools more responsive to the needs. For any school \nthat fails to help its students over a period of time and make adequate \nprogress, perhaps there can be an opportunity either for that school to \nbe restructured or, indeed, in many instances for the parents to have \nan opportunity to send their kids to other public schools.\n  I don't think in the beginning that the proposal will have the \nvoucher aspect of it, even though that is very controversial. But we \ncan have the charter idea, and we can have the notion that people can \nchoose.\n  There is nothing more important in education than the teacher. Give \nthem a better opportunity for training. Alternative certification may \nbe helpful to continuing learning opportunities. Teacher empowerment \nwill be one of the programs.\n  We will have enrichment initiatives where there can be different \nprograms designed for the 21st century learning centers, where you can \nhave special kinds of schools and special kinds of programs happening \nfor kids. There is also the gifted and talented program, the advanced \nplacement program, and help for neglected, delinquent, and at-risk \nstudents. There are all kinds of programs that are necessary.\n  Obviously, safe and drug-free schools is something we want. We used \nto think about the problem of talking out loud or chewing gum in \nschools, and so on, as problems in school. Now problems are much more \nserious than that. There are drug problems, shooting problems, and \nother kinds of safety problems. So we are going to address that issue.\n  There is a title on educational opportunity initiatives where we can \nhelp children with the establishment of charter schools. More of that \nwill be done. It is pretty much a local initiative.\n  We can help students across the digital divide so they are computer \nliterate in the eighth grade and ready to do the things that now need \nto be done to be successful in the private sector.\n  There is bilingual education and educational enhancement. I think \nthere needs to be some focus on students who speak limited English so \nthat they have a better chance to succeed when they go out into the \nworld. Obviously, the students will want to maintain their own choice \nof language, and that is great. But if they are going to be successful \nin this country, they have to be competent in English. I think that is \nsomething that can be done.\n  There is also impact aid. Of course, we have schools that are \ndifferent, schools that are in communities that are largely Federal. \nFor example, they do not have the same kind of tax structure and \nopportunities that others do. We have schools on Indian reservations \nand schools for Native Alaskans, and so on, that need special care. In \nWyoming, we have reservations that need special attention. We can \nprovide that special attention.\n  So these are the issues that will be involved in the educational bill \nthat is upcoming. There is great concern over the amount of money that \nwill be put in education. The Republican bill has more money in the \nbudget than the President has asked. There will still be arguments made \nabout needing more money.\n\n[[Page S3802]]\n\n  Of course, one of the issues is that when there is a ``surplus,'' \nthere is never enough spending to suit some people. Others think there \nought to be a limitation on the role of the Federal Government. I \nhappen to agree with that in terms of its involvement in elementary and \nsecondary education.\n  So I think we will have a spirited debate. It is interesting, though. \nEveryone in the debate, I believe, would agree that we have a real \nresponsibility and are determined to help strengthen the educational \nsystem in this country. The question will be, how do we do it? How do \nwe best do it? What are the areas in which we can have the most impact?\n  I have to confess, frankly--and I know there is testing, and so on--I \nam pretty proud of the system that we have and the young people with \nwhom I have occasion to deal. Frankly, my wife is a special ed teacher, \nso I have a little insight into that. As I tour around our State, I am \npretty darn proud of the young people in my State. I think they do a \ngreat job. Quite frankly, many of them are better prepared for life \nwhen they get out of school than I was or perhaps some of us were that \nare a little older.\n  So are we where we should be? No, of course not. Are there areas that \nare particularly in need? I think so. And we are in one of those areas \nright now. The results in the District of Columbia are not up to the \nnormal performance levels. There are many of those areas. So we need to \nwork on that. But we also have lots of dedicated teachers who do a \ngreat job and lots of school districts that do a great job.\n  So I am anxious for us to move on this matter of education. I think \nwe will be on it today. Certainly we will be on it for some days. \nIndeed, we should be. As we deal with this question --or any question, \nfor that matter, but this one maybe even more than others--we need to \nset some goals for ourselves as to where we want to be in 10 years, \nwhere we want to be in 15 years, what we want our children to be able \nto do, what opportunities we want to be able to provide for them, so \nthat as we deal with today's issues, and the issues that are in this \nbill and are before us--each one is a rather small step--that those \nsteps are directed for the attainment of a goal with which we can all \nagree.\n  It seems to me that is very important to having a successful \ndiscussion of an issue of this kind.\n  We need to have defined what our values are, what our goals are, \nwhere we are headed, and what it is we want to have as a result of the \nefforts we have made.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as the Members of the Senate are returning \nthis week from our Easter recess, many of us spent time in our home \nStates talking with our families and leaders, trying to catch the pulse \nof America. I was back in Illinois and had the opportunity to travel \nacross my State and have a number of meetings which had a profound \nimpact on me in terms of our debate in the Senate. I think these recess \nperiods are valuable because, as close as we think we are to people, \nthere is absolutely no substitute for sitting down with them and having \nsome conversations about the issues we are debating.\n  One of the issues we have spent a lot of time debating in Washington \nis the whole question of the tax cut. I think most of us believe a tax \ncut is a good thing to do. This may be a good time to do it. There is a \nlot of uncertainty in America now about our economy. I met a lot of \npeople during the course of my time back home who have seen their \n401(k) plans and IRAs and mutual fund savings take quite a battering \nover the last 5 or 6 months. It has happened to virtually all of us who \nwere not quite smart enough to get out of the market at the right \nmoment.\n  I still have a very positive feeling about where we are going, and I \ndo believe we can get this economy back on track. But I, frankly, do \nnot believe we are going to do it with the proposal we have heard from \nthe White House for a $1.6 trillion tax cut. This is a suggestion by \nthe President that we will have such prosperity and such surpluses over \nthe next 10 years that we can make dramatic tax cuts now and be able to \npay for them 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 years from now.\n  It takes a lot of insight and foresight to look ahead and suggest \nwhere America's economy is going to go. One of the people most \nrespected in Washington is Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve. It was only 6 or 7 months ago that Chairman Greenspan \nsuggested raising interest rates to slow down a hot economy. Since \nthen, the economy has slowed down dramatically, and Chairman Greenspan \nhas been racing week after week to lower interest rates to try to get \nthings moving again.\n\n  So even the best minds at the Federal Reserve and the Chairman 6 \nmonths ago, 8 months ago, were guessing wrong about where America's \neconomy would be today. I think it leads to a healthy skepticism by \nmany people when President Bush says: I know what America is going to \nlook like 5 years from now; I know where we are going to be.\n  Take a look at the same economists President Bush is relying on. What \ndid they guess 5 years ago for today? They told us America would find \nits economy in such a shape and the Federal budget in such a shape that \nwe would have a $320 billion deficit this year. It turns out that our \nsurplus is about $260 billion. So they missed it by $580 billion 5 \nyears ago when they tried to guess where we would be. So I think you \nmight understand why this Member of the Senate and many of the people I \nrepresent are skeptical when the President says the best thing for \nAmerica is to guess we are going to be so well off in 5 years or 10 \nyears that we can create tax cuts now.\n  Many of us believe we are on the right track in terms of the general \ndrift of our economy, though we are in a slow period; We do think if we \nmake the right decisions now we can get back to see the growth of \nincome in families, the increased value of our retirement plans, more \njobs, more housing. But we have to make the right decisions now.\n  If there is going to be a tax cut, and I think there should be, it \nshould be a sensible one, one that we can justify, not only today, but \nwhich might look good a few years from now. If we are going to have a \ntax cut, for goodness' sake, everybody in this country should profit \nfrom it. Everybody should benefit. All taxpayers should benefit.\n  Under President Bush's proposal, the $1.6 trillion tax cut, 43 \npercent of the benefits go to people making over $300,000 a year. These \nare people who have a monthly income of $25,000 or more. They are the \nbig winners in the President's plan.\n  I am sorry, but I do not believe those are the people on whom we \nshould be focusing. Yes, they are entitled to a tax cut, as every \nAmerican family should be, but they should not receive a \ndisproportionate share of any surplus.\n  Let me give you two illustrations. A man came up to me Saturday night \nin Chicago and he said: You know, Senator, you just don't represent me \nin Washington, DC.\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: I think you ought to vote for President Bush's tax cut \nbecause it would help people like me. I am one of those leaders in the \neconomy who makes a difference, and you, in fact, have criticized the \nPresident for the tax cut that would help me.\n  I said: Tell me a little bit about your circumstance.\n  He says: I pay taxes. I paid a lot of taxes last year. I paid \n$900,000 in Federal taxes last year.\n  How many people do you run into who paid $900,000 in Federal taxes? I \ndidn't know the man. But just a rough calculation--you don't have to be \nH Block to figure this out--suggests that man's income last year was \n$3 million or $4 million, maybe more. He paid\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\n$900,000 in taxes and he was critical that I didn't support the Bush \ntax cut that would have given him over $46,000 of tax breaks last year.\n  I said to him: I understand that you have been an important part of \nthis economy. Of course you should be considered when it comes to tax \ncuts. But you have done pretty well, haven't you?\n  He says: I have, but my portfolio has taken quite a hit over the last \n6 months.\n  I said: Numerically, virtually all of us can tell that story.\n  But it is hard to imagine that this is the man we should be focusing \non when we talk about getting America's economy and people moving \nagain.\n  I had another conversation a few days before that stay in a little \nhotel in Chicago late one night when I went to do some laundry down the \nhall at about 9 o'clock. There was a housekeeping lady who was kind of \nlaughing at the Senator who was out doing his laundry. But I said we \nkind of lead ordinary lives when we are not in the spotlight.\n  We started talking. This lady is a single mother who raises a few \nchildren and works as a housekeeper in this hotel. I said: How are you \ndoing? She said: I thought I was doing pretty well, Senator. She said: \nI was keeping up with my bills and everything, but this winter the \nheating bills have really hit me hard. I paid the same amount as I did \nlast year for my heating bills, and I am $1,000 behind. Now I have to \npay $1,000 more. I have to pay for the heating bills, and now I am \nworking with the gas company to figure out how to do that. She said: I \nreally try to pay something on those. I have really tried. I am $1,000 \nbehind.\n  I was thinking to myself, as I was flying back to Washington, about \nthose two people I met. Frankly, both of them are good, God-fearing \nAmerican citizens. But I have a great deal of concern about that lady \nwho is a housekeeper and is working at night trying to keep her family \ntogether, paying her bills, and who ran into an unexpected expense of \n$1,000 because of her heating bills. Sadly, the Bush tax cut provides \nno tax benefit for them. If anything, it is about $220 a year. For the \nman who makes $3 million or $4 million a year, the Bush tax cut is \nworth $46,000 more. For the lady who is trying to figure out how to pay \nfor the $1,000 heating bill, it is $200. That doesn't strike me as \nfair.\n  If there is going to be a tax cut in this country, it should be a tax \ncut that really benefits all the taxpayers and gives everyone a chance \nto have some spending money and have their taxes reduced.\n  Another concern of mine is that the Bush tax cut doesn't provide any \ntax relief for people who do not pay income tax but pay payroll taxes. \nTwenty-one million Americans go to work every day, and because their \nincome is low, they don't pay income tax but they pay the payroll \ntaxes. They pay for Social Security and Medicare. Sometimes it is a \nsubstantial part of what they earn. To say that these people are not \ntaxpayers I don't think is fair. They are working people who pay their \npayroll taxes and see it taken out of their paycheck. I think they are \nentitled to be in this conversation about tax cuts to get America \nmoving again.\n  When it comes to the tax cut proposals, I sincerely hope that when \nthe conference committee meets, it is going to move closer to what the \nSenate suggested and bring the President's tax cut down to a level we \ncan justify, that doesn't rely on inflated projections about where our \nsurplus might be, and try to make sure we invest in our priorities for \nthis country. And when it comes to the tax cut itself, let's try to \nmake that fair for all families--not 43 percent of it for people making \nover $300,000 a year but for that housekeeper in that hotel in Chicago \ndoing her level best for her family and who just needs a helping hand \nnow, and for families who, frankly, have low-income jobs but are going \nto work every day. They may not pay income taxes, but they see those \npayroll taxes come out of every paycheck. Include them in any tax \nassistance you provide.\n  One of the most significant votes during the course of the debate on \nthe budget came as a result of the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, \nMr. Harkin. He offered an amendment that said President Bush's $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut should be reduced so that we can put more money into \ntwo things: First, national debt reduction; and, second, education. I \nthink Senator Harkin was right. I am glad his amendment passed on a \nbipartisan basis.\n\n  The national debt is our national mortgage. The national debt is \nabout $5.7 trillion. It has never been larger in our history. We \ncollect $1 billion a day in Federal taxes to pay interest on the old \nnational debt. It doesn't hire a teacher. It doesn't build a road. It \ndoesn't protect America. It services the old debt.\n  When Senator Harkin suggested that we put more money in debt \nreduction, I think he was right. If there is going to be a surplus this \nyear, let's start retiring the national mortgage. The best gift I can \nleave my kids or grandson is to have less of a debt burden for my \ngeneration. I think that makes sense.\n  I am glad Senator Harkin prevailed. The White House did not approve \nof his amendment. They opposed it. But a bipartisan majority on the \nSenate floor supported it.\n  The second part of Senator Harkin's amendment also goes to the key \nissue of education. Senator Harkin proposed $250 billion in new \nspending by the Federal Government for education over the next 10 \nyears. I think Senator Harkin is right on the money.\n  As I talk to people across my State of Illinois, they say education \nis very important. For many of us, without education, we wouldn't be \nwhere we are today. Neither my mother nor father went beyond the eighth \ngrade, yet I was able to go through high school, college, and law \nschool and stand in this Chamber today. I brought the report card home \nevery 6 weeks. It was a big event in our house. My parents may not have \nhad a great formal education, but they knew what education was all \nabout. I think families across America know that education is really \nthe ladder we all climb for success in America.\n  Senator Harkin said in his amendment, cut back on President Bush's \ntax cut and put the money in education. Where would we put it?\n  I had a meeting in Naperville, IL. Naperville is the fourth largest \ncity in my State. It is a great community. The mayor took me around. We \nwent to a local high school, Naperville Central. They are very proud of \nthe fact that they just took an international test in math and science \nand came up first. It is a good school system. But it is a school \nsystem facing a lot of pressure right now because of cutbacks in funds \nand property tax caps. They are doing their best to keep good teachers \nand to make sure they still have the best students. That is one of the \nbetter off school districts in my State. In my old home, East St. \nLouis, and parts of Chicago they are really struggling with limited \nfunds.\n  Senator Harkin said we needed to invest more Federal dollars in \neducation in the areas they have focused on with these investments. The \nlocal level I think is what most people understand.\n  First, the key to success in education is good teaching. I can recall \nsome excellent teachers in my life who made a difference for me. I can \nrecall some who weren't so great where I had to kind of weather the \nstorm, get through and hope for a better teacher in another course and \nanother year.\n  Senator Harkin is talking about investing money in teacher training \nso that we have the very best teachers in the classroom. We have a lot \nof teachers who are going to retire very soon. We want to make sure \nthey are replaced by young, idealistic, and energetic teachers who can \nreally motivate our students to learn. There is no substitute for that. \nIf the Federal Government can assist in teacher training, recruitment, \nand retention of good teachers, I think that is money well spent.\n  The second thing we are talking about is class size. I have had \nteachers come up to me in the Chicago area and say the Federal \ninitiative to reduce the number of students in the classroom is the \nbest thing that ever happened to them.\n  Imagine yourself as a parent trying to raise your kids at home. I can \nrecall when my wife and I had our first child. We doted on that little \ngirl. We spent all that time. And then came along a son. Then came \nanother daughter. Pretty soon it looked like a mob scene in our house. \nWe tried to keep it under control with three kids. Imagine your \nclassroom every day with about 30\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\nkids. It is a tough thing to make sure you focus on every child's desk \nand what they are doing and trying to give a little help to those \nneeding a little extra help. Teachers say, if you can reduce that class \nsize to 20 or so, it makes a profound difference in their effectiveness \nas teachers.\n  In Federal investment in education, we want to make sure we put that \nmoney where it is needed so that we can have smaller classroom sizes.\n  I also think we ought to take a look at the schoolday. The schoolday \nthat ends at 2:30 or 3 in the afternoon isn't realistic anymore. \nUsually kids don't have people to whom to go home. They have a period \nof 3 or 4 hours where they could stick around school and be involved in \nactivities. That is good. But for too many of them it is just dead \ntime--time to watch television and hang out at the mall or on the \nstreet corner. That is not the best time to be unsupervised. That is \nwhen juvenile crime goes up. I think afterschool programs make sense, \nso kids have supervision.\n  We have Gallery 37 in the Chicago public school system in which Mayor \nDaley and his wife have been involved. They are about to expand that to \nprovide more opportunities for kids after school. I find that all \naround my State that has happened. That ought to be a national program, \nso that we have afterschool programs for kids who may need extra help \nwith their studies or may need an opportunity to learn how to play a \nmusical instrument, to get involved in an art class, or perhaps just to \nplay basketball. It may be something that will enrich them or enable \nthem to learn a little bit more about computers.\n  All of these afterschool activities are good, but we really need to \nfocus on it to make the schoolday reflect the reality of American \nfamilies.\n  The same thing is true with the school year. Three months off in the \nsummer so the kids can go work on the farm--there are not a lot of kids \nworking on the farm, even in Illinois. The question is whether or not \nthere should be a summer school opportunity for enrichment for \nchildren.\n  You find that kids, if they have tested well at the end of the school \nyear, and they are gone for 3 months, when they come back they lose \nlots of what they learned. So when we invest money in summer programs \nto enrich kids, and give them new opportunities, and they continue to \nlearn, it is a good investment in continuing education.\n  I think taking money from the $1.6 trillion Bush tax cut, which goes \nprimarily to wealthy people, and putting it into education so kids have \na chance in the 21st century in America makes a lot of sense. That is \nwhy I was happy to support the proposal from Senator Harkin, the \nbipartisan amendment which passed, to cut it back and make sure we have \nmore money invested in education.\n  We celebrated Earth Day last Sunday, too. I think that is worth a \ncomment or two, as well, because if we are going to make investments in \nAmerica, we certainly ought to make investments in environmental \nprotection.\n  Some of the things that have happened in the first 90 or 100 days in \nthe Bush administration have been very troubling, such as this whole \ndebate over arsenic in drinking water. I happen to believe we ought to \ntake a serious look at what we breathe and what we drink and what we \neat to make certain that it is safe.\n  All of us are concerned about public health statistics that show an \nincrease in cancer, in pulmonary disease, factors that lead us to \nquestion why is this happening now in an America that is so modern, in \nan America with so many health resources. I think, in many instances, \nit gets down to the basics--the water we drink, the air we breathe, the \nfood we eat.\n  When the administration came in initially and said they were not \ngoing to stick with the Clinton proposal of reducing the arsenic \ncontent in water, there was a cry across America because families said: \nWhy are we doing that? Wouldn't we want to make water safer? We know \nthat arsenic is a carcinogen. It causes cancer: lung cancer, bladder \ncancer, skin cancer.\n  For years now, we know that Europe has had a safer arsenic standard. \nWe know the National Academy of Sciences tells us we should move to the \nsafer standard. Why would the Bush White House reverse that position? \nBut they did.\n  Last week you may have heard Christine Todd Whitman at the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency say they were going to reconsider this \ndecision. This debate goes back and forth. But I tell you, when it gets \ndown to something as basic as the safety of the water we drink, we \nexpect the White House to be listening to families across America and \nnot to special interest groups that are pushing for relaxed \nenvironmental standards.\n  Whether we are talking about carbon dioxide in the air--which is part \nof global warming--whether we are talking about lead or whether we are \ntalking about arsenic in drinking water, the Environmental Protection \nAgency is supposed to be just that: an agency to protect the \nenvironment, not a revolving door so that special interests and \ncorporate interests can come through and change regulations to their \nliking.\n  I am glad they are going to reconsider their position on arsenic in \ndrinking water. But I certainly hope that is not an isolated situation \nwhere they found religion. I hope that it reflects a new idea in the \nBush White House about true environmental protection.\n  We can take a look at some of the energy concerns across America, and \nthey are directly linked to the environmental questions. The people who \nhave talked to me for the last several months in Illinois about \nincreased heating bills and the high natural gas prices now are talking \nabout increases in gasoline prices at the pump. I don't know if it is \nhappening across America, but it is certainly happening, again, for the \nsecond year in a row, in Illinois, where we are seeing this runup in \ngasoline prices at the pump.\n  Yesterday, two of the major oil companies reported record profits. It \nis no surprise; the families and businesses I represent are paying more \nat the pump, and that must translate into profits for some. The \nquestion is, When the President's task force on energy policy comes in \nwith a report in a few weeks, will they take into consideration the \nconsumers, the people who are paying the bills--the higher electricity \nbills, the higher heating bills, the higher gasoline bills? It is not \nappropriate or fair, as far as I am concerned, for them to just look at \nit from the corporate viewpoint.\n  I know the President and many of his people in the White House have \nbeen closely aligned with the oil industry in Texas. I understand that. \nThat is part of their background. But I think their responsibility now \ngoes far beyond the industry. It is time for them to be sensitive to \nthe families and consumers who are paying the bills.\n  A lady came to see me yesterday in Chicago and talked about the \nincrease in gasoline prices. She has a small business, a messenger \nservice. She said: Senator, here we go again. It hit us last year and \nit is coming back this year. I have to lay off people. I can't afford \nthis.\n  I had some people who came to me from a steel company in Chicago, \nFinkl Steel. They have had an increase in natural gas prices, which \nmeans an increase in the cost of their product. They find it difficult \nto pass along this cost to their consumers as they are struggling to \nkeep everybody working in their plant.\n  These energy prices, as they are going up, have a direct impact on \nemployment. We have to try to find an energy policy that accomplishes \nseveral things. First, it gives America a reliable source of energy; \nsecond, it makes certain consumers are not disadvantaged in the \nprocess; and, third, it respects our environment.\n  I certainly hope the Bush administration comes in with a proposal on \nthis and that they will, in fact, take all three factors into \nconsideration, and not just the profitability of the energy industry.\n  So we have an important debate ahead of us in Washington on a number \nof issues related to education, environment, energy policy, and \ncertainly health care. I left health care for last because it is \nsomething that I think we have forgotten, and we should not. The people \nI represent have not forgotten it.\n  I went up to Palatine, IL, to the clinic run by the Cook County \nBureau of Health Services and Northwest Community Health Care. I was \nthere with the mayor, Rita Mullins. After we went\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\ninto this clinic, Dr. Rodriguez came up to me and the first words out \nof his mouth were: Welcome, Senator. We need universal health care.\n  That was the first thing he said to me. He had a waiting room full of \npeople with small children who were uninsured, people who were charity \ncases for that clinic.\n  Each day in America more people lose health insurance. At a time of \nprosperity, when those of us in Congress are supposed to be sensitive \nto the real problems of families, we are totally ignoring the obvious. \nMore and more people are uninsured. Fewer and fewer families have peace \nof mind when it comes to health insurance. More and more employers are \ncutting back on health insurance coverage for their employees, and they \nare making it difficult for those employees to protect their families.\n\n  I know a fellow who had a small business with only about 10 \nemployees. One of the children of one of his employees had a serious \nhealth problem. As a result of that health problem, the employee \nincurred very expensive medical bills. The health insurance company \ncame back the next year and said: We are increasing your premiums by \nover 50 percent because of the one child in the one family. Because of \nthat, the business was forced to drop health insurance coverage and to \nmerely give their employees the amount of money they had traditionally \nspent for health insurance policies in the past. At least they did \nsomething, but it was of little or no help to the one man and his \nfamily who had been hit by all these medical bills.\n  That is the reality of the America in which we live. There are \nvirtually no proposals before Congress to deal with this problem. We \ncannot overlook it because the people who get severely ill in this \ncountry end up showing up, at some point, at the hospital when they are \nfacing an acute illness. They do get treatment, at the expense of the \nsystem, at the expense of everyone else who pays for health insurance \npremiums across this country.\n  There are several things I think we can do. First, I believe we \nshould provide tax benefits, deductions, and credits for small \nbusinesses that offer health insurance. Give them a helping hand in the \nTax Code. If the President can find $1.6 trillion for a tax cut, \nprimarily for the wealthiest people in this country, for goodness' \nsake, can't we find a tax break for small businesses so they can \nprovide health insurance for their employees? I think that is good for \nthe family who owns the business as well as those who work there.\n  Secondly, I have introduced legislation called caregivers insurance. \nThis is what I am trying to achieve. We entrust the people we love the \nmost in our lives to those who are paid a minimum wage.\n  Who am I talking about? Our children and grandchildren in daycare, \nour disabled friends and relatives who need a personal attendant, our \nparents and grandparents in nursing homes. They are primarily attended \nto and watched by those making the minimum wage, and these people who \nare keeping an eye on the folks we love the most generally don't have \nany benefits; they certainly do not have any health insurance in most \ninstances.\n  The plan I propose, caregivers insurance, would make all of these \nlicensed workers in daycare facilities, personal attendants to the \ndisabled, and those working in nursing homes eligible for Medicaid \ncoverage in their States. The State of Rhode Island is doing this. I \nthink every State should do this--so that it is part of that job.\n  The turnover in these businesses is 50 percent or more each year. If \nwe are going to keep good daycare workers, if we are going to keep good \nworking people at nursing homes, we ought to give them the peace of \nmind of having health insurance. That is something we should do in this \nCongress. I hope the caregivers across America to whom we say we are \nwilling to entrust our children and our parents can come together and \nprevail in this Congress for this health insurance protection. So as we \nget into this debate, the serious part of it in the appropriations \nbills, we have an important agenda ahead of us.\n  The President will have completed his first 100 days as of next \nMonday. At that time, people will make an assessment. I think the \nPresident deserves good marks in some areas even though I sit on the \nother side of the aisle from his party. I certainly acknowledge that he \nhas shown a sensitivity to many issues to which the American people are \nsensitive as well.\n  But I think the basic question is whether this White House is really \nfocused on the average family, the working family, the people who are \ngood citizens in their neighborhoods and in their parishes and churches \nand synagogues and temples, people who are paying their taxes, obeying \nthe law, doing their best to raise their kids, whether this \nadministration keeps them in mind when it talks about a tax cut plan \nthat should be benefiting these families as much as the wealthy--sadly, \nthe Bush tax cut really is focused on helping the wealthiest among us \nand not these families who make up the core values of America--and \nwhether the President's plan on education really thinks about families \nacross America in the cities and rural towns in Illinois and the \nsuburbs around Chicago, families who want their kids to have the very \nbest education, whether the President is really prepared not only to \ngive a speech about education but to provide a budget which funds \neducation at levels so that education quality is maintained and \nimproved for this country.\n\n  Finally, of course, when it comes to the environment, that the people \nat the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the \nInterior will think about their public responsibility to the legacy we \nare leaving our children. This Earth should be cleaner. It should be \nsafer. There should not be questions about the water we drink, the \narsenic levels in it, the air we breathe, and whether or not we are \ndoing our share in America to deal with global warming. We need to have \nthe courage and the leadership in the White House to be sensitive to \nenvironmental issues that will affect generations to come.\n  The assessment of the first 100 days will be made by many, but the \nmost important assessment will be made by that family back in Illinois, \nor whatever State they may be from, who will ask this basic question: \nDoes this administration, does this White House, and does this Congress \nreally care about me and my family? Are they making decisions for \nspecial interest groups or for those who have all of the power in \nWashington or are they remembering the real America, the families in \neach community who make this the great nation it is?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3805-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3805-S3807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, maybe I should have taken the time to \nlook at some notes. Instead, I will speak extemporaneously about the \neducation bill.\n  I will take a few moments to talk about an issue that is near and \ndear to me, given my own background as a teacher and my great passion \nabout children and education. I will talk about the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Before we went on break, I objected to a motion to proceed to this \nbill. The main reason I objected was I did not know what was in the \nbill. As a legislator, as a Senator from Minnesota, who gives, if you \nwill, a special priority to children and education, I wanted to know \nwhat is in the bill.\n  The second question, of course, has to do with appropriations. But, \nfirst things first. I wanted to know what is in this bill, and there \nare some questions I want to raise right now in anticipation of what \nwill probably be a very rigorous and vigorous debate about education \nbefore the Senate. This is as it should be.\n  The title of this bill is called BEST. President Bush is arguing we \ncan do our best for children and for education by the Federal \nGovernment requiring that every school throughout the United States of \nAmerica having annual testing starting at age 8 with\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\nthird graders, going through age 13. This will be in addition to the \ntesting that now takes place.\n  The first point I want to make today about this legislation is that \nwe have to be very clear in the language that there is no abuse of \ntesting and that at the local and State level, school officials and \nthose who administer this test will be able to rely on multiple \nmeasures. We want to be very careful that this testing is consistent \nwith National professional standards of testing. That is very \nimportant. Quite often there is confusion between accountability, which \nwe are all for, and a single standardized test. They are not one in the \nsame thing.\n  The second point is if, in fact, we are going to have this mandate on \nall of the States to do this testing, there has to be money committed \nto administer these tests. This should not become an ``unfunded \nmandate.'' States and school districts will be interested in that.\n\n  Most important of all, if we are going to have a massive requirement \nwhich puts all of the emphasis on testing, we also should make a \nmassive commitment by way of resources to make sure all of the schools, \nteachers, and children have the same opportunity to do well on these \ntests.\n  Right now, we do not have that. What we have from the President is a \ntin cup budget for education. I have said it over and over and over \nagain in the Senate, and in articles, one cannot realize the goal of \nleaving no child behind on a tin cup budget. At the moment, we have \nvery little by way of increase in expenditures for education under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. That, to me, is unconscionable. \nIf we are going to now basically say to every State, every school \ndistrict, every school, every child, take these tests and this is going \nto be how we will measure how you are doing, we will set up a lot of \nschools, teachers, and children for failure unless we give them the \nresources to make sure the children can do well.\n  I will be very interested to see when we move to this bill, whether \nor not there is a new, bold commitment to the title I program for kids \nwho come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Now it is funded at a 33-\npercent level. I will be interested to see whether or not there is a \ncommitment to afterschool programs, whether or not there is a \ncommitment to additional help for kids in reading, and whether or not \nthere is a commitment for rebuilding our crumbling schools. I will want \nto see whether or not we have a commitment to smaller class size and \nwhether or not we have a commitment to recruiting good teachers. If we \ndon't do that and we don't live up to what is our responsibility, we \nhave put the cart before the horse. We are going to hold the schools, \nchildren, and teachers accountable where we should be held accountable.\n  Where is the investment, I ask. I probably will offer a trigger \namendment, if, in fact, this bill comes to the floor, which will say \nthat no state will be required to implement the new testing under this \nbill until we fully fund the federal share of the IDEA program, which \nis a program for kids with special needs. How can we not fully fund \nthis program? Right now, we are funding IDEA at one-third of what we \nowe. We need to pay for everything that we owe. How can we not fund \nthat? How can we not fully fund the title I program? How can we not \nfund teacher recruitment, smaller class size, investing in crumbling \nbuildings, before we start saying we will have tests every year?\n  What the President has done, what the administration has done, and \nwhat too many Democrats seem to be accepting is the idea that tests are \nthe reform. The tests are the way we assess reform. I do not believe we \nwill be doing our best for children in America if the only thing we \nwill do is force tests on every State and school district in the \ncountry without at the same time giving the schools and teachers and \nchildren the resources to do well.\n  If we want to make the argument that to invest money and not have any \ntests is to not have any accountability, fine; let's have \naccountability, if the testing is done the right way. My argument is if \nall we do is have the tests and we have hardly any new additional \ninvestment in education and in children, what we have done is have \naccountability but it is a waste of time.\n  Quite frankly, until we get serious--the President is not; not in the \nbudget--it does not matter the words we utter. It is not the photo ops. \nIt is not visiting children in schools. Where it matters is whether or \nnot we are willing to make the investment.\n\n  Senator Harkin and I had an amendment that called for $225 billion \nmore by way of investment in education over the next 10 years. That \nmust be kept in the Budget Conference Committee. That amendment is all \nabout investment in children. Unless we do that, unless we make that \nkind of a commitment, we are not doing our best for children.\n  My hope is that Democrats will make it very clear to our colleagues \non the other side that anything and everything that helps children and \neducation, we are for. Any way we can work together, we should do so. \nBut we are not going to throw our support behind an education program \nwhich calls itself BEST--which does not come anywhere close to how we \ncan do our best for children--all for the sake of $2 trillion in Robin-\nHood-in-reverse tax cuts, with over 40 percent of the benefits going to \nmillionaires.\n  This President so far has not shown the commitment to make the \ninvestment in children and education. I hope the Democrats will stand \nup for children and stand up for education. We will make it crystal \nclear that if we are going to have this mandate of all these tests, the \nresources are going to come with it. That is the second point.\n  Finally, there are some fairly serious policy questions left \noutstanding. One of those policy questions has to do with what is \ncalled the Straight A's Program. The question is whether or not we are \nnow beginning to go to block granting to, seven States. This, \ntheoretically could affect a large number of children in America. It \nwould mean we would all of a sudden move away from safe and drug-free \nschools, move away from afterschool programs, move away from certain \nprograms that we have passed as a national community. We want to have \nseparate funding for these programs, we want to make these programs a \npriority, for every child, no matter where he or she lives. To move \naway from that Federal commitment without some fairly strong language \nthat makes sure all of the children are going to benefit; that makes \nsure this is not abused in any way, shape, or form; that makes sure \nthis is not used for extras as opposed to what can help children do \ntheir very best; I think we have to be vigilant on this question.\n  I think this could shape up as a historic agreement if it is real. \nBut if it is not real, and the President is not willing to back his \nrhetoric with resources, and instead he puts most of these resources \ninto tax cuts for, basically, wealthy people at the top, and does not \nmake this investment in education for children, Democrats should speak \nup for kids. We should speak up for education. We should speak up for \nour school boards and our school districts and our States.\n  As far as my State of Minnesota is concerned, I have been in enough \nmeetings with enough schools and enough teachers. We are going through \na very difficult battle at the State level, as well, on the education \nbudget. More than anything, what all of the good teachers tell me is \ngive them the resources to work. And, by the way, in addition, what the \nreally good teachers say is they do not want to be forced into some \nsort of straitjacket education, where everybody is teaching to low \nquality tests and to the lowest common denominator. This is the \neducational deadening. If we are going to use tests, they must be high \nquality. We have got to get it right, do it the right way.\n  Maybe every Senator has been in a school. I have tried to be in a \nschool every 2 weeks for the last 10\\1/2\\ years. If you get to the \nschool level, you get down in the trenches, you realize a lot of what \npurports to be reform, may, in fact, not be so good for kids in \nschools. It may, in fact, be counterproductive. It certainly will be, \nunless we get the investment in resources.\n\n  For my own part, I objected before spring recess to move forward with \nthe bill, and I will continue to object until I see what is in the \nbill, and then we will see whether we go forward in the debate. I hope, \nunless the President comes forward with a real investment of resources, \nthat Democrats and some Republicans will directly challenge\n\n[[Page S3807]]\n\nthis piece of legislation. I don't want to have a piece of legislation \nthat has this great acronym ``BEST'' with all of the symbolic politics \nthat purport to do so well for children and, in fact, do not. We \nshouldn't play symbolic politics with children's lives. We ought to be \nable to do well for kids and get the resources to the school districts, \nthe resources to the States, the resources to the schools, the \nresources to the teachers, and the resources to the kids. At the \nminimum, we ought to do that.\n  That would be my commitment in this debate that is to come.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our \nenvironment, and the right of all American families to clean air, clean \nwater, and a clean future for generations to come.\n  Maintaining a clean and safe environment should not be a partisan \nissue. All of us live on the same planet. We all breathe the same air. \nWe all drink the same water. When it comes to our global environment, \nwe are one community.\n  In fact, when Americans voted last November, they voted for two \nPresidential candidates who both professed a strong commitment to our \nglobal environment. Former Vice President Gore obviously made \nenvironmental protection a top priority. But President Bush also made \nseveral promises to improve environmental conditions.\n  Unfortunately, as we celebrate Earth Day, Americans around the \ncountry are growing increasingly concerned that these environmental \npromises have not been kept. Instead, we have seen a series of actions \nthat threaten to have significant and adverse effects on the quality of \nour air and water, and on the natural resources that our children and \ngrandchildren will inherit.\n  First, President Bush reneged on a campaign promise to regulate \ncarbon dioxide emissions. Then he caused an embarrassment abroad by \nannouncing the United States' withdrawal from an international \ninitiative to address global warming. He went on to block new \nprotections against arsenic in our drinking water, even though \nscientists have clearly found that Americans face unacceptably high \ncancer risks from arsenic in drinking water under existing standards.\n  These actions are out of step, in my belief, with the American \npeople. Certainly they are out of step with the people of New Jersey. \nAmericans understand and reject the outdated notion that we need to \nsacrifice the environment in the name of the economy.\n  Unfortunately, the attack on our environment continued in the \nPresident's budget, which would slash funding for EPA and natural \nresource programs by 15 percent over 10 years. This would significantly \nweaken our commitment to environmental protection in many ways.\n  Consider, for example, the President's request for funding for water \ninfrastructure funding. The President is reducing the funding for the \nClean Water State Revolving Fund and wastewater loan program by $450 \nmillion in this budget year. Yet more than 40 percent of our Nation's \nwaters are not safe for fishing and swimming. In my own State of New \nJersey, 85 percent of the water does not meet the quality standards of \nthe Clean Water Act. I cannot and will not support a budget that will \ntake us to even lower standards of protection.\n  I also am concerned about the administration's proposal to cut \nfunding for clean air programs at the EPA. More than 100 million \nAmericans today breathe air that does not meet the standards of the \nClean Air Act. Yet President Bush's budget cuts EPA's clean air \nprograms by 6 percent next year, from $590 million to $564 million. \nThis could have a serious impact, especially for those more vulnerable \nto dirty air: the young, the old, and the infirm. Just this week we saw \nnew scientific evidence of the carcinogenic impact of breathing soot in \nour air. I know it will have an impact in my State where the air \nquality in 9 of our cities and countries is among the worst in the \nNation. We need to move against this.\n  While the cuts to programs like clean air and clean water may tend to \nget the most attention--and maybe they should--I am especially \nconcerned about the cuts in the President's budget for EPA's \nenforcement operations--the so-called compassionate compliance. We can \nhave lots of strong laws on the books to protect our environment, but \nif they're not enforced, they're worth little more than the paper \nthey're written on. We in New Jersey have seen the consequences of \nunderfunding enforcement. For example, our State reduced funding for \nour water pollution control enforcement program by 26 percent. I \nrepeat, 85 percent of our waterways do not meet the clean water \nstandards. That is a major reason why we continue to have such \nsignificant water quality problems in our State. We are not enforcing \nthe rules that we have on the books. I hope we will not repeat this \nkind of mistake at the national level.\n  The President's budget also underfunds initiatives to conserve energy \nand to develop clean energy technologies. Overall, the budget cuts for \nthe Department of Energy are $700 million next year. This includes a \n$103 million cut in renewable energy research and development, and a \n$20 million cut in energy conservation programs. These cuts come at a \ntime when our Nation is once again confronted with the need to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil and to develop a comprehensive energy \npolicy. An energy policy that addresses this challenge should have \nrenewables and energy conservation as centerpieces. Instead, this \nbudget puts them on the chopping block.\n  The President's budget also threatens our Nation's land and wildlife \nresources. It would weaken the protections of the Endangered Species \nAct, underfund land conservation initiatives, and generally weaken the \nDepartment of Interior's efforts to protect and preserve our Nation's \ngreat natural heritage, including our national parks. This will \nundermine numerous efforts by our States to fight the effects of sprawl \nand over-development, including the one spearheaded in my own State of \nNew Jersey by our then-Governor, Christie Todd Whitman. She implemented \na 100,000-acre open space initiative as Governor. I am concerned \nbecause in New Jersey the Sierra Club estimates that we are losing \n10,000 acres of our dwindling open space a year. In New Jersey, these \nare real issues for us. We are the most densely populated State in the \nNation.\n  The budget goes beyond cuts in some cases; for example, it eliminates \nthe popular Wetlands Reserve Program. This is a voluntary program that \ncreates incentives for farmers to manage their lands as wetlands. \nFinally, the budget proposes to drill the pristine Arctic Refuge in \nAlaska at the expense of rare species and fragile ecosystems.\n  Let me say that I would always prefer to give the President the \nbenefit of the doubt. His actions, and the things he has to do, are \ndifficult for everyone. But it is simply wrong to give big corporate \ninterests such overwhelming influence in the development of \nenvironmental policies. The mining industry may do a lot of good, but \nit should not control policies over public lands. The oil and gas \nindustries play important roles, but their short-term interests should \nnot undermine the broader public interest in protecting our precious \nnatural resources. We need a more balanced approach then we have been \ngetting thus far in our discussion of the environment.\n  It is a great disappointment to me and many of my constituents given \nhow important the environment is to each of them and their families. I \nhave certainly heard that as I have traveled across New Jersey in the \nweeks leading up to Earth Day.\n  I hope we in the Congress will do what we can to help restore a \nbalance to our Nation's environmental policy. I assure the people of \nNew Jersey that I will continue to do all I can to resist efforts that \nwould lead to dirtier water and dirtier air and erode our national \nheritage. The stakes are vital to our country and to my State. The \nAmerican people deserve better.\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to take a brief moment to speak \nabout one element of the education issue which as we move towards the \ndebate on the education bill will be discussed at considerable length \nin this Chamber.\n  I want to lay out a predicate for this discussion. That involves the \nissue of what I call portability, or choice. Some have tried to place \non it the nomenclature of vouchers, which really isn't accurate. But \nthe issue is giving parents options in the educational system to assist \nthem in ensuring that their children get an education which is of \nbenefit to them and allows them to be competitive in our society.\n  I think we all understand that the core element of success in our \nsociety is quality education. We especially understand that in New \nJersey where we don't have a natural resource to mine or agricultural \nproducts. We don't have some unique physical characteristic that gives \nus the ability to create income as a result of that characteristic. The \nessence of what gives our State its competitive advantage is the fact \nthat we have a lot of people who are well-educated, intelligent, and \nare able to compete successfully in a very highly technical society.\n  That is a definition that can be applied to our country as we see a \nglobal market develop in all sorts of commodities. It becomes very \nclear that the theories of Adam Smith apply in our society and in our \nworld today. There are certain products and certain capabilities which \none society is better at than other societies. Fortunately, our society \nis best at those activities which produce the most wealth and the most \nprosperity. A large percentage of those products and capabilities \ninvolve technology. They involve intellectual capacity, and they \nrequire a strong education system to succeed.\n\n  Regrettably, what we have seen in our society today is an educational \nsystem that has not kept up with the needs of our Nation. In fact, tens \nof thousands--literally hundreds of thousands--of kids in our \neducational system simply aren't being educated at a level which makes \nthem competitive in this high-technology world. It makes them capable \nof being successful, which means when they leave school they have the \ncapacity to compete with their peers in English and math and basic \nscience.\n  We have seen this regrettably for years and years. The situation \nhasn't improved a whole lot. In fact, we see in study after study the \nconclusion that our school systems aren't working that well in many \nparts of our country; that we are well behind other nations which we \nare competitors with in the international community in the \nindustrialized world. We rank close to last in math and science. It is \nespecially true of kids who come to the table of education who have a \nnatural disadvantage of coming from a low-income background. Those kids \nare even further behind than kids who do not have that disadvantage \ncoming to the educational table. In fact, as I commented in this \nChamber before, the average child in the fourth grade coming from a \nlow-income background reads at two grade levels from his or her peers.\n  The same is true nationally. It is throughout the system. It is not \njust fourth grade. We have seen the dropout rate. We see the lack of \ncapacity to be competitive academically on the low-income side, and \nespecially the minority side in our urban areas is a staggering \nproblem. It hasn't improved even though we have spent hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in this country trying to improve the system. What \ncan we do to change that?\n  We are bringing out an educational bill on the floor with amendments \nto address a number of areas, and it has some very unique and creative \ninitiatives. The President made it his No. 1 priority. He brought \nforward the debate and I think moved the debate dramatically down the \nroad or significantly down the road towards trying to get a different \napproach to this issue, recognizing that we have not been successful \nwith the way things have been working for the last 20 or 30 years. He \nhas suggested that we give schools more flexibility, but in exchange \nfor flexibility for parents, teachers and principals in the school \nsystem require more accountability, and that we hold that \naccountability to be applied not only to the norm but to every \nindividual group within the norm, whatever their ethnic, race, or \nincome background. It is basically a testing program that requires kids \nmaintain that level of proficiency in their grade level.\n  But what happens when you see a school system which continues to fail \nyear in and year out? You may say: Who defines failure? The Federal \nGovernment? No. Failure is defined by the local school district or the \nState school board deciding what a child should know in the third, \nfourth, fifth, and sixth grades. It is not the Federal Government \nsetting the standard. It is the local school boards.\n  But we know literally thousands of schools in this country year in \nand year out meet the standards when it comes to teachers teaching kids \nin those school districts and those school buildings--standards which \nare set up not by the Federal Government but are set up by the local \nschool districts or by the States.\n\n  Literally thousands of schools are not cutting it this year. They \nhave not cut it for years in sequence. In some of our urban areas, 80 \nor 90 percent of the schools simply are not teaching the children in \nthose school systems at a level that the local school district or the \nlocal school board or State school board defines as educational \nproficiency.\n  A parent who has to send their child to that school says to \nthemselves: What am I to do? My child started in this school in the \nfirst grade and the school was failing. Now my child is in the fifth or \nsixth or seventh grade and the school is still failing. My child has \npassed through a system which simply wasn't teaching them what they \nwere supposed to be taught, and everyone knew that child wasn't \nlearning what they needed to learn.\n  What can the parent do under our present rules? The parent can do \nvirtually nothing to try to help their child unless they happen to come \nfrom a reasonably high-income family. Then they can take the child out \nof school, or even a moderate-income family if they have a Catholic \nschool system somewhere or a religious school system somewhere that has \na low cost and have their child go to that school. But for most low-\nincome families in our urban communities, their options are \nnonexistent. If you are the single mother with two or three kids, or \neven one child, and your child is trapped in that school system, you \nare saying to yourself: How is my child ever going to have the \nknowledge they need in order to be successful? How am I going to get my \nchild to a point where they can read and do math, where they can step \nout of that school and get a good job, and where they aren't going to \nbe assigned to a situation where they cannot compete in our society \nbecause they haven't been taught? That single mother's options are \nnonexistent today.\n  Some of us on our side of the aisle, and a few on the other side of \nthe aisle, have suggested giving parents some options. Let's say to a \nparent whose child is locked in the school that has failed year in and \nyear out--we are not talking about all parents. We are just talking \nabout parents in low-income families, and single moms trying to make a \nliving. They have a job. They are sending their kids to school. Their \nkids are in a school that doesn't work. Let's say to those parents that \nwe have some other options. After 3 years in that school system that \nhas failed, the parent will have an option to use the special money \nwhich the Federal Government sends to that school system to benefit \nlow-income children, which obviously isn't doing any benefit.\n  You, the parent, will have the ability to take a proportion of that \nmoney and have it follow your child to another school, either a public \nschool or a private school, where your child will have a chance to \nsucceed. Your child will have a chance to participate in the American \ndream rather than to be locked out of it because they are in a school \nthat does not work.\n\n[[Page S3809]]\n\n  This concept has been demonized. This concept has been vilified. This \nconcept has been aggressively attacked, primarily by the liberal \neducational establishment in this country, essentially the leadership \nof the labor unions. Why is that? This concept of giving parents whose \nkids are stuck in failing schools--low-income parents, most of them \nsingle parents, most of them women--an option to do something to try to \nbring their kids out of that destitute situation, why has it been so \nattacked by the major labor union movement in this country which \ncontrols the teachers' unions? Primarily because it is the first step \nto what is known as competition.\n  Competition is an evil term when it comes to the liberal educational \nestablishment in this country. I am not really sure why it is an evil \nterm. If you go out to buy a car, you decide on buying that car because \nthere is competition. Competition has produced the one car that does a \nbetter job of what you are interested in than what somebody else has \nbuilt. You buy a Ford over a Chevrolet or a Chrysler over a Chevrolet \nor maybe a Chevrolet over a Chrysler because you decide they build a \nbetter product that meets your needs more appropriately.\n  Competition has been the essence of what has produced quality in the \narea of products in our country. They will say, this is not a \nChevrolet; it is education. No, it is not a Chevrolet. This isn't cars. \nThis is service. In the area of service you do exactly the same thing.\n  If you have a doctor who you think is not taking care of you or your \nfamily correctly, you go to another doctor. If you have a dentist who \nis not taking care of you correctly--maybe he drilled into your tooth \nand did not give you any novocaine which caused you a little pain--you \ngo to another dentist.\n  For service providers, the same is true right across the board in our \ncountry. The only place where service isn't provided in a competitive \nway in our society with any significance, outside of pure Government is \nin public education. As a result, regrettably, when a child is locked \nin a failing school, the parent has no options. That is not fair. It is \nnot fair to that child. It is especially not fair to the low-income \nparent in America. It is not fair to the urban poor in America that \ntheir children are the only children who are subjected to this lack of \nability to have a chance at the American dream because we have a \nsociety which demands that they attend a school that fails year in and \nyear out.\n  So we have suggested, let's give these parents and these kids a \nchance. Let's take a small percentage of the funds and allow the parent \nto use those funds to bootstrap that child into some other educational \nvenue where they think they can do a better job, where the parent \nthinks they can do a better job. It can be a public school or it can be \na private school.\n  This is an idea that has caused great disruption obviously in the \neducational community. But let me point out it is working today with \nState and local dollars. It is working in the city of Milwaukee and in \nthe State of Arizona. They allow the State tax dollars and the local \ntax dollars to follow the child to the educational venue, the \neducational place they wish to go. It works very well.\n\n  Listen to the mayor of Milwaukee, who happens to be a very active \nDemocrat, and he proselytizes on this issue about how good it has been \nfor the kids in the inner city, to give them a chance to be more \nsuccessful, a chance to live the American dream. Remember, we are not \nproposing--and this is critical to understand--a unilateral Federal \nprogram that comes into the State, comes into the community, and says: \nYou must allow the parent to have portability, to have those dollars \nfollow the child.\n  What we are saying is this: We are going to put on the cafeteria line \nof Federal programs an idea. You, the local school district, you, the \nState, if you decide to, through your elected officials--and it is key \nto underline that; through your elected officials--can take off that \ncafeteria line the idea of portability, having the dollars follow the \nchild. So it is going to be a program which is totally controlled by \npublicly elected officials. It will be only at the discretion of \npublicly elected officials who control the public educational system.\n  So if the public education system in Milwaukee wants to use the \nWisconsin dollars and the Milwaukee dollars, and then wants to also use \nthe Federal dollars, they can do that. But if the public education \nsystem in Chicago does not want to use Federal dollars or local dollars \nor State dollars in order to give parents the option, then it will not \nhappen.\n  This is not a unilateral exercise. This is an exercise which is \nrelated to the local community making the decision, through its locally \nelected officials, who control local education. So it is not some huge \nscheme that is going to be settled on the community from above.\n  Why shouldn't we say to the city of Milwaukee: All right, you have a \nprogram that you think is working very well. You are taking your State \ntax dollars, you are taking your local property tax dollars, and you \nhave set up a program where those dollars follow the child. But, \nunfortunately, you, Milwaukee, today, under our law today, cannot take \nFederal dollars and follow the child. Your Federal dollars have to go \nto the public school system. They have to go to the public schools, and \nit is not in relation to how many low-income kids there are in the \nschools--and there can be some low-income kids who do not get any \ndollars for education--but, rather, it is in relationship to some \narbitrary formula settled back in 1976 that simply happens to be a \nformula based on political expediency today.\n  Why shouldn't we say to Milwaukee: We are not going to do that any \nlonger, Milwaukee. You have made a decision as to how you think you can \neducate your children. We are going to let the Federal dollars follow \nthe local and State dollars. Specifically, in Milwaukee, if you decide \nto do it, we are going to allow you to use these dollars with \nportability, so the parents can have options; the same with Arizona.\n  That is what we are proposing. It is really not radical at all. It is \nnot a Federal initiative demanding we have a national program on \n``vouchers,'' a word that has been made a pejorative term. It is a \nprogram that suggests that local communities and States may decide that \nparents, who have their kids in failing schools, where those schools \nhave failed year in and year out, can do something for their children \nthat will create some competition in the educational market, something \nwhich is fundamental to the American society in producing quality. It \nis a program that suggests that those school districts which have made \nthose decisions locally or statewide, through their elected leaders, \nwill have the option, with our Federal dollars, to do the same.\n  That idea has retained huge resistance; the resistance isn't \nrational. The resistance is political. It is driven by a desire \nbasically not to allow competition, not to allow creativity in our \nlocal school districts, but to drive the process of education from \nWashington, so that an elite few can decide for many how education is \npursued nationally.\n  We are going to discuss this at greater length as we move down the \nroad on the education bill. But I thought it would be appropriate at \nthis time to at least lay down the foundation for the predicate of the \ndebate because it is grossly misrepresented in the press, not because \nthe press does not understand the issue but because the presenters to \nthe press maybe want to misrepresent. I believe it is appropriate to \nmaybe begin to make clear for the record what is being proposed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to draw the attention of this \nbody to a report that was released just today by the Federal Trade \nCommission. It is a followup study to one that was done last year on \nthe issue of the marketing of violent, adult-rated entertainment \nmaterial to children. It was a groundbreaking Federal Trade Commission \nstudy last year that found that much of our adult material, adult-rated \nentertainment material--movies, video games, music--was adult rated by \nthe companies themselves, entertainment companies, the conglomerates, \nand then target-marketed back to children, for example, in the Joe \nCamel advertisement. It was said this was an adult-rated product, \ncigarettes, but using an image to target-market that then back to \nchildren. It turns out the entertainment community--entertainment \ncompanies and movies and music and video games--was doing the exact \nsame thing.\n  That report was released last fall, and it was very discouraging and \ndisappointing that they would do this, particularly at a time when we \nhave so much difficulty with violence in our society, violence among \nkids in our schools, killings among our teenagers.\n  There was a followup study released just today to that September FTC \nstudy. What came forward is that the movie industry is doing somewhat \nbetter about not target-marketing the adult-rated material to children, \nthe video game industry is doing better than the movie industry in not \ntarget-marketing their adult-rated fare to children, and the music \nindustry that is putting forward these hyperviolent, suicide, violence-\ntowards-women lyrics has actually done nothing to change its marketing \npractice and continues to directly target-market adult-rated material. \nThis is material the music companies themselves deem to be \ninappropriate for children. They put an adult sticker, parental \nadvisory, on this material, and they turn around and continue, with \nmillions of dollars in marketing campaigns, to target children.\n  They are saying: Yes, we got the study last fall. We saw that. Yes, \nwe were target-marketing adult-rated, parental-advisory-stickered \nmaterial to children last fall. Do you know what. We are going to keep \ndoing it. And they have continued to do that, as shown in this study \nthat was just released today.\n  I asked that industry to come forward and change its marketing \npractices: If you believe this material is inappropriate, to the point \nit needs a parental advisory label on it, don't spend millions of \ndollars to try to bypass parents and get the kids to buy them.\n  What the FTC study found is deeply disappointing. There have been \nsome efforts made at progress, mostly, as I noted, in the video game \nindustry, and more modest attempts in the movie industry. For those \nefforts I offer both praise and encouragement to step up the progress. \nBut the report also found, as I stated, that the recording industry has \nmade no effort to implement any reforms--either those mentioned in the \nreport or the reforms that they, the recording industry themselves, \ntold Congress they would do. This is even more disappointing.\n  Before we had the hearing last fall on the marketing of violent \nmaterial to children, the recording industry stepped up and said: We \nare going to change. Here is a three-point, five-point, seven-point \nplan we are putting forward; we will implement these as an industry to \nchange our marketing practices.\n\n  They volunteered. Now what they have done is they have said: We are \nnot even going to do what we volunteered to Congress we would do--\nchange our marketing practices.\n  I want to read just a few statements from this report because it is \ndeeply disturbing:\n\n       The Commission's review indicates that the entertainment \n     industry had made some progress in limiting advertising in \n     certain teen media and providing rating information in \n     advertising. The industry must make a greater effort, \n     however, if it is to meet the suggestions for improvement \n     included in the Commission's Report as well as its own \n     promises for reform.\n\n  Specifically, the report found, ``ads for R-rated movies still \nappeared on the television programs most popular with teens . . .''--\neven though they are supposed to be a restricted audience for the \nmovie--``and the ratings reasons in ads were either small, fleeting or \ninconspicuously placed.''\n  That was the good part of the study. The report reserved its harshest \ncriticism for the music industry and stated:\n\n       The Commission found that the music recording industry, \n     unlike the motion picture and electronic game industries, has \n     not visibly responded to the Commission's report, nor has it \n     implemented the reforms its trade association announced just \n     before the Commission issued its report. The Commission's \n     review showed that advertising for explicit-content labeled \n     music recordings routinely appeared on popular teen \n     television programming. All five major recording companies \n     placed advertising for explicit content music on TV programs \n     and magazines with substantial under-17 audiences. \n     Furthermore, ads for explicit-content labeled music usually \n     did not indicate that the recording was stickered with a \n     parental advisory label.\n\n  So not only did they market to kids, they didn't warn the parents in \nthe advertising that this was parental labeled material. In the \nadvertising, they said they were not even going to point that out to \nthe parents.\n  If you refer back to the original FTC report released last September, \nyou will find 100 percent of the violent music they studied was target-\nmarketed to kids--100 percent. Evidently the recording industry saw no \nreason to change.\n  Soon the Senate will turn its attention to consider the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, ESEA, and how to provide the best \neducation for all of America's children. I think for every Senator of \nboth parties, ensuring that America's children get a world-class \neducation is a top priority.\n  We also know one of the best measures of what a child learns is time \non task; that is, children learn what they spend their time focusing \non. That is significant because typically the American child spends \nmore time each year watching television and movies, playing video \ngames, listening to music, than he or she does in school. It makes no \nsense to assume that what a child sees, hears, and does in school will \nmold, shape, and enlighten his or her young mind but that what he sees, \nhears, and plays in terms of entertainment will have no impact \nwhatsoever.\n  Many of the most popular songs, games, and movies actively glorify \nviolence and glamorize brutality. There are video games which cast \nplayers as drug kingpins, with the game revolving around selling drugs \nand killing competitors. There are movies which glamorize murder, \ncasting teen idols as dashing killers. And there are numerous songs \nwhich celebrate violence against women--all of which are marketed to \nchildren.\n\n  If being perceived is doing, we clearly have problems on our hands.\n  There is new evidence to suggest that exposing children to violent \nentertainment not only affects their emotional and behavioral \ndevelopment--their sensitivity to other's pain, their ability to \nempathize, and their perceptions of the world around them--but also \ntheir cognitive development. A professor in my alma mater of Kansas \nState has done ground-breaking research on the impact that exposure to \nviolent entertainment has on children's brain activity. Dr. John \nMurray's studies have found that in terms of brain activity, kids who \nare exposed to violent entertainment have a similar experience to those \nwho are exposed to real-life trauma, and their brain responds in much \nthe same fashion.\n  This research, while still in its rudimentary stages, has potentially \nprofound implications for education. I would therefore like to announce \nmy intention to introduce an amendment to ESEA which calls for \nincreased research into the impact that exposing children to violent \nentertainment--violent music, and violent video games--has on their \ncognitive development and educational achievement. I hope and trust \nthat the Senate will adopt this amendment.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues to look at this interim study by \nthe FCC and what has happened.\n  I also urge the recording industry to step up and actually do what \nthey said they would do, which is not to market adult-rated material \nand parental advisory material directly to children. It is harming our \nkids. It is the wrong thing to do. I ask them sincerely to review what \nthey are doing in their marketing campaigns and stop this practice. It \nis harmful.\n  I am hopeful when we have the followup study and the anniversary \nreport\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\nto the FCC study this fall that the recording industry will actually \nstep forward and do what is right.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I want to spend a couple of minutes, if I \ncan, talking about the possibility of us debating and passing a \ncomprehensive bill on elementary and secondary education. My hope is, \nof course, that in the coming days this body will do what it should \nhave done 2 years ago; that is, to pass legislation, as we are required \nto do only once every 5 or 6 years, on elementary and secondary \neducation.\n  This morning across America 55 million children went to school. Fifty \nmillion went to school in a public school; 5 million went to school in \na private or parochial school. We, as President Bush has said, bear a \nprincipal responsibility to the education of all our children, but a \nparticular responsibility to children in our public schools, and even \nfurther, from a Federal standpoint, a particular obligation to the most \ndisadvantaged children across America.\n  That has been our historic participation, to try to assist our \ncommunities, our States, and most particularly families in this country \nwho suffer from various depravations, to see to it that their children \nhave an equal opportunity to success. We have no obligation, in my \nview, to guarantee anybody success in America. But we do bear \nresponsibility to try to provide an equal opportunity to achieving \nsuccess. That is all really any of us can try to accomplish in our \npublic responsibilities.\n  So the Elementary and Secondary Education Act historically over the \nyears has been an effort by the Federal Government to assist and \nparticipate in the improvement of the quality of public education in \nthe United States. For every dollar of education that is spent by our \npublic sectors--State, local governments, and the Federal Government--\nout of every dollar that is spent, the Federal Government spends about \n6 to 8 cents. And 93, 94 cents of the dollar spent on elementary and \nsecondary education comes from local property taxes in most States. I \ndo not know what Oklahoma does, but I know in Connecticut it is mostly \na local property tax. The State also contributes, but primarily it is \nlocal property taxes. So the Federal Government's participation \nfinancially is rather small when you think of it. Out of a dollar \nspent, we contribute about 6 or 7 cents.\n  I am not going to debate this point right now, or discuss this point, \nbut I happen to believe in the 21st century the Federal Government \nought to be a better partner financially. I would like to see us become \nsomeday a one-third partner--the States one-third, the local government \none-third, and the National Government one-third. What a wonderful \nrelief it would be--and I saw the Presiding Officer nod affirmatively \nwhen I spoke of property taxes in Oklahoma, as is the case in \nConnecticut--what a great relief it would be, putting aside education \nissues, if we could say to people in Oklahoma and Connecticut: We are \ngoing to reduce your local property taxes by a third--that is where \nmost of it goes, to education--because your Federal Government is going \nto step up and be a far greater participant in recognizing the national \nbenefits we all accumulate if the quality of public education in this \ncountry improves. So that is what brings us to this particular point.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not we have some \nagreements between the White House and the Senate on an Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. There has been some progress. But we are \nlight-years away from an agreement--light-years away from an agreement.\n  I do not say that with any glee. I had hoped after 2 or 3 weeks of \ndiscussions we would be a lot closer. But reports I have read in the \nnewspaper and heard in the press and heard from the White House, heard \nfrom some quarters here, that we are on the brink of some agreement, is \nvery far from the truth. I think it is a sad commentary, but it happens \nto be a fact. Let me tell you why.\n  First of all, we are asking schools to do some very dramatic things--\ntesting, for one.\n  I am not terribly enthusiastic about testing as the only means of \njudging performance. Testing is really not a reform; it is a \nmeasurement of how well one does. That is all. As an educator in my \nState recently said: When children have a fever, taking their \ntemperature three times an hour is not going to make them feel better; \nmedicine will. Testing every year in and year out is inclined, in my \nview, to turn our schools into nothing more than test prep centers \nacross America.\n  Who is going to pay for that unfunded mandate if we jam that down the \nthroats of communities across the country? I am very concerned with \nthis mandatory testing idea as the only way to judge how students are \nperforming.\n  Many look to our schools as the source of the kids' problems when, in \nfact, in my view, the problems begin before the kids ever get to \nschool. The problems too often are occurring at home. We do not want to \nlook in the mirror and see what is happening in our own homes long \nbefore this child enters kindergarten or the first grade. We now blame \nchild care centers. We blame the kindergarten teacher, the first, \nsecond, third, fourth, or fifth grade teacher because Johnny cannot \nread or Johnny is not performing well.\n  As I said, too often the problems occur long before a child reaches \nschool age or enters a child care center. We need to be a bit more \nrealistic about what we can expect by testing kids all the time, at \nsome significant cost, as a mandate.\n  Accountability standards have been improved. I am willing to support \nsome of those. These are the same accountability standards that have \nbeen developed, frankly, over the last few years. Jeff Bingaman, my \ncolleague from New Mexico, has been the principal author of legislation \nto improve accountability standards that will get us closer to a better \nway of getting schools to live up to the obligations they bear for \ntheir students and families who send their children to these schools.\n  Today's children are part of the first generation that is being \nraised in a truly global world. Nothing we do this year or in the \ncoming years is more important than how we go about providing for our \nchildren's education. If we succeed in this endeavor, our country's \nfuture will be very bright. If we do not succeed, it is going to be \nbleak.\n  With that in mind, I believe we have much work to do as we prepare to \ntake up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. If this debate \nturns out to be a feeding frenzy with literally dozens and dozens of \namendments being proposed every 5 minutes, with Members having little \nknowledge of what they may do, we do not know what we are going to \nproduce.\n  Since we only deal with this once every 5 or 6 years, we ought to \ntake some time and pull this together and come forward with a bill that \ntruly recognizes and reflects bipartisanship, that includes the ideas \nof people who spend a lot of time thinking about how to improve the \nquality of education in our country, rather than one that is a jump \nball that could end up doing a lot more damage despite the press \nreleases\n\n[[Page S3812]]\n\nand pats on the back we give ourselves on how we judge whether or not \nwe have lived up to our obligations.\n  The first issue we have to talk about candidly is the funding of \nthese programs. If, as the President says, education is his top \nnational priority--and I applaud him for that; this is what I call the \nhub of the wheel: education. If we get education right, then we \nincrease dramatically the likelihood that every other issue will be \ndealt with intelligently, and we can build public support and come up \nwith good answers.\n\n  If, in a democratic society, our education system begins to crumble \nand fall apart, then our democratic institutions, in my view, begin to \nfall apart as well. Thomas Jefferson, 200 years ago, said that any \nnation that ever expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was \nand never possibly can be. If that was true at the outset of the 19th \ncentury, then it is even more profoundly true as we begin the 21st \ncentury.\n  Our children will not just be competing with each other--a child in \nOklahoma competing with a child in Connecticut or a child in Louisiana \ncompeting with a child in New Hampshire--it will be a child in Oklahoma \nand a child in Connecticut competing with a child in Beijing, Moscow, \nSouth Africa, Paris, Berlin, and Australia. That is the world in which \nthey will have to be able to compete.\n  What we do this year with elementary and secondary education will be \nhow we begin the 21st century, giving this generation the tools it must \nhave to succeed as a generation and to also perpetuate the vision and \ndream that each generation has embraced over our more-than-200-year \nhistory.\n  Funding is important. I happen to believe if elementary and secondary \neducation is the top priority, then it ought to be reflected in the \nfunding. We know we need approximately $14 billion to meet the 6 or 7 \ncents out of every dollar the U.S. Government contributes to elementary \nand secondary education.\n  What resources will we devote to title I, the most important title of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the primary mechanism \nthrough which the Federal Government provides resources to help low-\nincome schools improve student achievement, resources to pay for more \nteachers, new computers, curricula, and other reforms?\n  According to a study published this year:\n\n       Whenever an inner city or poor rural school is found to be \n     achieving outstanding results with its students by improving \n     innovative strategies, these innovations are almost \n     invariably funded by title I.\n\n  The President's budget provides for an additional $42 billion for all \neducation programs over 10 years. That is approximately $4.2 billion a \nyear out of a huge economy, and I will speak to that in a minute. At \nthe same time, the President's budget includes a $1.6 trillion tax cut \nover that same 10-year period.\n  Think about this. The President said: This is my top priority. He has \nonly been in office about 100 days: This is my top priority. All during \nthe campaign: This is my top priority; $4.2 billion a year versus $1.6 \ntrillion. The numbers speak louder than the rhetoric--much louder.\n  By the way, under the President's tax proposal, approximately $680 \nbillion will go to people who earn more than $300,000 a year. Those are \nnot my numbers; those are the President's numbers: $681 billion will be \ngoing to people who earn $300,000 or more a year. That is where the tax \ncuts go. It appears the President considers tax cuts for people making \nover $300,000 a year to be seven times more important than increased \nfunding for education in America.\n  I do not agree with those priorities. I do not think the President \ndoes, or at least he says he does not. And I know the American public \ndoes not either. In fact, 3 weeks ago, this party on a bipartisan basis \nshowed it does not agree with those priorities either. That is why we \nsupported the amendment of Senator Harkin from Iowa to decrease the tax \ncut by $450 million and devote that amount equally to education \nand debt reduction. That is why we supported the amendment of Senator \nBreaux and Senator Jeffords to reduce the tax cut to provide funding \nfor special education.\n\n  I suspect Connecticut is not different from Oklahoma, Minnesota, or \nLouisiana. When I go home every week and meet with the mayors or first-\nselect people--forget about meeting with the superintendents of schools \nand the PTAs--I say: Tell me what you think are the top priorities. I \nam going back to Washington on Monday; what can I do to help?\n  The answer is: Special education. You guys promised 40 percent of the \ncost of this. You mandated it basically. You said: We will come up with \n40 percent of the money for it. That was 25 years ago, and we have done \nabout, at best, 11 percent. That money is not even included in the \nPresident's budget, although we force it down the throat of the \nadministration.\n  Special education is critically important. Contrary to what some in \nthe administration say: we as a nation cannot afford the increased \nfunding for education, the Democrats are saying we can afford it if we \nreally believe it is a top priority.\n  We are not talking about eliminating the tax cut. We are saying make \na more modest tax cut and use some of those resources for making \neducation the top priority that most people think it ought to be. I \nbelieve it is a priority to help children and communities by fully \nfunding special education. I believe it should be a priority to provide \nchildren with afterschool programs to enrich their lives.\n  I have been willing to go along with the accountability standards. \nSome testing may be fine. We will work that out. But I have asked the \nadministration: How about school construction funds? That is something \nI really care about and I think a lot of parents do, too.\n  Mr. President, 50 percent of our students this morning went to school \nin a building built prior to 1950. Think of that: 50 percent of our \nelementary and secondary kids walked into a building that was built \nprior to 1950.\n  How about some resources for new school construction, wired to \ncompete in a global economy, to have access to the great libraries and \ninstitutions all over the world? A kid who walks into a falling-apart \nbuilding is going to get a falling-apart education. That is not any \ngreat leap of logic; that is a fact.\n  How about some resources for new school construction? How about the \nWhite House saying: We will go along with you on that? I say: You want \nme to support some of your ideas that I think are questionable at best. \nHow about supporting my ideas and those of us who advocate funds for \nschool construction.\n  Smaller class sizes: This should not take more than 5 minutes of \ndebate. If a teacher is in a classroom and has more than 20 kids they \nare not teaching; all they are doing is managing chaos in most \ninstances. The teacher cannot teach; the kids cannot learn. That is not \na leap of logic; that is a fact. Every parent knows it; every teacher \nknows it. We do not need to do any studies; what we need is some \nresources to help poor communities across the country and others to \ncome up with some resources so they can reduce class size and attract \ngood people to the teaching profession.\n  We talk about the administration that says we want to test teachers \nevery year or every 2 years. I wonder, if I said we are going to test \nall lawyers every 2 years or test all doctors every 2 years--how about \ntesting every Senator for 2 years? What other profession do we mandate \nat the Federal level we are going to require testing every year?\n  If the administration tries to write that into the bill, I will not \nvote for it under any circumstance. That is punitive. It doesn't \naccomplish anything. It only creates great divisions within this \ncountry. It isolated the teaching profession.\n\n  There are ways of determining whether or not teachers are doing a \ngood job. A lot of the States are doing a good job in making those \nevaluations. Test the new ones coming in and decide whether or not they \ncan teach at all and use some of the creative methods developed to \ndetermine whether or not teachers are up to the job. This rush to test \neverybody, every year, is not a model of form.\n  We have asked for $14 billion, an increase of the elementary and \nsecondary education authorization. I don't think that is too much. I \ndon't think it is too much to demand in the context of a $1.6 trillion \ntax cut. I know many colleagues on both sides of the aisle agree\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\nwith me. That is why I will offer an amendment with Senator Collins of \nMaine to authorize full funding for title I grants to schools over the \nnext 10 years. Congress must go on record in making that, not a tax cut \nfor the wealthy, a top national priority. That is why this education \nbill must include class size reduction funds. No one questions that \nsmaller class sizes and better teachers result in better student \nachievement. That is why this education bill must include school \nconstruction funds.\n  According to the GAO, the problem of inadequate, unsafe school \nfacilities is a $112 million problem. The average school student goes \nto a school built around the 1950s. There are issues far from being \nresolved. They are not being discussed in these negotiations. Come out \nto the floor, offer your amendment, and see what happens. You accept \nall of our provisions and we will have a jump ball over yours.\n  What happened to bipartisanship? How many times did I hear we would \nwork things out? It is 50/50 here, almost 50/50 in the House. I heard \nthe President say over and over again: I want to work in a bipartisan \nfashion. Bipartisanship means you take my ideas and we will see what \nhappens to yours? That may be enough for some people; it is not enough \nfor me.\n  This bill will not be voted on again for 5 or 6 years. For many, this \nmay be the last time we get to express how public education at the \nelementary and secondary schools across the country ought to be dealt \nwith.\n  We took 2 weeks on campaign finance reform. We took 2 weeks last year \nto name the Ronald Reagan National Airport. We can take a few weeks to \ntry to get this right. The American people expect nothing less. I \nremember the days, not that many years ago, when an elementary and \nsecondary education bill passed this Chamber by votes of 92-6, 96-4. \nToday we ought to try to achieve the same results and to truly work to \ninclude these provisions which are necessary.\n  Democrats support real increases in proven programs. Yet the \nPresident, who says education is his top priority, would provide \ninadequate increases, $4.2 billion each year over the next 10 years, in \na budget where he advocates a $1.6 trillion tax cut.\n  We can do better than that. I know our colleagues agree with that \nconclusion. That is why this education bill must include construction \nfunds, include class size reforms.\n  We have to speak with a clear voice and build consensus. We are not \nthere yet. In my view, we ought to be. But we are a long way from \nachieving the kind of consensus that those who have been out there \nsuggest we are on the brink of; we are not. We may have to take some \ntime before this is resolved.\n  I intend to be heard on these matters. I don't want to see a bill \ncome up which will turn into a mess out here that allows these ideas to \ngo down the drain and the President claiming a bipartisan achievement \nbecause a few Democrats go along with something that isn't adequately \nfunded, doesn't provide for the true reforms that are needed, and we \nend up doing some real damage to kids, and then build a consensus that \nour public schools have failed for this country and you have to walk \naway from it. That is my fear of what will happen down the road and we \nwill look back to these days and rue the fact we didn't try to come \ntogether with a truly compromised bill that reflected the attitudes of \nall people in this Chamber and particularly the values and aspirations \nof the people we represent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise to add my voice to my distinguished colleague \nfrom Connecticut and to thank him for his outstanding leadership. \nSenator Dodd and my staff have been enthusiastically involved in this \nparticular debate. As a member of the committee, he has been a \ntremendous voice for education reform. I acknowledge the work Senator \nDodd has done with many of our colleagues on this issue and to say how \nmuch I agree with all of the points he has raised. I will join with him \nin as many hours as it takes through this week and the next week to try \nto bring some of these points home to our constituents and to the \ncountry at large.\n  I thank the Senator again for continuing to keep Senators focused on \nnot only the increases in investments that we need in education but the \ntargets of those investments to reach the children who need the most \nhelp, whether in Connecticut, Louisiana, Oklahoma, or other States, for \nwhom we are fighting. I thank the Senator for that.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague, and I admire her work. She has been \nat these issues for a long number of years both in her home in \nLouisiana before she arrived in the Senate and as a Member of this \nbody.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Let me follow up by making a few points. The President \nis right about one thing. That is, simply throwing more money at the \nproblems facing our educational system in America will do little to \ncreate the type of reform necessary to move America forward in the new \nglobal economy.\n  However, conversely what is true, passing new mandates and new \naccountability and new standards and new goals for our students and our \nteachers and our communities, without that important and strategic and \nsignificant new investment in education, is a hollow and an empty \npromise.\n  I call attention to a wonderful ad that caught my attention a couple \nof weeks ago. It was put out by the Business Leader Council. We do a \nlot of talking in this Chamber about budgets, taxes, futures trading, \ncommodities trading, and economic issues.\n  With my compliments to the Business Roundtable, this is the ad they \nran. It said under the picture of the bright-eyed optimistic and \nhopeful children:\n\n       Our Nation's classrooms are America's true futures market, \n     where a commitment today will yield individual and national \n     prosperity tomorrow.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Our Nation's classrooms are America's true futures market, \n     where a commitment today--\n\n  Not next year, not 5 years from now, but a commitment today--\n\n       will yield individual and national prosperity tomorrow.\n\n  I hope my colleagues can see the faces of these children. What jumped \nout at me from the picture is the hopefulness in these children's eyes. \nThey look like children in every classroom in Louisiana, with smiles on \ntheir faces, with hands in the air, anxious to answer questions \npresented by their teachers, with hope and optimism for the future.\n  The debate we will have in this Chamber and with our colleagues in \nthe House will determine whether these children walk away with supplies \nor whether they walk away with heads hung, shoulders stooped down, \nopportunities taken from them because we have made the wrong decisions \non this floor.\n  That is what this debate is about. This budget is not just about \nnumbers. It is not just about hard, cold facts. It is not just about \nstatistics. It is about hearts, minds, souls, and opportunities for our \nchildren and for our families and for this country. I am afraid if we \ndon't come to terms and make the best decisions we can, and good \ndecisions this week, these children and millions and millions like \nthem, and their parents, are going to be sorely disappointed.\n  Let me try to explain. One of the major debates we are preparing for \nis what kind of investment in education should we be making. The \nPresident has recommended what might seem to be a lot of money. When we \ntalk about billions and hundreds of millions of dollars, those are \nlarge figures and people's eyes tend to glaze over because that sounds \nlike a lot of money. We are debating an underlying bill, a \nreauthorization of elementary and secondary education, that is going to \nfundamentally change the way the Federal Government helps local and \nState government.\n  We are saying, instead of just sending you money and crossing our \nfingers and hoping for results, we are now going to tie the resources \nin a real and meaningful way. When we give you these moneys, we are \ngoing to expect real performance, real excellence, and there are going \nto be real consequences for failure. Schools may have to be \nreconstructed, reorganized; principals and teachers may need to be \nremoved and we may need to have a new leadership team come in. Students \nare to be\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\ntested not once every few years but every year. Teachers are going to \nbe held to higher standards because we believe in excellence. We do not \nwant to leave any child behind, and we want to make sure that, whether \nyou are in a poor rural area or a poor urban area or in a wealthy urban \narea or wealthy rural area, that you have a chance, as a child, to get \nan excellent education.\n\n  We are also going to give local officials more flexibility. We are \nnot going to micromanage from Washington any longer. We are not going \nto specifically mandate that you have to cross every t and dot every i. \nWe are going to be less focused on compliance and more focused on \nperformance.\n  I agree with the President that all of those things are important and \nthat we should change the way Washington funds our elementary and \nsecondary education system. But doing that and yet not providing the \nmoney at a high level for our schools to be able to do that is an \nempty, hollow promise to our children and an unfunded mandate of \ngigantic proportions to our local governments and to our States.\n  It would not be right. It is not what the American people want. It is \nnot what we should do. That is what this debate is about. Yes, we want \nreform, but we must have the significant, historic, huge investments \nnecessary to make those reforms work.\n  Let me say to those who might say money doesn't matter--yes, it does. \nTesting costs money. Improving teacher quality costs money. Fixing \nleaky roofs costs money. Buying textbooks and computers and training \nteachers and students costs money. You cannot just wish it. We can be \nmore efficient. We can spend our money more wisely. But in this year, \nin 2001, as we begin this new century, it has to be a combination of \nnew reforms and new investments.\n  Let me share some interesting poll numbers that came out because \npeople might say: Senator, you feel this way, but does anybody else \nfeel this way? Senator Dodd feels this way, but does anyone else?\n  This is a Washington Post poll issued today. The question was very \nbasic. It says, Is the Federal Government spending too much, about \nright, or too little for education? Mr. President, 60 percent of the \npublic says we are spending too little; 60 percent of Americans are \nsaying we are spending too little at the Federal level for education. \nOnly about 24 percent say ``about right'' and 8 percent say ``too \nmuch.'' So 60 percent of Americans.\n  When we talk about at the State level, Is your State government \nspending enough on education? Mr. President, 61 percent say the State \ngovernments are spending too little on education. At the local level \nyou can see that number drops fairly significantly because we are \npaying a greater portion at the local level.\n  This chart indicates to me that at the State level, but particularly \nat the Federal level, people across the board--and I think this was \nacross regions and economic income levels--suggest our current \ninvestment level is not sufficient to meet the challenges.\n  Let me also share with you, from the same poll, a question: Which is \nmore important to you, holding down the size of government, providing \nneeded services, or both?\n  Mr. President, 31 percent said ``holding down the size of \ngovernment,'' 62 percent, ``providing needed services.'' Does that mean \nthe American public supports sort of a runaway government? Obviously \nnot. But do they support a government that has efficient programs and \neffective programs and also makes investments in areas that matter to \nthem--education being one of them? Absolutely.\n\n  Let me show you the second chart that shows what their priorities \nare. This is what the American people said in the same poll. If given \nthe chance, how would you spend your money and what are some of your \nmost important concerns? Education is at the top of the chart, 47 \npercent. The next closest is 34 percent, Social Security and Medicare, \nmaking sure the resources are there to provide for Social Security and \nstrengthen it, and provide, hopefully, for reforms in the Medicare \nsystem, and an expansion for prescription drugs. Health care is \nimportant also, at 29 percent.\n  I want to focus on this area--education. The President, when he was \nrunning for President, said it over and over again: Let's not leave any \nchild behind. I agree with him. Many, many people in this Chamber, both \non the Republican and Democratic side, do. But that is just a slogan \nunless it is backed up with real dollars that actually move children \nforward, that give them hope, that fulfill a promise for life to help \nthem develop their skills and their abilities.\n  Again the Business Roundtable said:\n\n       Our Nation's classrooms are America's true futures market--\n     where a commitment today will yield individual and national \n     prosperity tomorrow.\n\n  Let me share, for the record, a specific example from one of \nLouisiana's industries, Avondale Industries. It is one of the largest \nemployers in Louisiana, an industry that I certainly try to help and \nsupport, that is building some of the finest ships for our commercial \nshippers as well as our national defense. It does a magnificent job, \nlet me add. They are now part of the Northrop Grumman Corporation, \nwhich is one of the five remaining facilities left in this whole \ncountry capable of building large combat vessels.\n  My staff called them and asked them if they could send us some \napplications for jobs that they might periodically put out to try to \nhire some of the individuals necessary for this work. These positions \nrange from electrical engineer to data entry clerk. But the one \nrequirement that comes through in all of these applications is that a \nhigh school diploma is necessary. What that translates to is really an \n11th grade or 12th grade proficiency in math. Many of these jobs are \nrelated to calculations, to making analytical decisions based on plans \nand graphs, as you can imagine.\n  Right now in our Nation, according to the latest data, only 30 \npercent of our eighth graders are functioning at the proficient level \nin math. Here is an industry in my State that could employ thousands of \nindividuals, that puts out applications daily for a variety of \ndifferent jobs. The minimum requirement is a high school education. \nPart of that is functioning just at the proficient level--not \noutstanding, not the top 1 percent in the Nation, just at the \nproficiency level for math.\n  I have to stand here as a Senator and look these industry people in \nthe eye and tell them that we can only create a school system that can, \nat best, give them 30 percent of the eighth graders who can fill out \nthe application. This is not going to work. It is not going to work for \nLouisiana. It is not going to work for Connecticut. It is not going to \nwork for New York. It is simply not going to work. And a budget that \ndoes not fund more science teachers, more math teachers, makes a real \ninvestment to give those kids an opportunity, is not going to help \nthem, their families, or Avondale.\n\n  I know the last administration asked me--it was a hard vote and I did \nit--to vote for 50,000 H-1B visas to bring in people from outside this \nNation to fill jobs because we were not able to find people in America \nto take these jobs. I cast that vote, but I will tell you I thought \nabout that vote, because when I cast that vote it allowed high-tech \nindustries and some industries such as Louisiana's shipbuilders to be \nable to hire people from other nations.\n  I go home and drive through neighborhoods, walk through communities, \nsit and talk to young people who have been left out because we have not \nprovided them the kind of education they need. They have to step aside \nand watch someone from another country walk past their door, fill out \nthe application, and take the job that they could have had if we had \nhad a school system that could have given them the education necessary \nfor the job.\n  That is a tough thing for a Senator to have to do because I do not \nrepresent any other country; I represent the United States, and I \nrepresent Louisiana. I represent cities and communities where there are \nthousands of people who cannot pass 11th grade math because we will not \nput the resources and the money where they need to be to give them the \nchance. Are they willing? Yes. But we have not done what we need to do.\n  So my message to the President and to my colleagues is, let's do it \nwhile we can. Perhaps when we were running terrible deficits and \nrunning up large, large bills, you could say: Look, we would love to do \nit but we simply can't\n\n[[Page S3815]]\n\nafford it. We are running huge deficits. We can't keep spending money \nwe don't have. Money doesn't grow on trees. We can't tax people any \nmore. So I am all for that and when we have to cut back, let's do it.\n  But now that we have a historic and significant surplus, now I am \nlistening to people say: We have the surplus; we have the money; it is \nsitting there in the bank, but we don't want to spend it on these \nchildren. We don't want to spend it on them. They are not our future. \nWe want to give a huge tax cut, and we don't want to make any \ninvestments in education.\n\n  I am not talking about the same kind of investments for the same \nmediocre results. We can't keep doing it 3 percent a year or 4 percent \na year or 5 percent a year, which is what the President is \nrecommending, and think we are going to get a 50-percent increase in \nresults. It doesn't work that way.\n  We have to make an extraordinary commitment now and put our money \nwhere our mouth is to reach the children that we need to reach through \nour schools. Yes, reform our schools with strong accountability \nstandards matched with a true investment and targeted to the kids who \nneed it the most.\n  We do a great job sometimes in Washington inventing new programs, and \neverything sounds great. And every year we invent about five, six, or \nseven more programs. We need to get back to the basics and fund through \nelementary and secondary education a significant amount, if not \ntripling the amount of money, for title I--flexible grants that go to \nplaces in Louisiana, New York, Connecticut, Alabama, New Mexico, or \nwhere the communities can't raise the tax dollars because they are \nrelatively poor or have a limited capacity.\n  The Federal Government can honestly stand up and say, whether you are \nlittle girls in Oregon or you were born into a poor, rural area or a \npoor urban area, it doesn't matter because we have a system at the \nFederal level that ensures, because of the way we fund education, that \nthe school you go to will help you pass and exceed that proficiency in \nmath so that you can get a job and we don't have to import someone from \nanother country to take the job while you collect welfare or while you \nhave to live on food stamps or while you tell your children they cannot \never live in a home of their own because you can't bring home a \npaycheck enough for you to be able to live in a home of your own.\n  I am not going to say that as a Senator because the money is in the \nbank. The question is, Are we going to write the check for the kids who \nneed it or to our schools, or are we going to squander the surplus and \nnot make the investments that we need?\n  I will come to the floor every single day this week and next week, as \nlong as it takes, because I know as a Senator from Louisiana, \nparticularly, my State's future rests in large measure on how our \nschools can function so that every child in every part of our State can \nget the quality education that in some small way perhaps will make up \nfor what they do not always get in their homes.\n  I don't know what kind of miracle schools can achieve. I know schools \ncan't do it without the parents. I know there is a limit to what \nschools can contribute to a child if they are not getting that support \nat home. But I am tired of making excuses and hearing excuses such as \nthis kid can't learn because this child only has one parent or this \nchild can't learn because this child is poor or this child can't learn \nbecause this child is a special education student.\n  I am here to tell you that every child can learn, but it takes a good \nsystem and good investments from the Federal Government, the State \ngovernment, and the local government working in partnership with \nparents.\n  I am about fed up with the excuses because I want to support trade \nand globalization, and I want our businesses to have the workers they \nneed. I have to fight for children to have the opportunity. I urge our \nPresident to please work with us. Work with the Democrats. We don't \nwant to waste money. We want to make a significant investment in \neducation, coupled with accountability, new standards and exciting \npossibilities for our Nation. I most certainly want to work with him. I \nbelieve we can make a real difference in Louisiana and Texas and many \nplaces throughout our Nation.\n\n  In conclusion, I refer to the vision of Lyndon Baines Johnson when we \ncreated the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--a vision that would \nmake the dream of a quality education a reality for all children \nregardless of their race, their socioeconomic status, or their gender. \nThis is what America is about. It is about opportunities.\n  In many ways, while education begins at home, it is most certainly \nenhanced at the school level. We are shortchanging ourselves, \nshortchanging our children, and shortchanging our future to do anything \nless.\n  I will end saying, again, I am going to be down here every day until \nwe complete this debate, urging my colleagues to push hard for a \nsignificant investment and targeting that investment to the schools and \ncommunities that need the most help, and also helping all of our \ndistricts to achieve success in educational excellence.\n  I yield any remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before my colleague from Louisiana leaves \nthe floor, I thank her so much for saying what the issue before us \nreally is. We all agree that we need to make children our No. 1 \npriority. We all agree that there are things in our schools that need \nto be improved, and we need to, frankly, underscore the things that are \nworking. We don't want to leave any child behind. That is President \nBush's comment.\n  When we get the chance to have an education bill brought here with \nour friends, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jeffords, and others, we want to \nmake sure it is not just an empty promise. I think she has fleshed this \nout. I thank her very much.\n  In California, we test every year. It is not a big deal. We have that \nreform in place. But if you test them and find they are failing and you \ndon't have anything in place to help them after school or during school \nto give them the smaller class sizes, to give them a facility that \nfeels good, looks good, and is safe for them, they are not going to \nimprove.\n  When this education bill comes up, I predict that the Senate will \ntake that Bush bill and change it dramatically in terms of the \nresources we put behind the rhetoric. There are two R's. Usually they \nsay there are three R's. But there is rhetoric here, then there is \nrequirement. Those are the two R's. The rhetoric is fine. Let's get the \nrequirements in there so that we can meet the needs of our children. \nThere is a third R--results. That is what we want to do.\n  How much time do I have? Is there a limit on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 10 minutes \nper speaker, and the Democrats have 40 minutes remaining.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would like to know when I have 1 minute remaining of my \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3815-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3815-S3817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE PRESIDENT'S BUDGET\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have been amazed at the first 100 days \nof the Bush administration in relation to the environment issue. When I \nsay the environment, I don't just throw that word out. I am talking \nabout air, I am talking about water, I am talking about drinking water, \nI am talking about parks, and I am talking about cleaning up Superfund \nsites and brownfield sites. The fact is, we have a situation on our \nhands that is going to be very dangerous for our people.\n  Why do I say that? I say that for a couple of reasons. First of all, \nwe see rollbacks on very important issues. We have all heard about the \nPresident backing off the pledge he made in the campaign to deal with \nCO2 emissions which cause major problems in air quality. We \nknow he has backed off that.\n  We saw him evaluate a number of rules that were put in place under \nthe Clinton administration. The one that I cannot get over--there are a \nnumber; I don't have time to get into them--is the one dealing with \narsenic. We know a few things about arsenic. It is unsafe at any level. \nWe know for a fact that at\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nthe current level of arsenic that is allowed in our drinking water, if \nyou drink out of that water supply, 1 out of 100 people will get \ncancer--not may get cancer, not might get cancer, but will get cancer. \nWe know this to be the case.\n  Yet this administration, in violation of the law, in my opinion--that \nwill be tested in the courts--reversed the Clinton administration rule \non arsenic to reduce the parts per billion that would be allowable, \nwhere the Clinton administration had gone from 50 parts per billion to \n10 and he put us back at 50 parts per billion.\n  Let me list some of the countries that have a standard of 50 parts \nper billion. I will give you an idea of the countries that allow 50 \nparts per billion of arsenic: Bahrain, Bangladesh, Bolivia, China, \nEgypt, India, and Indonesia. That is an example.\n  Let me list some of the countries that have the 10 parts per billion: \nEuropean Union, Japan, and Jordan.\n  I have to say that we owe our people safe drinking water. If we owe \nthem nothing else, we can argue a lot of things, but the Federal \nGovernment needs to make sure that our people are safe.\n  What we have is a rollback on a number of fronts. I am just talking \nabout the arsenic one today. There are others. I will save them for \nanother day. But in addition to this, in order to pay for his tax cut \nto the wealthiest people who do not need it, those over $300,000 and \n$400,000 a year, those over $1 million, $2 million, or $1 billion a \nyear, in order to pay for that tax cut, some of those people are going \nto get back a million dollars a year. This President has cut back \nenvironmental enforcement.\n  Let's take a look at the key cuts that he has put in his budget. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, a $500 million cut; the Interior \nDepartment, a $400 million cut. The clean energy and nuclear \ncontamination cleanup--you have Dick Cheney out there saying we need \nmore nuclear power. He has not even figured out a way to clean up the \nnuclear waste we have. They have cut $700 million, and they want more \nnuclear power, which is dangerous. There is a conservation program in \nthe Agriculture Department. They cut that $300 million. So we see a \ntotal of $1.9 billion in cuts to pay for a tax cut that favors the top \n1 percent, leaving out 99 percent of the people.\n  What does that really mean? What does it mean when you cut \nenvironmental enforcement? Let me get into that. It is very serious. \nWhat happens is, we are going to see fewer inspectors out in the field \nand fewer technical exports on the ground. We are going to see that the \nFederal Government will no longer be able to be a watchdog for some of \nthe most serious threats to public health and the environment.\n  I want to give examples because people have seen the movie ``Erin \nBrockovich.'' We all saw what happened to people in a small town in \nCalifornia when that particular water system had an excess of chromium \n6, which is, by the way, very dangerous. It is very lethal. By the way, \nthere is no Federal standard for chromium 6 in water. I have a bill \nthat would place into law a Federal standard, but we hear silence from \nthe Bush administration on that. Instead of looking at the new threats, \nthey are taking the old threats and making them more threatening, such \nas with arsenic, by rolling back the laws.\n  When the American people know about this, I think they are going to \nbe very upset. You should not have to be able to afford bottled water \nin this country to be safe. You should not have to worry that your \nchild is going to get cancer as a result of drinking from the water \ntap.\n  Oh, they say, it costs money to clean it up. As my kids would say \nwhen they were young: Dah. Yes, this is so. It costs money to clean up \nan environmental problem. Do we have it? Yes, we do. Why not cap the \ntax refund people earning over $1 million will get? Every year they \nearn $1 million. Cap their tax refund. Take the money and clean up the \nwater. Get the arsenic out. Help the local people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. But, no, let's look at these priorities. The President \nwants to bring an education bill to the floor. My colleague from \nMassachusetts is our real leader in the Senate, and he is going to talk \nabout it. There are some good ideas that have been carved out between \nthe parties. There is not enough money behind it. It is a false \npromise.\n  A kid takes a test and fails the test. What are you going to do for \nthe kid? You can test him every 6 months. Why not test him every 2 \nmonths? What good is it if there is no one available to help that child \nlearn? So when the President says, ``Leave no child behind,'' where is \nthe beef?\n  When you look at the environmental budget--and you have to remember \nthe President stood in front of some beautiful lakes and streams and \nrivers and said he was an environmentalist--how can we have prosperity \nwhen our environment is dirty? Yet we look at the budget, which \nincludes the priorities of this President, and you see nothing but \ndestruction.\n  I have seen it happen in California in El Segundo. We had a refinery \nthat was releasing air pollution that aggravated very badly those \nsuffering from asthma. People were very sick. There was a lawsuit that \nwas brought. EPA supported it. Why? They had enforcement capability.\n  Chevron's own records show that it simply did not use the pollution \ncontrol technology that was required. There was not any new innovative \ntechnology. It was already approved. They agreed to a huge settlement, \none of the biggest in history. Because of the Environmental Protection \nAgency, the people got help. Chevron is going to help build and operate \na health clinic to take care of those people who experience health \nproblems.\n  EPA has the legal authority needed to ensure that serious violations \nare stopped and that polluters are held accountable--which can help \ndeter a company from disregarding environmental protections in the \nfuture. EPA's legal authority and resources are most often needed in \ncases like this one, where the issues are very serious and the company \nhas substantial resources. It was not until the Federal Government \nfiled suit against Chevron that the company agreed to comply with the \nlaw.\n  In another example, the United States, including EPA, Department of \nInterior, and Department of Commerce, as well as several California \nstate agencies, reached settlement worth an estimated $1 billion with \nAventis to clean-up the Iron Mountain Mine located near Redding, CA, in \nOctober of 2000.\n  The State of California requested help from the Federal Government in \nthis enormously complex case explaining that they had ``exhausted all \npracticable enforcement action against the potential defendants.''\n  Prior to the settlement, this mine discharged an average of one ton \nof toxic metals per day into the Upper Sacramento River, a critical \nsalmon spawning habitat and a central part of California's water \nsystem. As recently as 5 years ago, the site dumped the equivalent of \n150 tanker cars full of toxic metals into the Sacramento River during \nwinter storms. At one point, workers had left a shovel at the site in a \ngreen liquid flowing from the mine and it was half eaten away over \nnight.\n  I have a photograph of a disposal area on the site that gives you a \nfeel for just one part of the damage at this very large and complex \nsite.\n  This site dumped approximately one quarter of the total copper and \nzinc discharged into our nation's water from industrial and municipal \nsources throughout the United States.\n  This case is another good example of the kind of cases a strong EPA \nenforcement program is needed for--sites that are large, that can \noverwhelm State programs, even in a State with a well developed and \nactive environmental program like California, and sites with very large \ncorporate interests involved.\n  When you take a close look at EPA's past enforcement efforts you see \nwho benefits from cuts in enforcement. Serious polluters can take big \nhits to their pocketbooks when they are caught. A cut in enforcement is \nworth a great deal to these violators, but enforcement cuts come at the \nexpense of public health and safety as well as the environment.\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\n  The President's proposed budget cuts the heart out of agricultural \nconservation programs, like the Wetland Reserve Program which is \neliminated--cut from $162 million in fiscal year 2001 to $0 in fiscal \nyear 2002. This program was first authorized in 1990, during the first \nBush administration, to provide long term protection for wetlands.\n  The President has collected an incredible assortment of cuts in \nenvironmental protection--all sources for the tax cut that fails to \ntake into account the priorities of the American people, like \nconservation and environmental protection. Before deciding on what the \n``right size'' of the tax cut should be, the President should consider \nthe impacts of these cuts. California provides some valuable examples \nof the conservation benefits we will lose if the President's budget \ncuts are implemented.\n  The Wetland Reserve Program in California has helped restore a \nportion of the 4.5 million acres of wetlands lost to agricultural \nconversion and development in our State. In addition to providing \nhabitat for migratory birds, other wetlands restoration benefits \ninclude improvement of water quality, flood control, sediment abatement \nand recharge of groundwater. California is the primary path of the \n``Pacific Flyway''--approximately 20 percent of all waterfowl pass \nthrough California's Central Valley. At the present time, the federal \nWetland's Reserve Program, zeroed out in the President's budget, is the \nlargest wetland protection program in California.\n  More than 60,000 acres to date have been protected in this program in \nCalifornia. There are more than 100 applicants on a waiting list to \nprotect and restore their agricultural lands. One of the strongest \nparts of the program are the partnerships with not-for-profit \norganizations like California Waterfowl and the Nature Conservancy, as \nwell as the private landowners themselves.\n  I have a photograph of one of the successful restorations \naccomplished by a conservation easement under the Wetland Reserve \nProgram. The site is in Colusa County, CA and was enrolled in the \nConservation Reserve Program in 1992. It is approximately 195 acres of \nseasonal wetlands that provides both winter and brood habitat for \nmigrating and nesting waterfowl, shorebirds, migratory songbirds, and \nother wildlife. This easement is part of a 1,000-acre complex of \nwetlands and upland nesting habitat adjacent to the Sacramento River \nand lies in the middle of the largest migratory waterfowl corridor in \nNorth America. It is owned by the Audubon Society and acts as a \nsanctuary for wildlife.\n  Given the value and community support for agriculture conservation \nprograms, I simply cannot see how the President can justify eliminating \nthese kinds of programs to increase his tax cut.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up. We have a tax cut that was pledged as a \ncampaign promise 2 years ago because Steve Forbes was in a debate with \nGeorge Bush and said: I am for this $1.4 trillion tax cut. Times have \nchanged. The economy has turned around since George Bush has become \nPresident. We have problems. People are not optimistic about the future \nof this country.\n  What does that mean? It means that a sensible person--this is my \nview--would sit back and say: I want to do this, and it is on my \nagenda, but maybe I can't do it all at once. Maybe I will cut it in \nhalf. Maybe I am going to invest in the people, invest in children, so \nthat we have an afterschool program for every child, so that we have \nsafe drinking water for every child, so that we know people are not \ngoing to get sick from air pollution.\n  We talk about our kids. Every one of us cares about kids. That is one \nof the reasons we are Senators. Do you know the leading cause of \nadmissions in hospitals for children is asthma? They miss school. So \nyou have to connect the dots. If you take out massive sums of money \nthat you are going to transfer to the top 1 percent of income earners, \nforgetting 99 percent--everyone else--really, you have given 43 percent \nof the tax cut to the people in the highest income, and then you say \nyou do not have any money to enforce the Clean Air Act or the Clean \nWater Act. You roll back the laws on arsenic. You take away the money \nto clean up nuclear contamination, while you are calling for more \nnuclear plants. You bring out an education bill that is so short of \nmoney that it is an empty promise and an unfunded mandate for our \nStates. It is an unfunded mandate because we are forcing them to test, \nand yet we do not have enough to help those children.\n  Connect the dots. If you build a budget around an unrealistic, \ndangerous tax cut, it is going to take us back to deficits. You are not \ngoing to be able to pay down the debt. You are not going to be able to \ndo the basics for our children. You are not going to be able to clean \nup the environment. And you have a problem. It is no wonder this \neconomy is a little at sea, because this budget does not add up and it \ndoes not make sense.\n  Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3817-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3817-S3824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few moments this \nafternoon to bring our colleagues up to date on where we are on the \nElementary and Secondary Education legislation. Over these past 2 weeks \nwe have had an ongoing exchange of ideas and views with the \nadministration and our colleagues. We have been trying to continue to \nfind common ground and to make important progress.\n  We are very much aware that this is an issue that is not only a high \npriority for the President of the United States, but also that it is a \nhigh priority for every family in this country, and certainly among the \nhighest priorities for those of us on this side of the aisle.\n  We welcome the fact that we have a President who has placed education \nat the top of his agenda. Eight years ago when the Democrats lost \ncontrol of the Senate, one of the first actions the Republicans took \nwas to rescind some of the funding of elementary and secondary \neducation. We also fought against attempts by our Republican friends to \nabolish the Department of Education. But that was then and this is now. \nWe welcome the opportunity to find common ground so we can move ahead \nand make a difference for the children in this country and for the \nfamilies across the Nation.\n  As we start off our debate on this issue, we have to understand the \nimportance of preparing a child to learn, even prior to the time they \nenroll in elementary school. This is an area of very considerable \ninterest on both sides of the aisle.\n  Our colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, has been a leader on \nthese children's issues. Senator Jeffords has made this a special area \nof concern. And Senator Stevens has been very involved in early \nintervention for children. It is enormously important to continue to \nensure a national commitment to have the nation's children ready to \nlearn, as we did and as the Governors did in Charlottesville some years \nago.\n  I am hopeful we will be able to do that in a bipartisan way in \nCongress with solid legislation. We still have a ways to go, but we \nhave made progress. We also have to understand the very serious and \nsignificant gap that still exists with regard to preparing children for \ngrades K through 12th.\n  We are still falling behind. We fund Early Start programs at \napproximately 10 percent for the earliest types of intervention. And \nfor programs from birth to 3 years of age, we are down to either 2 or 3 \npercent. This is an area of enormous importance. We are trying to help \nmany children across the nation with this program. Hopefully, it will \nmake a difference.\n  Unfortunately there are going to be many children who will still fall \nthrough the cracks unless we come back to revisit public policy and \nresources for early intervention programs.\n  It is all part of a mosaic. We must give our full attention to these \nefforts which are extremely important in preparing children for \nelementary school.\n  I was disappointed that the administration zeroed out a very modest \ndownpayment in the Early Child Development Program that had bipartisan \nsupport in the 106th Congress from Senator Stevens, Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Dodd, Senator Kerry, many others on the Health Education Labor \nand Pensions Committee, and myself.\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\n  We have reached some very important agreements on the reauthorization \nof the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, however, differences \nover funding remain. We are in the process of negotiating language for \nthe legislation, and I expect that the earliest we could have this \nlegislation is late Wednesday or Thursday.\n  Money is not the answer to everything, but it is a pretty good \nindication of the Nation's priorities.\n  Under the President's bill, there is a reduction in resources of $69 \nbillion for the Nation. However, we will only see an extremely modest, \nsomewhat less than $3 billion, increase in the funding for programs \nwhich are targeted on the neediest children in this country. It is that \nkind of disparity which is of considerable trouble to many of us.\n  We agree that every child should be tested each year in grades three \nthrough eight--not as a punishment, but so parents and educators know \nwhere every child stands and what more needs to be done to help them \nimprove and achieve their full potential.\n  We agree to create tough standards for schools and hold them \naccountable for improving student achievement.\n  We agree that where schools fail, bold steps are necessary to turn \nthem around, including requiring alternative governance arrangements.\n  We agree parents deserve more public school options to ensure their \nchildren get a quality education.\n  We agree that literacy programs should be expanded so every child \nlearns to read well in the early years.\n  We share these priorities with President Bush and believe these \nreforms will make a difference in our communities.\n  We are still working on how to increase the flexibility while \nmaintaining targeting and accountability. It is important that any \nadditional flexibility is tied to strong accountability, and strong \ntargeting to the neediest communities. We want to ensure that States \nand school districts do not ignore the children who need our help the \nmost.\n  We are also working hard to increase accountability and support for \nteachers. States and districts should be held accountable for putting \nqualified teachers in every classroom, particularly in the neediest \nschools. They should also have to provide professional development and \nmentoring support for teachers so that teachers can make these new \ntough reforms work.\n  We are also working to ensure that after-school programs are expanded \nso that more children have the opportunity to catch up with their \nschoolwork if they have fallen behind.\n  We are working to ensure parent involvement and that parent \ninvolvement is a cornerstone for all the new reforms.\n  We are working to ensure schools and districts and States are held \naccountable to the public through mandatory report cards that include \nimportant information about how well their schools are doing.\n  We are working to ensure that the Class Size Reduction Program is \ncontinued so children can get the individual attention they need to \nsucceed.\n  We are working to continue the School Renovation Program \nso communities can ensure children are learning in safe, modern school \nbuildings.\n\n  We hope we can address all these issues and come to a bipartisan \nconsensus on them.\n  We must also know that reforms minus resources equals failure. You \ncannot say education is your top priority and not put enough resources \nin the budget to do the job.\n  We are disappointed in the President's budget. According to OMB, \nPresident Bush's budget contains only a $669 million increase next year \nfor elementary and secondary education programs. That is an increase of \none-fifth of one percent of what we are spending on our public schools \ntoday at the national, State, and local levels; we are spending $350 \nbillion a year.\n  Testing and accountability are important, but they are only the \nmeasures of reform, they are not reform themselves.\n  Investment without accountability is a waste of money, but \naccountability without investment is a waste of time.\n  We need the resources to make sure that slick, easy, and quick tests \nthat have mostly multiple choice questions and which cost $3 or $4 will \nnot be developed. We want to make sure we have a quality teacher \nteaching a quality curriculum to a quality test. That takes investment.\n  It is not just the money, it is the resources to do the job: well-\nqualified teachers, thoughtful tests, good curriculum, the examination \nof the tests and reporting back in a timely way.\n  At the current time, we are meeting only about 20 to 22 percent of \nthe supplementary services that are necessary for children. If we are \nnot going to have a significant increase in resources, we are not going \nto be able to provide the good quality supplementary services for those \nchildren who need them.\n  We know with a very modest increase--about $1 billion--we could \nprovide 1.6 million children with quality supplemental after-school \nacademic opportunities. Even if you take what was paid last year and \nadding about $850 million this year, we are still only reaching about a \nthird of all latchkey children, ages 8 to 13, who go home alone in the \nafternoon.\n  Resources are important because they are translated into substantive \nissues that make a difference in advancing the quality of education for \nchildren.\n  This chart compares the investments in ESEA programs for fiscal year \n2001 to the Administration's 2002 proposal. In 2001, funding for ESEA \nprograms increased by $3.6 billion or a 24.2 percent. This \nAdministration has requested an increase of $669 million, which is only \na 3.5 percent increase.\n  Even with their willingness to go higher, it does not come close to \nthe increases in 2001. This recognizes that we are only reaching one-\nthird of all of the children who are disadvantaged or eligible under \nthe Title I program.\n  Look at the appropriations for the Department of Education. In 2001 \nthere was an 18.2 percent increase, $6.5 billion. The Bush budget for \nall the education, is increased by 5.9 percent or $2.5 billion.\n\n  The Department of Education over the period of the last 5 years shows \na 12.8-percent increase in resources. However the proposed budget \nstarts with a 5.9-percent increase in the Department of Education.\n  This is a time with record surpluses, when we are going to give back \n$69 billion in tax reductions. There is a great deal of talk about \ninvesting in education, but we are still not putting in the resources.\n  This chart is the State of Texas education equation. It shows that \nfrom 1994 to 2002, school funding went from $16.9 billion to $27.5 \nbillion, a 57-percent increase under Governor Bush. Interestingly, we \nsee an alarming increase in student achievement, from 56-percent of the \nstudents performing at a proficient level on the State test in 1994 to \n80-percent of students performing at a proficient level in 2000--\nshowing you cannot educate on the cheap.\n  The next chart shows the difference between the proposal the \nDemocrats support and the Bush budget. We know there are 10,000 failing \nschools that need to be turned around. The best estimate is that it \ncosts $180,000 to turn around a school. There are 57 different, \naccepted, scientifically evaluated ways in which schools can be \nrestructured and organized that have been found to have been \nsuccessful. Taking 10,000 schools and $180,000--that is, $1.8 billion--\nto turn around the schools that we know are in need. With the other \nproposal, effectively, we are leaving 7,556 schools behind.\n  We know what needs to be done. We know we have failing schools, and \nwe have ways of turning them around. We know we have unqualified \nteachers, and we know what needs to be done to make them qualified. We \nknow we have an inadequate curriculum, and we know what needs to be \ndone to strengthen curriculum. We understand what will benefit the \nchildren and the teachers and we know how to strengthen their needs \nwith supplementary services.\n  If we don't have the supplementary services, trained teachers, \neffective tests, modern and safe schools, and smaller class sizes, then \nwe are failing ourselves. We fail ourselves when we fail to provide the \nresources to ensure the nation's children with a sound education.\n  Finally, I hope during this debate we have some discussion about the \nissue of IDEA. Full funding for IDEA will help\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nimmeasurably in allowing special needs children to get additional \nresources.\n  I hope we can move ahead with ESEA and get the commitment of \nessential resources to meet these important needs. In doing the job, we \nneed to give children across the nation the best opportunities which we \nall understand they deserve.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Clinton speak \nnext for 15 minutes and I be allowed to speak after for 10 minutes, and \nthe Republicans then be allowed to have the time they need to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota. I associate myself with the remarks of the education Senator \nfrom Massachusetts who so eloquently laid out our dilemma, the dilemma \nthat will be occupying the Senate as we move forward on this very \nimportant debate.\n  People always talk about important debates, but it is fair to say as \nwe debate, we will set educational policy for our Nation for the next 7 \nyears. There is hardly a subject we can think of that will have more \ndirect impact on our families, on our communities, on our economy, and \nespecially on our children. We are setting the stage for determining \nhow much we as a nation will do to make good on the promise of a \nquality education for all children, and particularly for our country's \nneediest children.\n  I first became involved in education reform back in 1983 with the \nissuance of the report called ``A Nation at Risk,'' which was issued \nunder President Reagan's watch. Many took that call to action very much \nto heart that we were a nation at risk. We began looking for ways to \nimprove education, to provide more resources to provide more \naccountability measures. We have made progress over those last years.\n  When the Elementary and Secondary Education Act was last reauthorized \nin 1994, we sent a strong signal that although education was absolutely \na matter of local concern, it had to be a national priority; that we \nall had to recognize we were failing our children by not providing \nadequate educational resources and by not expecting them to do the very \nbest they could do. We put a high priority on academic standards, and \nwe worked to help teachers and administrators, parents, and communities \nimprove education.\n  The results of this strong Federal response to local and State \neducational demands has been heartening. Mr. President, 49 States plus \nthe District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have developed State standards \nand are working to implement them. These reforms are producing results.\n  We often only focus on the negative side of the ledger about how much \nwe still have to do. I give some credit to the children and the young \npeople, our students, and their parents, and especially their teachers, \nbecause we have seen progress. Reading and math scores for fourth \ngraders in our highest poverty school districts have improved by nearly \na grade level from 1994 to today. SAT scores are on the rise. More \nstudents than ever are attending college.\n  We cannot rest there. We know there is still far more to be done. We \nhave too many children, particularly in our underserved urban and rural \ndistricts, who are not reading at grade level. We have too many \nchildren being taught by uncertified teachers, in overcrowded \nclassrooms, in crumbling school buildings. We cannot stand by idly \nwhile these conditions persist. The issue is, what is the best way to \naddress them? How better can we equip parents, teachers, communities, \nand our students to meet the tests of the 21st century?\n  I applaud President Bush for calling for greater accountability. I \nagree with him on the importance of that. I was among the very first in \nour Nation, in Arkansas in the early 1980s, to call for the testing of \nstudents and the testing of teachers because I believed then we had to \nknow what we didn't know in order to make progress. We couldn't just \npretend that everything was fine and engage in social promotion and not \nface up to the fact that we had children graduating from high school \nwho couldn't read a job application. We had teachers who had been \nthemselves passed through the education system who were unprepared to \nteach the substance of what it was they were assigned to teach.\n  Accountability is key, to me. I have been a strong supporter of that. \nIn fact, I welcome the Republicans and I welcome the Bush \nadministration which has gone forward with accountability measures that \nare like the measures Democrats have proposed for several years. Many \non the other side of the aisle resisted such approaches for many years. \nIn fact, they wanted to abolish the Department of Education. So I \napplaud my colleagues on the Republican side for the progress they have \nmade in moving toward a common recognition that this is a national \npriority that must be beyond politics and partisanship.\n\n  The accountability that is in the bill that is proposed would ask \nthat we test our children every year from third to eighth grade. That \nis designed to ensure that they are meeting high standards. But here is \nwhere the rubber really hits the road. If all we do is order more \ntests, if we do not combine those tests with the resources that are \nneeded to help the children who have been left behind, then we will \nhave, at best, a hollow victory and I believe, worse than that, we will \nhave committed educational fraud on our children, our teachers, and our \ncountry.\n  The Bush plan orders more testing while providing only half the funds \nneeded to design and implement these tests. What would this mean to the \nState of New York, for example? It would mean that of the $16 million \nthat is estimated to have to be spent to comply with these new Federal \nrequirements, our State would only get $8 million. So we would have to \nfind 8 million more dollars, take it out of something else--from hard-\npressed school districts, from teacher pay, from whatever other \nimportant objective we are already trying to meet. We should not be \npassing on an unfunded mandate to our States.\n  If it is a national priority, if it is a priority for this \nadministration to order these tests, then the Federal Government ought \nto pay for these tests and make sure that, as the Senator from \nMassachusetts pointed out, they are good tests; they are quality tests; \nthey are not just make-work kinds of tests.\n  Passing tough new accountability standards without the resources to \nhelp our schools and students is similar to handing out thermometers in \nthe midst of an epidemic. The thermometers certainly can tell us that \nthere are a lot of sick people, but they do absolutely nothing to help \npeople get better. Unfortunately, the administration's proposal has \nplenty of thermometers but precious little medicine to help our schools \nimprove. The administration has not even yet committed to providing the \nFederal funds necessary to marry accountability with student \nachievement.\n  We already know that despite the rhetoric, this is not an increase of \nmore than 11 percent; it is only 5.9 percent because the administration \ntried to count money that had been appropriated last year. We are glad \nto have that money, but let's have honest accounting about how much \nmore money is going in. A 5.9-percent increase barely keeps up with \ninflation and population increases.\n  What also does it mean on the school level? Let's focus and ask \nourselves: If we pass this accountability measure, and everybody goes \nhome, pats themselves on the back, there is a big press conference, and \na big signing ceremony, what have we really done to help the districts \nsuch as the ones I worry about in the State of New York?\n  In New York City, for example, we are facing a severe teacher \nshortage. The city will need to hire approximately 40,000--that is \nright, 40,000--teachers over the next 4 years. In addition, the \ndistrict is under a court order to place those certified teachers it \nhires in the lowest performing schools. That makes sense because right \nnow we have uncertified teachers, ill equipped to teach, teaching \nthe children who need the best teachers. So the idea, which is a good \nidea, is let's put the certified teachers in the schools\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\nwhere the children need them the most.\n\n  But what has happened? Last week we learned from the chancellor of \nthe New York City schools that the certified teachers turned down the \njobs in the hard-to-teach schools. Why? Because those are the schools \nthat are already overcrowded; those are the schools that are crumbling; \nthose are the schools that hardly have a book in the library; those are \nthe schools without the computers connected by the cables they need to \nbe able to be functional, let alone to be accessible to the Internet.\n  We cannot in good conscience demand that school districts hire \ncertified teachers without providing the resources to help these hard-\npressed districts recruit and retain these teachers. And we have to do \nmore to make these schools attractive to certified teachers.\n  Answer me, why you would go into a very difficult school to teach \nchildren who are under lots of stress at home and in their \nneighborhoods if the school is not well equipped to give you the \nresources you need to try to do a good job with those children?\n  I will be working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nintroduce a bipartisan teacher recruitment amendment. We all know if we \ndo not place the recruitment of our teachers at the top of our national \nagenda we will have school districts that are barely able to open their \ndoors in the next couple of years. We will be asking people literally \nto come off the streets and start teaching because we will not have the \nteachers we need. I meet people all the time who want to be teachers, \nbut they will not, they cannot, and they should not work under the \nconditions under which many of our teachers are asked to function.\n  I am also concerned about the proposal the President includes called \nStraight A's. This is a demonstration project that would give 7 States \nand 25 school districts the chance to block grant Federal dollars. \nPeople are often talking about how important it is to give authority \nback to the States, and I agree with that in most instances. But we \nknow from years of education research that block granting funds--which \nmeans taking the Federal dollars and sending them to the State \ncapitol--means that those dollars do not get to the students and the \nschools that need them the most in the amount that they should. They \nget siphoned off in the bureaucracy of the State capitol. They get sent \nto other places that do not need them but, for political purposes, have \nthe influence to get them. We should be targeting those hard-earned \nFederal dollars to those school districts and those students who are so \nfar behind.\n  Right now in New York we know, because of a court decision, that the \nchildren in New York City do not get their fair share of education \nfunding. So we should do everything possible to get the dollars to the \nstudents who need them the most in the schools where the teachers have \na chance to try to help them.\n  We also know from research that smaller class sizes make a huge \ndifference, and the Class Size Reduction Initiative has worked wonders. \nWe now have teachers in New York who are federally funded who are \nhelping to lower class size. We have already seen positive results from \nthe school achievement scores.\n  We also know that construction funding to help schools repair their \nbuildings and modernize them and even construct the buildings they need \nis very necessary. These two important programs, class size reduction \nand school construction, are eliminated for all purposes in the Bush \nadministration proposal. I say this is a mistake, and I ask the \nadministration, with all respect, to please reconsider this decision.\n\n  The administration says that reducing class size with Federal dollars \nand helping to construct and repair schools are not Federal \nresponsibilities. I know they are not totally Federal responsibilities, \nbut I do not think in today's world they are also solely local \nresponsibilities. The districts that need the help the most are not the \ndistricts like the one I live in where, with very high property taxes \nfrom affluent people, the children have everything they could possibly \ndream of. But in so many districts, suburban taxpayers cannot pay \nanother penny to fix their schools and do what is necessary to have up-\nto-date labs. In many rural districts they do not have the tax base to \ndo that, and in many urban districts they don't have the dollars \nbecause they don't get their fair allocation from the State, and they \ncannot tax themselves to be able to meet the needs of children for whom \nEnglish is not their first language, who come to school with \nundiagnosed mental illnesses, who live in a system of deprivation and \nviolence and who cannot perform at the same level as the children in my \ndistrict.\n  Let's have a shared responsibility. That was the whole idea behind \nthe Class Size Reduction Initiative and School Construction Initiative. \nIf education is to be a national priority, let's invest in what we know \nworks--and we know reducing class size and providing good facilities \nactually works--to make for better education.\n  I hope we will continue in the spirit that we began in the education \ncommittee as we marked up this bill, in the negotiations that are \ncurrently ongoing with the administration. But I am very concerned that \nthis particular proposal falls way short of what we need to be doing. \nIt falls short for a very simple reason. The administration would \nrather invest in a large, fiscally irresponsible tax cut than in the \neducation of our children and particularly those who are most needy in \nrural and urban districts.\n  I hope this will be reconsidered because this failure to properly \nfund education, to me, is disappointing at a time when we have \nsurpluses, when we do not have to squander these surpluses on large tax \ncuts that will go disproportionately to the already wealthy whose \nchildren already attend schools that have all the computers, all the \nbells and whistles, all the extra help they could possibly have.\n  Let's, instead, take a moment and step back. I hear a lot about the \ngreatest generation. My parents were part of the greatest generation, \nthe World War II generation. I think they probably have to take a \nsecond seat to the greatest generation being the Founders of our \nCountry. But there is no argument that those who survived the \nDepression, won World War II, and set the stage for winning the cold \nwar, were among the greatest if they were not the greatest generation \nour country has ever seen.\n  We have been living off the investments and sacrifices of our parents \nand our grandparents for more than 50 years. My father, who is a rock-\nribbed Republican, voted for higher school taxes because he knew the \neducation of his children depended upon good schools. We invested in \nthe Interstate Highway System. We set a goal to send a man to the Moon. \nWe had big dreams, and we worked to fulfill those dreams.\n  Today, at the beginning of this new century, it is up to us to make \nthe decisions, the hard decisions to invest in our children's \neducation. And shame on us if we do not make the right decisions. We \ncan pass a bill that is filled with testing and sounds good but 10 \nyears from now we will still have children in overcrowded classrooms \nand crumbling buildings who are being deprived of certified, qualified \nteachers, and we will wonder what went wrong.\n  Let's instead be sensible about the best practices that we know work. \nWe have research. We have practical experience. We know what needs to \nbe done. The issue is, do we have the political will to make those \ndecisions?\n  I support working hand in hand with the administration in a \nbipartisan way, with the parents and teachers and community leaders of \nour country, to make education a real national priority. But I cannot--\nI could not--support a bill that is a hollow, empty promise.\n  Let's do both. Let's increase accountability so we get better results \nby making sure we have the resources to hold our children and our \nteachers accountable. If we do that, then we will be setting the stage \nto leave no child behind. If we do any less, then I think we have \nmissed a historic opportunity.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator one or two \nquick questions?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have been very moved by what she said. On the \nquestion of accountability and then the whole issue of unfunded \nmandates, one\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\nargument I heard the Senator make was we have to provide the funding \nfor the actual tests to make sure these are high quality, which means \nwe should not confuse accountability, testing, and standardized tests \nas being one and the same thing; is that correct?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The second point I want to make and I want to be sure \nwe are clear about is that it would also be an unfunded mandate, even \nif you provided the funding for the administration of the testing, \nwithout the investment in our children and our schools to make sure \neach and every child had the same chance to achieve and do well in \nthese tests. Then I tried to remember what you described it as. You \nsaid it was hollow, and you said it would be an educational fraud. That \nis fairly strong language. I will put the Senator on the spot, but \ncould I ask her why she feels so strongly about this point?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Certainly. My feelings go back many years. As the \nSenator knows, children have been my passion for more than 30 years. I \nhave worked on improving and reforming education for nearly 20 years. I \nknow how difficult it is, today, to try to help many of our children \nachieve educational competence.\n  The reason for that is that we are not living in the same world in \nwhich the Senator and I grew up. It is harder to teach our children. \nOur children come to school with more problems and more stress. They \nare exposed to many more things than we ever faced.\n  We have to understand that if we don't really provide the resources \nto reach the children as they are today, not as we wish they would be, \nnot as we thought they were back when I was sitting there with my hands \nfolded and listening to every word, but as they are today with all the \nother pressures that are on families and children, then we are not \ngoing to have the results and the kind of achievement to which the \nSenator from Minnesota is referring.\n  But there is no reason we have to make this choice. It is not an \neither/or choice. We have the resources to assist our local districts \nso they do not have to reach any deeper. Many of the districts from my \nState can't afford to raise their property taxes any more.\n  I was on Long Island last night talking to a group of about 1,000 \npeople. I explained to them, if we have this large Federal income tax \ncut, and then we have these unfunded mandates for education, where is \nthe rubber going to hit the road? It is going to hit the road in the \nlocal property tax levies.\n  I would rather be, I am sure, part of an administration that gets to \ntake credit for cutting income taxes than the poor souls down at the \nlocal level having to vote to raise property taxes in order to meet the \nmandates they have put on them. I think we should not be raising false \nhopes. We should be looking at how we help every child be successful.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. When I go back to Minnesota, I try to be in the \nschools every 2 weeks. For the last 10\\1/2\\ years there has been \nconcern about the testing, especially standardized tests; people have \nto kind of teach within a straightjacket. But what about the issue? I \nask the Senator from New York because this is also, I think, part of \nher passion and part of her work. I hear a lot about two other things: \nThe IDEA program, which isn't within ESEA, but it seems to me that we \nhave to be very clear with some kind of trigger amount so that testing \ndoesn't take its place unless we fully fund IDEA, because that is \nreally a threat and a strain that a lot of districts feel. The other \none is prekindergarten.\n  With all due respect, I want to get the Senator's opinion. If we \nstart testing kids at age 8, I might argue at age 12 or 13, ``Schools, \nwhat have you done?'' But at age 8, I would argue that much more of \nwhat will explain how that child is doing is what happened to the child \nbefore kindergarten. Where is the administration, if the administration \nis going to talk about leaving no child behind? Where is the community \nin early childhood development to make sure that these children are \nkindergarten ready? Shouldn't that all fit within what is defined as \nreform?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I think my colleague is absolutely right, because if we \nare looking at the comprehensive reform, we cannot leave out the \nfunding of IDEA. We can't leave out doing something to help parents \nunderstand their obligations to be a child's first teacher and provide \nquality preschool.\n  I hear so much about the IDEA program, otherwise known as the special \neducation program. I hear it mostly in suburban districts, \ninterestingly enough, because suburban districts have activist parents \nand they know the law. The law is that we have to provide an education \nfor every child. And I support that law. It was the first project I \never did for the Children's Defense Fund. I went door to door in \ncommunities back in--I hate to say--1973 to find out where the children \nwere because they weren't in school. We found a lot of children with \ndisabilities who were being kept out of school.\n\n  I am a 100-percent supporter of mainstreaming our children and giving \nevery child a chance. But we are bankrupting a lot of our suburban \nschool districts. We are saying you have to provide special treatment \nand education for children who need it and deserve it. If that means \nyou have to shut down the band program or only have one physics session \nor do away with art, that is the tough choice to make.\n  The Federal Government said in the 1970s that you have to provide \nthis education. Furthermore, it is not only, as our colleague Tom \nHarkin likes to say, a Federal mandate, but it is a constitutional \nmandate to provide this quality education. The Federal Government is \ngoing to tell districts they have to provide special education. Where \nis the full funding so suburban districts and all other districts can \ntry to keep up with their expenses?\n  I could not agree more with the second point the Senator made. Those \nof us who have been parents read to our children. We take them to \nmuseums. We get them a library card. We monitor their television. We \nworry about any kind of childcare arrangements. We know those early \nyears make a difference. Why don't we make a commitment based on the \nresources we now have about the brain to do more to provide quality \npreschool opportunities both at home and outside the home so that more \nchildren can come to school ready to learn? That might be the very best \ninvestment we could make in terms of long-term academic success.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  In the time I have remaining, I would like to make the point that I \nthink this is truly a matter of values and truly a matter of \npriorities. Either we are going to be talking about close to $2 \ntrillion in tax cuts--most of it Robin Hood in reverse. Again, if \nsomebody wants to prove me wrong, about 40 percent of the benefits go \nto the top 1 percent of the population.\n  Any day of the year, I would stake my reputation back in Minnesota on \nbeing able to say, as opposed to those Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts, \nthat I am going to be a Senator from Minnesota who is going to insist \nthat if we are going to say a piece of education legislation is the \nbest, we had better make it the best for our children. That means there \nis a commitment to making sure kids are kindergarten ready. That means \nwe live up to our commitment to fully funding the program for children \nwith special needs, which is getting to the 40-percent level and not \nthe 14-percent level. That means we ought to be moving toward fully \nfunding the title I program for kids who come from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds. That means we ought to be funding afterschool programs and \nwe ought to be talking about teacher recruitment. We ought to be \ntalking about how we can provide the supportive services.\n  I say to Senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, that you will rue \nthe day you voted for a piece of legislation that mandated that every \nschool and every school district in your State every single year had to \nhave tests, starting as young as age 8 and going to age 13, and you did \nnot at the same time vote to provide the resources so that those \nteachers and those schools and those school districts and, most \nimportant of all, the children had the tools so they could succeed and \ndo well.\n  I will tell you something. I hope my colleagues on the Democratic \nside will draw the line on this question. It seems to me that before we \nproceed to this kind of legislation, before we talk about a piece of \nlegislation as being reform, we should say we want to make sure there \nis a commitment of resources. Before we have this mandate on all of our \nStates and all of our schools, we ought to make sure we have provided \nthe funding. If we can't\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\ndo that, then this becomes very hollow. If we can't do that, then this \npiece of legislation I believe does nothing but set up the schools and \nthe kids and the teachers for failure.\n  My colleague was saying get it down to the school level. I sometimes \nthink what we have been doing has a sense of unreality to it. If you go \ndown in the trenches, and especially it you go to the schools, a lot of \nthe inner-city neighborhoods and rural areas, you have kids on free or \nreduced lunch programs. You have homes where sometimes they have to \nmove two or three times a year. You have schools that are crumbling, \nschools that don't have the resources, schools that don't have the \nlaboratory facilities, and schools that don't have the textbooks. Now \nwhat you are saying is you are going to have tests and state with \nprecision the obvious: Guess what. Children who come to school hungry, \nchildren who come from families who don't have adequate housing or are \neven homeless, children who are not kindergarten ready, children who do \nnot receive all of the good stimulation and all of the nurturing that \nthey need to have before kindergarten, those children who come to \nschools without the facilities, without the best teachers, without the \nsalaries for the teachers, we are going to find out through tests that \nthose children and those schools aren't doing as well as a lot of other \nschools which have all the resources in the world with which to work.\n  That is what the test does. Absolutely nothing--not without the \nresources.\n  I can say this from the floor of the Senate. It sounds a little \njarring. But in a lot of ways I think the best way you can move to \nvouchers is to design a system where you guarantee over the next 4 or 5 \nyears that many schools are not going to succeed because you don't give \nthem the resources. Then you can state with precision the obvious; that \nis, the children who come from low- and moderate-income backgrounds \nwith the least amount of help to do well are continuing to do poorly. \nThe schools are continuing to do poorly because they do not have the \nresources. Then you use that as a reason for an all-out broadside \nattack on public education.\n  Some of the harshest critics of these teachers in these schools \ncouldn't last an hour in the classrooms they condemn. I have never met \na teacher and I have never met a parent who has said to me what we need \nis more and more tests, tests, tests.\n  I have had a lot of people in Minnesota talk to me about the IDEA \nprogram, the title I program, afterschool programs, how we can make \nsure kids are kindergarten ready, and how we can make sure we have the \nbest teachers and get the resources to the teachers and have the \nsupport for the teachers and the kids.\n  We have a budget from the President of the United States of America \nwho says education is his No. 1 priority, and it is a tin cup budget. \nHow are you going to realize the goal of leaving no child behind on a \ntin cup budget? At the moment, I agree with Senator Clinton. I think it \nis an educational fraud bill. Without the resources to back the \nrhetoric, it becomes nothing more than symbolic politics with \nchildren's lives.\n  I will oppose it with all of my might until we get resources to \ninvest in our children--all of our children.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will be turning to the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act reauthorization bill soon. I want to speak a \nbit about the subject of education.\n  This will be an interesting debate and one that is very important for \nour country. All of us come to the Senate from different backgrounds \nwith different interests. I happen to come from a small town of about \n300 people in the southwestern corner of North Dakota, down by the \nMontana and South Dakota border. I graduated in a high school class of \nnine.\n  That little high school in Regent, ND, where I went to school, held \nits last prom this year because the high school is not going to be \ncontinuing any longer. In order to have a prom in a school that small, \nthey have to gather a fair number of classes. That is the only way to \nhave a prom in a school that size.\n  I was saddened to read that, because of the challenges facing rural \nareas of North Dakota, schools are seeing fewer and fewer students \ncoming into the school system. In my State, we had 16 counties that had \nfewer than 25 births in a year, and in almost all of those counties \nthey have at least two school systems. Divide up those births 5 or 6 \nyears from now and see how many children are going to enter first grade \nand see what the challenges are for those schools. They are very \nsignificant.\n  Despite having gone to a small school, I always felt I got a very \ngood education. It was not a fancy school. It was a school with a \nlibrary no larger than a coat closet, but we had teachers who cared, \nand it was a school that provided an awfully good education.\n  Even though all of us have different backgrounds, we also share \ncommon goals. All of us want the same thing for our country. We want \nour country to do well, our children to be well educated, our country's \neconomy to grow and provide expanded opportunities for people.\n\n  In this debate, we are going to talk a lot about what is wrong with \neducation. That, I guess, is the nature of things in this country. We \ntalk about what is wrong and how we will fix it. We almost never catch \nour breath to talk about what is right. In fact, when you listen to \npeople talk about what is wrong with education in America, you wonder \nhow on Earth this country became what it has become.\n  Anyone who has done any traveling throughout the world understands \nthere is not any other country like this. Go to Europe, Asia, South \nAmerica, Africa--just travel and ask yourself: Have I visited a country \nwith the same conditions that exist in the United States? Is there a \ncountry quite as free as this, as open as this, with an economy as \nstrong as this, where every young child goes into a school system which \nallows him or her to become whatever his or her God-given talent \nallows? That is what our school system provides our children.\n  This is not true in many other countries in the world. By the eighth \ngrade, often other countries have moved kids into different tracks \nwhere only selected children have an opportunity for higher education. \nA lot of countries do that.\n  Our country has said for a long while that we believe in universal \neducation. All children in this country, no matter their background, \nought to have the opportunity to be whatever their God-given talents \nallow them to be.\n  Yet when hearing this debate, one wonders what has allowed this \ncountry to be as successful as it has been? This is the country, after \nall, that has split the atom and spliced genes. We have invented radar \nand the silicon chip. We have invented plastics. We learned to fly, and \nthen we built airplanes. We flew those airplanes, and then we built \nrockets. We took those rockets to the Moon and walked on its surface. \nWe cured smallpox and polio. We discovered how to create a telephone \nand then used it, invented radios, television, computers.\n  One almost wonders how on Earth this happened in a country like this \nwith an education system that some say has totally failed us.\n  The reason all of this has happened is the education system has not \nfailed this country at all. There are some significant challenges and \nsome significant problems in certain areas of our education system, but \nby and large this education system has been the most productive in the \nworld for a long period of time.\n  If one wants to evaluate where the world-class universities are, by \nfar 80 percent of them are in the United States of America. We house \nthe world-class universities in this country.\n  Let me talk a bit about the status of this country's educational \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\n Some say we have an educational recession. The President, during his \ncampaign, said that, among others.\n  Yet reading achievement is up in this country. The National \nAssessment for Educational Progress, called NAEP, says that during the \nlast decade, reading achievement has significantly improved in all \ngrades tested.\n  Are there some challenges in some schools in this country with \nrespect to reading skills? You bet your life there are, and we need to \naddress them.\n  But on the average, reading skills are up. Mathematics and science \nachievement is up. NAEP scores in mathematics have improved during the \npast decade, and in science NAEP reports scores have increased \nsignificantly for older children in the last decade.\n\n  Students were better prepared for college throughout the 1990s. \nScores on both the SAT and ACT climbed steadily. Mathematics SAT scores \nare at an all-time high. The average SAT math score increased from 509 \nin 1992 to 514 in 2000. Verbal SAT scores improved over the same period \nfrom 500 to 505.\n  Some say if you compare the SAT scores in the United States to the \nsame scores in other countries, the United States ranks well down the \nlist or that our scores have decreased over time. But those people are \nnot comparing apples and apples. Only the best students in other \ncountries are taking the ACT and SAT, while in our country a majority \ntake them. Thirty years ago, only the top 25 percent of U.S. students \nwould take the SAT tests. Now, perhaps the top 60 or 70 percent of the \nuniverse of students take the same tests. Would you perhaps get a lower \nscore on average by taking 70 percent of the universe instead of taking \nthe top 25 percent? Yes.\n  But compare the top 25 percent now to the top 25 percent 30 years \nago? What do you find? Higher test scores. You need to compare like \ncomparisons if you are going to make judgments.\n  Our students are taking tougher courses. Between 1992 and 1997, the \nnumber of high school students taking advanced placement courses in all \nsubjects increased by two-thirds, from 338,000 to 581,000.\n  It is hard to make the case we are in an educational recession.\n  I have two children in school. They study hard. They do their \nhomework. They do not necessarily enjoy doing that every night, but \nthey do their homework. They are in a good school with great teachers. \nThe fact is that is true in much of this country.\n  There is a very simple formula to determine whether education is \ngoing to work, and it is true in every neighborhood in every school in \nthis country. To make education work, we need several things: One, a \nstudent who is interested in learning; two, a teacher who knows how to \nteach; and, three, a parent who is going to be involved in that \nstudent's education.\n  When those three elements are present, education works and works \nwell. When they are absent, we have great difficulties.\n  I know from firsthand experience that there are some schools with \nsignificant challenges. I visited an inner-city school that had \nsignificant challenges. I knew that at the front door. I walked through \nmetal detectors, saw security guards, watched teachers try to deal with \na series of problems in the class. Those problems were identical to the \nproblems of the neighborhood surrounding that school: poverty, \ndysfunctional families, a whole series of issues that those children \nthen brought to that school.\n  Some weeks after I visited that school, I read in the paper there was \na shooting at that school. That was a few years ago. Some kid bumped \nanother kid at a water fountain, and the other kid took out a pistol \nand shot him, despite the fact they had obviously gone through a metal \ndetector as they walked into that school.\n  If schools are not safe places of learning, they are not going to be \ngood places of learning, so we must deal with that issue.\n  We need good teachers, students willing to learn, parents involved in \neducation, and a safe environment in which students can learn.\n  In addition to that, in this debate, we are going to have to \nunderstand that we have a responsibility as a country to send children \nthrough classroom doors into classrooms of which we can be proud. \nChildren cannot learn in classrooms that are not modern.\n\n  I have toured schools, especially Indian schools attended by children \nfor whom the Federal Government has a trust responsibility to educate. \nThis is not an option. Yet these Indian schools where desks are 1 inch \napart, classes are so crowded you just cringe when you see them pack \nthese kids into those classrooms. These are schools where you cannot \nhook up a computer because the facilities are so old they do not have \nthe capability of supporting a computer; schools where you would not \nwant to send your child to school because it is in such disrepair.\n  Is that a good safe place in which to learn? The answer clearly is no \nand we need to do better. We need to deal with the issue of school \nconstruction. We built schools all over this country just after the \nSecond World War. The GIs came home, they married, had children, and we \nbuilt schools all over this country. Many of those schools are now 50 \nand 60 years old and in desperate disrepair.\n  None is in greater disrepair than the schools on Indian reservations. \nI talk about that a lot because we have so much to do in those areas. \nWe have a responsibility to deal with these crumbling schools around \nthe country. If we will have a first-class education, it ought to be in \na first-rate classroom.\n  Second, we also know from experience and from research that children \nlearn best in classrooms of 15 to 18 students. I have had children of \nmine in classrooms in mobile trailers, the temporary classrooms with 32 \nand 34 kids. It doesn't work well. We know that. We know a teacher who \nis teaching 15 to 18 children has much more time to spend individually \nwith those children and does a much better job. We have a \nresponsibility to try to help and do something about that as well.\n  At the Federal level, we only do niche financing for education. Our \nschools are financed, by and large, by State and local governments and \nespecially by local school boards. No one is suggesting we change that.\n  But we ought not brag in this country, as some are wont to do, that \nwe don't have any national objectives for our school system. It is not \na source of pride, in my judgment, to brag that we do not have or want \nnational standards or objectives for our children to meet upon their \ngraduation. We ought to aspire to meet certain objectives. Of course we \nought to have national objectives we aspire to reach.\n  In order to do that, some feel strongly we ought to improve our \nschool buildings. This Congress can provide funding to help local \nschool districts meet their construction and repair needs. We ought to \nreduce classroom size and provide funding to do that. We ought to do it \nin this legislation, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nreauthorization.\n  President Bush is correct when he talks about the need for testing. \nMany have stood for years on the floor of the Senate saying we need to \nhave some testing. People also need to know what our schools are \nproducing, how our schools are doing. I will offer an amendment dealing \nwith the issue of school report cards. Many States have them. But there \nare no standards for school report cards and no parent can understand \nhow their school is doing. They know how their child is doing because \nthey get a report card every 6 to 9 weeks. But how is their school \ndoing? Is this school doing a good job of educating that child? How \ndoes this school relate or compare to another school? How does our \nState compare to another State? What are we getting as taxpayers for \nthe investment we are making in these schools? We have a right to know \nthat. We have a right to get report cards on our schools. All parents \nhave that right. All taxpayers have that right. I intend to offer an \namendment on that during the consideration of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  There is so much to say about education. Let me mention two stories \nthat illustrate the value of education.\n  I toured a refugee camp one day in an area near the border between \nGuatemala and Honduras. It was some while ago when Honduras was having \na lot of terrorism and difficulties. At this refugee camp, the United \nNations High Commissioner for Refugees was running a refugee camp and \nhad people living in tents. As I was going around the camp, viewing the \nconditions, there\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nwas a fellow, probably in his mid-sixties, who could not speak English \nbut he knew I was a visitor to the camp. He beckoned to me and wanted \nme to come with him. I asked the guide from the United Nations what the \nfellow wanted and the guide said: I think he wants you to go into the \ntent area. So we did. He reached under his cot for some of his \nbelongings, which is all he had. He had a cot and a couple of \nbelongings stored under a cot in the refugee camp. He reached under the \ncot and pulled out a book. It was an education reading primer book in \nSpanish. It was the Spanish version of the ``See Dick Run'' book we \nwould have had in first grade. He was, for the first time in his life, \nin his mid-sixties, being taught to read. He wanted to show me, a \nvisitor, that he could begin to read. He pulled out the book and began \nto read in halting Spanish, ``See Dick Run.''\n\n  He had a huge smile on his face after he finished the first two \nlines, looked up at me with only two or three teeth, someone who was \nliving in great difficulty, in a refugee camp, with perhaps not enough \nto eat, never having had an opportunity for education, and he was so \nenormously proud of being able to learn.\n  Education, even at the later stage of his life, was so important to \nhim that he wanted to show a visitor he was learning to read. Think of \nthat.\n  The second story is one I have told my colleagues about before, but I \nwill tell it again because it also describes how important education \nis. It is the story of a woman who was a janitor at a tribal college, \ncleaning the bathrooms and the hallways of a tribal college. Her \nhusband had left her. She had four children and was over 40, with no \nmeans of support except this job as a janitor. She wanted to go to the \ncollege somehow so she could earn a degree and find a better job. The \nday I showed up to give a graduation speech at the tribal college, this \nwoman was a graduate of the college. She had pulled herself up by the \nproverbial bootstraps and gotten an education and was no longer the \njanitor of the school. She was wearing a cap and a gown and a huge \nsmile because, despite it all, and through it all, with all the \nadversity in her life, she had become a college graduate. You could \nread ``pride'' all over her face. It is something she had done for her \nown future that no one will ever take away from her. She invested in \nherself against all the odds.\n  Education means so much to people at every stage: When they are \nretired, when they are 40, when they are 20, when they are 10. We are \ntalking about the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. There is not much that is more important for this \ncountry than to improve this law for America's kids. There is a lot on \nwhich we can agree, some we will disagree on in the coming days, but I \nhope at the end we can look at this bill and say we did something very \nimportant for this country's future.\n  I will take the floor later in the debate and offer a couple of \namendments I have described. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I commend my colleague from North Dakota for his \neloquent statement on education. I come to the floor today to join a \nnumber of Democratic Senators who have been here this afternoon to \nspeak about the issue of education which is going to come before the \nSenate this coming week. I share their passion and their concern as we \nlook at reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  It is critical we understand we all share the same goals. President \nBush stated very rightly that no child should be left behind. Everyone \nin this body wants to make sure that no child is left behind. The \nElementary and Secondary Education Act is our opportunity to do that \nbecause, as we all know, education is the key to a child's future. If \nthey know how to read, they will make it in this world. If they can do \nmath, they will be able to move on. If they can converse, they will be \nable to get a job and be successful. That is our goal for every single \nchild.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act that is being worked on \nnow has a number of compromises in it. It is not everything everybody \nwants, but the one concern that I want to express adamantly to this \nbody before we bring this bill to the floor is the lack of available \nresources. It is so easy to say we set standards, we set goals that we \ndemand our children and their schools reach. But if we don't provide \nthe dollars for them to be able to reach those goals, we are simply \nputting out a mandate, an unfunded mandate, to districts which means \nthe kids will fail. There is no doubt that if you want a child to learn \nto read, you have to provide the resources for a teacher who is \ncapable. You need to make sure the class size is small enough, that the \nchild has enough personal time with the teacher, an expert, to be able \nto learn to read.\n  It is not magic. It takes a qualified teacher. We want to make sure \nall of our kids pass the annual tests. Just giving tests as required in \nthe bill does not assure the students will do better. I fear it means \nwithout the backing of the resources behind it, so the children can \nlearn what is required of them to pass the test, the children will fail \nand drop out of school. And, yes, 5 years from now we may have a higher \npercentage of kids doing better on tests but nobody will be testing the \nkids who didn't make it, who dropped out, who failed, who are not in \nthe school system anymore. Those are the kids we cannot leave behind.\n  Without the resources that are so important for success, and a \ncommitment from this White House to have the resources available, we \nwill have failed America's children if we move this bill forward.\n  We know what works in public education. Any one of us who has been to \na school recently knows what makes a difference. A teacher makes all \nthe difference. A good teacher and a good principal makes an incredible \ndifference. A parent who is involved makes an incredible difference. \nUnfortunately, that doesn't happen in every school. A lot of classrooms \ndon't have qualified teachers. That is a concern. It doesn't happen \njust because we mandate it. It happens because we provide the resources \nto recruit good teachers, to help school districts hire them, and to \nmake sure that every child is in a classroom with a qualified teacher.\n  We know the facility that a child learns in makes a difference. I \nhave been in classrooms, as I believe several of my colleagues have, \nwhere children are wearing coats, where there are buckets catching \nraindrops, where there is no electrical outlet for the children to even \nplug in a computer much less have a computer, where there isn't even a \nrestroom facility in the building; they have to go outside across the \nway to get to one.\n  How do you expect a child to learn in that kind of environment? It \ndoes not happen. Unless we put investments into bringing our buildings \nup to code and providing a partnership at the Federal level for those \ndistricts and schools that need it the most, we cannot expect children \nto learn. We cannot require that children only pass or move on if they \nhave the best teacher and the best classroom and the best facility. If \nwe do, we will have failed numbers of children in this country, and \nthat is really the wrong policy.\n  I will have much to say about many of these issues as we move through \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the coming days or weeks. \nBut I just want our colleagues to know that the worst thing we can do \nis pass an Elementary and Secondary Education Act without adequate \nfunding for the requirements we are making, because several years from \nnow we will have every school district, every school administrator, \nevery school board member, every parent, and every teacher at our door \nsaying you passed an unfunded mandate down to us. Instead of recruiting \ngood teachers and building our classrooms and working hard to teach our \nkids, we are failing them because the only thing we are doing is \nproviding testing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3825-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3825-S3826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n                            NATIONAL DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this morning as I read the Wall Street \nJournal, I came across Mark Helprin's article called ``The Fire Next \nTime.'' The thesis of Mr. Helprin is this:\n\n       The consensus that doing much to protect America is \n     preferable to doing too little has been destroyed. If the \n     President does not rebuild it, we will suffer the \n     consequences.\n\n  I commend this article to the Senate. I do not think it is totally \nthe President's responsibility. It certainly falls on many of us to \nhelp the President and the Secretary of Defense and those in the \nNational Security Agency and the Vice President, all of them working on \nwhat should be our defense policy, to find ways to rehabilitate our \nnational defense. Very clearly, we do not have the defense we need for \nthe future.\n  At one point in this article, Mr. Helprin says this:\n\n       God save the American soldier from those who believe that \n     his life can be protected and his mission accomplished on the \n     cheap. For what they perceive as an extravagance is always \n     less costly in lives and treasure than the long drawn-out \n     wars it deters altogether or shortens with quick victories.\n\n  I do hope all of us will think about how we can restore our national \nprestige in terms of being the superpower of the world and having the \npower to defend that position.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Apr. 24, 2001]\n\n                           The Fire Next Time\n\n                           (By Mark Helprin)\n\n       From Alexandria in July of 1941, Randolph Churchill \n     reported to his father as the British waited for Rommel to \n     attack upon Egypt. In the midst of a peril that famously \n     concentrated mind and spirit, he wrote, ``You can see \n     generals wandering around GHQ looking for bits of string.''\n       Apparently these generals were not, like their prime \n     minister, devoted to Napoleon's maxim, ``Frappez la masse, et \n     le reste vient par surcroit,'' which, vis-a-vis strategic or \n     other problems, bids one to concentrate upon the essence, \n     with assurance that all else will follow in train, even bits \n     of string.\n\n\n                          Consensus Destroyed\n\n       Those with more than a superficial view of American \n     national security, who would defend and preserve it from the \n     fire next time, have by necessity divided their forces in \n     advocacy of its various elements, but they have neglected its \n     essence. For the cardinal issue of national security is not \n     China, is not Russia, is not weapons of mass destruction, or \n     missile defense, the revolution in military affairs, \n     terrorism, training, or readiness. It is, rather, that the \n     general consensus in regard to defense since Pearl Harbor--\n     that doing too much is more prudent than doing too little--\n     has been destroyed. The last time we devoted a lesser \n     proportion of our resources to defense, we were well \n     protected by the oceans, in the midst of a depression, and \n     without major international responsibilities, and even then \n     it was a dereliction of duty.\n       The destruction is so influential that traditional \n     supporters of high defense spending, bent to the will of \n     their detractors, shrink from argument, choosing rather to \n     negotiate among themselves so as to prepare painstakingly \n     crafted instruments of surrender.\n       A leader of defense reform, whose life mission is to defend \n     the United States, writes to me: ``Please do not quote me \n     under any circumstances by name. . . . Bush has no chance of \n     winning the argument that more money must be spent on \n     defense. Very few Americans feel that more money needs to be \n     spent on defense and they are right. The amount of money \n     being spent is already more than sufficient.''\n       More than sufficient to fight China? It is hard to think of \n     anything less appealing than war with China, but if we don't \n     want that we must be able to deter China, and to deter China \n     we must have the ability to fight China. More than sufficient \n     to deal with simultaneous invasions of Kuwait, South Korea, \n     and Taiwan? More than sufficient to stop even one incoming \n     ballistic missile? Not yet, not now, and, until we spend the \n     money, not ever.\n       For someone of the all-too-common opinion that a strong \n     defense is the cause of war, a favorite trick is to advance a \n     wholesale revision of strategy, so that he may accomplish his \n     depredations while looking like a reformer. This pattern is \n     followed instinctively by the French when they are in \n     alliance and by the left when it is trapped within the \n     democratic order. But to do so one need be neither French nor \n     on the left.\n       Neville Chamberlain, who was neither, starved the army and \n     navy on the theory that the revolution in military affairs of \n     his time made the only defense feasible that of a ``Fortress \n     Britain'' protected by the Royal Air Force--and then failed \n     in building up the air force. Bill Clinton, who is not \n     French, and who came into office calling for the \n     discontinuance of heavy echelons in favor of power \n     projection, simultaneously pressed for a severe reduction in \n     aircraft carriers, the sine qua non of power projection. \n     Later, he and his strategical toadies embraced the revolution \n     in military affairs not for its virtues but because even the \n     Clinton-ravished military ``may be unaffordable,'' and \n     ``advanced technology offers much greater military \n     efficiency.''\n       This potential efficiency is largely unfamiliar to the \n     general public. For example, current miniaturized weapons may \n     seem elephantine after advances in extreme ultraviolet \n     lithography equip guidance and control systems with circuitry \n     not .25 microns but .007 microns wide, a 35-fold reduction \n     that will make possible the robotization of arms, from \n     terminally guided and target-identifying bullets to \n     autonomous tank killers that fly hundreds of miles, burrow \n     into the ground, and sleep like locusts until they are \n     awakened by the seismic signature of enemy armor.\n       Lead-magnesium-niobate transducers in broadband sonars are \n     likely to make the seas perfectly transparent, eliminating \n     for the first time the presumed invulnerability of submarine-\n     launched ballistic missiles, the anchor of strategic nuclear \n     stability.\n       The steady perfection of missile guidance has long made \n     nearly everything the left says about nuclear disarmament \n     disingenuous or uninformed, and the advent of metastable \n     explosives creates the prospect of a single B-1 bomber \n     carrying the non-nuclear weapons load of 450 B-17s, the \n     equivalent of 26,800 100-pound bombs. Someday, we will have \n     these things, or, if we abstain, our potential enemies will \n     have them and we will not.\n       To field them will be more expensive than fielding less \n     miraculous weapons, which cannot simply be abandoned lest an \n     enemy exploit the transition, and which will remain as \n     indispensable as the rifleman holding his ground, because the \n     nature of war is counter-miraculous. And yet, when the \n     revolution in military affairs is still mainly academic, we \n     have cut recklessly into the staple forces.\n       God save the American soldier from those who believe that \n     his life can be protected and his mission accomplished on the \n     cheap. For what they perceive as extravagance is always less \n     costly in lives and treasure than the long drawn-out wars it \n     deters altogether or shortens with quick victories. In the \n     name of their misplaced frugality we have transformed our \n     richly competitive process of acquiring weapons into the \n     single-supplier model of the command economies that we \n     defeated in the Cold War, largely with the superior weapons \n     that the idea of free and competitive markets allowed us to \n     produce.\n       Though initially more expensive, producing half a dozen \n     different combat aircraft and seeing which are best is better \n     than decreeing that one will do the job and praying that it \n     may. Among other things, strike aircraft have many different \n     roles, and relying upon just one would be the same sort of \n     economy as having Clark Gable play both Rhett Butler and \n     Scarlett O'Hara.\n       Having relinquished or abandoned many foreign bases, the \n     United States requires its warships to go quickly from place \n     to place so as to compensate for their inadequate number, and \n     has built them light using a lot of aluminum, which, because \n     it can burn in air at 3,000 degrees Celsius, is used in \n     incendiary bombs and blast furnaces. (Join the navy and see \n     the world. You won't need to bring a toaster.)\n       And aluminum or not, there are too few ships. During the \n     EP-3 incident various pinheads furthered the impression of an \n     American naval cordon off the Chinese coast. Though in 1944 \n     the navy kept 17 major carriers in the central Pacific alone, \n     not long ago its assets were so attenuated by the destruction \n     of a few Yugos disguised as tanks that for three months there \n     was not in the vast western Pacific even a single American \n     aircraft carrier.\n       What remains of the order of battle is crippled by a lack \n     of the unglamorous, costly supports that are the first to go \n     when there isn't enough money. Consider the floating dry \n     dock. By putting ships back into action with minimal transit \n     time, floating dry docks are force preservers and \n     multipliers. In 1972, the United States had 94. Now it has \n     14. Though history is bitter and clear, this kind of mistake \n     persists.\n       Had the allies of World War II been prepared with a \n     sufficient number of so pedestrian a thing as landing craft, \n     the war might have been cheated of a year and a half and many \n     millions of lives. In 1940, the French army disposed of 530 \n     artillery pieces, 830 antitank guns, and 235 (almost half) of \n     its best tanks, because in 1940 the French did not think much \n     of the Wehrmacht--until May.\n       How shall the United States avoid similar misjudgments? Who \n     shall stand against the common wisdom when it is wrong about \n     deterrence, wrong about the causes of war, wrong about the \n     state of the world, wrong about the ambitions of ascendant \n     nations, wrong about history, and wrong about human nature?\n\n\n                           the prudent course\n\n       In the defense of the United States, doing too much is more \n     prudent than doing too little. Though many in Congress argue \n     this and argue it well, Congress will not follow one of its \n     own. Though the president's appointees also argue it well, \n     the public will wait only upon the president himself. Only he \n     can sway a timid Congress, clear the way for his appointees, \n     and move the country toward the restoration of its military \n     power.\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\n       The president himself must make the argument, or all else \n     is in vain. If he is unwilling to risk his political capital \n     and his presidency to undo the damage of the past eight \n     years, then in the fire next time his name will be linked \n     with that of his predecessor, and there it will stay forever.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nstrong opposition to oil and gas exploration off the coast of Florida. \nSpecifically, the issue at hand is the sale of Lease Sale 181. I am \ncertainly not alone. There are 16 million Floridians who join in this \nopposition. Senator Bob Graham as well, Florida State elected \nofficials, certainly the legislature of Florida and most of the Florida \ncongressional delegation opposes any drilling in Lease Sale 181.\n  Lease Sale 181 may not be included in the current moratorium on lease \nsales off the coast of Florida, but in the hearts of all Floridians it \nis part of the moratorium. Moreover, there has never been a production \ndrilling rig actually producing off the coast of Florida because \nFloridians unequivocally oppose offshore drilling because of the threat \nit presents to the State's greatest natural and economic resource: our \ncoastal environment.\n  Florida's coastal waters provide an irreplaceable link in the life \ncycle of many species, both marine and terrestrial. Florida's beaches, \nfisheries, and wildlife draw millions of tourists each year from around \nthe globe, supporting our State's largest industry, tourism. Florida's \ncommercial fishing industry relies on these estuaries as nurseries for \nthe most commercially harvested fish. Nearly 90 percent of the reef \nfish resources of the Gulf of Mexico are caught on the West Florida \nShelf and contribute directly to Florida's economy.\n  Oil spills would be devastating to Florida's beaches, coastal waters, \nreefs, and fisheries. The chronic pollution and discharges from \ndrilling would detrimentally effect the shallow, clean water marine \ncommunities found on the Florida outer continental shelf. For these \nreasons, I cannot sit back and watch as my State, one of our nation's \nenvironmental jewels, is degraded.\n  I know some may have differing views because other issues or concerns \nconsume their constituents; and I respect those views. However, in \nFlorida the environment and tourism are of paramount importance. The \nbeaches, the abundant fisheries, and the pristine waters make Florida \nwhat it is today; and the people of Florida want it to stay that way. \nJust as drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would not solve \nthe administration's claimed energy crisis, drilling in Lease Sale 181 \nwill not either. Increased conservation and increased fuel efficiency \nin our cars would do more to meet our country's energy needs than \ndrilling in Lease Sale 181. For these reasons, I must adamantly object \nto and vigorously oppose the sale of Lease Sale 181; and I hope the \nrest of this body listens to the pleas of Floridians.\n  All of the oil and gas that would come out of this proposed lease \nsale would only give about 2 months worth of energy for the country. \nThat is simply not a viable tradeoff for the damage it would do to our \neconomy and our environment. We are not willing to make that tradeoff \nin Florida. As a matter of fact, as you talk about drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, isn't it interesting. If you put it \ninto the context of all the barrels of oil that are projected to be \npumped from that wildlife refuge, that energy consumption could be \nreplaced if we but increased all new vehicles in their energy \nefficiency by 3 miles per gallon. That puts the crisis in context.\n  Conservation is considerably important. The use of research and \ndevelopment to produce more energy-efficient appliances, more energy-\nefficient automobiles--there is no reason why this country that has the \ntechnological prowess cannot produce a car that is economical and that \nwill get 80 miles per gallon. We have that within our grasp. Think what \nthat would do to our energy consumption.\n  As a matter of fact, when you look at the uses of energy by this \nNation, the transportation sector is the sector that consumes most of \nthat energy. Just think what future energy-efficient automobiles could \ndo for us.\n  But that is a subject of larger proportions. Today, I rise on behalf \nof a State that has ecologically pristine beaches and the need to be \nkept just that way. This proposed lease sale for oil and gas drilling \nclearly jeopardizes the future economy and ecology of Florida.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, just prior to the Easter recess, the \nSenate completed action on the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution. I \nvoted in favor of final passage of the budget resolution, recognizing \nthat it does not reflect everything that I wanted. However, I am \nthankful the Senate-passed resolution does contain a fair amount of \nwhat President Bush had originally proposed in his budget plan.\n  Nevertheless, it is my hope that when the Senate does go to \nconference with the House--which has passed a more stringent budget \nresolution--the end result will yield a budget resolution more in-tune \nwith the President's more responsible package.\n  As it was originally put forward, I felt the Bush budget plan \nprovided much of the fiscal responsibility I have long sought from \nWashington prior to, and since, becoming a Member of the Senate. \nSpecifically, it restrains the growth of spending, reduces the debt as \nfast as is prudent, and allows for meaningful tax cuts. This is what I \nlike to refer to as a ``three-legged stool'' approach. For this package \nto work, however, we have to insist on a balanced approach, because \nfiscal responsibility, like a three-legged stool, cannot stand if one \nleg is significantly longer or shorter than the others.\n  Unfortunately, if we characterized the Senate budget resolution as a \nthree-legged stool, it would be rather wobbly right now since under the \nSenate budget resolution, discretionary spending increases at 8 \npercent, and that is double the amount the President suggested.\n  People often forget the President's proposal increased spending by a \nmodest 4 percent at a time when inflation is approximately 2.8 percent, \nmeaning it contains a real increase of 1.2 percent. In contrast, the \nSenate budget resolution, in real terms, results in a spending increase \nof 5.2 percent. That is a 333-percent higher rate of growth than what \nthe President proposes.\n\n  These increases may sound like small numbers in the grand scheme of \nthings, or in the Senate, but do not be fooled. It adds up to tens and \nhundreds of billions of dollars in more spending over time.\n  If we continue to spend money at this rate, we will have less \nresources to address important national needs, such as reforming Social \nSecurity, reforming Medicare, or providing a prescription drug benefit.\n  Indeed, according to calculations by the Concord Coalition, the \nSenate budget resolution includes new and expanded entitlement spending \nthat is going to cost $600 billion over 10 years, and discretionary \nspending that may total $240 billion over 10 years.\n  Coupled with the resulting increased interest cost of $550 billion, \nthis package of amendments to the budget resolution could reduce the \non-budget surplus by $1.4 trillion over 10 years.\n  I say to my colleagues, enough is enough. We have to stop this \nrampant\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nspending and, instead, prioritize what we ought to be doing with the \ntaxpayers' money. We need to sit down and make some hard choices about \nwhere to allocate taxpayers' money, where we want to increase spending, \nwhere we want to make cuts or maybe where we want to flat-fund.\n  For example, with regard to the National Institutes of Health, the \nPresident has included a generous increase in the amount of money that \nthe NIH will receive in its budget, boosting NIH spending $2.8 billion. \nThat is a 13.8 percent increase. The Senate, not wanting to be outdone, \nadded an additional $700 million in NIH funding. Therefore, under the \nSenate's plan, NIH funding will be increased 17.2 percent over last \nyear. In other words, the Senate wants to boost the rate of spending \nincrease some 25 percent faster than the President.\n  Do I think we should spend money on important health research? \nAbsolutely. But how much is enough?\n  The true cost is not just the dollar figure, it is what you give up, \nor what you could have purchased with that money. Economists call the \nconcept ``opportunity cost.'' When the Senate thinks about spending \nmoney on one thing, we need to recognize that we are giving up the \nability to use the money for other worthy purposes.\n  If we follow through with the Senate's budget resolution, that means \nwe will have fewer funds to conduct necessary Medicare reform, \nundertake education efforts aimed at preventive health care, provide \ngreater access to rural health care, or fully fund the social services \nblock grant.\n  Think about the social services block grant for a moment. Congress \npromised a funding stream of $2.8 billion for this program, but funding \nhas actually eroded $1 billion over the past 6 years. I hear a lot \nabout that from our county commissioners in the State of Ohio.\n  What most people do not realize is the fact that funds from the \nsocial services block grant go towards providing health care services \nfor children, prenatal to age 3.\n  There are tough choices and dilemmas: Do you give more to NIH to \nfight disease, or do you give more money to the social services block \ngrant, a program that gives children the nutrition and health services \nthey need so they do not develop the diseases that the NIH is trying to \nfight?\n  Another thing we need to remember in figuring opportunity costs is \nthe fact that we have a number of unmet Federal needs--needs that are a \nFederal responsibility, and which we should address as part of our full \nand balanced approach to the Federal budget.\n  Do we spend Federal dollars on school construction, which is a State \nand local responsibility, or do we prevent flood and storm damage from \nravaging people's lives? As former chairman of the Transportation and \nInfrastructure Subcommittee, I personally know we have $39 billion of \nwater resources development projects that the Army Corps of Engineers \nneeds to fund, and yet we only provide $1.3 billion each year for such \nprojects. Let's get serious. We will never deal with that backlog at \nthis rate.\n  Addressing such unmet needs does not sound important until there is a \nflood situation such as the folks along the Mississippi River are \nenduring right at this very moment.\n  In addition, we have serious unmet needs in our Nation's wastewater \ntreatment and sewer infrastructure. The costs are going up \nastronomically in the State of Ohio to comply with mandates from the \nU.S. EPA for sewer and water treatment. We have a responsibility to \nparticipate in helping to alleviate those costs.\n  My point is this: We should allocate our financial resources on a \nvery deliberate and prioritized basis and make the hard choices instead \nof the reckless last-minute spending that has often characterized the \nSenate over the last 3 years.\n  I cannot believe what the Senate has done the last couple of years. I \ncannot believe it. If I as a Governor or as a mayor or as a member of a \nboard of county commissioners spent money the way we did during the \nlast couple of years, they would have run me out of office very \nquickly.\n  I would remind my colleagues that just last year alone, we increased \nnon-defense discretionary authority by an astounding 14.3 percent. \nThink about it. This is unsustainable. In my view, we need to stiffen \nour backbones and bring an end to this spending habit. Families need to \ncarefully budget their resources. So do cities and States, and so, too, \nshould the Federal Government.\n  It is one of the reasons I wanted to get two points of order agreed \nto in the budget resolution to prevent further game playing with tax \ndollars. One point of order I offered would have helped stop abuses of \nemergency spending, and another would have prevented ``directed \nscoring,'' a process used to circumvent the budget process.\n  I am glad 51 Senators joined me and my cosponsors, Senators Gregg and \nFeingold, in supporting this measure. It is my hope the next time we \nwill get the 60 votes we need for adoption.\n  I also wanted to offer an amendment that would have extended and \nstrengthened the current caps on discretionary spending. Unfortunately, \nthat amendment would never have passed muster due to the excessive \nspending in the amendments of the budget resolution. We blew that out \nbefore I even had a chance to bring it up.\n  While the Senate's version of the budget resolution did not do \nenough, in my opinion, to keep spending in check, the silver lining is \nthe fact that it provides for two tax cuts. I am hopeful, therefore, \nthat we can, first, get this budget resolution to conference and that \nit emerges looking more fiscally responsible and that the conferees \npare-down the spending; and second, that the Finance Committee begins \nwork immediately on developing an $85 billion tax cut which I call \na ``balloon-payment'' approach, using the fiscal year 2001 on-budget \nsurplus.\n\n  I suggest this money go toward an immediate fiscal stimulus in the \nform of a cut in marginal rates; a cut that people will see in their \npaychecks directly through a change in their withholding.\n  We need to get the money in the people's hands right now. If we are \nserious about getting this reduction in marginal rates done soon, I \nhonestly think we could get legislation considered and passed in the \nSenate and the House and on the President's desk by Memorial Day and \nthe American people could see the benefits this summer. Let's get it \ndone.\n  I think we are all agreed that something needs to be done to restore \npeople's faith in the economy and bolster consumer optimism. It is at \nthe lowest level in my State since 1992. In my view, the balloon \npayment is probably one of the best ways to show the doubting Thomases \nthat the money is there and that we are doing something in Congress to \naddress the issue. Further, I believe we need to enact a long-term \nmarginal rate tax reduction as proposed by the President, which \neconomists say will have a tremendous impact on stimulating our \neconomy.\n  Given our economic situation, we in Congress need to follow a \nbalanced three-legged stool approach. If we can control the growth of \nspending, reduce the debt and achieve quick passage of a balloon \npayment and implement both a long-term and short-term marginal tax cut, \nit will give a gigantic boost to consumer confidence and help us return \nto economic normalcy. We can quibble about how to distribute the \nballoon payment. Let's just work it out. The main thing is, get it done \nand connect to it a true marginal rate tax reduction.\n\n  However, there is one thing that I fear could torpedo any recovery \nand that is our inability to address our Nation's energy crisis. While \nwe have already seen unprecedented home heating bills this past winter, \nI am concerned the worst is yet to come. Indeed, we are already seeing \ngasoline prices move toward the $2-per-gallon range, and it is far from \nthe peak summer driving season. What's more, the cost of energy is \nskyrocketing and supplies are scarce or unreliable. We can expect \nCalifornia's problems to intensify and likely be duplicated in other \nareas across the Nation.\n  It is not as if we didn't see this coming. The storm clouds have been \nbrewing for many years. Still, there has been no action on the part of \nCongress to consider a comprehensive energy policy along the lines of \nwhat Senator Murkowski has proposed in his bill, S. 388. I fear if we \ndon't get moving, we will not get that done, either.\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\n  We need to act on these issues quickly. The American people are \nwatching to see if we intend to bring this Nation out of our economic \ndownturn and back on the road to economic prosperity, or if we are \ngoing to continue to fiddle around while the country burns. I hear that \nfrom the folks back in Ohio: ``You are fiddling around in the Senate, \nand you are not getting anything done. Don't you understand how bad it \nis on the street?''\n  They want us to make the hard choices about spending. They want us to \nwork together to develop solutions to our energy crisis, to pay down \nour debt, and provide quick and measurable tax relief. They want us to \nput aside the partisan bickering and the gamesmanship and act in the \nbest interests of the Nation. After all, that is what they think they \nelected us to do.\n  We need to act in the spirit of the old Rogers and Hammerstein song \nfrom Carousel--many remember that--``You'll Never Walk Alone,'' so that \nthe American people know that ``at the end of the storm there is a \ngolden sky and the sweet silver song of the lark.''\n  Now, more than ever before, we have to restore people's faith and \ntheir confidence in the economic future of our Nation. It is in our \nhands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3828-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GOVERNOR MELDRIM THOMSON\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to my dear personal friend and political mentor, former New \nHampshire governor Meldrim Thomson, who passed away last Thursday. Mel, \nwho was 89, was one of the greatest governors in the history of the \nState of New Hampshire.\n  Mel Thomson left a lasting legacy. His legacy of country, state, \nfamily, and God will not soon be forgotten by those of us whose lives \nhe touched so deeply. He was not only a gentleman but a gentle man, a \nloving husband to Gale, father of six, grandfather, and great-\ngrandfather. He was one of my closest and most treasured friends. In \npolitics, loyalty and friendship mean everything.\n  In 1993, Governor Thomson wrote a book, ``100 Famous Founders,'' for \nwhich I was honored to have written the introduction. Among the first \nof the Founding Fathers to step forward and put his life, property, and \nhonor on the line for his country by signing the Declaration was Josiah \nBartlett of New Hampshire. Dr. Bartlett later served as the Governor of \nNew Hampshire. It is fitting that this magnificent book of profiles of \nour Nation's one hundred foremost Founders was written by one of Josiah \nBartlett's most distinguished and patriotic successors as Governor, \nMeldrim Thomson.\n  Meldrim Thomson had the same trust in God, love of family, steadfast \ndedication to his country and state, and sense of honor that \ncharacterized the Founders about whom he wrote. Indeed, had he lived in \nJosiah Bartlett's time, Meldrim Thomson certainly would have been a \nFounder too. Had he lived during the American Revolution, he would have \nstood shoulder-to-shoulder fighting for the cause alongside George \nWashington, Thomas Jefferson, Sam Adams, and General John Stark.\n  Meldrim Thomson, Jr., took the oath of office as the 91st Governor of \nNew Hampshire on January 3, 1973, and served until January 4, 1979. He \nis the only Republican to have served as Governor of New Hampshire for \nthree consecutive two-year terms.\n  Meldrim Thomson's road to the governorship began in 1954, when he \nmoved his publishing business and his family from New York to a new \nhome in Orford, NH. Although he was not a native son, Meldrim Thomson's \nstrongly independent nature and his bedrock conservative principles \nwere right for New Hampshire. In spirit, then, he quickly became a son \nof New Hampshire.\n  Plunging into New Hampshire politics, Meldrim Thomson waged an \nunsuccessful campaign for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1964. \nThat same year, though, he won election to New Hampshire's \nConstitutional Convention.\n  With characteristic grit and determination, Meldrim Thomson did not \nlet his defeats in the 1968 and 1970 New Hampshire Republican \ngubernatorial primaries discourage him from continuing to seek our \nState's highest office. His commitment paid rich dividends in 1972, \nwhen he won election as Governor. He ran and won again in 1974 and \n1976. In waging his victorious campaigns, Meldrim Thomson proved \nhimself to be a true populist. Running on the slogan ``ax the tax,'' \nGovernor Thomson took his campaigns to the people of New Hampshire in \ntheir living rooms and meeting halls.\n  As Governor, Meldrim Thomson did not shrink from difficult decisions. \nAs the spiritual descendant of the Founding Fathers, he had the courage \nto take grave political risks on behalf of his unfailingly conservative \nprinciples. Meldrim Thomson fought tirelessly for low taxes and strict \nfiscal discipline. As a result, during his time as Governor, the \neconomy of New Hampshire enjoyed a prosperity that was unknown in the \nrest of New England. Attracted by the state's low taxes, significant \nnew businesses moved their operations to New Hampshire. Wages and \nsalaries increased Old manufacturing centers such as Manchester and \nNashua demonstrated new signs of life.\n  Beyond his great economic successes, Meldrim Thomson did not hesitate \nto use his platform as Governor to speak out on vital national and \ninternational issues. He did not hesitate to criticize the foreign and \ndomestic misadventures of the Administration of Jimmy Carter. In fact, \nGovernor Thomson ordered New Hampshire State flags flown at half-staff \nto protest President Carter's pardon of Vietnam era draft resisters. It \ndeeply offended Governor Thomson's profound sense of patriotism that a \nPresident of the United States would take such an unprecedented action \nto shield those who refused their country's call from the rightful \nlegal consequences of their acts.\n  I have so many personal, inspiring memories of Mel Thomson. In our \nprivate moments, of which we shared many up at the farm in Orford, he \nwould affectionately call me ``son''. I thought of him like a father, \nboth personally as well as politically.\n  He always inspired me with his words of wisdom. He often said ``put \nprinciple above politics.'' He heeded his own words. Like Lincoln, \nChurchill and so many great men, he was unfairly criticized, but rose \nabove it all to do what was right.

SHANE OSBORN AND HIS CREW MEMBERS FOLLOWING THEIR \n                   DETAINMENT ON HAINAN ISLAND, CHINA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to commend in the \nstrongest possible terms the members of the United States Navy crew who \nwere detained on Hainan Island in China for 11 long days earlier this \nmonth. I think I speak for our entire nation when I say how much we \nadmire their dedication and the extraordinary level of professionalism \nthey exhibited throughout their ordeal.\n  Under the command of Lt. Shane Osborn, this crew of 24 servicemen and \nwomen left Kadena Airbase in Okinawa, Japan, on the evening of March 31 \nfor what was to have been a routine mission over the South China Sea.\n  As we all now know, what happened after they left Okinawa, and for \nthe next 11 days, was not routine. It was heroic. The entire world \nwitnessed the strength, discipline and courage of our Navy crew.\n  Every man and woman on that plane is a hero.\n  I am especially impressed with the skill and character of a \nremarkable young man who first dreamed of flying as a 3-year-old \nwatching a small Cessna on a South Dakota farm.\n  We are fortunate that Lt. Shane Osborn pursued his dream to fly. And \nwe are doubly fortunate that he put that dream to work in service of \nhis country.\n  Lt. Osborn says, modestly, that he was just what he'd been trained to \ndo when he landed his damaged aircraft safely. Others see it \ndifferently. A Pentagon spokesman described the landing\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\nas a ``spectacular feat of airmanship.'' Experienced EP-3 pilots termed \nit astounding. Indeed, it was.\n  Think about what had just happened: The collision with a smaller, \nfaster Chinese F-8 had dropped Lt. Osborn's EP-3 between 5,000 and \n8,000 feet and turned it almost completely upside-down; two of the \nplane's four propellers had been clipped in the collision, rendering \nuseless the wing flaps used to slow the plane during landing.\n  The collision had also sheared off the plane's nose cone.\n  And most of the plane's instruments were so badly damaged that they \nwere useless.\n  Even so, Lt. Osborn managed to stabilize the plane, and he and his \ncrew were able to guide it to the nearest airport, 70 miles northwest, \non China's Hainan Island.\n  Remarkably, during that 70-mile flight, Lt. Osborn and his crew had \nthe presence of mind to follow international procedure and issue a \nseries of distress signals. In fact, they issued as many as 25 signals \non two separate standard frequencies.\n  Lt. Osborn's crew and commanders say his courage and quick thinking \nsaved 24 lives.\n  After landing in Hainan, with their plane surrounded by armed Chinese \npersonnel, Lt. Osborn and his crew followed U.S. Navy procedure. They \ndestroyed sensitive documents and technology, greatly limiting what \ncould have been a significant intelligence loss.\n  For the next 11 days, Lt. Osborn's leadership, courage, dignity, and \nhis remarkable sense of humor, helped keep the spirits of his crew \nhigh.\n  We are fortunate to be protected and represented by the entire crew \nof that Navy EP-3: Richard Bensing; Steven Blocher; Bradford Borland; \nDavid Cecka; John Comerford; Shawn Coursen; Jeremy Crandall; Josef \nEdmunds; Brandon Funk; Scott Guidry; Jason Hanser; Patrick Honeck; \nRegina Kauffman; Nicholas Mellos; Ramon Mercado; Richard Payne; \nMitchell Pray; Kenneth Richter; Marcia Sonon; Curtis Towne; Jeffrey \nVignery; Wendy Westbrook, and Rodney Young.\n  As a South Dakotan, I must say I am especially proud of Lt. Shane \nOsborn, who followed his dream from Mitchell, SD, to the Norfolk, \nNebraska Civil Air Patrol, and now, into the pages of Naval history. He \nis a true hero, and we are proud of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3829-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3829-S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SMALL BUSINESS AMENDMENT TO THE 2002 BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing on behalf of NAGGL's \n     nearly 700 members in support of your amendment, number 183, \n     to the Budget Resolution that would revise the proposed \n     budget for the Small Business Administration in fiscal year \n     2002. Specifically, your amendment would restore $264 million \n     to the SBA's budget in fiscal year 2002 of which $118 million \n     is earmarked for the agency's 7(a) guaranteed loan program. \n     We strongly believe it is in the best interest of small \n     business that your amendment be adopted.\n       The present budget proposes no fiscal year 2002 \n     appropriations for the 7(a) loan program and instead proposes \n     to make the program self-funding through the imposition of \n     increased fees. The previous SBA Administrator testified \n     before the House Small Business Committee last year that the \n     7(a) program was already being run at a ``profit'' to the \n     government. This statement was confirmed in a September 2000 \n     Congressional Budget Office report entitled ``Credit Subsidy \n     Reestimates, 1993-1999.'' Unfortunately, the budget as \n     currently proposed would, in our view, have the effect of \n     imposing additional taxes by increasing program fees. This \n     result would be ironic given the Administration's push for \n     tax cuts.\n       A recent survey of NAGGL's membership, who currently make \n     approximately 80 percent of SBA 7(a) guaranteed loans, shows \n     that if the budget were adopted as proposed, most lenders \n     would significantly curtail their 7(a) lending activities. \n     Therefore, small businesses would find it more difficult and \n     expensive to obtain crucial long-term financing. The proposed \n     budget would increase the lender's cost of making a loan by \n     75 percent and would increase the direct cost to the borrower \n     by 12 percent. Any fee increase is unacceptable when the \n     program is already profitable for the government.\n       The small business consequences of a slowdown in 7(a) \n     guaranteed lending are manifold. Currently, according to \n     statistics available from the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation and the SBA, approximately 30 percent of all \n     long-term loans, those with a maturity of 3 years or more, \n     carry an SBA 7(a) guarantee. This is because lenders \n     generally are unwilling to make long-term loans with a short-\n     term deposit base. Therefore, reducing the availability of \n     7(a) capital to small businesses will have a significant \n     effect on them and on the economy.\n       The average maturity for an SBA 7(a) guaranteed loan is 14 \n     years. The average conventional small business loan carries \n     an average maturity of one year or less. For those\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\n     conventional loans with original maturities over one year, \n     the average maturity is just three years. The majority of SBA \n     7(a) borrowers are new business startups or early stage \n     companies. The longer maturities provided by the SBA 7(a) \n     loan program give small businesses valuable payment relief, \n     as the longer maturity loans carry substantially lower \n     monthly payments.\n       For example, if a small business borrower had to take a 5 \n     year conventional loan instead of a 10 year SBA 7(a) loan, \n     the result would be a 35%-40% increase in monthly payments. \n     The lower debt payments are critical to startup and early \n     stage companies. Small business loans, where they can be \n     found, would have vastly increased monthly payments. This at \n     a time when the economy appears to be struggling and when \n     bank regulators have spurred banks to tighten credit \n     criteria, the current budget only proposes to worsen the \n     situation for small business borrowers.\n       Your amendment would help mitigate this problem. It would \n     provide small businesses far better access to long-term \n     financing on reasonable terms and conditions at a time when \n     their access to such capital is critical. We urge your \n     colleagues to support your initiative and adopt your \n     amendment.\n           Respectfully,\n     Anthony R. Wilkinson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             U.S. Hispanic Chamber\n\n\n                                                  of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Small Business Committee, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We write in support of the Kerry/Bond \n     Amendment to restore $264 million of the proposed cuts to the \n     Small Business Administration's (SBA) budget. We further \n     support the amendment's proposal to have these funds come out \n     of the contingency fund and not the tax cut or the Medicare/\n     Social Security trust fund. Your amendment would ensure that \n     the small business programs at the SBA are adequately funded \n     and continue to provide loan and business assistance to \n     Hispanic-owned small businesses in this country.\n       The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) \n     represents the interest of approximately 1.5 million \n     Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States and Puerto \n     Rico. With a network of over 200 local Hispanic chambers of \n     commerce across the country, the USHCC stands as the \n     preeminent business organization that promotes the economic \n     growth and development of Hispanic entrepreneurs.\n       The SBA programs that are currently in jeopardy of losing \n     funds have been extremely instrumental in helping our \n     Hispanic entrepreneurs start and maintain successful \n     businesses in the United States. Without these programs, the \n     Hispanic business community will suffer huge setbacks to the \n     strides we have been able to achieve over the years. It is \n     therefore necessary to restore and increase funding to these \n     programs so that the Hispanic business community will \n     continue to experience economic growth and success in this \n     country.\n       We support your efforts and urge other members of the \n     Senate to support the Kerry/Bond amendment in restoring these \n     necessary funds to the SBA.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                   Maritza Rivera,\n     Vice President for Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                                           Bankers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n     To: Members of the U.S. Senate.\n     From: Independent Community Bankers of America.\n     Re: ICBA support the Kerry-Bond amendment to preserve small \n         business loan programs and to prevent new fees.\n       On behalf of the 5,300 members of the ICBA, we support the \n     Kerry-Bond amendment to the FY 2002 budget and urge all \n     Senators to join in support of this important bipartisan \n     amendment. The amendment to be offered by Senators John Kerry \n     (D-Mass) and Christopher Bond (R-Missouri) would prevent new \n     hidden taxes in the form of additional fees imposed on small \n     business lenders and borrowers. The proposed FY 2002 Budget \n     pending in the Senate would levy significant new fees on the \n     SBA 7(a) loan program. These increased fees would jeopardize \n     needed lending and credit to small business at the worst \n     possible time as our economy has slowed dramatically and \n     small business lending has become more difficult. Therefore, \n     the Kerry-Bond amendment would restore the appropriation for \n     the 7(a) small business loan program and prevent onerous new \n     fees from being levied on borrowers and lenders.\n       This amendment shares bipartisan support. The Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Senate Small Business Committees \n     oppose new taxes on small businesses in the form of higher \n     loan fees. Specifically, Small Business Committee Chairman \n     Chris Bond and Ranking Member John Kerry have asked for the \n     $118 million appropriation to support the 7(a) loan program \n     to be restored in the FY 2002 Budget. The ICBA applauds the \n     bipartisan efforts of Senators Kerry and Bond in offering \n     their amendment.\n       We urge every Senators' support for the Kerry-Bond \n     amendment so that small businesses have continued access to \n     needed credit and that the 7(a) loan program is not \n     devastated by taxing new fees.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Association of Small Business\n\n\n                                          Development Centers,\n\n                                                        Burke, VA.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Small Business Committee, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We wish to commend you for prosing an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution calling for the \n     restoration of funding for the Small Business Development \n     Center (SBDC) and 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Programs. During this \n     period of economic downturn, it is even more important \n     that funding for these two critically important programs \n     not be compromised as hundreds of thousands of small \n     businesses will need management and technical assistance \n     and long term debt financing more than ever.\n       As for the SBDC Program specifically, we are proud to \n     report that the most recent impact survey of the program \n     found that in one year SBDC's helped small businesses create \n     92,000 new jobs, generate $630 million in new tax revenues, \n     increased by 67,000 the number of entrepreneurs counseled \n     above previous levels, and provided training to more than \n     84,000 small business owners than were trained during the \n     last reporting period. In all, over 750,000 small business \n     and preventure clients received SBDC assistance in the last \n     fiscal year. And that was during good economic times.\n       Your seeking funding of $105,000,000 for the SBDC Program \n     is bipartisan as Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the Senate \n     Small Business Committee in his Views and Estimates letter to \n     the Senate Budget Committee called for the same funding \n     level. Likewise Senator Bond opposed any funding cut for the \n     7(a) Guaranteed Loan Program. Both recommendations we \n     applaud.\n       We also understand that your amendment would restore \n     funding for the New Markets and PRIME programs. This \n     association has taken no formal position regarding funding \n     for these well intended programs.\n       Thank you for soliciting our views. We appreciate your \n     leadership regarding these two outstanding SBA programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald T.

Mr. President, the Administration recently informed \nCongress of its arms sales package to Taiwan. Having long followed \npolitical developments both in Taiwan and the People's Republic of \nChina, PRC, and having visited both sides of the Strait, I wanted to \nmake a few brief comments.\n  First, weapon systems and military hardware aside, the political \nmessage transmitted to Taipei through the sales is that America's \ncommitment to Taiwan remains steadfast and strong. This is an \nappropriate message delivered in a timely manner by the new \nAdministration and with the encouragement and support of Congress.\n  Second, the package generally reflects a balanced approach to \nTaiwan's defensive needs, particularly on and under the sea. While the \nArleigh Burke-class destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system are \nnot part of this year's sale, and would not be operational until 2010, \nthe Administration has left open the option to pursue Aegis-equipped \ndestroyers at a future date. Aegis is still on the table. America has \nbolstered Taiwan's defensive capabilities through Kidd-class \ndestroyers, P-3 aircraft, submarines, and other weapons, and has \ndeferred decisions on other sales, such as tanks and helicopters, \npending a review of Taiwan's ground forces needs.\n  Finally, the PRC must understand that its continued buildup of short-\nrange ballistic missiles opposite Taiwan and aggressive modernization \nof its military for offensive purposes will all but guarantee the \nfuture sale of Aegis-equipped destroyers, or other technologically \nadvanced weapons system. If the Mainland is serious in wanting a \npeaceful resolution of differences with Taiwan, senior military and \ncivilian leaders must accept America's obligations under the Taiwan \nRelations Act to provide ``defense articles and defense services in \nsuch quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a \nsufficient self-defense capability.''\n  Simply put, every Chinese offensive military action will have a \nTaiwan-U.S. defensive reaction. Beijing can make clear its intentions \nby immediately renouncing the option to use force against Taiwan, and \nby reducing its military deployments across the Strait.\n  I intend to continue to follow political and military developments \nnot just in Taiwan and the PRC but throughout the region. I urge \nBeijing and Taipei to continue dialogue as the means of resolving their \ndifferences.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3831-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3831-S3832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to speak today in order to \ncommemorate the Armenian Genocide. As you know, today marks the 86th \nanniversary of this tragic occurrence. It is important that we take \ntime to remember and honor the victims, and pay respect to the \nsurvivors that are still with us.\n  April 24th marks the inception of brutal genocidal campaign to \neliminate Armenians from the Turkish Ottoman Empire. From the period of \n1915-1923, approximately one and a half million Armenians perished \nunder the rule of the Turkish Ottoman Empire. During this horrific \nperiod, the Armenian people fell victim to deportation, conscription, \ntorture, starvation and murder.\n  The Armenian genocide was the result of a consciously orchestrated \ngovernment plan. The German Chancellor to the Ottoman Empire, Count \nWolff-Metternich, stated at the time that, ``In its attempt to carry \nout its purpose to resolve the Armenian question by the destruction of \nthe Armenian race, the Turkish government has refused to be deterred \nneither by our representations, nor by those of the American Embassy, \nnor by the delegate of the Pope . . .''\n  In a century filled with loss and bloodshed, the Armenian Genocide \nmarked the first effort of the century to systematically eliminate an \nentire people. Unfortunately, the world did not learn from this \nmassacre, and the past 86 years have been stained by reminders that \nthere are those who will stop at no means to spread their agendas of \nhate and intolerance.\n  Nobel Laureate writer Elie Wiesel has said that the denial of \ngenocide constitutes a ``double killing'' for it seeks to rewrite \nhistory by absolving the perpetrators of violence while ignoring the \nsuffering of the victims. We must acknowledge the horrors perpetrated \nagainst the Armenian people to preserve the memory of the victims and \nto remind the world that we cannot and will not forget these crimes \nagainst humanity. However, it is not enough to simply remember those \nwho have perished. We must speak out against such tragedies, and \ndedicate ourselves to ensuring that evils such as the Armenian Genocide \nare not revisited on our planet. This is the highest tribute we can pay \nto the victims of any genocide.\n  The Armenian people have preserved their culture, faith and identity \nfor over a thousand years. In the last century alone, the Armenian \npeople withstood the horrors of two World Wars and several decades of \nSoviet dominance in order to establish modern Armenia. I hope all my \nSenate colleagues will join me in honoring and remembering the victims \nof the Armenian Genocide.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today marks the 86th anniversary of the \nbeginning of one the great human tragedies of history, the Armenian \ngenocide. Between 1915-1923 as many as 1.5 million Armenians were \nsystematically murdered by the Ottoman Empire and hundreds of thousands \nmore were forced to flee their homeland. These Armenians were victims \nof a policy intended to isolate, exile and even extinguish the Armenian \npopulation.\n  Although nearly a century has passed since this tragedy occurred, we \nmust not wipe it from our consciousness and let it become the forgotten \npast. Rather, we must continually learn from mistakes of the past so \nthat they are not repeated again and again in the future. Recent \nhistory in Bosnia, Rwanda and Kosovo tells us that systematic \nbrutality, that the attempt to wipe out an entire population because of \nits ethnicity, is still possible. The atrocities that took place in \nthese countries remind us that we still have much to learn.\n  The international community has made some progress, standing up for \njustice, holding those responsible for genocide and other serious \nviolations of international humanitarian law accountable for their \ncrimes. By establishing war crimes tribunals, like the International \nCriminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, ICTY, and the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, ICTR, we have begun to send \nthe clear message that such atrocious crimes will not go unpunished. I \nam pleased that the former Yugoslav leader Slobodan Milosevic, who has \nbeen wanted on international war crimes charges for his role in the \ncampaign of violence and hate in the Balkans, has finally been \narrested. I hope that his arrest marks the beginning of full justice \nbeing served with regard to him and others responsible for the \nunspeakable crimes committed in the Former Yugoslavia.\n  Each day we continue to read about and witness ethnic violence and \nviolations of human rights in countries across the globe. Sadly, in \nmany places this is simply the norm. Clearly there is a great deal of \nwork that still needs to be done to prevent human tragedy. So today as \nwe commemorate the Armenian genocide, let us honor the men, women and \nchildren whose lives were lost between 1915-1923, as well as the other \ncountless victims of violence throughout history, and recommit \nourselves to efforts that foster acceptance of others, respect for \nhuman rights, democratic principles, and peaceful relations between \npeople and nations at all levels.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today marks the 86th anniversary of \nthe beginning of the Armenian Genocide. I rise today to acknowledge and \ncommemorate this terrible crime and to help ensure that it will never \nhappen again.\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  On April 24, 1915, the Ottoman Empire launched a brutal and \nunconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an eight year period, 1.5 \nmillion Armenians were killed, and another 500,000 were driven from \ntheir homes, their property and land confiscated.\n  We who enjoy the blessings of freedom and liberty must commemorate \nthis event to ensure that it does not happen again. Far too often \nduring this century we have remained silent as men, women, and children \nhave been singled out, rounded up, and killed because of their race, \nethnicity, or religion. By acknowledging the Armenian Genocide we state \nloud and clear: Never again.\n  Never again will we let brutal violations of human rights go without \ncondemnation. Never again will we turn our backs on the oppressed and \ngive comfort to the oppressors. Never again will we fail to stand up \nfor justice and human dignity. Never again will we allow genocide to be \nperpetrated on this Earth.\n  Even as we remember the tragedy and honor the dead, we also honor the \nliving. I am proud that my home State of California is home to a \nvibrant Armenian American community, a half a million strong. They have \nenriched the culture of our state and have participated in every aspect \nof civic life. They are a shining example of a people who overcame the \nhorrors of the past to create a better future.\n  Let us never forget the victims of the Armenian Genocide. Let us \nensure that they did not die in vain. Let us come together to remember \nthe crimes of the past and to pledge to one another that they will not \nhappen again in the future. Let us look ahead with Armenia and the \nArmenian American community to a brighter tomorrow.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 86th \nanniversary of the Armenian genocide. From 1915 to 1923, 1.5 million \nArmenians were executed in the first genocide of the 20th Century.\n  Sadly, there are some people who still deny the very existence of \nthis period which saw the institutionalized slaughter of the Armenian \npeople and the dismantling of Armenian culture. To those who would \nquestion these events, I refer them to numerous documents kept by the \nUnited States National Archives, which detail these horrifying events. \nThe entire Armenian population in the Ottoman Empire was forcibly \nremoved from their historic homeland in present-day eastern Turkey. A \nmillion and a half people were massacred and another 500,000 were \nexiled. As the United States Ambassador to the Ottoman State at the \ntime, Henry Morgenthau, said, ``I am confident that the whole history \nof the human race contains no such horrible episode as this. The great \nmassacres and persecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when \ncompared to the sufferings of the Armenian race in 1915.''\n  Tragically, the Armenian genocide was the first in a series of \ngenocides in the 20th Century. Adolf Hitler, in preparing his genocide \nplans for the Jews, predicted that no one would remember the atrocities \nhe was about to unleash. After all, he asked, ``Who remembers the \nArmenians?''\n  And that is why we come together every year at this time to remember. \nThe genocide of the Armenians did take place, and we do remember. That \nmemory must be kept alive, to keep us vigilant in our efforts to \nprevent such atrocities from ever happening again.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join with Armenians throughout the \nUnited States, in Armenia, and around the world in commemorating the \n86th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  This week, members and friends of the Armenian community will gather \ntogether to remember April 24, 1915. On that day, nationalist forces of \nthe Ottoman Empire started an eight year campaign of massacre and \ndeportation that would impact the lives of every Armenian in Asia \nMinor.\n  Armenian men, women, and children of all ages fell victim to murder, \nrape, torture, and starvation. By 1923, an estimated 1.5 million \nArmenians had been systematically murdered and another 500,000 had \ntheir property stolen and were driven from their homeland. With World \nWar I occupying center stage at the time, the Armenian people's \nsituation went unaided.\n  Unfortunately, the residents of Armenia still suffer today. Armenian \nefforts at democracy and economic development have been hindered by \nregional conflict, natural disasters and internal strife. Yet, despite \nthese setbacks, the Armenian people have maintained a persevering \nspirit that has kept hope alive. In the past few months, optimism has \ngrown as internationally mediated peace talks between Armenian \nPresident Kocharian and Azerbaijani President Aliyev have made \nprogress.\n  Commemoration of the Armenian genocide is important not to keep alive \nthe memory of those Armenians who died, but to remind the world of its \nduty. As Archbishop Desmond Tutu noted in 1999, ``It is sadly true what \na cynic has said, that we learn from the history that we do not learn \nfrom history. And yet it is possible that if the world had been \nconscious of the genocide that was committed by the Ottoman Turks \nagainst the Armenians, the first genocide of the twentieth century, \nthen perhaps humanity might have been more alert to the warning signs \nthat were given before Hitler's madness was unleashed on an unbelieving \nworld.'' It is my hope that the world has begun to pay attention to \nhistory because, unlike in 1915, the international community heeded the \nwarning signs in Kosovo and did not sit back and watch, but reacted \nquickly and decisively. We must always bear witness to the terrors of \nyesterday so that we can respond to acts of oppression in the future, \nensuring that the deaths of all victims of hatred and prejudice are not \nin vain.\n  Therefore, on the 86th anniversary of the terrible tragedy of the \nArmenian genocide we remember the past and rededicate ourselves to \nsupporting Armenia as it looks to the future.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, April 24 marks the 86th anniversary of \nthe beginning of one of the most tragic events in history, the Armenian \nGenocide. In 1915, the Ottoman Turkish Government embarked on a brutal \npolicy of ethnic extermination. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million \nArmenians were killed, and more than half a million were forced from \ntheir homeland into exile.\n  In the years since then, the Armenian diaspora has thrived in the \nUnited States and in many other countries, bringing extraordinary \nvitality and achievement to communities across America and throughout \nthe world. The Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian National \nCommittee of America, and other distinguished groups deserve great \ncredit for their impressive work in maintaining the proud history and \nheritage of the Armenian people, and guaranteeing that the Armenian \nGenocide will never be forgotten.\n  One of the enduring achievements of the survivors of the Genocide and \ntheir descendants has been to keep its tragic memory alive, in spite of \ncontinuing efforts by those who refuse to acknowledge the atrocities \nthat took place. In Massachusetts, the Armenian Genocide is part of \nthat curriculum in every public school. Legislation was introduced last \nyear in the U.S. House of Representatives to support recognition of the \nArmenian Genocide, and the French government approved a law to \nrecognize the Armenian Genocide in January.\n  It is time for all governments, political leaders and peoples \neverywhere to recognize the Armenian Genocide. These annual \ncommemorations are an effective way to pay tribute to the courage and \nsuffering and triumph of the Armenian people, and to ensure that such \natrocities will never happen again to any people on earth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3832-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3832-S3833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred in my own home \nState of Oregon in 1995. A twenty-seven year old Stockton, California \nman murdered a Medford, OR couple, Roxanne Ellis, 53 and Michelle \nAbdill, 42. The women, who ran a property management business, \ndisappeared December 4, 1995\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\nafter showing the man an apartment for rent. He shot them both in the \nhead, and the bodies were left bound and gagged in a truck bed. The \nStockton man later confessed, saying he targeted the women because they \nwere lesbians, and he figured they wouldn't have families that would \nmiss them.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3833-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FINAL PASSAGE OF S. 27\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on Monday, April 2, the Senate took long \nawaited action to approve legislation to address what the American \npeople believe is the single most egregious abuse of our campaign \nfinance system--that is the unlimited flow of soft money permeating our \nelections system. If the McCain-Feingold legislation did nothing else \nbut close the soft money loophole, it would still be reform.\n  But my colleagues have accomplished much more in this legislation. I \ncongratulate Senators McCain and Feingold for their vision in \nrecognizing the powerfully negative influence of the money chase on our \npolitical system and their dogged persistence and patience in striving \nto craft a consensus on reform legislation that seeks to address the \nworst aspects of the current system.\n  But the Senate would not have passed this bill were it not for the \nequally determined leadership of Tom Daschle and the Democratic caucus. \nNo member has been more consistent in support of reform than our \nleader, and no member has worked harder behind the scenes to hold the \nDemocratic caucus together in support of this measure.\n  At the same time, I must also acknowledge the powerful influence of \nmy colleague, the chairman of the Rules Committee, for his unstinting \ndevotion to the principles of free speech and his unyielding belief \nthat most, if not all, proposed campaign finance reforms are not only \nunwise, but unconstitutional.\n  While a majority of this body clearly do not share Senator \nMcConnell's views, I appreciate his willingness to allow the debate to \ncontinue unhindered, unlike debates in the past, by repeated cloture \nvotes.\n  This debate has exemplified the Senate at its best. The free flow of \ndebate, the unrestricted offering of well reasoned amendments, and the \nopportunity for all members to be heard are the hallmarks of this, the \nworld's greatest deliberative body.\n  Finally, I must express my great respect to my colleagues in the \nDemocratic caucus, under the very able leadership of Senator Daschle, \nwho, along with a small group of courageous Senators across the aisle, \nhave put aside their own short-term political interests and voted time \nand again in favor of comprehensive, commonsense, and badly-needed \ncampaign finance reform.\n  I predict that this debate will find its place in history as one of \nthe greatest Senate debates in the last decade, both in terms of its \ncontent and its impact on our system of democracy.\n  I have been privileged and honored to serve as floor manager of this \nmeasure, along with the Senator from Kentucky. As my colleague from \nKentucky has alluded, the stakes in this debate were considerable for \nmany interested parties.\n  And although members disagreed over the need for this measure, and \namendments to it, Senators were not disagreeable in their debate. I \nthank my colleagues for their patience and cooperation throughout this \ndebate.\n  I also compliment my good friend, the Majority Leader, for his \nwillingness to allow the Senate to have a free-flowing debate. This \nissue is of paramount importance to the continued health of this \ndemocracy, and his willingness to provide for free and open debate on \nthe McCain-Feingold measure has produced, in this Senator's mind, an \neven better bill than was originally brought to the Senate floor.\n  I am hopeful there will be an opportunity to make further \nimprovements in this measure in the House. Although I am supporting the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation, there are two provisions, in particular, \nthat cause me concern.\n  First is the so-called millionaire's provision which purports to \nlevel the playing field for candidates who face wealthy challengers. \nWhile that may be a laudable goal, the amendment ignores the fact that \nmany incumbents who face wealthy challengers are sitting on healthy \ncampaign treasuries, sometimes amounting to several million dollars. In \nthose instances, this amendment serves as an incumbent protection \nprovision.\n  As I stated before passage of the Durbin-Domenici-DeWine amendment to \nfix this inequity, I am not satisfied that the Durbin amendment went \nfar enough to recognize the considerable war chests that some \nincumbents have. I urge my colleagues in the House to carefully \nconsider this provision with an eye to improving it.\n  Secondly, although I reluctantly supported the Thompson-Feingold \namendment to increase the individual hard money contribution limits, I \ndid so only in the context of achieving broader reform. Quite simply, \nthe increase in the hard money limits was the price to be paid to gain \nsufficient support from our Republican colleagues for banning soft \nmoney and reining in so-called sham issue ads.\n  Of particular concern to me is the indexing of these increases which \nonly ensures the continuing upward spiral of money into our political \nsystem. While I understand the desire of some to avoid a future debate \non reform, the fact that the hard money limits had not been increased \nsince 1974 is what created both the pressure and the opportunity for \nthis reform.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues in the House to consider these limits and \navoid the temptation to increase them ever higher; otherwise, there may \ncome a time when the price for reform becomes too great for this \nSenator.\n  I am hopeful that the House will act expeditiously on this measure. \nWhile I do not suggest that House members forego their responsibility \nand right to thoroughly debate and amend this legislation, I encourage \nthem to do so in a manner that will allow this bill to reach the \nPresident's desk before the end of this year.\n  I also thank the numerous staff who have assisted in facilitating \nconsideration of this measure, not the least of which are our \nDemocratic floor staff, including Marty Paone, Lula Davis, and Gary \nMyrick, along with the outstanding Democratic cloakroom staff.\n  I also extend my special appreciation to Andrea LaRue of Senator \nDaschle's staff. She, along with Mark Childress and Mark Patterson, \nwere invaluable in offering much needed expertise and guidance on this \nlegislation.\n  Of equal assistance were the staffs of Senators Feingold and McCain, \nincluding Bob Schiff, Ann Choiniere and Mark Buse, as well as Laurie \nRubenstein of Senator Lieberman's staff and Linda Gustitus of Senator \nLevin's staff.\n  I also wish to acknowledge the contributions of Senator McConnell's \nstaff, including Hunter Davis of his personal staff, and Tam Somerville \nand Andrew Siff of the Rules Committee staff.\n  Finally, I thank Shawn Maher of my personal office staff, and \nVeronica Gillespie, my Elections counsel on the Rules Committee staff, \nas well as Kennie Gill, the Democratic staff director and chief counsel \nof the Rules Committee.\n  One final point, Mr. President. The great justice, Learned Hand, once \nspoke of liberty as the great equalizer among men. In his words, ``the \nspirit of liberty is the . . . lesson . . . (mankind) has never \nlearned, but has never quite forgotten; that there may be a kingdom \nwhere the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the \ngreatest.''\n  That, my colleagues, should be the ultimate test of whether any \nmatter considered by this body is worthy of support. The McCain-\nFeingold legislation passes that test.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3833-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3833-S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ARKANSAS PLAN\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I am announcing my vision for the \ndesign of the tax cut and I am sending a message to my Chairman and to \nthe President that I am willing to work with them on a tax cut as long \nas it recognizes that Arkansas taxpayers\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\nalso work hard and have earned a share of the surplus in the form of a \ntax cut.\n  The President's tax rate cuts are skewed to the rich and the average \nArkansan won't see a real cut, if at all, until 2006. Forty-nine \npercent of Arkansans have adjusted gross incomes under $20,000 and the \naverage household income in Arkansas is $29,019. About 85 percent of \nArkansas families don't make enough to qualify as one of the ``model \nfamilies'' that President Bush has been talking about in his speeches. \nIn other words, only about 15 percent of Arkansans would get a $1,600 \ntax cut. The other 85 percent of Arkansans deserve a real tax cut too.\n  I believe in creating a new ten percent bracket like the President, \nbut under my plan it be fully implemented this year. That will bring \nthousands of dollars to Arkansas families immediately and over the next \n5 years will mean significantly more to the Arkansas economy than will \nthe Bush plan.\n  I also want to expand the 15 percent bracket by $10,000. This will \nmean that 85 percent of Arkansas taxpayers and small businesses never \nmake it out of the 15 percent bracket and will never pay more than \nabout an 11 percent effective Federal tax rate. Expanding the 15 \npercent bracket would mean that a couple earning $55,000 would get $980 \nmore than they would under the Bush plan, regardless of whether they \nhave children or not. The only way for average citizens to get a \nsignificant tax cut under the Bush plan is to have children. Single \npeople and people who are no longer raising their children deserve a \ntax cut too, and I propose to give them one.\n  I do believe in doubling the child tax credit as the President \nproposes. However, I believe it should be partially refundable for \nworking taxpayers as their Earned Income Tax Credit is phased out. \nApproximately 140,000 Arkansas families, or 37 percent of Arkansas \nfamilies with children, will not benefit from the President's plan \nbecause their incomes are too low to owe federal income taxes. By \nmaking the child tax credit partially refundable, low-income working \nparents would get the benefits of the child tax credit just like I do. \nAt the same time, I believe it is unfair to phase out the value of \nexemptions and credits for high income individuals. What's good for the \ngoose is good for the gander. If we are going to give a $1,000 per-\nchild tax credit to working families, then we should give that credit \nto all working families, rich and poor.\n  We also must fix the Alternative Minimum Tax, AMT. I have asked the \nPresident in person, I have asked him in writing, ``How will your \nAdministration address the AMT?'' Many of you may not know that the \nAMT, which is designed to prevent affluent taxpayers from sheltering \ntheir tax liability in credits and deductions, will soon have an \nunintended consequence for 37 million Americans. These middle income \nworkers will be paying higher rates and filing out more forms if we do \nnot act. At a minimum, the AMT exemptions should be raised and indexed, \nand family credits should be protected from the AMT's bite.\n  With our private savings rate at a negative for the first time in our \nhistory we should encourage more private savings by increasing the IRA \nand 401(k) contribution limits as part of an overall retirement \nsecurity and expansion act. Increasing private savings is an important \nway to keep capital reserve up and interest rates low. The fiscally \nconservative thing to do is include the pension bill in this year's tax \nrelief.\n  I support eliminating the so-called marriage penalties in the tax \ncode, but we should do it in a way that is fair to widows and singles. \nTaxpayers should not be punished for getting married, but nor should \nthey be punished when their spouse dies or if they choose not to get \nmarried.\n  Lastly, the estate tax should be repealed within the next three \nyears. While the revenue estimates of repealing the estate tax have \nbeen high, I believe there are many ways we can ensure that death is no \nlonger a taxable event without breaking the treasury. In the short run, \nwe may have to provide for a mark-to-market fee to provide for a \nstepped-up basis for inherited property or a higher capital gains rate \nfor inherited property, but no tax would be paid unless the asset was \nsold. In short, the U.S. tax code should not be an obstacle to family \nfarmers and small business people who want to pass on their legacy.\n  At the end of the day, Vice-President Cheney would get about a $1 \nmillion tax cut under my plan, instead of the $2.4 million he would get \nunder the Bush plan. However, average Arkansans would see thousands \nmore and those dollars will be spent and saved in Arkansas where they \nbelong. A family of four with a $30,000 income would get a $1,600 per \nyear tax cut which is approximately $484 more per year than they would \nget under President Bush's plan. My plan would put more money in \nArkansas and the South, and would cost $400 billion less than the \nPresident's $1.6 billion plan. That cost savings is important, because \nultimately, I will not support any tax cut plan that would endanger the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare and inhibit our \nability to retire the national debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3834-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \ntributes by current and former members of the Senate and House of \nRepresentatives at the memorial service for the late Senator Alan \nCranston be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Memorial Tribute to Sen. Alan Cranston by Senator Max Cleland\n\n       On February 6, over 200 admirers gathered in Hart SOB 902 \n     to pay tribute to our dear friend Alan Cranston, who left us \n     on the last day of the year 2000. Joining with me as sponsors \n     of this event were the Senators from West Virginia (Mr. \n     Rockefeller), California (Mrs. Feinstein and Mrs. Boxer), and \n     Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the former Senator from \n     Wyoming (Mr. Simpson). Ten members and former members spoke, \n     and a short film about Senator Cranston's recent activities \n     was shown. At the end of the program, Alan's son, Kim, spoke. \n     It was a memorable afternoon for all in attendance.\n       The Program Cover pictured Alan and his beautiful, now \n     seven-year old, granddaughter Evan. On the second page \n     appeared the following words of the Chinese poet and \n     philosopher Lao-Tzu, which Alan carried with him every day:\n\n     A leader is best\n     When people barely know\n     That he exists,\n     Less good when\n     They obey and acclaim him,\n     Worse when\n     They fear and despise him.\n\n     Fail to honor people\n     And they fail to honor you.\n     But of a good leader,\n     When his work is done,\n     His aim fulfilled,\n     They will all say,\n     ``We did this ourselves.''--Lao-Tzu\n\n       The program participants and sponsors were shown on the \n     third page as follows:\n       Musical Prelude: United States Army Strings.\n       Introductions and Closing: Judge Jonathan Steinberg.\n       Speakers: Senator Max Cleland, Senator Alan Simpson, \n     Senator Edward Kennedy, Senator Diane Feinstein, Senator \n     Barbara Boxer, Representative G.V.

Cranston Cameron.\n       Event Sponsors: Senators Cleland, Simpson, Rockefeller, \n     Kennedy, Feinstein, and Boxer.\n       The back page of the program set forth Senator Cranston's \n     Committee assignments and the acknowledgments for the \n     Tribute, as follows:\n       Senator Cranston's 24 years of service in the United States \n     Senate exceeded that of any California Democratic Senator and \n     was the second longest tenure of any California Senator. He \n     was elected Democratic Whip seven times, and his service of \n     14 years in that position is unequaled. His Committee service \n     was:\n       1969-93: Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n       1971-73 and 1975-79: Chairman, Subcommittee on Production \n     and Stabilization.\n       1973-75: Chairman, Subcommittee on Small Businesses.\n       1979-85: Chairman or Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee \n     on Financial Institutions.\n       1985-87: Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on \n     Securities.\n       1987-93: Chairman, Subcommittee on Housing and Urban \n     Affairs.\n       1969-81: Committee on Labor and Public Welfare (Human \n     Resources).\n       1969-71: Chairman, Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n       1971-73: Chairman, Subcommittee on Railroad Retirement.\n       1971-81: Chairman, Subcommittee on Child and Human \n     Development.\n       1981-93: Committee on Foreign Relations.\n       1981-85: Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Arms \n     Control, Oceans, International Operations, and Environment.\n       1985-93: Chairman or Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee \n     on East Asian and Pacific Affairs.\n       1977-92: Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Chairman or \n     Ranking Minority Member.\n       In addition, Senator Cranston served on the Committees on \n     the Budget (1975-79) and on Nutrition and Human Needs (1975-\n     77), and on the Select Committee on Intelligence (1987-93).\n       Event Planning and Arrangements: Bill Brew, Fran Butler, \n     Kelly Cordes, Chad Griffin, Bill Johnstone, Susanne Martinez, \n     Dan Perry, Ed Scott, Jon Steinberg, Lorraine Tong, Elinor \n     Tucker.\n       As I said at the Tribute, I would not be in this body were \n     it not for Alan Cranston. My colleague, the Senator from \n     Washington (Ms. Cantwell), expressed that same sentiment in \n     her remarks. Alan Cranston will always be an inspiration for \n     us. He will live in our memories and the memories of all \n     those who served with him and were touched by the causes he \n     championed and in the hearts and minds of those he so ably \n     represented in his beloved State of California. Following are \n     the transcript of the Tribute, and the document, \n     ``Legislative Legacy, Alan Cranston in the U.S. Senate, 1969-\n     1993,'' that was distributed at the Tribute.\n\n   A Legislative Legacy--Alan Cranston in the U.S. Senate, 1969-1993\n\n\n                              An Overview\n\n       As an eight-year-old boy, Alan Cranston lost his first \n     election to be bench monitor in his Los Altos grammar school. \n     As an adult, he became the state's most electable Democrat \n     and one of the most durable and successful California \n     politicians of the 20th Century. During decades of political \n     and social turbulence, when no other California Democrat was \n     elected more than once to the U.S. Senate, Alan Cranston won \n     four Senate terms in the Capitol, serving a total of 24 \n     years. It is a California record unmatched except for the \n     legendary Hiram Johnson, a Republican who held his Senate \n     seat from 1917 to 1945.\n       In addition, Cranston was elected to seven consecutive \n     terms as the Senate Democratic Whip, the number two party \n     position in the Senate. That, too, is an all-time Senate \n     record for longevity in a leadership post. Alan Cranston is \n     credited with rebuilding the Democratic Party in California \n     through grass- roots activism and organization. In the mid-\n     1950s, he organized the then- powerful California Democratic \n     Council, a vast network of party volunteers that in 1958 \n     helped sweep Republicans from most statewide offices. Edmund \n     G. ``Pat'' Brown was elected governor, Democrats seized the \n     California Legislature, and Cranston began two terms as State \n     Controller of California.\n       Senator Cranston sought the Democratic Party nomination for \n     President in 1984. His campaign, though ultimately \n     unsuccessful, raised to new heights public support for \n     international arms control and a superpower freeze on nuclear \n     weapons.\n       In terms of political style, Senator Cranston drew upon an \n     earlier Earl Warren tradition of bipartisanship, and was well \n     served by a diversified base of political support. \n     Representing the California mega-state in the Senate, \n     Cranston skillfully balanced a wide array of insistent and \n     sometimes conflicting state interests. He steered a delicate \n     course between the state's giant agribusiness interests and \n     those of consumers, family farmers and farm workers; he \n     weighed the claims of home builders and growing communities \n     with the need to preserve open space and wildlife habitats; \n     and he nurtured and led the California epicenter of the \n     national arms control and peace movements, while effectively \n     representing the home of the nation's defense and aerospace \n     industry.\n       The record of Congressional measures from 1969 to 1993 adds \n     up to a catalogue of literally tens of thousands of \n     legislative actions on which there is a Cranston imprint. \n     These include the large events of the past quarter century--\n     Vietnam, the Cold War, civil rights, the rise of \n     environmentalism, conflict in the Middle East, Watergate, the \n     energy crisis, and equal rights for women.\n       The Cranston mark is on thousands of bills and amendments \n     he personally authored affecting virtually every aspect of \n     national life. Without this legislative record, America would \n     be a different and poorer place in the quality of life and \n     environment for a majority of our people. Rivers would be \n     more polluted, the air less clean, food less safe. Fewer \n     opportunities would be open to all citizens, fewer advances \n     made in medicine and science; there would be less safe \n     conditions in workplaces.\n       Despite facile and careless cynicism about the work of \n     government, the achievements of the nation's Legislative \n     Branch from the mid-1960s to the early 1990s have made a \n     distinct and meaningful difference in the lives of millions \n     of Americans. Alan Cranston's particular contributions to \n     progressive legislation is notable. The difference a single \n     U.S. Senator can make is demonstrated by a study of all votes \n     cast in the Senate over two decades in which the outcome was \n     decided by less than five votes and often by a single vote. \n     Between 1969 to 1989 there were over 2,500 such votes in \n     which Alan Cranston's influence often was critical to the \n     outcome.\n       The figures do not include thousands of legislative \n     decisions reached by less narrow margins. Nor do they reflect \n     the additional influence of Senator Cranston as a behind-the-\n     scene strategist, nose-counter, marshaler of forces and \n     shrewd compromiser who always lived to fight another day. The \n     sum of thousands of ``small'', quiet, often little-noticed \n     and uncelebrated legislative actions over near a quarter-\n     century adds up to steady progress in nearly every area of \n     American life.\n       As for one man's place in such a record, former Vice \n     President Walter Mondale called Senator Cranston: ``The most \n     decent and gifted member of the United States Senate.''\n       Even with so diverse a legislative record, certain points \n     of emphasis and priority emerge. Although never an ideologue, \n     Senator Cranston was passionate in pursuit of world peace, \n     for extending opportunities for those left out of the \n     mainstream, and for protecting the natural environment. Asked \n     by a reporter what he ``goes to the mat for,'' Cranston \n     replied: ``Peace, arms control, human rights, civil rights, \n     civil liberties. If there's an issue between some very \n     powerful people and some people without much power, my \n     sympathies start with those who have less power.''\n       During the eight years that remained to him after he left \n     the Senate, Alan Cranston worked tirelessly on issues of war \n     and peace, speaking out for human rights, and for preserving \n     the environment of the planet for present and future \n     generations. In 1996, he became chairman of the Global \n     Security Institute, a San Francisco-based research \n     organization which he founded together with former Soviet \n     President and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mikhail S. Gorbachev \n     to promote world peace and the abolition of nuclear weapons.\n\n\n                             EARLY HISTORY\n\n       Few people in modern history have entered the U.S. Senate \n     as freshmen better prepared than Alan Cranston to combine \n     lifelong concerns over foreign and domestic policy with an \n     understanding of the inner procedural, political and human \n     workings of the institution. It was a preparation which made \n     it possible to gain and hold on to Senate power as Democratic \n     Whip for 14 of his 24 years in Congress.\n       In 1936, as a 22-year-old foreign correspondent he joined \n     the International News Service (later part of United Press \n     International), immediately after graduating from Stanford \n     University. He was sent on assignments to Germany, Italy, \n     Ethiopia and England in years leading up to the outbreak of \n     World War II. He personally watched and listened as Adolph \n     Hitler whipped his audiences into mass frenzy. He saw \n     Mussolini strut before tens of thousands in Rome. He covered \n     London in the fateful years ``while England slept,'' and he \n     watched as the world seemed helpless to act against the dark \n     march of fascism.\n       Three years later, following his return to the United \n     States, Cranston learned that an English-language version of \n     Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' was being distributed in the U.S. He \n     was alarmed to discover that, for propaganda purposes, parts \n     of the text had been purposefully omitted. These were \n     passages which would have made clear the nature and full \n     extent of Hitler's threat to the world. To warn Americans \n     against Hitler, he wrote a complete and accurate version of \n     the book, with explanatory notes making the Dictator's real \n     intentions clear. It was published in tabloid form and sold a \n     half-million copies before a copyright infringement suit \n     brought by agents of the Third Reich put a stop to its \n     further distribution.\n       Senator Cranston's strong commitment to human rights and \n     peace, and his alertness to the dangers of totalitarian one-\n     man rule, were clearly shaped by witnessing first hand the \n     rise of fascism in Europe and the deadly chain of events \n     leading to the Second World\n\n[[Page S3836]]\n\n     War and its Cold War aftermath. His first work in Washington, \n     serving in 1940 and 1941 as a representative of the Common \n     Cause for American Unity, entailed lobbying Congress for \n     fairness in legislation affecting foreign born Americans. \n     This activity gave him an opportunity to learn at close \n     range the inner workings of the Senate.\n       With the outbreak of war, Cranston served as Chief of the \n     Foreign Language Division of the Office of War Information in \n     the Executive Offices of the President. When offered a draft \n     deferment in 1944, he declined it and enlisted in the Army as \n     a private, where he was first assigned to an infantry unit \n     training in the U.S. Because of his experience as a foreign \n     correspondent and journalist, he became editor of Army Talk. \n     His rank was sergeant by VJ Day.\n       While still in the Army, he began researching and writing a \n     book in hopes of influencing international decision-making in \n     the post-war world. It was an account of how, in the \n     aftermath of the first World War, a handful of willful men in \n     the U.S. Senate, opposed to President Wilson and the 14-point \n     peace plan, managed to prevent U.S. participation in the \n     League of Nations, ultimately undermining the peace and \n     setting the stage for a second World War.\n       In 1945, ``The Killing of the Peace'' by Alan Cranston was \n     published. The New York Times rated it one of the 10 best \n     books of the year. The book served to warn against the folly \n     of repeating the same isolationist mistakes that followed \n     World War I. The Cranston book also presented a meticulous \n     description of the byzantine inner workings of the U.S. \n     Senate during the debate over ratification of the League of \n     Nations treaty. At age 31, the future Senator revealed a full \n     appreciation of the critical role played by individual egos, \n     personalities and interpersonal relationships in the \n     legislative process, and showed how awareness to such human \n     factors could be critical in determining the outcome of a \n     vote.\n       The immediate post-war years in Washington and publication \n     of The Killing of the Peace marked the real beginning of \n     Cranston's determination to become a member of the Senate. He \n     wanted to enter that institution where he could promote world \n     peace and causes of social justice.\n       From 1949 to 1952 he served as national president of the \n     United World Federalists, dedicated to promoting peace \n     through world law. He was a principal founder of the \n     California Democratic Council, established to influence the \n     direction of the Democratic Party in the state, and was \n     elected as the first CDC President in 1953 and served until \n     1958.\n       He was elected California state controller in 1958, which \n     placed him among the top ranks of the party's statewide \n     elected officials. He was reelected in 1962 and served until \n     1966.\n\n\n                          SENATE ACHIEVEMENTS\n\n                            Foreign affairs\n\n       Elected to the Senate in l968, during the height of \n     fighting in Vietnam, Senator Cranston quickly allied with so-\n     called ``doves'' which were a distinct minority in Congress \n     at that time. Together with Senator Edward Brooke of \n     Massachusetts, Alan Cranston co-authored the first measure to \n     pass the Senate cutting off funds to continue the war in \n     Southeast Asia. The Brooke-Cranston Amendment paved the way \n     to the U.S. Congress ultimately asserting its prerogatives \n     over military spending and provided for the orderly \n     termination of U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.\n       Senator Cranston played key roles in shaping the SALT and \n     START arms pacts, and in framing debate on virtually every \n     new weapon system, arms control issue and foreign treaty from \n     1969 to 1993. A recognized leader on the Foreign Relations \n     Committee, Alan Cranston was a highly respected voice on \n     behalf of arms control, nuclear non-proliferation, peaceful \n     settlement of international conflict, human rights around the \n     world, sensible and compassionate approaches to immigration \n     and refugee issues, foreign trade and long range solutions \n     to problems of famine, disease and oppression in the Third \n     World.\n       In addition to U.S.-Soviet relations, those specific areas \n     of foreign policy in which Senator Cranston made a \n     significant impact include the passage of the Panama Canal \n     Treaty, efforts to bar military aid to the Nicaraguan \n     contras, aid to Israel and efforts toward peace in the Middle \n     East, helping to bring a halt to U.S. involvement in a civil \n     war in Angola, and opposition to apartheid in South Africa.\n\n                       Environmental legislation\n\n       Among the legacy of Alan Cranston's years in the Senate is \n     a wealth of parks, wilderness areas, wildlife refuges, wild \n     rivers, scenic areas and coastline protection measures. With \n     just two bills in which Alan Cranston and Rep. Phillip Burton \n     of San Francisco teamed--the Omnibus Parks Act of 1978 and \n     the Alaska Lands Act of 1980--as much acreage was placed \n     under federal protection as all the parks lands created \n     earlier in the 20th Century combined. Senator Cranston was \n     the Senate sponsor of legislation creating the Golden Gate \n     National Recreation Area, the Santa Monica Mountains National \n     Recreation Area, the Channel Islands National Park, a 48,000 \n     acre addition to the Redwoods National Park, and the \n     inclusion of Mineral King into Sequoia National Park. He \n     sponsored 12 different wilderness bills which became law \n     between 1969 and 1982. He helped close Death Valley National \n     Monument to open pit mining and was an architect of the \n     Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act.\n       He worked diligently throughout his Senate years for the \n     California Desert Protection Act, that called for setting \n     aside millions of acres of desert lands as wilderness and \n     park preserves, and creating better government conservation \n     efforts for a vast portion of the California desert \n     ecosystem. His efforts ultimately came to fruition when \n     Senator Dianne Feinstein, during the first Clinton term, was \n     able to enact into law the Cranston crusade for desert \n     preservation.\n       Even this long list does not tell the complete story of \n     Senator Cranston's environmental record, which includes clear \n     air and clean water legislation, control of toxic wastes, \n     liability for oil spills, restoration of fish and wildlife \n     resources, and support for new technologies for cleaner \n     fuels. No other period in American history has seen so much \n     been accomplished for environmental protection as the last \n     three decades of the 20th Century, and Senator Cranston was \n     an essential but largely unheralded architect of these \n     policies.\n\n                      Civil rights/Civil liberties\n\n       In his first term as a Senator, Alan Cranston wrote the \n     amendment that extended to federal workers the civil rights \n     protections earlier mandated to private employers. He also \n     played a key strategic role in ending a filibuster which \n     threatened the extension of the Voting Rights Act. He \n     authored the first Senate bill to redress grievances of \n     Japanese-Americans interned in relocation camps during the \n     Second World War. Cranston co-authored landmark legislation \n     protecting the civil rights of institutionalized persons. He \n     was the first U.S. Senator to employ an openly-gay person on \n     his staff, and he fought official discrimination against \n     homosexuals in immigration laws and access to legal services.\n       Aware from his days as a journalist of the importance of \n     protecting news sources, Senator Cranston fought the Nixon \n     Administration to preserve an unfettered and free press in \n     America. He successfully blocked legislation in 1975 that \n     would have created an Official Secrets Act threatening First \n     Amendment freedoms.\n\n                              Health care\n\n       Both on the Senate and Human Resources Subcommittee on \n     Health and Scientific Research, and as Chairman of the Senate \n     Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator Cranston worked to secure \n     for all individuals access to health services necessary for \n     the prevention and treatment of disease and injury and for \n     the promotion of physical and mental well-being.\n       He authored the law, and extensions and refinements of it, \n     that provided for the development nationwide of comprehensive \n     medical services (EMS) systems and for the training of \n     emergency medical personnel. He steered the original \n     Emergency Medical Systems Act through Congress, then \n     persuaded a reluctant President Nixon to sign it into law. A \n     few years later, the Cranston measure was quite possibly \n     responsible for saving another President's life. It was at a \n     special trauma care unit at George Washington University \n     Medical Center in Washington, D.C., established in part by \n     the EMS law, where President Reagan's life was saved \n     following an assassination attempt in 1981.\n       Senator Cranston also wrote laws that have made a broad \n     range of family planning services available to individuals \n     who cannot otherwise afford or gain ready access to them. He \n     authored legislation that improved services to families of \n     sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and encouraged expanded \n     research efforts. Legislation to support community efforts to \n     control venereal diseases and tuberculosis were shaped by \n     Senator Cranston. He authored several provisions of law \n     substantially increasing funding for AIDS research, \n     education, and public health activities.\n       He wrote the law that expanded and coordinated federal \n     research in arthritis, and he helped create the National \n     Institute on Aging. Totally separate from his role as a \n     federal legislator, he helped establish the private, non-\n     profit Alliance for Aging Research to spur research \n     scientists to find answers for the chronic disabling \n     conditions of aging, including Alzheimer's Disease.\n       His commitment to healthy aging was also personal. A \n     lifelong physical fitness buff and accomplished runner, he \n     set a world record for his age group in 1969, running the \n     100-yard dash in 12.6 seconds. He broke his own record three \n     years later running in the University of Pennsylvania Relays \n     at age 59.\n\n                  Rights for persons with disabilities\n\n       When Alan Cranston came to the Senate, disabled persons had \n     virtually no legal protection against unjust discrimination \n     and there had been little progress toward removing physical \n     barriers that excluded them from public buildings and \n     facilities. He was acutely aware of these injustices due to \n     crippling disabilities suffered by members of his immediate \n     family. He often characterized people with disabilities as \n     ``the one civil rights constituency any of us can be thrust \n     into without a moment's warning.'' He led efforts to enact \n     legislation in 1973 for the first time outlawing \n     discrimination in federally-funded programs and requiring \n     that federally-funded buildings be made accessible to \n     disabled individuals, and promoting the employment and \n     advancement of persons with disabilities by the federal \n     government and federal contractors. The sloping sidewalk\n\n[[Page S3837]]\n\n     curbs for wheelchairs on nearly every street in the nation \n     stem from Alan Cranston's early advocacy for disabled people.\n\n                         Children and families\n\n       Senator Cranston authored a rich body of legislative \n     reforms that humanized and vastly improved adoption \n     assistance, foster care, child custody and child care. He was \n     a leader in sponsoring child abuse and neglect prevention \n     laws and in investigating the abuse of children in \n     institutions.\n       He was responsible for extending the original authorization \n     of the Head Start pre-school education program. He authored \n     successful bills extending Medicaid coverage for prenatal \n     health care for low-income pregnant women. He co-wrote the \n     landmark L975 law designed to provide educational \n     opportunities for handicapped children, and he was a strong \n     supporter and developer of children's nutrition and feeding \n     programs throughout his time in the Senate.\n       Many private organizations honored Cranston for his work, \n     including the North American Conference on Adoptable \n     Children, which named him ``Child Advocate of the Year'' in \n     1979, the California Adoption Advocacy Network, the Child \n     Welfare League of America, the Day Care and Child Development \n     Council of America, the California Child Development \n     Administrators Association, and the JACKIE organization, \n     which cited ``his leadership in obtaining national adoption \n     and foster care reform.''\n\n                                Veterans\n\n       Though opposed to the Vietnam War, he was deeply \n     compassionate toward those who fought America's most \n     unpopular war. Able to separate the war from the warriors, he \n     was an early champion for the Vietnam veterans, especially \n     for improving health care in VA hospitals and clinics.\n       In his first year in the Senate, Alan Cranston was assigned \n     chairmanship of a Labor Committee subcommittee dealing with \n     veterans. He used that post to draw national attention to \n     inadequate and shocking conditions in VA hospitals, which \n     were overwhelmed by the returning wounded from the Vietnam \n     war. When a full Committee on Veterans Affairs was \n     established in the Senate, he chaired its subcommittee on \n     health and hospitals and later chaired the full committee for \n     a total of nine years.\n       Among a few highlights of this record: improvements in \n     compensation for service-connected disabled veterans, \n     education and training programs tailored to Vietnam-era \n     veterans, requirements for federal contractors to give \n     preference in hiring for Vietnam-era and disabled veterans, \n     and a long list of initiatives to improve health care in the \n     VA medical system.\n       Alan Cranston wrote the law that created a national network \n     of VA counseling facilities known as ``Vet Centers'' to aid \n     returning Vietnam veterans in coping with readjustment to \n     civilian society, and helping to identify and treat the \n     condition known as post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n       He was among the first to draw attention to the health \n     problems believed associated with exposure to Agent Orange \n     and he gave the VA specific authority to provide Vietnam \n     veterans with medical care for those conditions. He also \n     helped bring to light health problems of veterans who were \n     exposed to nuclear radiation as part of U.S. government \n     atomic testing in the 1940s and 50s, and he fought to allow \n     compensation for subsequent medical effects of the exposure.\n       For more than a decade he fought to allow veterans legal \n     rights to appeal VA decisions on claims for benefits and \n     ultimately succeeded in establishing the United States Court \n     of Veterans Appeals. His very last day in the Senate, Alan \n     Cranston was responsible for passage of three veterans bills: \n     Veterans Re-employment Rights, Veterans Health-Care Services, \n     and the Veterans Health Care Act.\n\n                                 Women\n\n       Another constant throughout the Cranston Senate career has \n     been his efforts aimed at eradicating sex discrimination and \n     providing equal opportunities for women.\n       He worked hard, both in the U.S. Congress and in the \n     California legislature, for passage and ratification of the \n     Equal Rights Amendment. He authored provisions of the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Act precluding discrimination in \n     hiring and retaining women employees and those who are \n     pregnant. On the Banking Committee he pioneered laws \n     prohibiting discrimination against women in obtaining credit \n     and benefitting from insurance policies.\n       He consistently championed women's access to health care \n     and reproductive health services. He was the Senate author of \n     the Freedom of Choice Act to codify into federal law the Roe \n     v. Wade court decision.\n\n\n                                Addenda\n\n       Any summary of the Cranston record would be incomplete \n     without also noting the following:\n       Senator Cranston helped lead the opposition in the U.S. \n     Senate to G. Harrold Carswell and Clement Haynsworth, both \n     nominated by President Richard Nixon to the Supreme Court. \n     Both nominations were defeated.\n       When Robert Bork was nominated to the Court, it was a vote \n     count taken by Democratic Whip Alan Cranston that first \n     showed the nomination could be overturn. Senator Cranston \n     skillfully used this information to persuade swing vote \n     Senators to reject the Bork nomination.\n       During the Carter Presidency, when Cranston had the \n     patronage power to recommend federal judicial appointments, \n     he instead established a bipartisan committee with the \n     California Bar Association to assist in screening candidates \n     based on merit. Under this system four women, four African-\n     Americans, two Latinos and one Asian were appointed to the \n     U.S. District Court in California. In addition, one African-\n     American, one woman, and one Latino were appointed as U.S. \n     Attorneys.\n       He long championed federal support for mass transit, \n     including the Surface Transit Act, which for the first time \n     opened up the Federal Highway Act to allow mass transit to \n     compete for federal funds on an equal basis with highways.\n       As Housing Subcommittee Chairman on the Banking Committee, \n     he lead efforts to pass the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1987, \n     the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, and the Housing and \n     Community Development Act of 1987 and then succeeded in \n     gaining enactment of the Cranston-Gonzalez National \n     Affordable Housing Act in October 1990, a landmark law that \n     set a new course for federal housing assistance, stressing \n     production of affordable housing units, improved FHA \n     insurance, elderly and handicapped housing expansion, special \n     housing for people with AIDS, and reform of public housing. \n     Passage of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 \n     culminated Senator Cranston's 24 years of major legislative \n     achievements steadily aimed at making housing more available \n     and fostering community economic growth.\n       He helped strengthen the Resources Conservation and \n     Recovery Act, the basic law which allows the federal \n     government to regulate hazardous waste material to insure \n     that it is safely managed.\n       He headed efforts in the Senate to break the filibuster \n     mounted against Labor Law Reform.\n       Over more than two decades, he provided diligent oversight \n     and direction for all federal volunteer programs, including \n     the Peace Corps, VISTA, the ACTION Agency, Foster \n     Grandparents, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Program.\n\n\n                           Post-Senate Career\n\n       From 1993 until his death just hours before the first day \n     of 2001, Alan Cranston pursued the opportunity afforded by \n     the end of the Cold War to abolish nuclear weapons. He worked \n     on the issue as Chairman of the Gorbachev Foundation, and \n     then as President of the Global Security Institute in San \n     Francisco, which he helped establish. An important \n     accomplishment of the Institute was to put together, with a \n     coalition of groups called Project Abolition, the Responsible \n     Security Appeal, which calls for action leading to the \n     elimination of all nuclear weapons. At Cranston's urging, \n     this document was signed by such notable people as Paul \n     Nitze, General Charles Horner, and former President Jimmy \n     Carter. Project Abolition, founded by Cranston, promises to \n     be the foundation for a wider nuclear abolition campaign in \n     the years ahead.\n       During the decade of the 1990s, he traveled to the Indian \n     Subcontinent, in Central Asia and elsewhere, working with \n     national leaders to accommodate peaceful change in the world, \n     especially the development of pluralistic, free societies in \n     the former Soviet Union. In the very last years of his life, \n     he was more often at home, in the sprawling Spanish Colonial \n     style residence in Los Altos Hills, where he was surrounded \n     by three generations of his family. He assembled a \n     magnificent library encompassing a wide range of California, \n     American and International history and politics, in thousands \n     of books, artworks, memorabilia and photographs. To this \n     library would come many friends, political allies old and \n     new, former staff and an occasional journalist intent on an \n     interview. Former Senator Cranston made this assessment of \n     his priorities in one interview, just months before his \n     death:\n       ``I am an abolitionist on two fronts. I believe we have to \n     abolish nuclear weapons before they abolish us, and I think \n     we have to eliminate the incredibly important and significant \n     role of money in politics before we're going to have our \n     democracy working as it should work. If we blow ourselves up \n     in a nuclear war, no other issue, no matter how important it \n     may seem to be, is going to matter. And until we get money \n     out of politics, money is going to affect every issue that \n     comes along, often adversely to the interest of the public. \n     So let's abolish both.''\n       Years earlier, while preparing to retire from the United \n     States Senate, he expressed gratitude for the opportunities \n     to make a difference on behalf of California and people \n     throughout the world:\n       ``It has been a privilege I have cherished and for which I \n     can never adequately thank the people of California. It is my \n     hope that many of the accomplishments achieved over these \n     past 24 years in the areas of world peace, the environment, \n     and in the effort to secure a better quality of life for \n     millions of Americans will survive and serve as the basis of \n     continued progress by others in behalf of future \n     generations.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n  February 6, 2001, 2:00 pm, Memorial Tribute to Alan Cranston, U.S. \nSenator 1969--1993, Hart Senate Office Building, Room 902, Washington, \n                                  D.C.\n\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. On behalf of the sponsors, \n     Senators Cleland, Simpson, Rockefeller, Kennedy, Feinstein, \n     and Boxer, welcome to this Memorial Tribute to Senator Alan \n     Cranston. At the outset, I want to express our appreciation \n     to the U.S. Army\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\n     Strings for their Prelude musical offerings today. Also, \n     thanks to C-Span for covering this event. This turnout today \n     is itself a wonderful testimonial to the work of this man of \n     the Senate, Alan Cranston, and we are absolutely delighted \n     that his family has journeyed here from California to share \n     in this Tribute--his son, Kim, and daughter-in-law Colette, \n     and their child and Alan's granddaughter, Evan, who graces \n     the program cover with Alan, and we are so happy that Alan's \n     wonderful, 91-year-old sister, R.E., who wrote a biography \n     about Alan, is with us as well.\n       During his 24 years as a Senator, Alan Cranston did much to \n     better the lives of the people of his state and the people of \n     this country and all countries. You will hear much about \n     those efforts and achievements today. In my role, I am a \n     proxy for the scores of staff who worked for Alan Cranston \n     over his Senate career. I began in March 1969, almost at the \n     beginning, and stayed 21 and a half years. I've always \n     thought that one could tell a great deal about the kind of \n     person someone was by how those who worked most closely with \n     him felt about him. I think it speaks volumes about Alan \n     Cranston--and Alan is the way he asked his staff always to \n     refer to him--that so many worked with him for so long. In \n     fact, five worked for him for his full 24 years; two others \n     worked more than 20 years; five others for 15 years or more, \n     and three or four for 10 or more years. I doubt that any \n     Senator has surpassed that record for staff loyalty and staff \n     satisfaction.\n       Alan was wonderful to work for and with. He was not a \n     saint, of course, but he was a gentlemen, through and \n     through. He gave respect to get respect. To me he was a \n     mentor, a teacher, an inspiration, and a friend. I loved him. \n     I will always remember him. And when I do, I will think back \n     to our last meeting--at dinner on November 13. He was strong \n     and vibrant and full of passionate commitment to the cause of \n     the elimination of nuclear weapons. I remember our hugging \n     goodbye. It was a great hug, but I wish I had held on a \n     littler longer.\n       A few announcements before we get to our speakers: First of \n     all, I want to remind each of you to please sign one of the \n     guest books in the lobby before you leave. I hope you've each \n     gotten a program. If not, you can pick one up on the way out. \n     And also on the way out, there is a paper on Senator \n     Cranston's legislative legacy in the Senate.\n       Before I introduce our first speaker, I want to note the \n     presence here--now or expected--in addition to those who will \n     speak, of many distinguished members of the Senate and House: \n     Senator Rockefeller, who is one of our sponsors; Senator \n     Lugar, Senator Leahy, Senator Dodd, Senator Bingaman, Senator \n     Sarbanes, Senator Dorgan, former Senator DeConcini, and \n     Representatives Waxman, Filner, Roybal, Capps, and Harmon. \n     Also with us is former Senator Harris Wofford, who spoke so \n     eloquently at the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco on January \n     16, and Mark Schneider, former Director of the Peace Corps, \n     which Harris Wofford was instrumental in starting, in which \n     Senator Dodd served as a volunteer in Central America, and in \n     which Alan Cranston believed so deeply. We are also honored \n     to have the presence of three Cabinet members, all from \n     California--Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta, \n     Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman, and Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs Tony Principi.\n       Our first speaker has timed it impeccably. (Laughter.) Our \n     first speaker is, fittingly, the lead sponsor of today's \n     tribute. Simply put, Alan Cranston loved Max Cleland--as do \n     I. They first met in 1969, and I'm sure Senator Cleland will \n     talk about that. Alan was truly overjoyed at Max's election \n     to the Senate in 1996. I want to express my gratitude to Max \n     personally and to his staff, Bill Johnstone, Farrar Johnston, \n     and Andy VanLandingham, for all of their help with the \n     arrangements for this event.\n       And now our first speaker, Senator Max Cleland of Georgia. \n     (Applause.)\n       Senator Max Cleland. Thank you all very much and thank you \n     Jon Steinberg for being uncharacteristically brief. \n     (Laughter.)\n       I see so many of my colleagues here. Really my first real \n     exposure to the United States Senate came about because Alan \n     Cranston cared. He was an unusual individual. I visited the \n     Dirksen Building here for the first time in December of 1969. \n     I was still basically a patient in the VA hospital system \n     when I was asked to appear before something called the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Veterans' Affairs about how the VA was \n     handling returning Vietnam war veterans. That meeting was \n     chaired by a tall, lean freshman California senator named \n     Alan Cranston. I really didn't know him then, but it became \n     the start of a three-decade friendship.\n       In 1974, I ran unsuccessfully for Lieutenant Governor in \n     Georgia, and, other than my own priority for my own race, my \n     second priority in the whole world in terms of politics was \n     to make sure Alan Cranston got reelected in 1974. Actually, \n     Alan was very kind to me, and brought me out to California, \n     and I got a chance to campaign for him and kind of clear out \n     some of the cobwebs that I had in my own mind about politics \n     and about life. We campaigned together and I found him just \n     as inspiring and invigorating in that campaign as when I had \n     met him in '69.\n       It's amazing how life works. Little did I know that, as \n     someone from Georgia, someone from California would be \n     critical in my continued service in public life. I did lose \n     my race for lieutenant governor in 1974 and, therefore, was \n     unemployed. Christmas Eve, 1974, I called my friend Jonathan \n     Steinberg, and said ``I just wanted to wish you the happiest \n     of holidays'' and said ``by the way, if you're looking for \n     anybody who wants to work, I'm available.'' He said, ``are \n     you serious?'' And I said ``I am deadly serious.'' Well, it \n     was Alan Cranston that made it possible for me to get a \n     $12,500-a-year job on the staff of the Senate Veterans' \n     Affairs Committee in the spring of 1975. That was more money \n     than I'd ever made in my whole entire life.\n       I was there a couple of years and, in the summer of 1976, \n     when a young man from Georgia named Jimmy Carter seemed like \n     he was destined to win the Democratic primary, Alan Cranston \n     talked to me and said ``I think you ought to be the new head \n     of the Veterans' Administration.'' That scared me to death. I \n     said, ``well, if you really think I can do it, let's go for \n     it.'' He talked to Senator Nunn and talked to Senator \n     Talmadge. By the August convention of the American Legion, a \n     convention in Seattle, Senator Cranston pulled Jimmy Carter \n     aside and said ``I have two requests.'' I don't know what the \n     other one was, but he said ``the second one is to make Max \n     Cleland head of the VA.'' And Jimmy Carter replied, ``I love \n     Max Cleland.''\n       So President Carter wound up in January 1977 as President \n     of the United States, and Alan Cranston wound up as Chairman \n     of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I only had two \n     friends in Washington; one was President, and the other was \n     Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. (Laughter.) So I \n     was nominated in March of 1977, as the youngest head of the \n     Veterans' Administration, and, thanks to Alan Cranston, I was \n     confirmed in record time, and took over that agency, with \n     really the support of Jon Steinberg and Alan. They were my \n     constant guides, and sometimes spurs, and encouraged me all \n     the way.\n       One of the things I'm proudest of that we were able to do, \n     is put together something called the Vet Center Program. Alan \n     Cranston, since 1971, had been introducing in the Senate \n     something called psychological readjustment counseling for \n     Vietnam veterans and their families. It would usually pass \n     the Senate, die in the House, and had no Presidential \n     support; but I was able to talk to President Carter, we were \n     able to put the administration behind this legislation. It \n     passed, and we were able to sign it into law, and I put \n     together one of the very first Vet Centers in 1980 in Van \n     Nuys, California. Now, there are some 200 scattered around \n     the country. Some three-and-a-half million veterans and their \n     families have received counseling through this program, and \n     Alan Cranston was basically responsible.\n       Let me just say that, in 1973, he helped to pass \n     legislation that helped the disabled in this country, that \n     required that federally-funded buildings be made accessible, \n     that promoted the hiring and advancement of people with \n     disabilities by the Federal government. He established \n     something called the Architectural and Transportation \n     Barriers Compliance Board, which has the responsibility for \n     setting standards for accessibility and for assisting and \n     forcing compliance with accessibility laws. I was named to \n     that Board by President Carter in 1979.\n       Throughout the remainder of the 70s, Alan worked to revamp \n     federally-assisted state voc-rehab programs, sponsoring laws \n     that gave priority to the most seriously disabled. In 1980, \n     he sponsored legislation to make some improvements in that \n     program at the VA, and in 1990 he was a leading cosponsor of \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act, which has been a pioneer \n     piece of legislation, as we all know.\n       I just want you to know that I wouldn't be in the United \n     States Senate, I wouldn't have ever been head of the \n     Veterans' Administration, without the mild-mannered \n     distinguished gentleman from the great state of California. I \n     mourn his passing, and we will miss him. God bless you. \n     (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you very much, Max. \n     Speaking of the ADA, I see Senator Harkin here. We welcome \n     you.\n       Alan referred to our next speaker as his best friend on the \n     Republican side. They served together as their respective \n     party leaders on the Veterans' Affairs Committee and as \n     Assistant Floor Leaders, or Whips, as they were also called. \n     Another tall, lanky, hairline-challenged Alan, former Senator \n     Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming.\n       Senator Alan K. Simpson. Jonathan and former colleagues and \n     friends and family, Kim, Colette, Evan, and Eleanor, and \n     Cabinet members, including one Norm Mineta, who I met at the \n     age of 12 in the war relocation center at Hart Mountain. He \n     was behind wire, I wasn't, and I should have been and he \n     shouldn't have. (Laughter.) But, anyway, it's a long, \n     wonderful friendship, with a guy I love, and I'm so damn \n     proud of you, pal, even when you did that when you were in \n     Boy Scouts, I'll never forget. (Laughter.)\n       Well, it's a great honor and privilege to honor my old \n     friend. To be asked is very, very moving to me, and I want to \n     share just a few memories and thoughts about a very special \n     friend. I came to the Senate in '79. Al was Chairman of the \n     Veterans' Affairs Committee, and that's when I first met Max. \n     I said, ``Max, you have a wonderful job there, Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs; veterans never pick on each other--ha, ha, \n     ha.'' Well, anyway, it was an interesting time, Max, wasn't \n     it? Well, enough of that. Butch is here and he would correct \n     anything that I said. But it fell to my pleasant luck to soon \n     become the ranking member in 1980, the Reagan Administration. \n     Well, I knew who Al was, I knew of\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\n     his journalistic prowess, of his warning to his countrymen \n     about Adolf Hitler, and the two versions of ``Mein Kampf'', \n     one for domestic consumption and one for the naive and the \n     unwary, and Alan was sending out the alert. I knew of his \n     athletic achievements and his stamina, and I very soon \n     learned of his powerful loyalty to America's veterans.\n       He was so cordial to me, and his staff, so very helpful to \n     this new, pea-green freshman. And what a staff it was: Jon \n     Steinberg, Ed Scott, Bill Brew, Babette Polzer. Well, I \n     sought their counsel, and plumbed their expertise. Al would \n     occasionally check up on me, ``how are you? Can we be of more \n     help?'' I said, ``I need a lot more help.'' But then I built \n     my own staff. And, oh, to all of you who will be deprived of \n     staff one day. Staff deprivation is a serious issue \n     (laughter); it is the most shocking of the transitions \n     (laughter), and my wife, a beautiful woman of 46 years, she \n     said ``Alan, your staff is gone, you have no staff, they are \n     not here, and I am not one of your staff.'' (Laughter.) But, \n     there was Biblical precedent for this, you look it up in the \n     Good Book, it says, ``Jacob died leaning on his staff''. \n     (Laughter.) Now, so along came Ken Bergquist and one Tony \n     Principi, in those early years. Tony seems to have moved \n     along nicely in life, a wonderful human being with rare \n     gifts, who has been bestowed again on the veterans and the \n     people of this country. He will be serving very wisely and \n     very well as Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and I'm damn \n     proud of you, too, pal.\n       Tom Harvey then came on. But Tony and Jon Steinberg became \n     a very dynamic duo, they worked with Tom Harvey in those \n     early years. And, as I say then, in '80, I became in the \n     majority, and the first call I received after the election \n     was from Al Cranston. Of course, who else? In that cheery \n     voice, he said ``congratulations, Mr. Chairman.'' Well, I \n     thought, the power, I felt the surge . . . (laughter) . . . \n     and I thought how like him to do that. Well, we cranked out \n     some good legislation together. With Sonny here, another dear \n     friend on the other side of the aisle, and John Paul \n     Hammerschmidt, then Bob Stump, those were men of my faith, my \n     political faith. And Sonny used to sit next to me and say: \n     ``Don't do it pal. I know what you're going to do. Just shut \n     up, won't you?'' (Laughter.) I know we're not going to let \n     that get away now, Sonny.\n       Anyway, the changing of the guard went well. The only hitch \n     was that all of the veterans organizations had selected \n     National Commanders and Officers from California. Well, you \n     know how that goes. And now their guy was gone, and the \n     cowboy from Wyoming was in the saddle. Well that was very \n     much fun to watch, I loved it. It was painful for Jonathan, \n     but I loved it. And we were able to, when I took over, we \n     were able to get Steinberg's statutory language down to one \n     paragraph in one page. We never let him go two pages with one \n     paragraph. And he had a tendency to do that.\n       Then, in 1984, I was honored to become the Assistant \n     Majority Leader, and who was the Assistant Minority Leader? \n     Al Cranston. We worked closely together. We enjoyed each \n     other, we trusted each other. We gave good support and \n     counsel to Bob Dole and George Mitchell, and we thought it \n     was a silly idea, but that we oughta make things work. And \n     even when Al was running for President, imagine me, being the \n     ranking member of a committee with Kennedy and Hart and \n     Cranston, all three of them running for President. I went \n     to them and I said ``you cannot use these chores of mine \n     for your great cycle, and I won't ever use the committee \n     to embarrass you'' That's the kind of friendship I had \n     with Ted, with Al, with Gary, it was very special, and it \n     can be that way again. I urge it upon you all. Anyway, he \n     ran for President, he gave it his all, as he did in every \n     phase of his life, but the brass ring eluded, eluded his \n     grip, and he came back to his Senate home, his pride \n     intact. The only time I really, really flustered him, I \n     was flush with power. Now a member of the majority, the \n     fever of the majority burned in my bosom like a hot \n     Gospel. I ambled over to his offices, his spacious \n     offices, great view, two fireplaces, couches, cozy chairs, \n     comfort, oh, and I said ``Al, yes I think this will do \n     very nicely [(laughter)] for my new Whip office.'' And the \n     blood drained from his face. And I said: ``No, no, just \n     kidding, Al. You represent millions, I represent \n     thousands. But when the wind shifts around here, and you \n     Dems have the horses, don't let `em come around my office \n     with a tape measure and some greedy looking guy with a \n     clipboard.'' And he said, ``it's a deal.'' And we had a \n     handshake. Then the time came, and no one ever darkened my \n     door, no unworthies with tape measures ever came to see \n     me.\n       So, we legislated together, we argued, we collaborated, we \n     joshed and laughed with each other, we took pleasure in \n     confusing people. Same first name, same hairstyle; ``hairing \n     impaired'' is what we called it in political correctness. \n     Same gaunt, emaciated frame. Same gait, same grin. And, \n     people would come up to me and say, ``I just think the world \n     of you and you ran for President, and your views on the \n     environment and nuclear freeze thrill me to death.'' \n     (Laughter.) And I'd say, ``No, no; I'm Al Simpson,'' and \n     they'd say ``Not you!'' (Laughter.) And Al said he got that \n     in reverse about, you know, twice a month, too, so we would \n     compare that, and our constituents were often not in \n     alignment, you might imagine. But the best one, though, and \n     then I'm going to stop: Cheney, Gulf War, Secretary of \n     Defense, he called and he said, ``we're going over to a game \n     in Baltimore; bring Ann'', and we went over to the game, and \n     53,000 Oriole fans, ``Hey Cheney, we love ya! Great stuff!'' \n     You know, I said ``Boy, this is getting bad in here.'' We \n     left in the seventh inning and went back down through the \n     bowels, where all the guys, the beer drinkers and the cigar \n     smokers, were, and they went ``Hey, Cheney, baby, you're all \n     right--we love ya!'' And I turned to him and I said, ``You \n     know, they never treated you like this in Casper.'' And a guy \n     from the audience said ``Hey, I know the big guy, too; that's \n     Al Cranston!'' (Laughter.) So, I can assure you he loved that \n     story (laughter), when I told him that.\n       Well, he handled life well. Stuck to his guns, worked \n     through pain, met life full in the face, as if in a track \n     meet, headed for the tape, and he loved that thrill. Many \n     would have buckled; not Al. The pain of loss of the \n     Presidency, the pain of loss of family members, the pain of \n     loss of Norma to Parkinson's Disease that withered her, that \n     withered their union. The pain of cancer, the pain of \n     accusation and assault by the media, the pain from his peers \n     at that time; we talked about that, oh yes we did, of that \n     sense of being singled out, very painful.\n       And he left the Senate and went on to vital other things, \n     and meaningful things in his life, undaunted, head high, \n     smile on his face, fire in the belly, finishing the course \n     laid out. And we knew on one unknown day he would be taken \n     from us. And we shall miss him. But not mourn him. For he was \n     a man of vigor and joy and vision. And my life is much richer \n     for having shared a significant piece of it with Alan \n     Cranston. A race well run, my old friend. God rest his soul. \n     (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Senator Simpson, we greatly \n     appreciate your having rearranged your schedule to come down \n     here from New York and we know you have to leave to go back \n     there.\n       We're going to show a very short film now, it's only two or \n     three minutes, but we thought we ought to have Alan with us.\n\n                                  Film\n\n       Narrator. Moscow, Winter, 1998.\n       Voice. Alan, you don't wear a coat in the Russian winter?\n       Alan Cranston. I don't believe in them.\n       Voice. He doesn't believe in them. It's like John Kennedy, \n     it's . . .\n       Narrator. That was Alan in retirement. For most people, a \n     time to slow down. But at 84, as he approached the Russian \n     Duma, Alan Cranston was a man on a lifelong mission.\n       Alan Cranston. I got into all this way back shortly after \n     Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I met Albert Einstein. He told me, as \n     he told others, that the whole human race could be wiped out \n     by nuclear weapons. I've been working on it ever since.\n       Narrator. And forty years later, after trillions had been \n     spent on weapons of mass destruction, Alan emerged with a \n     collection of allies that astonished even him.\n       Alan Cranston. One very dramatic moment, when Lee Butler, \n     who had command of all of our nuclear weapons, gave his first \n     public address at the State of the World Forum, in San \n     Francisco, revealing the concerns he had developed about the \n     whole deterrence policy and the ongoing dangers from reliance \n     on nuclear weapons. And, as he spoke, presiding right next to \n     him was Mikhail Gorbachev, the leader of the country that we \n     would have destroyed. At the very end of this remarkable \n     speech, Gorbachev and Butler stood up and embraced each \n     other. That was a very dramatic moment.\n       Two weeks ago, General Butler and I made public a statement \n     by 48 past and present heads of state and some 75 other \n     national leaders from 48 nations, advocating specific steps \n     towards abolition. Despite these and other favorable \n     developments, there is significant doubt, skepticism, \n     cynicism, and outright opposition to much of this. So, \n     plainly, there is much to do, and we have a lot of hard \n     thinking to do about what is in order. But let me say in \n     closing that I do not believe that we need to wait, and I do \n     not believe that we can afford to wait, until the end of the \n     next century, to fulfill the obligation of our generation to \n     all generations that preceded us and all generations that \n     hopefully will follow us, to deal with the threat to all life \n     that exists and is implicit in nuclear weapons. Thank you.\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. That film that was pulled \n     together from a larger documentary by George Crile, a former \n     CBS producer, who has developed documentaries on nuclear arms \n     for ``60 Minutes'' and CNN. We are indebted to him and the \n     Global Security Institute, of which Alan Cranston was \n     President, for making that film available to us.\n       And now we will go a little bit out of order, and hear from \n     one of this event's sponsors, the Senior Senator from \n     California, whose work with Alan Cranston goes back many, \n     many years and who, among many other achievements, carried on \n     successfully with some very important environmental \n     initiatives that Senator Cranston began.\n       Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. (Applause.)\n       Senator Dianne Feinstein. Thank you very much. Thank you. \n     It's really a great honor and a privilege to be here. I just \n     want to recognize two members of the California House \n     delegation that came in. First is Lois Capps, from the Santa \n     Barbara area, and Jane Harmon, from the southern Los Angeles \n     area. And I'm not sure whether Paul Wellstone and Jeff \n     Bingaman were introduced earlier, but I want everybody to \n     know that they're here, too.\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n       Alan Simpson is a hard act to follow, there's no question \n     about that. I look at life this way: That we're here but for \n     an instant in an eternity. No one really knows when that \n     instant is over, and the only thing that really matters is \n     what we do with that instant. Because, when it's over, \n     there's nothing we can take with us other than the legacy, \n     leave behind. Alan Cranston first came into my life in 1962, \n     and that's when I first met his sister, R.E., and it was in \n     his campaign for State Controller; believe it or not, it was \n     the first campaign for which I ever volunteered, and so I've \n     always kind of taken a special interest in a lot of his \n     achievements. From that point on, I found this former long \n     distance runner really to be a tireless workhorse for all \n     Californians, and, as a matter of fact, for all Americans. \n     This was a man who really loved the intricacies of the \n     legislative process. He was the consummate vote counter. He \n     possessed the uncanny ability to assess competing camps, to \n     quickly find where votes would fall and determine whether the \n     best course of action was to fight or compromise. \n     Unfortunately, neither my friend Barbara Boxer nor I really \n     had an opportunity to work with him in his nearly quarter of \n     a century here in the Senate, but I think these traits are \n     legendary, I think they're known by all.\n       Alan Cranston yielded a whole array of wonderful \n     accomplishments, but I want to just concentrate today on a \n     few things in the environment. And, in the true sprit of the \n     legendary Californian conservationist John Muir, Alan \n     Cranston became a very passionate architect of measures to \n     preserve our God-given natural treasures. Alan Cranston \n     was the original author of something called the Desert \n     Protection Act. Shortly after I won in 1993, and knew I \n     was coming to Washington, the phone rang, and Alan said, \n     ``Would you be willing to take over the effort to pass a \n     Desert Protection Act?'' And I said, ``Of course.'' And we \n     came back and we revised the language, rewrote the bill \n     somewhat, changed some of the concepts, and moved it \n     ahead. But, the basic originator of this, let there be no \n     doubt, was Alan Cranston. The bill was filibustered, but \n     we were lucky in the Senate, we got it through, and it \n     became a reality in 1994. And the legislation created the \n     largest park and wilderness designation in our nation. \n     Over six million acres, two new National Parks, Death \n     Valley and Joshua Tree, and one National Preserve, the \n     East Mojave. And so because of that, we have actually \n     protected, well I said six, but it's actually closer to \n     seven million acres of pristine California desert \n     wilderness for all time. Thank you, Alan Cranston.\n       He was also the lead sponsor of legislation which \n     established the Golden Gate and the Santa Monica National \n     Recreation Area, the Channel Islands National Park, a 48,000 \n     acre addition to the Redwoods National Park, and the \n     inclusion of Mineral King into the Sequoia National Park. He \n     also sponsored twelve different wilderness bills that became \n     law between 1969 and 1982. He helped close Death Valley \n     National Monument to open-pit mining. He helped craft the \n     Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and \n     with just two bills, on which he teamed with the late and \n     wondrous Phillip Burton of San Francisco, the Omnibus Parks \n     Act of 1978, and the Alaska Lands Act of 1980, as much \n     acreage was placed under federal protection as all the park \n     lands created earlier in the twentieth century combined.\n       So, I can truthfully say, without his service, America \n     would have been a different, and certainly a poorer place, in \n     terms of our environment and the quality of life for many of \n     our citizens. Alan Cranston leaves a legacy of preservation \n     that will be remembered and enjoyed and certainly by his \n     beautiful seven-year granddaughter Evan, who is here today. \n     And I think, for my granddaughter, for Barbara's grandson, \n     and for all of us, who really look at this land and want to \n     do what we can to protect it.\n       This was a very special Californian. And life wasn't always \n     easy for Alan, either. But I think his ability to keep his \n     eye on the goal, to establish what he established, whether it \n     was from the translation of Mein Kampf, to his work against \n     nuclear devastation, to his environmental record, Alan \n     Cranston truly lived that instant in eternity, and he has \n     truly left us a good legacy. Thank you very much. (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. I'm sure there are others that I \n     failed to mention. I thank Senator Feinstein. I know that \n     Senator Reid is also here, and again I apologize if I missed \n     anyone.\n       No Senator has worked on more causes closer to Alan \n     Cranston's heart and soul than has Senator Edward M. Kennedy. \n     I am particularly grateful to him, because it was through his \n     chief counsel, Jim Flug, who is also here today, that I was \n     introduced to and came to work for Alan in 1969. Senator \n     Cranston and Senator Kennedy served together for 12 years on \n     the Labor and Human Resources Committee, which Senator \n     Kennedy chaired from 1987 to 1995 and again for 17 days this \n     year.\n       Our next speaker, Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts. \n     (Applause.)\n       Senator Edward M. Kennedy. Thank you, Jonathan. To Kim, and \n     Colette, and Evan, and R.E.--let me begin by saying that I \n     loved Alan Cranston too. I will never forget the 24 years of \n     friendship and leadership and achievement with which he \n     graced the Senate and the nation. And so it's a special \n     privilege and honor for me to be part of this tribute today. \n     Alan is profoundly missed by his family and friends, his \n     colleagues in the Congress, and by all those around the world \n     who pursue the great goals of hope and progress and peace.\n       I must say--I grew up thinking Cranston was a city in Rhode \n     Island. But Alan taught each of us that Cranston stands for \n     something else as well--the very best in public service.\n       Alan loved to lead behind the scenes--for 14 of those 24 \n     Senate years with us, he was our Democratic whip, and he \n     wrote the book about the job. In those great years, we used \n     to tease Alan about the position, because so few people \n     outside Congress knew what it involved. Since Alan was from \n     California, a lot of people thought the Minority Whip was \n     the name of a Leather Bar in Malibu. (Laughter.)\n       But seriously, Alan was a giant of his day on many issues, \n     and his concern for social justice made him a leader on them \n     all. We served together for many years on the Labor Committee \n     and especially the Health Subcommittee, and his insights were \n     indispensable. I always felt that if we'd had another Alan \n     Cranston or two in those years, we'd have actually passed our \n     Health Security Act, and made health care the basic right for \n     all that it ought to be, instead of just an expensive \n     privilege for the few.\n       Perhaps the greatest legacy that Alan left us was his able \n     and tireless work for democracy and world peace. Every \n     village in the world is closer to that goal today because of \n     Alan. No one in the Senate fought harder or more effectively \n     for our nuclear weapons freeze in the 1980's, or for nuclear \n     arms control. His hope for a nuclear-free future still \n     represents the highest aspiration of millions--even \n     billions--throughout the world.\n       I also recall Alan's pioneering efforts to press for Senate \n     action to end the war in Vietnam, and his equally able \n     leadership for civil rights at home and human rights around \n     the world. We know how deeply he felt about injustice to \n     anyone anywhere. And his leadership in the battle against \n     apartheid in South Africa was indispensable.\n       Throughout his brilliant career, the causes of civil rights \n     and human rights were central to Alan's being and his \n     mission--and America and the world are better off today \n     because Alan Cranston passed this way.\n       A key part of all his achievements was his unique ability \n     to translate his ideals into practical legislation. Few if \n     any Senators have been as skilled as Alan in the art of \n     constructive legislative compromise that fairly leads to \n     progress for the nation.\n       He was a vigorous supporter of the Peace Corps, a strong \n     overseer of its performance, and a brilliant advocate for all \n     the Peace Corps Volunteers. He was a champion for health \n     coverage for returning Volunteers, and one of the first to \n     understand that good health coverage had to include mental \n     health services as well.\n       In many ways, his first love was the Peace Corps, and I \n     know that President Kennedy would have been very proud of \n     him. Even before he came to the Senate, he had his first \n     contact with the Corps, as a consultant to Sargent Shriver. \n     As Alan often said, he became involved because he was so \n     inspired by my brother's vision of a world where Americans of \n     all ages could work side-by-side with peoples throughout the \n     world to put an end to poverty.\n       Because of Alan, the Peace Corps today is thriving as never \n     before--free of the partisan tensions that divide us on other \n     issues--spreading international understanding of Alan's and \n     America's best ideals--educating new generations of young \n     Americans about our common heritage as travelers on spaceship \n     earth--teaching us about the beauty, the richness, and the \n     diversity of other peoples, other languages, other cultures \n     and about the enduring importance of the greatest pursuit of \n     all--the pursuit of peace.\n       Near the end of John Bunyan's ``Pilgrim's Progress,'' there \n     is a passage that tells of the death of Valiant:\n       ``Then, he said, I am going to my Father's. And though with \n     great difficulty I am got hither, yet now I do not regret me \n     of all the trouble I have been at to arrive where I am. My \n     sword I give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage, \n     and my courage and skill to him that can get it. My marks and \n     scars I carry with me, to be a witness for me, that I have \n     fought his battle who now will be my rewarder.\n       ``When the day that he must go hence was come, many \n     accompanied him to the riverside, into which as he went, he \n     said, `Death, where is thy sting?' and as he went down \n     deeper, he said, `Grave, where is thy victory?' So he passed \n     over, and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other \n     side.''\n       We loved you, Alan. We miss you. And we always will. \n     (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you, Senator.\n       Our next speaker was elected to the Senate seat that Alan \n     occupied when he retired in 1993. She and Senator Cranston \n     collaborated on many matters while she served in the House of \n     Representatives, and she authored with Senator Feinstein a \n     lovely resolution of tribute to Senator Cranston that was \n     adopted by the Senate on January 22. On behalf of Alan's \n     family and his extended family and all his friends, we \n     express our gratitude for this most gracious action.\n       Senator Barbara Boxer of California. (Applause.)\n       Senator Barbara Boxer. Thank you. To Alan's family, \n     beautiful family, and to my dear colleagues who are here, it \n     certainly has been my honor for the past eight years to serve \n     in the seat that was held by Alan Cranston for 24 years.\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n       Alan was a deeply caring human being and he cared even for \n     those whose distant cries were not always heard in \n     Washington.\n       From civil rights to arms control, from cleaning up the \n     environment to improving the lives of our nation's veterans--\n     Alan's work knew no geographic boundaries. But, sometimes \n     Alan's legacy on women's rights gets overlooked and that is \n     what I'm going to speak about today.\n       From his earliest days in the Senate, Alan made improving \n     the lives of women a priority. In 1969, he supported the \n     Equal Rights Amendment. Remember the ERA. It failed. But, in \n     1972 he became a proud cosponsor again of the ERA, and it \n     passed. But he didn't stop there--he wrote letters and he got \n     on the phone to California legislators considering the \n     measure, urging their support, and his work paid off and \n     California ratified it that same year. Unfortunately, not all \n     the states followed suit. But Alan did not stop his advocacy. \n     He continued over the next decade to push for the Amendment's \n     ratification and when time ran out, he cosponsored another \n     ERA in 1983 and another one in 1985, even before he knew he \n     was going to have a granddaughter. Alan would not give up.\n       He worked to eliminate gender discrimination in the \n     workplace. He was the principal author of the Equal \n     Employment Opportunity Act Amendments of 1972, which extended \n     protections against gender discrimination to federal \n     employees in the workplace. And he was the very first member \n     of Congress to introduce legislation aimed at eliminating \n     wage discrimination in the federal workplace.\n       Alan understood the challenges faced by working mothers. He \n     worked to provide child care for this nation's working \n     families, introducing some of the first ever legislation to \n     provide care both before and after school. He knew that many \n     kids were without adult supervision, and I was so proud when \n     under the Clinton Administration, we saw after-school funding \n     increase from $1 million in 1997 to $845 million in 2001. \n     Alan, you laid the ground work for that.\n       He also worked tirelessly to protect a women's right to \n     choose, authoring the Freedom of Choice Act to codify Roe v. \n     Wade. I proudly carry that bill now. He pushed for increased \n     access to family planning services for low-income women and \n     teenagers, and fought to provide medical care to low-income \n     pregnant women, who otherwise would have been left without it \n     and would not have had healthy babies.\n       And he didn't stop there. He sought to level the financial \n     playing field for women, pushing for laws prohibiting \n     discrimination against women trying to obtain credit. And we \n     forget today when we open our mailboxes and we keep getting \n     all these applications for credit cards, there was a time \n     when a woman could not get any credit. We thank you, Alan, \n     although we have to restrain ourselves now and then. We \n     appreciate the work you did.\n       Alan was responsible for the first appointment of a woman \n     to the federal court bench in California. I've personally, \n     and I know Dianne, we've recommended many women; five of \n     those that I recommended to President Clinton were nominated \n     and confirmed. Alan laid that ground work too.\n       An advocate for equal education for young women, he fought \n     hard for Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, and \n     you know what that is, equal opportunity for our children, \n     for our girls in athletics.\n       And the list goes on and I will stop there with it, because \n     it could go on and on. But I stand before you today, as a \n     Senator who is carrying on the progressive work of Alan \n     Cranston. His belief that women are equal has borne fruit.\n       If you look around today in the Senate, there are 13 women \n     Senators from both parties. That's just in this building. \n     Next door--and we have a couple here--there are 61 women in \n     the House. We are doing better now, but as my friend Barbara \n     Mikulski often says, it takes the ``Sir Galahads,'' to get us \n     there, and Alan was definitely a Sir Galahad.\n       I'm just going to tell you one quick personal story, and \n     then I'll end. Alan decided to retire, I ran for the seat and \n     won the seat, and about a year later, he made an appointment \n     to come to see me. Now, I know this, the family must know \n     this, but unlike the Whip's office, which someone else must \n     have decorated, Alan's personal office here in the Hart \n     building was not the most beautiful place, because this was \n     not important to Alan. It was dark; it was dark leather and \n     dark walls and the blinds were drawn, and that was it. Alan \n     just saw it as a place to work--files all over the floor. So \n     when I got into the office, I said: ``Let's brighten it up. \n     Let's bring California.'' And I ordered all of these green \n     plants, and we opened up all the shades and we painted the \n     walls peach and we got peach and green fabrics, and I mean, \n     it was different. So I thought, you know, Alan was coming to \n     see me about arms control, but I was excited that he was \n     going to see what had happened to his office. And he came in \n     and he sat down, and he sat there and his first thing is, \n     ``You've got to be more aggressive on arms control.'' Now \n     that's the first time anyone ever told me to be more \n     aggressive on anything. (Laughter.) But he started to lecture \n     me and, you know, time went on, it was an hour, he still \n     hadn't said a thing about the room. So, finally, I got up my \n     courage, and I said, ``So Alan, what do you think of the \n     office?'' And he looked around, and he looked around, and he \n     said, ``You moved my desk.'' (Laughter.) That was it.\n       Alan said about his role as Senator, and I quote him, when \n     he retired: ``It has been a privilege I have cherished and \n     for which I can never adequately thank the people of \n     California.'' Let me take this moment on behalf of the people \n     of California to say to Alan Cranston thank you and your work \n     lives on. (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you very much, Senator \n     Boxer, and thank you for being with us so long. I couldn't \n     help but note when you talked about women and forging the way \n     for women, that the U.S. Army Strings that played at the \n     beginning of our ceremony today was composed of four women \n     from the U.S. Army. And no men.\n       I want also to acknowledge the presence here of Senator \n     Daniel Akaka, of the Democratic Leader, Senator Tom Daschle, \n     and of Senator Hollings of South Carolina. We appreciate \n     their presence with us very much.\n       Known to all veterans' advocates as ``Mr. Chairman'', our \n     next speaker was the counterpart in the House to Senator \n     Cranston and Senator Simpson as the Chairman of the Committee \n     on Veterans' Affairs in the other body, as it is \n     affectionately called. He and Alan had to resolve many sticky \n     and tricky issues over the 14 years that he led the House \n     Committee, and they were always able to do so with \n     congeniality and mutual respect.\n       He has been a great friend to me personally, as has been \n     his Committee staff. I now introduce Former Representative \n     Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi, ``Mr. Chairman''. \n     (Applause.)\n       Representative G.V. (Sonny) Montgomery. Thanks very much, \n     Jon.\n       To the family of Senator Cranston, my colleagues on this \n     panel, cabinet members, other distinguished guests, ladies \n     and gentlemen.\n       I'd like to thank you, Judge Steinberg and others for \n     letting me participate in the remarks of this Memorial \n     Tribute to Senator Alan Cranston.\n       Alan and I became friends because he was Chairman of the \n     Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee and I was Chairman of the \n     House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and we both enjoyed \n     working for veterans and their families. Alan was a veteran \n     of World War II and had really a good feel for veterans \n     issues.\n       You know, at first, I was a little uncomfortable working \n     with the great Senator from California. I am kinda the hand-\n     shaking, pat-on-the-back congressman whereas Alan was in \n     great physical shape, and he would look down on me and say \n     ``I am sure we can work together'' and we did.\n       He had a couple of veterans functions out in California and \n     asked me to come out.\n       Going from one veterans meeting to another in different \n     towns in California, we stopped at this restaurant, and he \n     said they made the best vegetable soup in California. People \n     recognized him when he walked in, but Alan wanted the soup \n     and didn't work the crowd, so to speak.\n       I said to Steinberg, ``explain to me'', and he did, in \n     California you had millions of people and you just don't work \n     the crowds. (Laughter.) So, I found out about that.\n       Alan did many good things for veterans, and I will mention \n     a few.\n       He was the architect of the Veterans Readjustment \n     Counseling Act that Max Cleland mentioned. There are 206 \n     centers to help Vietnam veterans to readjust and Alan did \n     pass this legislation in 1979.\n       He had a strong interest in veterans health care and he \n     passed legislation that gave thousands of veterans more \n     access to health care. He pushed for more outpatient clinics, \n     and more veterans use outpatient clinic facilities now and \n     the VA, I'm happy to say, has been able to cut back on the \n     number of hospital beds in our 172 hospitals, because of Alan \n     Cranston and our outpatient clinics.\n       He was part of our team that established the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for Veterans Claims and worked very hard for the \n     upgrade of the VA to a Cabinet department.\n       Some member of Congress, and what a mistake he made, \n     introduced legislation to tax veterans disability \n     compensation. Senator Cranston went berserk, he killed this \n     tax legislation before it even saw the light of day, and he \n     was right.\n       Alan was very helpful in establishing educational benefits \n     for veterans who completed their military obligation, and, he \n     saw to it that the educational benefits go to the actives as \n     well as the National Guard and Reserve.\n       As big as California is and the many government programs \n     that the state has, I believe he really enjoyed working for \n     veterans and their families more than other issues in \n     government.\n       He was a friend of the veteran and veterans organizations \n     knew they could count on Alan, and he came through for them.\n       We all miss him and know even in Heaven Alan has an \n     exercise program going. (Laughter and applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you very much, Mr. \n     Chairman.\n       I want to note Senator Jeffords who has just joined us. We \n     appreciate your being here.\n       Next, we will hear from a former colleague of Alan's who \n     knew him long before he became a United States Senator or \n     held any public office. He very graciously called last \n     Thursday to offer to say a few words in tribute to Alan. I \n     now introduce former Representative and Independent \n     Presidential candidate, John B. Anderson of Illinois. \n     (Applause.)\n       Representative John B. Anderson. Thank you very much, Judge \n     Steinberg, and my distinguished former colleagues in both the\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\n     House and the Senate, distinguished members of the cabinet, \n     and Alan's family. I count it an honor indeed to be included \n     in the group that is privileged this afternoon to say just a \n     few words about the career of this very remarkable man. You \n     have already heard a great deal about his commitment to the \n     cause of civil rights, women's rights, conservation, the \n     environment, veterans' affairs. I will not attempt to repeat \n     the comments or the praise that could continue to be heaped \n     upon him for the efforts that he exerted in all of those \n     fields. But, as a member of the ``other body'' for 12 of the \n     24 years that Alan Cranston served in the Senate, I was well \n     aware of the distinguished record that he had compiled in \n     that body. And I would simply again state what has already \n     been remarked that earlier than most he saw the folly of our \n     entanglement in Southeast Asia, and I remember his very clear \n     and clairvoyant voice calling for an end to the struggle \n     there. He called for more than that, for an end to the arms \n     race.\n       And it's really to that vision that he had in this \n     particular realm of international affairs that I wanted to \n     direct my very brief remarks this afternoon. Because, as a \n     very young man he was gifted with a passion for achieving \n     peace in our time that was shaped as someone said about a \n     former President, I forget who it was, he had a vision that \n     enabled him to peer around a corner of history, to see what \n     lay beyond. In short, he was, indeed, a globalist long \n     before globalization had become a term used in common \n     parlance.\n       And it was just two years after the founding of the United \n     World Federalists in Asheville, North Carolina, that young \n     Alan Cranston at the age of 35 became the President of that \n     organization and served until 1951. One of his mentors was \n     the late, distinguished Grenville Clark, who, along with \n     Lewis B. Sonn, wrote that very magisterial work on world \n     peace through world law. And that indeed was the vision that \n     Alan Cranston had. He had a vision of a democratic world \n     federation that would emerge from what was then, when he was \n     president of the United World Federalists, still a very \n     nascent United Nations. He maintained that interest and \n     served on the Board of Advisors of the World Federalists \n     Association until his recent death.\n       Upon his retirement from the Senate in 1994, and this is \n     the point, I think, that I wanted the opportunity to \n     emphasize here this afternoon, he did not regard his career \n     as ended. I read the account of the marvelous memorial \n     service conducted in San Francisco just three weeks ago, in \n     Grace Cathedral, where his son was quoted as saying that he \n     had said that ``when the end comes, I want to be able somehow \n     to still struggle across the finish line with my head up.'' \n     And he added to that that when the end came, he was still \n     sprinting; he was not merely struggling, he was sprinting in \n     pursuit of the goals that he sought. And he became a leading \n     and a very strong voice in civil society in the area that, at \n     the end of his life, I am convinced, lay closest to his \n     heart. It was the interest in disarmament, an end to the \n     threat of nuclear war and the achievement of world peace \n     through world law. And he believed that that could be \n     achieved only through the application and the use of the same \n     federalist principles that had inspired the Framers of our \n     Constitution to write a Constitution that would bring about \n     peace and domestic tranquillity among the then 13 independent \n     sovereignties who had found that under the Articles of \n     Confederation their bonds of unity had become frayed. And it \n     was Alan's belief, building on that historical fact, that \n     only with a restructured and an empowered United Nations, one \n     capable of maintaining peace with justice, that we would \n     recognize the goal that he sought, of world peace through \n     world law.\n       It's been mentioned, I think, already, that he served as \n     President of the Global Security Institute, a non-profit \n     organization dedicated to disarmament and world peace. He saw \n     security not simply as an issue confined within the narrow \n     boundaries of nationalism but as an issue that required the \n     forging of new bonds of global cooperation.\n       And one of the last and most vivid memories that I \n     personally have of Alan Cranston was less than three years \n     ago, when the Hague Appeal for Peace drew thousands of peace \n     activists from around the world to the Hague, to celebrate, \n     to commemorate the one-hundredth anniversary of the first \n     Hague peace conference. Alan was there as one of the leading \n     spokespersons from the United States. And again, one of the \n     memorable experiences of that international meeting was to \n     attend one of its sessions and to hear him describe how he \n     was even then busy working on a book, a book on sovereignty, \n     a book that would seek to explain that, in this new \n     millennium, the old Westphalian theory of state sovereignty \n     was simply not sufficient unto the needs of our present age, \n     and we had to reconceptualize that term in a way that would \n     allow the formation of democratic global institutions that \n     would carry out the goals of disarmament and build a world in \n     which peace could be achieved through reliance on the rule of \n     law.\n       Those are the memories that I will certainly carry with me, \n     as inspiration for the remainder of my life, and I thank you, \n     Alan Cranston, for the things that you did, both in the \n     Senate, and then in those very important years when you \n     carried forth your ideas and lived for your ideals as a \n     strong member of American civil society. (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. I think that gave us all an \n     important glimpse of the formation of Alan Cranston's \n     philosophy and thinking and I know that there are a number of \n     people from those early days in the United World Federalists \n     who are here today, including Neil Potter and Ted Waller, who \n     worked with Alan so many years ago at the founding of that \n     organization.\n       Our next speaker has served for 26 years in the House of \n     Representatives. He worked very closely with Alan on many \n     initiatives of significance to their California constituents \n     and particularly to the children of their state and the \n     children of the entire country. We are very grateful that he \n     has taken time to be with us throughout this entire ceremony \n     this afternoon.\n       Representative George Miller of California. (Applause.)\n       Representative George Miller. Well thank you, and to all of \n     you, to family and friends, and colleagues. I am very, very \n     pleased to be able to participate in this memorial to an \n     extraordinary life, to clearly one of the leading California \n     statesmen of the 20th century.\n       My familiarity with Alan Cranston goes back long before my \n     politics, when as a young boy, I sat in the living room of \n     our home and listened to Alan Cranston and my father and many \n     other California politicians plot campaigns and create and \n     organize the California Democratic Council, which changed the \n     politics of California, changed the Democratic Party in \n     California, launched their careers, and later the careers of \n     so many other progressive politicians in the State of \n     California. It was a profound organization, in terms of its \n     influence in California. In the post-war, in the conservative \n     years, it was an organization, that led by Alan, would speak \n     out on nuclear arms control, on civil rights, on the rights \n     of labor--these issues that became the cornerstone for so \n     many of us who later sought to run for political life in the \n     State of California.\n       I think it's rather fitting that we remember Alan at this \n     time. Because we can remember when a conservative \n     administration came to this town twenty years ago and sought \n     to launch an attack on programs for the poor, on women and \n     the ill, on foster care and adoption, on child health, on \n     handicapped education, and so many other programs that were \n     targeted for elimination. Alan and his colleagues not only \n     led that fight, but participated in it, stood their ground, \n     and fought against those efforts, and today, when we see a \n     new administration arriving in town, we're no longer talking \n     about the elimination of these programs, we're talking about \n     making them work better. We recognize the beneficiaries of \n     these programs, and the benefits to our society. We now see \n     that, in fact, because of the fight that was made a long time \n     ago, we now have a legacy of understanding the role and the \n     importance that government plays in so many American's lives, \n     and the necessity of it. We've heard it with respect to \n     veterans, we've heard it with respect to the environment, to \n     women, and to so many others in American society.\n       Many of us would think that if you look at the last quarter \n     of the 20th century in American politics, you would think of \n     extreme ideological behavior, you'd think of political chaos, \n     and you would suggest that not a lot got done. But, as \n     already had been mentioned here, if you look at the legacy \n     and the workload and the work product of Alan Cranston, you \n     would recognize that, in fact, it was a golden age of \n     legislation for people like Alan Cranston. He was able to put \n     his signature and his work into so many efforts that became \n     the law of the land. I recall two of those, working with him \n     as a colleague in the House. One was in the 70s; in the late \n     70s, after five years of working together, of holding \n     hearings, site visits, talking with families and children, we \n     put together legislation to deal with the problems of foster \n     care, to children who were trapped in a system from which \n     they could not escape, families who could not get their \n     children back from that system, and the impact that it had on \n     these children. That law was later signed by President \n     Carter, and it was Alan's tenacity that allowed us to get it \n     through.\n       The other one of course, that's been mentioned here, is the \n     California Desert. Alan started pioneering that effort so \n     many years ago, so many years before we actually considered \n     it on the floor of the House or the Senate. Where he walked \n     over those areas, he hiked over them, he spent time with the \n     constituents who were interested in them, with the \n     organizations that were trying to preserve them. Kim has \n     spent much time in that area. And, after Alan left the \n     Senate, I managed the bill on the floor of the House. The \n     opponents were numerous; we used to have to have security and \n     armed guards to go into the hearings on the California Desert \n     Bill. They held the controversial ones in Beverly Hills, so \n     that people would have trouble getting there, it was a grand \n     ploy. And it worked. But, in any case, the opposition in the \n     House was incredible. We spent many, many, many, many days \n     debating this legislation, on again, off again, part of the \n     day, into the night. They filed numerous amendments, all of \n     which had unlimited debate time. They had a coterie of people \n     who would speak on every amendment for the maximum time \n     allowed, so that they could delay this bill and not see it \n     enacted. I called Alan and I said, ``Alan, we've got to \n     accept some amendments to speed this along. The members of \n     the House are starting to call me Moses, they've said they've \n     been in the desert for so long on this legislation.'' I said,\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\n     ``Some of these amendments, what can we accept to narrow this \n     down'', and he said, ``None''. And I said, ``Alan, this is \n     the House, it will never stop'', and he said, ``None''. He \n     said ``We can't accept them''. I talked to him about a couple \n     of amendments to move the boundaries, he said, ``No, I've \n     been there; I've been there and if you go to the bottom of \n     that canyon, you're going to find a little spring down \n     there--most people don't know it exists. You can't put that \n     outside the park, that's going to have to be in.'' Well, it's \n     turned out he was right. Dianne managed the bill on the \n     Senate floor, and Bill Clinton signed it into law, and now \n     it's one of our leading attractions in the nation and \n     certainly in the State of California. Those who opposed it \n     are now seeking authorizations and appropriations for \n     visitors centers and various support systems for the park. \n     (Laughter.) The Chambers of Commerce now think that this is a \n     cash register and they'd like to have it expanded, they'd \n     like to have the boundaries expanded, they'd like to have the \n     protections upgraded, so that more visitors would come and \n     bless their economy. It was Alan Cranston's foresight that \n     brought that about.\n       You know, the political mentor to so many of us, Phil \n     Burton, used to say to us that when you came to the House or \n     you came to the Senate, that it was a privilege and it was an \n     honor, and you had to pay the rent, you had to pay the rent \n     all the time to stay there. And I think that Alan fully \n     understood that while this clearly was the world's most \n     exclusive club, he still had to pay the rent, and he did over \n     and over and over again, on behalf of so many Americans, on \n     behalf of our environment, on behalf of world peace, on \n     behalf of human rights. He paid the rent constantly to earn \n     his right to stay here and to work and to work and to work on \n     behalf of all of us. And I think we should thank him, for all \n     of the fights that he made, and all of the ground that he \n     stood, on behalf of America, and all of its people. Thank you \n     very much, Alan. (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you, Representative Miller.\n       Next, we will hear from a Senator who served on two \n     Committees with Alan--Banking and Foreign Relations--where \n     they shared many common interests. Senator Kerry was a highly \n     decorated veteran of Vietnam and a co-founder of the Vietnam \n     Veterans of America, an organization which was to play an \n     important role in the enactment of much legislation that he \n     and Senator Cranston championed, particularly the Veterans' \n     Judicial Review Act that created the Court on which I am \n     honored to serve along with another former Member of Congress \n     who is also with us today, Chief Judge Ken Kramer.\n       Senator Kerry succeeded to the Democratic leadership of the \n     Banking Committee's Housing Subcommittee, which Senator \n     Cranston had chaired from 1987 to 1993. Also, I know that \n     Senator Kerry shares the passion that Senator Cranston lived \n     and breathed for ending the threat of nuclear annihilation.\n       Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts. (Applause.)\n       Senator John Kerry. Thank you, Jonathan. Kim, Colette, \n     Evan, and R.E., it's a very special privilege to join with \n     all of you today in remembering the remarkable life and \n     achievements of our friend, Alan Cranston.\n       As we've heard today, and as we all know, Alan was a \n     sprinter, a record-holding sprinter, who, in his sixties, was \n     only two seconds slower than he was in his twenties when he \n     set the records. And I think it's safe to say that those who \n     knew him well would agree that he really sprinted through \n     life; he sprinted through the United States Senate, always \n     with a yellow pad in his hand and a felt-tip pen, covered \n     with ink, with more things on that pad to do in one day than \n     most of us would venture to accomplish in a week or a month, \n     and he got them done. And always with this incredible, \n     mischievous twinkle in his eye. He had fun advocating and \n     challenging the system.\n       One of the most enduring images of Alan would be at the \n     Iowa caucuses in 1984 at the Holiday Inn in Keokuk, Iowa, \n     where he was seen sprinting barefooted down 40-meter \n     hallways, then he'd walk back, and he'd repeat the exercise \n     for about 40 minutes. And I think that understanding that, we \n     can understand why it was no coincidence that Alan's favorite \n     hotel was the Chicago O'Hare Hilton, where they had 250-meter \n     hallways. (Laughter.)\n       Three weeks ago in California, we had a tender goodbye to \n     our friend, this sprinter, at a memorial service--calling to \n     mind the many ways in which he enriched our lives and this \n     country.\n       There in the Grace Cathedral, we heard Colette Cranston say \n     that in death Alan Cranston ``has become my Jiminy Cricket--\n     that little voice in [her] conscience that says, `Colette, \n     think before you leap.''' It would not be an exaggeration to \n     say that that warning was a characteristic of Alan--think \n     before you leap, and, most of all, he wanted us to think, he \n     wanted us to look, and, by God, he wanted us to leap. He \n     implored us to put a public face on policy. He wanted us to \n     think not in terms of statistics and numbers and programs, \n     but in terms of people; and the people he spoke of most \n     often, as all of my colleagues who served with him will \n     remember, were senior citizens, children, those without \n     decent housing, immigrants, those in need of a helping hand \n     regardless of race or religion. He was a moral voice, a voice \n     of conscience, someone who understood that even as he \n     remained vigilant in defending the needs and wishes of his \n     home state of California, he was also a global citizen and he \n     knew and felt the responsibilities of this institution, \n     towards the rest of the world.\n       Through four terms as a United States Senator, he also \n     remained a man of enormous humility--on his answering machine \n     he was simply ``Alan''--as he was to so many who worked with \n     him and knew him. And this personal sense of place and of \n     restraint made it easy to underestimate the contributions \n     that he made to the Senate, and to our country. Certainly \n     he never paused long enough to personally remind us of the \n     impact of his service, of the history that he was a part \n     of and the lives that he touched.\n       I first met Alan in 1971 when I had returned from Vietnam \n     and many of our veterans were part of an effort to end what \n     we thought was a failed policy in that country. In Alan \n     Cranston we found one of the few Senators willing not just to \n     join in public opposition to the war in Vietnam, but to \n     become a voice of healing for veterans of the war--a \n     statesman whose leadership enabled others, over time, to \n     separate their feelings about the war from their feelings for \n     the veterans of the war. At a time when too many wanted \n     literally to disown this country's own veterans, Alan \n     Cranston offered them a warm embrace. He was eager to do \n     something all too rare in Washington: To listen--and he \n     listened to veterans who had much to say, much of it ignored \n     for too long. He honored their pride and their pain with his \n     sensitivity and his understanding.\n       That's when I first came to see the great energy and the \n     commitment that he brought to issues affecting veterans, \n     especially those of the Vietnam era. He was deeply involved \n     on veterans' health care issues, among the first to fight for \n     the recognition of post-Vietnam stress syndrome, a leader in \n     insisting, together with Sonny Montgomery, on the extension \n     of coverage under the VA, under the GI Bill. And when the \n     Agent Orange issue came to the fore, Alan insisted on getting \n     answers from a government that was unresponsive. He made sure \n     that veterans and their families got the care that they \n     needed. Under his leadership, together with his partner in \n     the House, they increased GI Bill benefits for Vietnam \n     veterans--and I tell you that that was a time when veterans \n     too often had to fight for what was their simple due, whether \n     it was a memorial here in Washington, or simply to have the \n     government recognize that it was a war, and not simply a \n     conflict. Alan's leadership made all the difference. It's a \n     sad truth in our history that a weary nation indeed seemed \n     eager to turn its back on the entire war by also turning its \n     back on so many veterans. It should forever be a source of \n     pride to the Cranston family that Alan was chief among those \n     who insisted that America honor that service and keep faith \n     with sons who left pieces of themselves and years of their \n     lives on the battlefield in Vietnam.\n       This was a man who fought with extraordinary passion for \n     everything. And he fought at the most difficult of times. Not \n     just for veterans, but as we've heard from others today, he \n     fought against all that war represents--remembering that war, \n     and the killing that follows it, is the ultimate failure of \n     diplomacy.\n       Alan Cranston was above all else a man of peace. And he was \n     a man of peace not as a matter of public policy, but as a \n     matter of personal passion. Remember: This was a man who, in \n     1934, found himself in the same room as Adolf Hitler. Five \n     years later, he wrote a critical English translation of Adolf \n     Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' in an effort to reveal the German \n     leader's true plans. And he wore Hitler's ensuing lawsuit as \n     a badge of honor, proud that he had stood up to try and warn \n     the English-speaking world about the evils of Nazism.\n       Throughout the rest of his service he used public office to \n     force Americans to listen to other prescient warnings--about \n     nuclear war, about the arms race, about hopes for peace that \n     he refused to give up even as others chose to beat the drums \n     of war.\n       Senator Cranston came to his famous commitment, as we \n     learned from the film, after meeting with Albert Einstein in \n     1946. And he left that meeting convinced that he had found \n     his mission and he would indeed spend the balance of his life \n     arguing that conviction before the world.\n       As a member of the Senate leadership and a senior voice on \n     the Democratic side of the Foreign Relations Committee, he \n     worked tirelessly to reduce the nuclear threat. Obviously, \n     there were many of those efforts, but one of the most \n     unpublicized was his effort through the 1970s and 80's, when \n     he convened a unique group known as the ``SALT Study Group''. \n     A senators-only gathering monthly in his office, off the \n     record, face-to-face to define the confines of the debate. He \n     knew the impact that quiet diplomacy could have on the \n     issues, but on this issue above all that he cared about the \n     most.\n       He loved the Peace Corps, and he fought for it. He fought \n     to attach human rights conditions on aid to El Salvador. He \n     was a leading national advocate for the mutual verifiable \n     freeze. He was always an idealist whose increase in political \n     power, gratefully, was always met by progress for the issues \n     that he cared about so deeply. It was not just the work of a \n     career, but the work of a lifetime--and after he left the \n     Senate, we all know the remarkable commitment that he\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\n     continued with Mikhail Gorbachev and ultimately in his \n     founding of the Global Security Institute.\n       He did that because he sensed that the end of the Cold War, \n     with all of the opportunity that it afforded, which he \n     understood, still left us a world that was more dangerous, \n     and he was haunted by the threat of nuclear terrorism. We \n     missed his voice in the debate on the test ban treaty, and we \n     miss him even more today.\n       When he left the Senate, Alan reflected on his service and \n     he said of his own legacy, simply: ``Most of all, I have \n     dedicated myself to the cause of peace.''\n       That dedication was real, it was lasting, and the legacy of \n     peace for a good and peaceful man who gave living embodiment \n     to Culbertson's simple, stubborn faith that ``God and the \n     politicians willing, the United States can declare peace upon \n     the world, and win it.'' That belief was Alan Cranston--and \n     it's a belief still worth fighting for. (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Our concluding speaker from this \n     body is also one of its newest members. She traveled to \n     California three weeks ago, as did Senator Kerry, as he told \n     us, to attend the ceremony attended by over a thousand \n     persons at the Grace Cathedral in San Francisco. For reasons \n     that I know she will share with us, she will be--along with \n     Max Cleland--a living legacy of Alan Cranston in the United \n     States Senate.\n       Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington. (Applause.)\n       Senator Maria Cantwell. Thank you. To Kim and Colette and \n     Evan and R.E., thank you for allowing me to share this \n     occasion to remember Alan and to have been there a few weeks \n     ago and to see so many of the friends and faces that Alan \n     touched.\n       People today have talked about Alan's legislative career--\n     the many pieces of legislation that will live with us for a \n     long time. But I'd like to share with you today maybe a \n     different Alan Cranston that I knew as I worked on his \n     Presidential campaign in 1983 and 1984. Some people might \n     think running for President is a glorious task, but it is a \n     very difficult one that I think Alan knew would help aid the \n     cause and message that he wanted to fight for. In fact, I'm \n     not from Washington state originally; it was Alan Cranston \n     that dropped me off there in 1983. In fact, the first time I \n     ever visited, I was a part of his presidential campaign \n     staff, in which he left me at SEA-TAC Airport in Seattle and \n     went on about his business to campaign. But people who knew \n     Alan knew that he jumped into that race to deliver a message \n     for the right reason. I was fortunate enough to have read \n     R.E.'s book about Alan, and knew all the things that Alan had \n     fought through in his life, some of the things that have been \n     mentioned today. About being sued by Adolf Hitler for \n     translating in next to no time a version of ``Mein Kampf''. \n     Being a pre-World War II journalist and being smart enough to \n     understand what was going to be advocated and running back to \n     the United States and having that published. And all of the \n     other wonderful things that Alan did in helping women, and on \n     the environment; one thing I haven't heard mentioned today is \n     his work with Native Americans, which is something that I \n     recognize.\n       But what was amazing about Alan from a personal \n     perspective, and you definitely get to know someone from a \n     personal perspective when you travel with him on a \n     presidential campaign, is that Alan was very self \n     disciplined. John Kerry talked about his running, and that \n     was something that was very important to Alan on a daily \n     basis. And, yes, I can attest to the fact that he did sprint \n     in the hotel corridors when you didn't schedule time for him \n     to run outside. But, when Alan, challenged with the fact that \n     maybe some of the other hotel guests found it shocking to \n     find somebody so tall and long running down the halls at 7:30 \n     in the morning, the Senator replied, ``well maybe I should \n     start at 6:30 instead.'' (Laughter.)\n       But Alan never complained about that task. And for me, in \n     Washington state, there were lots of World Federalists, a lot \n     of people part of the nuclear freeze movement, a lot of \n     people very appreciative of his efforts on the environment. \n     But Alan was also a very self-deprecating person when it came \n     to making a moment light. And I'll never forget the time in \n     Vancouver, Washington, where hundreds of people had showed up \n     at eight-thirty on a Sunday morning, I think it was the \n     Fourth of July, to hear his message about the nuclear freeze. \n     And when he mistakenly called the host of the event, whose \n     name was ``June'', ``Jane'', and he heard a gasp from the \n     audience, he quickly looked down at his program and saw that \n     he had mistakenly called her the wrong name, and all of a \n     sudden started pounding on his chest, saying, ``Me Tarzan! \n     You Jane!'' (Laughter.) Which put everybody at ease, and Alan \n     went on to give his very important remarks to a community \n     that I don't think has seen since the likes of Alan Cranston.\n       And yet, when you run a Presidential campaign, you also are \n     a spokesperson for your issues. But I never saw Alan take \n     advantage of that situation, where he was trying to make more \n     than the situation called for. In fact, he was very reserved \n     in his comments. I remember being with him on August 31, in \n     1983, when the Korean Airline flight 007 was shot down. We \n     happened to be in Anchorage, Alaska, at that time, and many \n     of you probably know the various controversies that arose out \n     of that; 269 people were killed. And I remember waking up \n     that morning to a press event where probably 200 different \n     people were there, including the national press, all wanting \n     Alan to make a statement right away; because he was a \n     Presidential candidate, because his remarks would be all over \n     the news. And yet Alan had the self discipline not just to \n     say something immediately that morning, but to say, in a \n     calming way, ``let's find out the facts, first.'' And when I \n     think about that as a human being, particularly in my new \n     post and job, in which the world moves so fast and in which \n     people go about promoting their idea and concepts, the very \n     human side of Alan Cranston remains with me, and I hope it \n     does with each of you.\n       I talked to him in October of this year, in which I was out \n     campaigning in Bellingham, Washington, one of the last places \n     I had to campaign with him, and I said to him, ``Senator, you \n     dropped me off here almost seventeen years ago, and you never \n     picked me up.'' And Alan reminded me that is was time to work \n     together. So I guess I say to Kim, and Colette, and R.E., and \n     to those of you who are going to carry on the Cranston \n     legacy, that he left in each one of us a piece of that flame \n     that he carried for so long. You saw it on the film. It \n     started when Albert Einstein said to him, ``nuclear arms \n     could wipe out a whole race of people.'' I think Alan started \n     saying that from that moment on, and reminded people about it \n     until his last days. And so I hope that each and every one of \n     you, as I will, carries part of that torch and flame that \n     Alan had of self-discipline, knowing that he was not the \n     message, but the messenger, in helping this fight. Thank you. \n     (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. And now we'll hear from Alan \n     Cranston's son Kim, who I know is committed to seeing that \n     Alan's lifelong commitment to securing world peace is carried \n     on as his most important bequest to his granddaughter Evan \n     and all the children of our planet.\n       Kim. (Applause.)\n       Kim Cranston. Thank you, all. Those of you who were \n     familiar with the legal pads that Alan carried around and the \n     black pens will be happy to know that Evan is over here busy \n     making a ``to do'' list. (Laughter.) I'm not sure what it all \n     includes.\n       Jonathan, thank you very much for helping to organize this, \n     and everybody else who was involved in this, the Senate \n     sponsors, and each of the other speakers; I deeply appreciate \n     your kind and touching words about Alan and his work here. \n     It's good to see all of you, so many old friends. It's sad \n     under the circumstances that we come together, but it's \n     wonderful to see you all again. I know how much Alan \n     cherished your friendship and collaboration over the years.\n       I was really truly blessed, I feel, to have, through the \n     genetic lottery, ended up as Alan's son, and had the \n     opportunity to get to know him as my father, as my dearest \n     and oldest friend, and as a wonderful collaborator, mentor, \n     teacher, and leader. And I know his loss as a leader is a \n     loss we all share.\n       I've been reflecting over the last month on many of the \n     things that I've learned from Alan and our work together, \n     living with him, and a few things stand out that I wanted to \n     share today. One thing that stood out for me was the \n     remarkable style of leadership he had. Inside the program is \n     the poem that he carried, the Lao-Tzu quote, for most of his \n     life, that really informed the style of leadership that he \n     practiced. It concludes with:\n\n     But of a good leader,\n     When his work is done,\n     His aim fulfilled,\n     They will all say,\n     ``We did this ourselves.''\n\n       And so today, we're here, recognizing what we accomplished \n     together with Alan. And so it's an opportunity not only to \n     mourn his loss, but to celebrate what we accomplished \n     together, and I think, beyond that, to recommit, and commit \n     to the ongoing causes that we engaged in with him.\n       Another lesson that has stood out in the last month for me \n     was something that I really remember when I first began \n     hearing it from him. I was told the central purpose of life \n     was to make the world a better place, or, as one of Alan's \n     heros, Martin Luther King, Jr., once said, ``life's most \n     persistent and urgent question is `what are you doing to \n     serve others?' '' And it was certainly in that spirit that \n     Alan conducted his life and committed most of his public \n     life.\n       And, finally, one other thing that stands out very strongly \n     for me, both in terms of the work that he did here in \n     Washington, and to the work that he continued to do after he \n     left Washington, was his recognition of the extraordinary \n     moment in history in which we all live. In that regard, I \n     just note that a friend commented after Alan had left the \n     Senate, that they had seen him, and they said, ``Kim, you \n     know, he doesn't seem to be slowing down, he seems to be \n     speeding up.'' And I think that was true, because he said \n     to me that he'd felt since he left the Senate that he \n     could really focus in on the things that he was most \n     concerned about, to devote 100% of his energy to those \n     causes that were of greatest concern to him. And I think \n     the cornerstone of that was an understanding that we have \n     entered a new age during our lifetime, when we're facing \n     global challenges that can be addressed only at the global \n     level, and that we need to come up with effective new \n     approaches for dealing with those challenges.\n       After he left the Senate, the cause did continue, most \n     recently in the form of the Global Security Institute, which \n     is continuing,\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\n     and it has a great board, and a wonderful director, Jonathan \n     Granoff, our CEO, who is here today. And I would really urge \n     those of you who are here today who shared in those causes \n     with Alan to look forward to opportunities to collaborate \n     with us, because the work goes on, and Alan was just the \n     messenger.\n       In closing, I'd just like to say something I know Alan \n     closed most of his speeches with, which was, ``I thank you \n     for all you are doing, and urge you onward.'' Thank you. \n     (Applause.)\n       Judge Jonathan Steinberg. Thank you, Kim. I know your \n     father would be proud of your personal actions to pick up the \n     torch and deeply moved by your words.\n       I want to close with some expressions of thanks to many \n     people. Again, I want to note how grateful all of us are to \n     the sponsoring Senators and to all who spoke so eloquently \n     and movingly about the man who will live forever in my heart \n     as ``Alan,'' as the most important influence on the lives of \n     so many of us in this room today.\n       The presence here throughout this entire ceremony of three \n     Cabinet officials in this new Administration should remind us \n     all of Alan's abiding belief that it was possible to form an \n     alliance with every Senator on one issue or another, and of \n     his commitment to do just that. Common ground and common \n     sense was much more important to him than party affiliation \n     or political philosophy. We thank the three Secretaries who \n     joined us today and helped remind us of how important those \n     sentiments are for the welfare of our country.\n       There are an enormous number of people who volunteered \n     their time and did just incredible work to make this tribute \n     as successful and meaningful as we hope that it has been. If \n     I leave anyone out, I apologize--as I do, and as I did \n     before, if I left out any former officeholder, who I should \n     have recognized earlier. So, I offer special thanks, on \n     behalf of the family and myself, alphabetically, to Zack \n     Allen, Bill Brew, Fran Butler, Monique Ceruti, Kelly Cordes, \n     Chad Griffin, Bill Johnstone, Susanne Martinez, Katie \n     O'Neill, Dan Perry, Valerie Rheinstein, Alexandra Sardegna, \n     Ed Scott, Martha Stanley, Loraine Tong, Joel Wood, and one \n     most special person, Elinor Tucker, without whose highly \n     efficient logistical support we would never have made it to \n     this point. I thank Senator Rockefeller for allowing her to \n     put in so much time and effort and to do so in such an \n     effective way. Finally, an even more personal thanks to my \n     wife, Shellie, for helping to keep me on an relatively even \n     keel over the past month as this event was pulled together.\n       And, finally, thanks to all of you who joined us in tribute \n     today to Senator Alan McGregor Cranston, a great American who \n     lived his life by the philosophy of a Chinese poet Lao-Tzu, \n     whose words on leadership, printed in today's program, Alan \n     carried with him every day.\n       That concludes this Tribute. Please remember to sign the \n     guest book, and thanks again for coming. And we'll go out to \n     the theme song from Alan's Presidential campaign, ``Chariots \n     of Fire''. (Applause.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3845-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         CONGRATULATING WE THE PEOPLE PARTICIPANTS FROM WYOMING\n\n Mr. ENZI.

I would also like to recognize their teacher, Don Morris, \nwho deserves much of the credit for the class' success.\n  These young scholars worked diligently to reach the national finals \nand through their experience gained a deep knowledge and understanding \nof the fundamental principles of our constitutional democracy.\n  I am pleased to have had the opportunity to support the ``We the \nPeople'' program through my work on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I am particularly proud to note that the \nBetter Education for Students and Teachers Act will allow schools, \nwhich choose to do so, to use federal funds to incorporate the We the \nPeople program into their study of civics and American government.\n  I once again want to congratulate Don Morris and these students from \nCheyenne Central High School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3845-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO STEPHEN J. RAPP\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes to \nhonor Stephen J. Rapp, United States Attorney for the Northern District \nof Iowa.\n  Steve Rapp has been a trailblazer in my home state of Iowa since he \nbegan his career in public service in his early twenties. Back in 1972, \nhe won a seat in our House of Representatives, and at the tender age of \ntwenty-five, he came within a hair's breadth of winning the Third \nDistrict Congressional seat. He did eventually join us on Capitol Hill \na few years later when he served as Staff Director and Counsel of the \nU.S. Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency.\n  After his stint in Washington, Steve returned to Iowa and served \nanother four years in our House of Representatives where he \ndistinguished himself as a leader on anti-crime legislation. Steve was \ninstrumental in passing our state's rape shield law and our strong \nanti-drunk driving regulation. And he wrote the law that forbids \nrelease pending appeal of criminals who are guilty of forcible \nfelonies.\n  In 1993, Steve was appointed as a United States Attorney for the \nNorthern District of Iowa, and under his stewardship, the Northern \nDistrict became a national torchbearer in criminal prosecutions. Steve \nfiled America's first prosecution under Title II of the Brady Law. He \nalso filed the nation's first prosecution under the federal ``Three \nStrikes'' law, and the first prosecution under the Lautenberg amendment \nthat prohibited convicted domestic violence offenders from owning a \ngun.\n  But Steve wasn't content merely to do a stellar job on the day to day \nduties of United States Attorney. He became a member of the Attorney \nGenerals Advisory Committee, serving on the working Group on Interior \nEnforcement Immigration Law and on Subcommittees handling violence \nagainst women, organized crime, victim crime, juvenile justice and \nNative American issues. In addition, he served as chair of the Midwest \nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Area and has held forums across \nNorthern Iowa to educate citizens and help reduce methamphetamine use.\n  When I think of all the work Steve Rapp has done for our state and \nour country, I'm reminded of the words of President John F. Kennedy who \nonce noted, ``Law is the strongest link between man and freedom.'' \nSteve Rapp has worked tirelessly to keep the people of Northern Iowa \nand America free, free from crime and violence, and free to raise their \nfamilies and live their lives in safe, secure communities.\n  Steve has been honored by groups ranging from the Afro-American \nCommunity Broadcasting to the NAACP to the Black Hawk County Legal \nSecretaries Association. And it is my pleasure to add myself to that \nlist and offer my deepest gratitude for his long and distinguished \nrecord of service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3845-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3845-S3846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF THE 125TH BIRTHDAY OF ST. MARY PARISH OF NEW BALTIMORE, \n                                MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me today \nin congratulating the St. Mary Parish of New Baltimore, MI on their \nupcoming one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary. Since 1876, the St. \nMary's has been serving the spiritual needs of it's congregation as \nwell as the community at large.\n  The history of St. Mary Parish is too long and rich for me to recount \nhere in full, but it is important to point out that New Baltimore has \nbeen home to a Catholic community since 1805, when ``horseback \npriests'' from Canada and Detroit would come to minister in private \nhomes. It was in 1876, as America was celebrating its centennial, that \nFather Aloysius Lambert was appointed the first resident pastor and the \nSt. Mary Parish was born. Father Lambert worked to establish a church \nand chapel, a grade school and a rectory. Other important events in the \nhistory of the Parish include the mortgage being paid off and burned in \n1938, the addition of a war memorial shrine in 1949, and the completion \nof a new gymnasium in 1951. This gymnasium would serve as a temporary \nchurch when the 83 year old building burned to the ground in 1958. In \n1963, the cornerstone was laid in\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\nwhat was now to be known as St. Mary Queen of Creation.\n  The 1960's also saw the creation of a new mission for St. Mary \nParish. A chapter of St. Vincent de Paul was opened to serve the needs \nof the poor in New Baltimore and seventh-grader Mary Jane Plague began \na music ministry. This legacy of community stewardship grew with the \naddition of Sister Loretta Demick to the St. Mary Parish in 1974. \nSister Demick began what was known as Sister Loretta's Closet, which \nhelped feed the poor, elderly and infirmed of the Parish. Also in 1974, \nthe former convent was turned into a home for women who are \ndevelopmentally disabled. People with special needs are still being \nserved in this building, and it is known as the Horizons Residential \nCenters. In the last decade, the St. Mary Parish has expanded outreach \nprograms to help the homeless and those with HIV/AIDS.\n  Over the years, St. Mary Parish has grown from a few families to \nthousands of parishioners and along the way has dedicated itself to \nbettering the lives of everyone in its community. The community of New \nBaltimore and all of Macomb County have benefitted from many good deeds \nand continuing works of generosity that the St. Mary Parish has \nundertaken. I trust that my Senate colleagues will join me in wishing \nSt. Mary Parish a happy one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary, and \nhoping that the next century and a quarter are as fruitful as the \nlast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3846-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING THE STUDENTS FROM CENTURY SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I had the privilege to meet \nwith twelve accomplished students from Century Senior High School in \nBismarck, ND, who are in town to compete in the national finals of the \n``We the People. . .'' competition. This competition focuses on the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights, and these students have worked \nhard to reach the national finals.\n  These students are Adrienne Buckman, Nicole Elkin, Jessica Fritz, \nNathan Grenz, Gwen Hobert, Chris Holzer, Reed Hushka, Whitney \nKreingKrairt, Rudie Martinson, Paul Nehring, Grant Neuharth, and Russel \nPearson. They are ably led by their teacher, Jeff Aas, who also \ndeserves credit for the success of the class.\n  I am proud of this class and their dedication to this project. The \nConstitution is not just a historical document; it is the basis for our \nentire system of government. The brilliance of the Constitution lies in \nits flexibility which has allowed it to stand the test of time. The \nBill of Rights is a fundamental part of our national culture and has \nbeen the basis of freedom principles that have been adopted in other \ncountries around the world.\n  The knowledge that these students have gained by studying the \nConstitution will serve them well for years to come. Congratulations to \nthese outstanding students from my home State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3846-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DENNIS H. BLOME\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments \ntoday to honor Dennis H. Blome for his outstanding work as United \nStates Marshal for the Northern District of Iowa.\n  Before he even set foot in the U.S. Marshal's office, Dennis Blome \nhad already distinguished himself with over two decades of dedicated \nlaw enforcement service. During these years, he took on just about \nevery position in the field of law enforcement, and he performed them \nall with diligence, passion and honor.\n  Dennis started out as a Deputy in the Linn County Sheriff's Office in \n1971. He then took on the positions of Jail Officer, dispatcher and \npatrolman before becoming First Deputy for Sheriff Walter H. Grant. And \nhe later served as Jail Administrator, Sergeant, Lieutenant and head of \nDetectives for the Sheriff's Office.\n  In 1984, Dennis was elected as Sheriff, and he took the lead in \nhelping build a new jail and provide critically needed training for \njail personnel throughout Iowa. He was also an enthusiastic member of \nthe legislative Committee of the Iowa State Sheriffs' and Deputies' \nAssociation and of the National Sheriffs' Association.\n  Dennis' passion for learning and taking on new challenges led him to \ncontinue his education at the FBI National Academy, the National \nInstitute of Corrections and Mount Mercy College where he got his BA \ndegree in Criminal Justice and Psychology. He also took advantage of \nspecial training seminars through the National Sheriffs' Conference and \nthe International Chiefs of Police.\n  Dennis' extensive job experience and solid education served him well \nwhen he was appointed as United States Marshal for the Northern \nDistrict of Iowa back in 1994. He focused his boundless energy on a \nnumber of projects, most notably, that of strengthening security in our \ncourthouses. Today, thanks to Dennis, our courthouses in Cedar Rapids \nand Sioux City have interior and exterior camera systems as well as \nrecording systems and multiple monitoring systems.\n  But even more important than what Dennis accomplished is how he \naccomplished it. Dennis never considered any job to be ``beneath'' him. \nHe was always willing to pitch in whether it meant being present in \ncourt, transporting prisoners or doing anything else necessary to keep \nthe agency in good running order. His humility and commitment to his \nwork made him a popular leader.\n  Dennis Blome embodies all of the highest ideals of public service. \nHe's served our state with honor and loyalty for thirty years, and it \nis my pleasure to offer my deepest gratitude for his considerable \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3846-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3846-S3847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING BILL BRADLEY\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we celebrate the long career \nof dedicated public service rendered by Mr. Bill Bradley of Ware, MA. \nHis deep love of policy and politics has inspired me and many others, \nand I am fortunate to have Bill's friendship and counsel in my life.\n  This weekend, Bill's friends and colleagues will gather to look back \non 25 years of service to two United States Senators, a Congressman, \nthe US Department of Agriculture and the people of Massachusetts. Bill \nretires from a distinguished career of government service, most \nrecently having held the post of Regional Director for the Department \nof Agriculture's Rural Development Program and today I join his \nextended political family in this celebration.\n  The same interest and passion that Bill brought to his USDA service \ncan be found in earlier chapters of his life. As a freshman in high \nschool, he pursued an early interest in politics by working as a \ncongressional page in Washington D.C. in 1962, and his sponsor was a \nson of Dorchester who went on to become the great Speaker of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, John W. McCormack. Bill was a page through \nthe next two years, and capped his early Washington experience by \nwitnessing Lyndon Johnson's inauguration in 1965. After graduating from \nthe University of California and serving a brief stint with the U.S. \nForest Service in Alaska, Bill got his first job on Capitol Hill as a \nLegislative Aide for Congressman Dale Milford of Texas during the \nCarter Administration. Soon he moved closer to his Massachusetts up \nnorth to run a mobile office for my predecessor in this chamber, the \nlate Paul Tsongas. From 1979 to 1983, Bill traveled in this capacity \nthrough the same towns he would later serve through the USDA. Once \nestablished in Western Massachusetts with Senator Tsongas, Bill dug \ndeeper into the issues closest to the heart of those communities, and \nsoon his knowledge and understanding of the region and its needs was \nexemplary. Even greater was his passion to serve them.\n  Bill coordinated these cities and towns in my first Senate campaign \nin 1984 and later became the Director of Constituent Services for my \nwhole state-wide operation. Throughout the nine years he spent on my \nstaff, he held positions that ranged from Director of Western \nMassachusetts to Director of Local Relations. In each position, Bill \ndemonstrated the same tenacity and dedication to improving people's \nlives he carries to this day.\n  It came as no surprise to those who worked with and knew Bill that \nPresident Clinton would recognize and embrace these same qualities as \nhe assumed office in 1993. The President appointed Bill to the position \nof Regional\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nDirector for the Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program, \nand the success of his tenure is well known to everyone in the three-\nstate region he served. He oversaw more than 65 employees in six \noffices throughout three states. The program's successes throughout \nthis time are numerous; he worked with other agencies and officials to \nobtain new fire trucks for the Palmer Fire Department, and worked with \nCongressman Neal and the Ware Selectmen to help move the police station \nto its current location. During his eight years of directing this \nagency, Bill coordinated the distribution of over $870 million dollars \nin rural housing programs that helped rural towns foster and maintain \neconomic development. Concurrent with this service, Bill was a Member \nof the Electoral College for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and I \ncongratulated him along with his friends and colleagues as he cast his \nvote for the re-election of Bill Clinton and Al Gore.\n  Throughout all of these national and State-wide efforts, Bill Bradley \nhas maintained an iron-clad commitment to community and his neighbors. \nHe has served as Director of the Ware Cooperative Bank, and mobilized \nState and Federal money through the Ware Community Development \nAuthority. His love of politics is surpassed only by music and his \ndevotion to his wife, Linda, and I congratulate both of them as they \nbegin this new chapter in their lives. I have been very fortunate to \nhave some of the best people I have ever known be involved in my \ncampaigns and on my staff. Bill Bradley is a credit to his community \nand the State of Massachusetts. He has performed 25 years of public \nservice with a professionalism and dedication that is increasingly \nrare, and it is with great pride, respect and affection that I \ncelebrate his contributions to the lives of people throughout \nMassachusetts and the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3847-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RECOGNITION OF THE LIGHTHOUSE OF OAKLAND COUNTY, INC.

Mr. President, Phylliss Henry has been a pioneer \nin my home State of Iowa, shattering glass ceilings, blazing a bold new \ntrail for women in law enforcement, and reaching out to help others \nfollow after her. Her tireless work to stamp out crime and to bring \nwomen to the table in law enforcement have made a lasting impact on our \nstate.\n  Back in 1972, Phylliss became the first woman ever to receive a law \nenforcement degree from Des Moines Area Community College. She was then \nhired as the first female patrol officer in the Des Moines Department, \nand she remained the only female patrol officer until 1977. She later \nbecame a Sergeant with the Special Crime Unit and with the \nCommunication Section where she helped with minority recruitment and \nacted as a role model for other women in law enforcement.\n  Phylliss then made the courageous decision to continue and expand her \neducation, and she focused her energy on obtaining a Bachelor of \nGeneral Studies degree in 1984, an MA in Communications Studies in \n1986, and a PhD in Communication Research in 1988, all from the \nUniversity of Iowa.\n  In December of 1990, she became the Support Services Manager of the \nIowa State University Department of Public Safety. As in all her \nprevious positions, she took the job to a new level, creating new crime \nprevention, security and assault awareness programs.\n  In 1994, Phylliss' outstanding record led to her appointment as a \nUnited States Marshal, the first woman ever to hold this position in \nthe state of Iowa, and for seven years, she served with distinction. \nShe was instrumental in leading building renovations projects in Des \nMoines and Davenport and in helping to finish up the Court Annex \nBuilding. She also led the initiatives to bring Iowa Communication \nNetwork access to the district.\n  And she was a one-woman army when it came to getting funding for \ncritical projects in the district and to stretching every dollar to its \nlimits. In a few years, she was able to automate the entire district \nwith limited funding. And during a time when the district was being hit \nhard by increases in prisoner populations and decreases in bed space, \nshe obtained a State of Iowa contract and greatly reduced the crisis \nneed for federal prison beds.\n  In addition, throughout her career, Phylliss has never been content \nto use her energy only in the workplace. She has contributed to \norganizations ranging from the Young Women's Resource Center, the \nInternational and Iowa Associations of Women Police, Children and \nFamilies of Iowa and many more. She even managed to find the time to \nco-found the Iowa Association of Women Police.\n  She has been honored by groups ranging from the Greater Des Moines \nYWCA to the Des Moines Metro Women's Network to the International \nAssociation of Women police and more. And it is my pleasure to add \nmyself to that list and offer my deepest gratitude for her long and \ndistinguished record of service to our State.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3848-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3848-S3851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       E-1417.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \na bill called ``The Nonresident Income Tax Freedom Act of 2001.''\n  My legislation would prohibit a state from imposing income taxes on \nincome earned within such state by nonresidents of such state.\n  Simply put, my bill bans state income taxes levied on nonresident \nworkers.\n  I am sure that every American has studied the Boston Tea Party.\n  In 1776, the 13 American colonies refused to pay unjust taxes and \ndeclared their independence from Britain.\n  The resulting American revolution was a revolution of ideas and \ntogether the 13 colonies created a government which derived its just \nauthority from the consent of the governed.\n  In 1764, Britain imposed the Sugar Act on the American colonies, that \ntax was followed by the Stamp Act and the Townshend Revenue Act.\n  The Stamp Act was essentially a paper tax of less than one cent, but \nthis tax inspired the formation of the Sons of Liberty, who burned the \nstamps in protest of the tax.\n  A tea tax was imposed on the American colonies of less than one cent, \nbut this tax motivated Bostonians to protest the tax in the Boston Tea \nParty.\n  The result of these British taxes were that Americans openly rebelled \nin order to fight those unjust taxes.\n  I am not comparing the current situation to the American revolution, \nbut I am proposing legislation consistent with the theme of the \nAmerican Revolution--No taxation without representation.\n  When a citizen from New Hampshire goes to work in Massachusetts or \nMaine or Vermont and pays their income tax, it is not reciprocated. We \ndon't have an income tax. We don't tax them. They don't live in that \nState, and, therefore, I don't believe they should pay that tax.\n  My bill will grant Federal protection for nonresident taxpayers and \nprohibit this taxation without representation.\n  I hope my colleagues will look carefully at this regardless of the \ntax situation in their own States. The State of Oklahoma, or the State \nof New Hampshire, or any other State has a perfect right to tax its \ncitizens in whatever way the citizens allow their elected \nrepresentatives. But the question is, Should the citizens of Wyoming or \nsome other State tell another State what taxes they should pay on their \ncitizens?\n  The problem exists today where workers from one State are being taxed \nby others, and these taxpayers have no vote. They have no say and no \nrecourse into how their income tax money is spent. Approximately 90,000 \nfrom New Hampshire go to Massachusetts and work. The taxes are \ncollected from them for Massachusetts income taxes. They have no \nrecourse. They have to pay those taxes.\n  As a matter of fact, New Hampshire residents pay over $200 million in \nincome taxes to Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont, all of which have \nincome taxes. New Hampshire doesn't. In 1999, Vermont imposed an income \ntax on 10,840 New Hampshire residents and raised $10.2 million in \nrevenue off the backs of New Hampshire workers who had nothing to say \nabout it, nor could they do anything about it.\n  In 1998, Massachusetts levied an income tax on 89,336 New Hampshire \nresidents and raised $184 million, again, off the residents of New \nHampshire.\n  And finally, in Maine, in 1998, 8,219 New Hampshire residents were \ntaxed and $9.3 million was raised in revenue.\n  This is taxation without representation. I am not trying to start \nanother Revolutionary War here, but it is not fair. I believe that \nwhether you have an income tax or not in your State, the issue is \nreally should you be able to levy an income tax against another citizen \nwho lives in another State.\n  In New Hampshire, we have always had a keen interest in taxes, as a \nmatter of fact, a keen interest in less taxes. One of the greatest \nGovernors in the history of our State, Gov. Meldrim Thomson, passed \naway last Thursday at the age of 89. Mel Thomson was a hero to many of \nus in the antitax movement. His campaign theme, when\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\nhe ran for Governor three times, was ``ax the tax.'' And that he did. \nHe fought taxes and cut taxes time and time again in our State. He \nhelped our State to assume that true ``live free or die'' tradition \nthat is so popular and so well known.\n  It is a strength that New Hampshire politicians have not allowed a \nState income tax to be levied on the hard-working residents of that \nState. People still do not understand it. They come to me and say: How \ncan you do this without an income tax? How do you get along? We do it \nthrough frugality and responsibility and taking care of the hard-earned \ndollars of our taxpayers.\n  As recently as last week, my friends in the New Hampshire State House \ndefeated a sales tax proposal. I congratulate them for it. The \nRepublican-led legislature knocked down a 2.5-percent sales tax which \nwould have helped Maine, Massachusetts, and Vermont to discourage their \nState citizens from coming across the border to shop because we would \nhave begun to get our States equalized in their taxes.\n  We have this great tradition in New Hampshire of less taxes, less \nspending, and fiscal responsibility. That is why I was pleased and \nproud just today--and I know the Presiding Officer's rating is high up \nin this rating; and I will check the rating--I was pleased today to be \ntold the National Taxpayers Union ranked me No. 7 in the Senate for \nfiscal responsibility on cutting spending, cutting taxes, and cutting \nregulations. It is an award of which I am very proud. But it is not so \nmuch me; it is tradition in New Hampshire.\n  If you advocate those sales taxes, if you advocate those income \ntaxes, if you advocate more taxes, you won't be reelected. There are a \nlot of people who said, let's have a sales or income tax, and they have \nbeen defeated and have not been heard from since, and many of them had \nto leave town.\n  I think it is rather unfortunate Governor Thomson passed away at the \nvery time President Bush--a man who Governor Thompson admired, and \nPresident Bush admired Governor Thompson as well; it was reciprocal--\nbut at the very time President Bush is proposing a $1.6 trillion tax \ncut for the American people, the man who led the ``ax the tax'' fight \nin New Hampshire has passed away. So President Bush has picked up the \ntorch from Governor Thomson, and New Hampshire is proud of that.\n  I am proud of President Bush's budget proposal to provide the typical \nfamily of four paying income taxes $1,600 in tax relief.\n  John Marshall said: ``The power to tax is the power to destroy.'' \nTaxes have to be used responsibly. As I said today, when I was asked \nabout the National Taxpayers Union rating, it does not mean we do not \nspend money. We do spend money. We have a responsibility to spend money \nfor our military, for those in need, or whatever. But we have to spend \nit responsibly. I think that is the key issue.\n\n  The taxers in New Hampshire's neighboring States are very clever. \nThey impose the income tax on New Hampshire residents without any fear \nwhatsoever of any political retaliation. It is really cowardice. The \nofficials there tax citizens from my State of New Hampshire who go into \nMassachusetts to work, and they cannot vote. They cannot vote. They do \nnot have any say about it. What can they do about it? It is not fair. \nWe ought to change it. I say that with respect to my colleagues no \nmatter what the tax status of your own State is. Tax all you want in \nyour State, but do not tax people from another State. And I think that \nis fair.\n  Today's average taxpayer faces a combined Federal, State, and local \nburden of nearly 50 percent of their income. I think that is a little \ntoo much. It is time for a change. This is one small way to help New \nHampshire citizens, as I know so many are trying to help all of our \ncitizens with tax cuts at the national level.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support George W. Bush's tax cut and my tax \nfairness initiative to give certainly New Hampshire citizens and all \nAmericans a little boost for their pocketbooks, so they can spend some \nmoney the way they would like to spend it, to have it in their pockets. \nThat $200 million in the pockets of taxpayers in New Hampshire can be \nused for a lot of things they would like to use it for, including \ncollege education, health care, putting money away for a rainy day, or \nwhatever.\n  I close by saying, my bill amends chapter 4 of title 4 of the U.S. \nCode to add a provision that says, ``a State or political subdivision \nthereof may not impose a tax on income earned within such State or \npolitical subdivision by non-residents of such State.'' In other words, \nif they are not your citizens, then you cannot tax them with an income \ntax. It explicitly allows a State, however--and this is a very \nimportant point--if two States want to enter into a voluntary compact \nor agreement to tax one another--if the two States agree--they can do \nthat. There is an exception for that if the two States agree.\n  This is consistent with the theme of ``no taxation without \nrepresentation'' because residents who become angry at politicians who \nvote for income tax compacts can vote the offending politician out of \noffice. That is why it is good.\n  I look forward to pressing hard on this and getting the attention of \nmy colleagues. It is my hope I can be a part of the President's push to \nrestore reason and good sense to the Federal tax law.\n  I ask my colleagues to support me on the Nonresident Income Tax \nFreedom Act of 2001 to help thousands of New Hampshire citizens who are \ntreated unfairly by taxation without representation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Ms. Snow, Mr. Reid, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Rockfeller, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 762. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for information technology training expenses \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, during the final months of the 106th \nCongress, the Senate and House completed action on the American \nCompetitiveness in the 21st Century Act which will respond to the \nshortage of skilled IT workers and help ensure our nation's continued \ngrowth and leadership in the information technology field. Congress \nincreased the cap on the number of H1B visas available for foreign \nworkers with high-tech skills to fill the job vacancies in information \ntechnology in the US.\n  As important as action by Congress to permit companies to hire \nforeign-born skilled IT workers is, this legislation by itself will not \naddress our long-term IT worker needs. Throughout the recent debate on \nthe IT worker shortage, I have urged that we focus our efforts on IT \ntraining and partnerships between the business and education \ncommunities. Many excellent partnerships between the IT community, \nstate and local government, high schools, and colleges and universities \nthat provide individuals of all ages with education and training \nopportunities in information technology are already underway.\n  Partnerships include ExplorNet, a non-profit organization working \nwith local community and school officials to train educators and \nstudents to rebuild computers; e-learning opportunities for IT training \nthrough more than 100 community colleges nationwide, including Bismarck \nState College; Cisco Systems Training Academies in many school \ndistricts; AOL/Time Warner Foundation's ``Time to Read'' literacy \nprogram; Green Thumb and Microsoft working with seniors to improve \ntheir IT skills; Great Plains Software's, Fargo, ND, partnership with \nValley City State University; and Texas Instruments sponsored training \nfor educators to improve technology skills in the classroom. These are \nexcellent examples of the IT and education communities working together \nto meet the growing demand for information technology skills.\n  Although these partnerships are helping to train individuals to fill \nmany IT job vacancies, these educational opportunities cannot keep pace \nwith the demand for workers with advanced technical skills--a demand \nthat continues for the long term despite our current economic slowdown \nand recent layoffs in the IT sector. Furthermore, continuing to rely on \nforeign workers who obtain H1B visas is not the answer to our shortage \nof skilled IT professionals.\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\n  A report of 685 companies released by the Information Technology \nAssociation of America ITAA, on April 2, 2001, confirms this continuing \ndemand for skilled IT workers. The ITAA assessment of the current IT \njob market, although reporting a significant decline in the demand for \nIT workers because of the economic slowdown, confirms there are \nthousands of positions that employers are not able to fill because \nfirms are unable to find workers with the necessary technical skills. \nThe study estimates there are currently 425,000 vacancies in the IT \nfield for skilled technical positions. Harris Miller, president, of \nITAA, remarked, ``. . . hiring has by no means halted for IT workers, \nrather, demand still far exceeds supply in this market. Miller \ncontinues to encourage individuals to pursue advanced technical \neducation programs. He remarked, ``this is actually the time to prepare \nyourself.''\n  Mr. President, in response to this continuing long-term demand for \nskilled IT workers, I am introducing legislation, the Technology \nEducation and Training Act of 2001, TETA, to provide a tax credit for \nbusinesses offering IT training and to enable individuals enrolled in \ncertified IT training to take advantage of the Hope Scholarship and \nLifetime Learning Credits. This legislation is similar to a bill that I \nintroduced in the 106th Congress, and I am particularly pleased that \nSenator Snowe is joining me again in this bipartisan effort as the \nprincipal cosponsor. Also joining me as cosponsors are Senators Reid, \nDeWine, Rockefeller, and Johnson, colleagues who have taken leadership \nroles in focusing attention on the importance of information technology \nfor our economy and encouraging IT education and partnerships.\n  I am honored that this legislation is also endorsed by a broad \ncoalition of IT, business and educational organizations, including \nComputing Technology Industry Association, CompTIA, the Technology \nWorkforce Coalition, the American Society for Training and Development, \nthe Information Technology Association of America, the Information \nTechnology Training Association, the Career College Association, the \nNational Association of Computer Consultant Businesses, Cisco Systems, \nNovell, Compaq Computer Corporation, Gateway and Microsoft.\n  Under our legislation, businesses would receive a credit against \ntaxes equal to 100 percent of the first $1,500 of information \ntechnology training expenses for non-degree IT skills certification on \nbehalf of a current or prospective employee. The credit would increase \nto $2,000 if the training program is offered in an empowerment zone, an \nenterprise community, an area declared a disaster zone, a school \ndistrict with 50 percent or more of students participating in the \nschool lunch program, a tribal community, a rural enterprise community, \ninvolves a small business with 200 or fewer employees or involves an \nindividual with a disability.\n  Additionally, this legislation would amend current law regarding the \nHope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning Credits to permit individuals \nenrolled in non-degree IT training programs and not attending a Title \nIV institution to be eligible to apply for the Hope Scholarship or \nLifetime Learning Credit. Under current law, individuals are not \neligible to take advantage of the Hope Scholarship or the Lifetime \nLearning Credits unless the programs are offered through a Title IV \nhigher education or proprietary institution.\n  In order to qualify for the Hope Scholarship or Lifetime Learning \nCredit, the IT training program must lead to certification in an IT \nskill similar to programs offered by Cisco, Microsoft, Novell, and \nCompTIA. Under the proposed changes in the Technology Education and \nTraining Act, the certification offered by the commercial information \ntechnology training provider must be approved by the Secretary of \nTreasury in consultation with an Information Technology Training \nCertification Board.\n  The shortage of skilled information technology workers will continue \nto be a major concern for all sectors of our economy despite the \ncurrent economic slowdown and the recent layoffs in the IT sector. Our \ncontinued growth and leadership in formation technology will depend on \na sufficient number of highly trained workers. Additionally, as \neconomies around the world rebound and countries, particularly in Asia, \ndevelop their own high-tech corridors, it will be difficult to continue \nto recruit high-tech workers from these countries to meet the needs of \nour own economy.\n  Rather than continue our dependency on the H1B program, I believe \nthat encouraging partnerships between the IT and education communities \nand authorizing additional incentives for businesses and individuals to \ntake advantage of IT skills training offers a more reasonable approach \nto meeting our long-term high-tech worker needs. The Technology \nEducation and Training Act authorizes important initiatives to respond \nto this critical shortage. I welcome additional cosponsors of this \nlegislation and urge my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to \nsupport the proposed changes in TETA during consideration of tax \nlegislation in the 107th Congress.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation along with \nstatements of endorsement for the Technology Education and Training Act \nfrom the Technology Workforce Coalition, the Information Technology \nAssociation of America, and the American Society for Training and \nDevelopment be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 762\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

On \n     Tuesday, the United States Senate introduced the ``Technology \n     Education and Training Act (TETA) of 2001,'' which gives \n     individuals and employers tax credits of up to $2,000 for IT \n     training expenses. Sponsored by Senators Kent Conrad (D-ND), \n     Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Mike DeWine (R-OH), and Harry Reid (D-\n     NV), TETA works to help individuals get needed IT training, \n     thus easing America's IT worker shortage.\n       ``Headlines may scream out high-tech layoffs, but the plain \n     fact is that IT jobs are going empty because there are not \n     enough skilled people to fill them,'' noted Grant Mydland, \n     Director of the Technology Workforce Coalition. Mydland \n     applauded the bill's introduction and urged Congress' quick \n     consideration and passage of TETA.\n       Essentially, TETA:\n       Provides a tax credit of up to $1,500 for IT training \n     expenses paid by employers\n       Amends the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits so \n     individuals can better access IT training courses at all of \n     the available institutions and training centers\n       Allows tax credits of up to $2,000 for small businesses, as \n     well as for people residing in and companies operating in \n     empowerment zones and other qualified areas\n       ``Nearly half of all IT jobs that will be created in 2001 \n     will remain vacant,'' Mydland added. ``IT drives our economy. \n     TETA gives individuals and companies the necessary \n     educational tools to meet America's rapidly evolving IT \n     needs. The Senate should be congratulated for its foresight \n     in addressing a significant challenge to U.S. prosperity and \n     growth.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Summary of the Technology Education and Training Act (TETA) of 2001\n\n Introduced by Senators Kent Conrad (D-ND), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), Mike \n DeWine (R-OH), Harry Reid (D-NV), and Representatives Jerry Weller (R-\n                        IL) and Jim Moran (D-VA)\n\n       Provides a tax credit for 100% of the first $1,500 of \n     information technology training expenses paid for by an \n     employer.\n       Amends the HOPE and Lifetime Learning tax credits to make \n     it easier for individuals to use these tax credits for \n     information technology training expenses.\n       The training program must result in certification.\n       The allowed credit would be $2,000 for small businesses and \n     all companies or individuals in enterprise zones, empowerment \n     zones, and other qualified areas.\n\n\n                    why this tax credit is necessary\n\n       According to a 1999 Comp TIA Workforce Study, as a result \n     of unfilled IT positions, the U.S. economy lost $105.5 \n     billion in spending that would have gone to salaries and \n     training, this reduced household income by $37.2 billion.\n       An estimated 268,740 (10%) of IT service and support \n     positions went unfilled in 1999, resulting in $4.5 billion \n     per year in lost worker productivity.\n       ITAA study released April 2, 2001, predicts a shortage of \n     425,000 of the 900,000 new IT workers needed in 2001.\n\n\n                      a public-private partnership\n\n       Allows the private sector to determine who, what, where and \n     how to train workers.\n       Helps individuals seek the training they need to enter or \n     re-enter the IT workforce.\n       Fills the IT worker pipeline with thousands of new and \n     retrained skilled IT workers.\n       Helps cities all across America fill thousands of available \n     IT jobs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n             The Information Technology Association of America\n\n     For Immediate Release, April 24, 2001.\n\n                ITAA Praises IT Training Tax Credit Bill\n\n       Arlington, VA.--The Information Technology Association of \n     America (ITAA) today hailed the Technology Education and \n     Training Act of 2001 introduced by Senators Kent Conrad, \n     Olympia Snowe, Mike DeWine and Harry Reid as a vital step \n     toward a permanent fix of the current high-tech workers \n     shortage in the U.S.\n       The bill would allow employers a $1500 credit against \n     income tax for expenses incurred by high technology job \n     training programs for employees, and a $2000 credit for small \n     businesses or all companies in enterprise zones or \n     empowerment zones. ITAA believes the bill would encourage \n     companies to go the extra mile in training U.S. workers for \n     high tech jobs.\n       ``Tax credits for business to train and retrain workers \n     mean more high-paying, high-tech jobs for American workers,'' \n     said ITAA President Harris N. Miller. ``The current high \n     vacancy rate for IT jobs represents thousands of missed \n     opportunities for American workers, and the impact of failing \n     to address this shortage can be felt as we see more\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\n     jobs shipped overseas. This bill is sound public policy.''\n       ITAA is the industry leader in combating the high-tech \n     worker shortage. In its latest study of the demand for IT \n     workers, When Can You Start?, ITAA found that the number of \n     needed IT positions in the U.S. had declined to 900,000 for \n     2001, with an expected vacancy rate of 425,000. While \n     substantially lower than in 2000, the study shows that demand \n     for approximately skilled high tech workers persists.\n       The Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) \n     provides global public policy, business networking, and \n     national leadership to promote the continued rapid growth of \n     the IT industry. ITAA consists of over 500 direct corporate \n     members throughout the U.S., and a global network of 41 \n     countries' IT associations. The Association plays the leading \n     role in issues of IT industry concern including information \n     security, taxes and finance policy, digital intellectual \n     property protection, telecommunications competition, \n     workforce and education, immigration, online privacy and \n     consumer protection, government IT procurement, human \n     resources and e-commerce policy.

A bill to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nimpose just and reasonable load-differentiated demand rates or cost-of-\nservice based rates on sales by public utilities of electric energy at \nwholesale in the western energy market, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, by now we know that there will not be \nenough electricity supply to meet demand in California this summer and \nthat there will be significant rolling blackouts.\n  As the peak summer demand for power in the State kicks in over the \nnext few months, the crisis is only going to deepen, and we may see \nelectricity prices in California and the Northwest reach unprecedented \nlevels.\n  And without intervention by the Federal Government, the price gouging \nthat has occurred over the past 6 months will almost certainly \ncontinue.\n  In fact, it looks like California will spend 10 times more for power \nin 2001 than it spent in 1999, an increase from $7 billion to $70 \nbillion.\n  And I predict that if left unchecked, these price spikes will spread \nto other states as well.\n  But despite the severity and scope of this crisis, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, FERC, has failed to take necessary steps to \naddress the problem.\n  Since last August, I have called upon FERC to impose a temporary \nwholesale price cap or cost of service-based rates on energy prices in \nthe Western market.\n  But FERC, an agency whose sole mission is to regulate the energy \nmarket, has refused to act. Today, we introduce this legislation to \nforce FERC to do its job.\n  Some have argued that a bill to control energy prices would remove \nincentives for companies to build additional energy generation, \nexacerbating the situation.\n  While I agree that we desperately need new supply, I believe that a \nprice cap would provide temporary price stability and reliability until \nthe market returns to normal.\n  And quite frankly, I think that with prices for power 10 times more \nthan they were in 1999, there is more than enough incentive for \nsuppliers to sell into the Western market.\n  With cost of service based rates, energy suppliers would generate \nsignificant profits and be guaranteed a reasonable rate of return.\n  With wholesale price caps, companies would be able to decide for \nthemselves whether it is profitable to produce at a given price.\n  In fact, the energy crisis we are now experiencing is marked much \nmore by the withholding of energy supply from the market than an \nunwillingness to build additional generation.\n  In fact, California expects to have 20,000 additional megawatts on \nline by 2004, enough power for 20 million additional people.\n  But because it takes 2-3 years to site new power generation, not \nenough energy can be brought online in time to help the situation this \nsummer.\n\n  Price controls, if done right, could actually bring more power into \nthe market.\n  Indeed, the temporary cost-based rates and/or the regional price cap \nthat Senator Smith and I are proposing will eliminate that incentive. \nThus, generators would have no reason to withhold power to the market.\n  With that said, let me talk briefly about what this bill would do: \nThe bill requires FERC to set either a temporary price cap or cost of \nservice based rates (with a reasonable rate of return). And make no \nmistake this bill is temporary; it is intended to get us through two \nsummers. In order to qualify, a state must allow its utilities to \nrecover costs from ratepayers and a state must pass electricity rates \nonto ratepayers. Though a state regulatory authority would still \ndetermine the manner in which wholesale rates are passed onto \nconsumers. In addition, the bill directs FERC to end the temporary \nsuspension of the natural gas transportation rate cap. Even today the \nprice of natural gas in Southern California is about 3 times the cost \nin neighboring San Juan, New Mexico, $13 Decatherm vs. $4.50 Decatherm. \nThe bill directs FERC to require that anyone selling natural gas in a \nbundled transaction into California to disclose the commodity and \ntransportation components of the price. When a company purchases both \nthe transportation and commodity components of natural gas, there is no \nreporting requirement as to the price of each transaction. The bill \nalso requires that all future orders to sell natural gas or electricity \nto an affected state must include a reasonable assurance of payment.\n  I am deeply disappointed that FERC will not do its job and protect \nconsumers and businesses in the West.\n  It is my hope that FERC will reconsider its opposition to price caps \nor cost-based rates. Price caps or cost-based rates may be the only way \nto prevent the further transfer of wealth from the Western region to \nenergy suppliers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. \n        DeWine):\n  S. 765.

A bill to extend the Brady background checks to gun shows, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Gun Show Background \nCheck Act of 2001. Along with twenty of my colleagues, I am offering \nthis legislation to renew the process of bringing some sense to our \nnation's gun laws by closing a loophole that has allowed criminals to \nbuy firearms at gun shows for far too long.\n  The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms reported to Congress last \nyear that gun shows are a major gun trafficking channel responsible for \nmore than 26,000 illegal firearms sales during an 18-month period. The \nFBI and ATF tell us again and again that convicted felons, domestic \nabusers, and other prohibited purchasers are taking advantage of the \ngun show loophole to acquire firearms.\n  Two years ago, after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 13 people \nat Columbine High School with weapons purchased from a private seller \nat a gun show, the United States Senate passed the Lautenberg amendment \nto close the gun show loophole. The legislation I am introducing today \nis identical to that Senate-passed amendment.\n  Under federal law, Federal Firearms Licensees are required to \nmaintain careful records of their sales, and under the Brady Act, to \ncheck a purchaser's background with the National Instant Criminal \nBackground Check System before transferring any firearm. However, a \nperson does not need a federal firearms license, and the Brady Act does \nnot apply, if the person is not ``engaged in the business'' of selling \nfirearms pursuant to federal law. These nonlicensees make up one \nquarter or more of the sellers of firearms at thousands of gun shows in \nAmerica each year. Consequently, felons and other prohibited persons \nwho want to avoid Brady Act checks and records of their purchases buy \nfirearms at gun shows.\n  My legislation incorporates recommendations made by the Department of \nJustice and the Department of the Treasury in their 1999 report on gun \nshows. The legislation would take several steps to make gun show \ntransactions safer for all Americans:\n  Definition of gun shows: Gun shows are defined to include any event \nat which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited for sale. This \ndefinition includes not only those events where firearms are the main \ncommodity sold, but also other events where a significant number of \nguns are sold, such as flea markets or swap meets.\n  Gun show promoters: Gun show promoters would be required to register \nwith the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, maintain a list of \nvendors at all gun shows, and ensure that all vendors acknowledge \nreceipt of information about their legal obligations.\n  Background checks for all transactions: The bill requires that all \nfirearms sales at gun shows go through a Federal Firearms Licensee. If \na nonlicensed person is selling a weapon, they would use an FFL at the \ngun show to complete the transaction. The FFL would be responsible for \nconducting a Brady check on the purchaser and maintaining records of \nthe transactions.\n  Improved firearm tracing: FFLs would be required to submit \ninformation necessary to trace all firearms transferred at gun shows to \nthe ATF's National Tracing Center, including the manufacturer/importer, \nmodel, and serial number of the firearms. However, no personal \ninformation about either the seller or the purchaser would be given to \nthe government. Instead, as under current law, FFLs would maintain this \ninformation in their files. The NTC would request this information from \nan FFL only in the event that a firearm subsequently becomes the \nsubject of a law enforcement trace request.\n  Some will say that this legislation is an attempt to end gun shows, \nbut the experience of states that have closed the gun show loophole \nproves otherwise. California, for example, requires not only background \nchecks at gun shows but a 10-day waiting period for all gun sales, yet \ngun shows continue to thrive there. No, we're not trying to end gun \nshows. What we are trying to end is the free pass we're giving to \nconvicted felons when they can walk into a gun show, find a private \ndealer, buy whatever weapons they want and walk out without a Brady \nbackground check.\n  In overwhelming numbers, the American people believe that background \nchecks should be required for all gun show sales. The people of \nColorado and Oregon confirmed this last fall when they approved ballot \ninitiatives to close the gun show loophole. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Gun Show Background Check Act of 2001 so that we can \nfinally close this loophole in every state and make sure that convicted \nfelons, domestic abusers, and other prohibited persons do not use gun \nshows to purchase firearms without a Brady background check.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 768. A bill to amend section 8339(p) of title 5, United States \nCode, to clarify the method for computing certain annuities under the \nCivil Service Retirement System which are based (in whole or in part) \non part-time service, and for other purposes, to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague in the \nHouse of Representatives, Congressman Jim Moran, in introducing \nlegislation to correct an error in the retirement benefits calculation \nfor certain part-time federal employees.\n  In 1986, Congress passed legislation to reform the retirement system \nfor the federal workforce, establishing the Federal Employees \nRetirement System to replace the Civil Service Retirement System.\n  Provisions in this legislation also revised the formula used to \ndetermine retirement benefits for employees with full time and part \ntime service in the federal government. Congress did not intend this \nchange to impact the existing workers who remained under the Civil \nService Retirement System.\n  Implementation of the provision, however, was misinterpreted by the \nOffice of Personnel Management. Affected employees are losing hundreds, \nand in some cases thousands, of dollars every year of the retirement \nbenefits they earned.\n  Many employees only became aware as they were about to retire that \nthey would not receive all of the benefits they were expecting. The \nimpacted federal workers had full-time service before 1986, and changed \nto part-time service for the end of their civil service career. Often \nthese employees cut back their hours to care for their families,\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\nor even delayed retirement and worked part-time to help an office \nduring a transition period.\n  The revised retirement formula calculates benefits for a federal \npart-time worker based on a full-time equivalent basis which is scaled \naccordingly. Benefits are based on a worker's high-three average salary \nduring his or her career. This could occur during an employee's part-\ntime service.\n  Civil service employees with pre-1986 full-time work and some part-\ntime work after 1986 do not receive the proper credit for their full-\ntime work, however, because full-time and part-time work are broken \ninto two parts. The full-time equivalent pay for the high-three years \nshould apply to an employees entire career. Instead, for the affected \nemployees, their pre-1986 full-time benefits are based on actual \nsalary. This two-step approach undervalues the worker's full-time \nservice.\n  The bill I am introducing today will correct this error by allowing \nan employee's full-time equivalent salary for their high-three years \napply to their entire careers, including pre-1986 service.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and these \nfederal employees for their dedicated service by ensuring they receive \nthe retirement benefits they have earned.\n  I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 768\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social security Act \nto allow up to 24 months of vocational educational training to be \ncounted as a work activity under the temporary assistance to needy \nfamilies program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nJeffords, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee in introducing legislation that seeks to add an important \nmeasure of flexibility to a provision of the Temporary Assistance for \nNeedy Families program, TANF, under the Personal Responsibility and \nWork Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. The legislation we are \nintroducing increases from 12 to 24 months the limit on the amount of \nvocational education training that a state can count towards meeting \nits work participation rate.\n  Under the pre-1996 Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, \nrecipients could participate in post-secondary vocational training or \ncommunity college programs for up to 24 months. While I support the new \nlaw's emphasis on moving welfare recipients more quickly into jobs, I \nam troubled by the law's restriction on post-secondary education \ntraining, limiting it to 12 months. One year of vocational education is \nan approved work activity, the second year of post-secondary education \nstudy is not.\n  The limitation on post-secondary education training raises a number \nof concerns, not the least of which is whether individuals may be \nforced into low-paying, short-term employment that will lead them back \nonto public assistance because they are unable to support themselves or \ntheir families. According to recent studies, this is exactly what has \nhappened in far too many cases. According to a March 13, 2001 report of \nthe Congressional Research Service, which is based on research \npublished in the 2000 Edition of the House Committee on Ways and Means \nGreen Book, although the majority of recipients who have left the \nwelfare rolls left because they became employed, most remained poor. \nThe research also revealed that the average hourly wage for these \nformer welfare recipients ranged from $5.50 to $8.80 per hour.\n  Study after study indicates that short-term training programs raise \nthe income of workers only marginally, while completion of at least a \ntwo-year associate degree has the potential of breaking the cycle of \npoverty for welfare recipients. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nthe median earnings of adults with an associate degree are 30 percent \nhigher than adults who have not achieved such a degree.\n  A majority of the members of the Senate has previously cast their \nvote in favor of making 24 months of post-secondary education a \npermissible work activity under TANF The Levin-Jeffords amendment to \nthe 1997 Reconciliation bill, permitting up to 24 months of post-\nsecondary education, received 55 votes--falling five votes short of the \nrequired procedural vote of 60. The amendment had the support of the \nNational Governors Association, NGA, and NGA's support continues with \nthe legislation Senator Jeffords and I are introducing today. I would \nalso like to make note of Senator Wellstone's efforts on this issue. He \nsubsequently proposed several modifications to TANF, including raising \nthe 12 month limit to 24 months, in an amendment to the 1998 Higher \nEducation reauthorization bill. The amendment passed the Senate but was \ndeleted during conference negotiations.\n  It is my hope that the Senate will again act favorably and \nexpeditiously on this legislation and that the House will support this \nmuch-needed State flexibility. We must do what is necessary to achieve \nTANF's intended goal of getting families permanently off of welfare and \nonto self-sufficiency.\n  In closing, I would like to present to my colleagues some examples of \nthe earnings that can be made upon completion of two years of training \nin a structured vocational or community college program. The following \nare jobs that an individual could prepare for in a two-year community \ncollege program, including the average starting salary for each \nnationwide.\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\n                   Average Starting Salary Nationwide\n\nDental Hygiene..................................................$31,750\nPhysical Therapy Assistant.......................................28,782\nComputer Programing..............................................28,000\nOccupational Therapy Assistant...................................27,624\nRespiratory Therapy..............................................26,877\nComputer Assisted Design.........................................26,890\nDrafting and Design..............................................24,800\nElectronic Technology............................................24,255\nCulinary Arts....................................................22,500\nEarly Childhood Development Assistant............................18,000\n\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to act with haste. The modification \nembodied in this legislation can give the states the flexibility they \nneed to help improve the economic status of families across America.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself and Mr. Allen):\n  S.J. Res. 13. A joint resolution conferring honorary citizenship of \nthe United States on Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, also known as \nthe Marquis de Lafayette; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nmake General Lafayette an honorary United States Citizen. This honor \nhas been bestowed on four other individuals including Winston Churchill \nand Mother Teresa.\n  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette \n(1757-1834) was born in France and was a wealthy French youth blessed \nwith every advantage offered by Europe's aristocracy. Although he was \nwealthy and among France's aristocracy, he risked his wealth and status \nto aid the Americans in their revolution against Great Britain.\n  At the age of 19, determined to dedicate himself to the cause of our \nliberty, he bought a ship and sailed to the American colonies to \nvolunteer his services. In early summer of 1777, soon after his \narrival, Congress voted him the rank and commission of Major General. \nJust two months later, Lafayette was wounded at the battle of \nBrandywine, forever endearing himself to the American soldiers.\n  Throughout the American Revolution, Lafayette acted as a liaison \nbetween France and the American colonies. He urged influential policy \nmakers to have France make the decisive military, naval and financial \ncommitment to the colonists. His tireless efforts, both as a liaison \nand a general, aided America in her time of need.\n  As a general, his military tactics lured British General Cornwallis \nand his army to Yorktown, Virginia. The American Army, led by General \nWashington, along with French forces led by Rochambeau, came south and \ntrapped Cornwallis and his troops at Yorktown. As a result, the British \nwere forced to surrender.\n  Lafayette's services to America extended beyond the battlefront. He \nworked diligently as an advisor, helping win concessions from Britain \nduring the Treaty negotiations. At Versailles, when negotiating with \nthe French government, our representatives Franklin and Jefferson found \nhim invaluable. Moreover, his impartial friendship was extended to the \nfirst eight U.S. presidents.\n  Despite his commitment to our Country, America did not recognize his \nUnited States' citizenship in his time of need. While crossing the \nFrench border into the Netherlands to escape arrest from the \nRevolutionary French Government, the Austrians captured and arrested \nGeneral Lafayette. Despite his claim that he was an American citizen \nbeing illegally detained, the Austrians disagreed. General Lafayette \nappealed to American ministers for help, but his calls for intervention \nwere not answered. Lafayette clearly felt that he was an America \ncitizen, and technically he may have been under the blanket \nnaturalization granted all citizens of each state when the Constitution \nwas ratified. The U.S. government, however, failed to acknowledge his \nclaim, and he spent the next five years in prison.\n  Although General Lafayette was made an honorary citizen by Virginia \nand Maryland before the United States Constitution was ratified, the \nUnited States failed to recognize his citizenship while he was \nimprisoned. I feel that we must set the record straight and honor \nGeneral Lafayette for his commitment to the United States by making him \nan honorary United States citizen. I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                             S. J. Res. 13\n\n       Whereas the United States has conferred honorary \n     citizenship on four other occasions in more than 200 years of \n     its independence, and honorary citizenship is and should \n     remain an extraordinary honor not lightly conferred nor \n     frequently granted;\n       Whereas Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, also known as the \n     Marquis de Lafayette or General Lafayette, voluntarily put \n     forth his own money and risked his life for the freedom of \n     Americans;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette, by an Act of Congress, \n     was voted to the rank of Major General;\n       Whereas, during the Revolutionary War, General Lafayette \n     was wounded at the Battle of Brandywine, demonstrating \n     bravery that forever endeared him to the American soldiers;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette secured the help of France \n     to aid the United States' colonists against Great Britain;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette was conferred the honor of \n     honorary citizenship by the Commonwealth of Virginia and the \n     State of Maryland;\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette was the first foreign \n     dignitary to address Congress, which honor was accorded him \n     upon his return to the United States in 1824;\n       Whereas, upon his death, both the House of Representatives \n     and the Senate draped their chambers in black as a \n     demonstration of respect and gratitude for his contribution \n     to the independence of the United States;\n       Whereas an American flag has flown over his grave in France \n     since his death and has not been removed, even while France \n     occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II; and\n       Whereas the Marquis de Lafayette gave aid to the United \n     States in time need and is forever a symbol of freedom: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Paul \n     Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, also known as the Marquis de \n     Lafayette, is proclaimed to be an honorary citizen of the \n     United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3864-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3864-S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 72--DESIGNATING THE MONTH OF APRIL AS ``NATIONAL \n                    SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Crapo, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Dodd, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nInhofe, Mr. Reid, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Graham, \nMr. Bingaman, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Daschle, \nMr. Levin, Mr. Baucus, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nKennedy, and Mr. Bayh) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               S.

Res. 33\n\n       Whereas charter schools are public schools authorized by a \n     designated public body and operating on the principles of \n     accountability, parent flexibility, choice, and autonomy;\n       Whereas in exchange for the flexibility and autonomy given \n     to charter schools, they are held accountable by their \n     sponsors for improving student achievement and for their \n     financial and other operations;\n       Whereas 36 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed laws authorizing \n     charter schools;\n       Whereas 35 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico will have received more than \n     $500,000,000 in grants from the Federal Government by the end \n     of the current fiscal year for planning, startup, and \n     implementation of charter schools since their authorization \n     in 1994 under part C of title X of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8061 et seq.);\n       Whereas 34 States, the District of Columbia, and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico are serving approximately 550,000 \n     students in more than 2,150 charter schools during the 2000 \n     to 2001 school year;\n       Whereas charter schools can be vehicles both for improving \n     student achievement for students who attend them and for \n     stimulating change and improvement in all public schools and \n     benefiting all public school students;\n       Whereas charter schools in many States serve significant \n     numbers of low income, minority, and disabled students;\n       Whereas the Charter Schools Expansion Act of 1998 (Public \n     Law 105-278) amended the Federal grant program for charter \n     schools authorized by part C of title X of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 8061 et seq.) to \n     strengthen accountability provisions at the Federal, State, \n     and local levels to ensure that charter public schools are of \n     high quality and are truly accountable to the public;\n       Whereas 7 of 10 charter schools report having a waiting \n     list;\n       Whereas students in charter schools nationwide have similar \n     demographic characteristics as students in all public \n     schools;\n       Whereas charter schools have enjoyed broad bipartisan \n     support from the Administration, Congress, State governors \n     and legislatures, educators, and parents across the Nation; \n     and\n       Whereas charter schools are centers of reform and serve as \n     models of how to educate children as effectively as possible: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges and commends the charter school movement \n     for its contribution to improving student achievement and our \n     Nation's public school system;\n       (2) designates the period beginning on April 30, 2001, and \n     ending on May 4, 2001, as ``National Charter Schools Week''; \n     and\n       (3) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the people of the United States to observe the \n     week by conducting appropriate programs, ceremonies, and \n     activities to demonstrate support for charter schools in \n     communities throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/24/senate-section/article/S3865-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3865]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
