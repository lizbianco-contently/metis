Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the \nsevere drought gripping much of our Nation. The situation is developing \ninto a national problem, a big problem that can no longer be ignored.\n  Last week in Nebraska, I met with farmers and livestock producers who \nhave witnessed firsthand the devastation caused by this drought. For \nmany agricultural producers in Nebraska and throughout America, hope is \nagain for this growing season. Their crops are wilted and their \npastures are scorched and bare. These producers need assistance. For \nthem, there are no options left. Drought is not just a Nebraska \nproblem; it is a national problem.\n  According to the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University \nof Nebraska, about 15 percent of the country experiences drought in a \ntypical year. Today, more than 40 percent of the entire country is \nsuffering from drought. The West is bone dry. ``Exceptional'' and \n``extreme'' drought, as it is termed by the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA, has ravaged the Southwest as well as \nWyoming, Montana, and parts of Texas. The Southern States, along with \nsections of New England, such as represented by the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, and the Mid-Atlantic States are also reeling from \ndrought.\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\n  This past spring was the driest in 107 years of data reporting in \nColorado and the second driest in Arizona and southern California. Keep \nin mind, it is only July 9. To add to this problem, the drought has \nbrought swarms of grasshoppers which are now infecting many parts of \nNebraska as well as the entire Midwest.\n  The economic effects of drought are often hard to measure. Unlike a \nhurricane or tornado, droughts area measured in years, sometimes \ndecades. The worst drought in recent memory, in the summer of 1988, \ncovered almost 40 percent of the entire United States. It cost an \nestimated $40 billion. Compare that to Hurricane Andrew in 1992, which \ncost about $30 billion.\n  The bad news is the current drought could be much worse than the \ndrought of 1988, considering we still must endure July and August, the \nhottest months of the year. Already, Nebraska is estimating at least \n$307 million damage to its economy, with the loss to crops and \npastureland alone estimated at $150 million. Again, this is only a \nmidyear estimate.\n  Government action is now necessary. Congress is quick to respond to \nfloods, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Now we must respond to this \nnational drought. Some of my colleagues may second-guess the need for \nadditional agricultural assistance. After all, Congress, for the past 3 \nyears, has provided billions of dollars for supplemental agricultural \nspending, mostly due to low commodity prices. Emergency payments were \nsupposed to cease with passage of the new farm bill this year.\n  Clearly, the new farm bill, which will spend an estimated $180 \nbillion or more over the next 10 years, provides almost no safety net \nfor farmers and ranchers hurt by drought. That is one of the farm \nbill's biggest faults, as Senators Roberts and Lugar pointed out often \nduring the farm bill debate on the floor of the Senate. Increased price \nsupports could not help much when there is no crop to be harvested.\n  During the Senate farm bill debate, Senator Lugar brought up the idea \nof expanded crop and livestock revenue insurance. Senator Roberts \ncalled for more emphasis on direct, decoupled, nonproduction-related \npayments. Both are solid, sound ideas, but Congress did not listen. Now \nwe must play with the cards we have dealt ourselves.\n  It is important we do not hold drought-plagued agricultural producers \nhostage to a shortsighted farm bill. The President said any new \nagricultural disaster aid must come from the $73.5 billion in new \nagricultural funding. I agree with the President. We should find the \nnecessary offsets for this new funding. But we must act quickly to find \nthe necessary disaster aid to help minimize the drought's impact on \nlocal economies. America will see a ripple effect on these economies. \nThe economies of many States are directly tied to agriculture and food \nproduction.\n\n  We are not limited to just an agricultural disaster package. There \nare other ways in which Washington is helping our agricultural \nproducers this year.\n  Secretary Veneman has been making disaster declarations for counties \nacross the country, which allows eligible agriculture producers to \nreceive emergency low-interest loans. She has approved grazing and \nhaying on Conservation Reserve Program acres throughout the country, \nincluding almost 40 Nebraska counties.\n  Also, I would like to remind my colleagues of an important bill \nrecently introduced by the senior Senator from New Mexico. Senator \nDomenici's National Drought Preparedness Act S. 2528 would move us away \nfrom the costly, ad-hoc, response-oriented approach to droughts to a \ncomprehensive, pro-active national drought policy. We need an \nestablished program that will allow local, State, and Federal \nGovernments to work together--to coordinate a drought preparedness \nstrategy.\n  Droughts do not happen overnight, and the damage they cause to the \neconomy and environment do not go away with one measurable rainfall. \nGovernment cannot bring an end to the drought or bring pastures and \ncrops back to life. But we can help our agriculture producers survive, \nweather this crisis, and prepare for the next growing season. With many \nof my colleagues in the House and Senate, I am working on an emergency \ndrought disaster package to bring before the Congress.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to help find a responsible way to get \nAmerica's agriculture producers the help they need--as soon as \npossible.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time do the Republicans have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republicans have 5 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Presiding Officer advise me if the time of the \nRepublicans has run out?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Republicans has \nexpired.\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6434-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6434-S6436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CORPORATE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss a \nmatter that is very related to the whole issue of corporate \nresponsibility. Sometimes the people do not connect the issue of the \nenvironment with corporate responsibility, but I am going to do that \nthis morning with the Senator from Illinois, as we touch on some of the \npolicies of this administration, which are really, in my view, putting \nus in a very dangerous situation in terms of taking a stand with the \ncorporate polluters versus the people of this country who deserve to \nhave protection from environmental hazards. This is not a discussion \nabout ideology, it is really a discussion about the checks and balances \nthat there have to be in this country so we can have robust economic \ngrowth along with the sense that there will be responsibility and \npeople will be protected.\n  I have found out, in my long history in politics, that in fact if you \nare good to the environment and if you care about the health and safety \nof people, you will have, actually, development of new businesses to \ndeal with pollution and you will have prosperity.\n  We go back in the environmental movement to the days when rivers in \nthis country were on fire, they had so many hazards in the waterways, \nsuch as in Ohio and other places. That is what started the Clean Air \nAct. We go back to the days when you could literally see the air in \nsome of our big cities. We turned it around in such a way that the \npeople benefited both from a healthier environment and a robust \neconomy.\n  So this argument that we should step away and no longer say to \ncorporations that pollute: You have a responsibility to clean up your \nmess--the fact that this administration seems to take that position is \nat odds with our history and is at odds with what we ought to be doing.\n  On Monday, July 1, a report by the Environmental Protection Agency \ninspector general was released stating that the EPA has designated 33 \nsites in 18 States for cuts in financing for the Superfund cleanup \nprogram. The reason this administration decided to do this is, frankly, \nthey are depleting the Superfund, which is a fund that is set up via a \nfee by polluting corporations, and the administration is not \ninterested, at least to now, in making sure that we have that fund, \nthat that fund is not depleted.\n  The report that was commissioned several months ago by Democrats in\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nthe House finally did come back. I have to say, as the chair of the \nSuperfund Subcommittee in the Environment Committee, we have been \ntrying to get this information from EPA for several months. We have not \nbeen able to get it. I thank my colleagues in the House for going to \nthe inspector general.\n  The 33 sites are National Priorities List sites, and they are among \nthe most toxic in the country. So instead of saying, we are going to \nclean them up, the administration is walking away from them.\n  What do these sites contain? Let me say, you may want to know this \ninformation but you would not want to get near it. The sites contain \narsenic, Agent Orange, dioxin, and industrial pesticides.\n  The report indicates that EPA's Atlanta regional office staff say \nthere is a bottleneck on new starts for cleanup and that there must be \nmaintenance of cleanup progress. The Dallas office reports they have \nproblems. They did not receive $56 million. The Kansas office says they \nneed $100 million. The Denver regional office at EPA says they did not \nget the $10 million they were to receive.\n  Here is the point. For an administration that says, trust the people \nwho are working in the field, this administration has turned its back \non their regional offices.\n  One of the excuses the administration comes up with--and then I will \nyield to my friend from Illinois--is that, well, it is true the Clinton \nsites were cleaned up--I have a chart showing progress that was made \nunder President Clinton. We see, in the last 4 years of his \nadministration, 88, 87, 85, and 87 sites. That is the number of sites \nthat were cleaned up. Under this administration, they told us, when we \nasked them, they wanted to clean up 75, 65, and 40 sites. Now it is 47, \n40, and 40 sites.\n  We are looking at a terrible diminution in the number of sites \ncleaned.\n  One of the things they say is: Well, there are no tough sites left. \nThey were cleaned up by Clinton.\n  So we did a little research. One of the sites that was cleaned up by \nthe Clinton administration is the Illinois site.\n  I want to bring this up so my colleague can hear this. The NL \nIndustries Corporation smelter site in Illinois was cleaned up. For \nthem to say they didn't clean up any hard sites is ridiculous. The site \nwas used for lead smelting operations from the turn of the century \nuntil 1983. It included 100 square blocks and 1,600 residences were \naffected. Ten percent of the children living near the site had blood \nlevels of lead above 10 micrograms, which is an unsafe level. The \nresponsible parties fought the EPA. We had to go to the Superfund to \nget the money. It was not a simple site. The cleanup was important for \nthe children. The site was cleaned up.\n  Why was it cleaned up? Because the Clinton administration used that \nSuperfund, and they were committed to cleaning up the site. I am sure \nmy colleague will attest to the fact that the site is quite different \ntoday.\n  That is the reality. That is why we are on the floor--because this is \na great program. It had some problems in the early stages. It wasn't \nmoving. But by 1992 it really started.\n  It is a sad day when I am here to tell you that this administration \nis not cleaning up its act.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the \nSenator from California for her leadership on this issue. I hope the \nSenator will bear with me for a moment. I think for those who are \nfollowing this debate, a little history goes a long way.\n  There was a time in America, in my home State of Illinois, when \npeople would strip-mine coal. They would literally drag the coal out \nfrom just below the surface and leave behind this terrible wasteland \nthat looked like craters on the Moon. Over time, people started saying: \nIt is not only ugly but the runoff is dangerous, and we ought to \nrequire the coal companies to restore the land after they have strip-\nmined so it can be used for something--so it looks a little bit like it \nlooked when God created it.\n  That really reflected a kind of change in the national conscience \nwhich said it isn't enough to take the land, or take parts of America, \nblight them, make them toxic and dangerous for someone to make a \nprofit.\n  We said, as we looked around America and found toxic waste and \nhazardous waste, that is a danger to our environment, to the people \nliving nearby and to the ground water. President Carter--a Democrat--\nsaid let us put together a Superfund tax where the corporations, the \nbusinesses which are polluting businesses, will pay a tax to pay for \nthe cleanup of the mess left from this industrial work.\n  The reason I wanted to get into this history a little bit is that, as \nI understand from staff, although it was passed by President Carter--\nobviously, a Democrat--and a Democratic Congress, a few years later, in \n1986, President Ronald Reagan--a Republican--not only reauthorized the \nsame program but said, yes, corporations around America should be held \naccountable; they should pay a fee or a tax to clean up the toxic waste \nsites across America through the Superfund. Not only did this \nRepublican President restore it, but he raised the tax. He said we need \nmore money to do this on a national basis.\n\n  Now we had a bipartisan commitment to this concept from a Democratic \nPresident, Jimmy Carter, and a Republican President, Ronald Reagan. \nThey assumed that America would stand behind the concept of corporate \nresponsibility when it came to environmental cleanup.\n  Now enter President Clinton at a later point. He said to Congress, we \nneed to reauthorize this same law to keep up this program. What he ran \ninto was a Republican Congress, a probusiness Congress, that said: We \ndon't believe that is the right thing to do any longer. So they \nwouldn't reauthorize the Superfund. The collection of about $2 billion \nor more a year to clean up America started evaporating as the taxes and \nfees were not being collected to clean up the polluted mess across \nAmerica. Now we are down to $25 million, or $26 million for all of this \nmess around America.\n  The Senator from California, in a bipartisan effort, I might add, \nwith Senator Chafee of Rhode Island, says we ought to reestablish the \nSuperfund. If it was good enough for Democratic President Carter and \nRepublican President Reagan, if Congress--Democratic and Republican--\nthought it was a good concept, why are we walking away from it?\n  When I was back home on the Fourth of July break, I went to two sites \nin Chicago. I went to one site in the southeastern part of the city. It \nis an industrial graveyard from an operation not many years ago, and \n75,000 manufacturing jobs are now gone. I went to the LTV Steel \nCorporation site, a company that declared bankruptcy just last \nDecember. I took a look at the toxic waste which the Superfund left \nbehind.\n  I went up to north to Waukegan. For over 20 years, Waukegan has been \ndealing with mercury and PCBs dumped into Lake Michigan--something we \nvalue as part of our national heritage. They are in a position of limbo \nwith a suspended mix of efforts to clean it up. It is within a stone's \nthrow of Lake Michigan. We pointed out the outboard marine site. \nWaukegan said this is a site which won't be cleaned up because the \nSuperfund is not being funded again by the Bush administration. They \nrefused to put the money into environmental cleanup.\n  That is irresponsible. It is irresponsible not to hold liable the \ncorporations that produce the chemicals that we find over and over \nagain at these sites. If they want to make a profit producing these \nchemicals, is it unreasonable to suggest they pay a fee so they can \nclean up the aftermath of the use of these chemicals which have \nblighted parts of America?\n  I say to the Senator from California, as we view this issue, some \nsay: There go the Democrats again with their outlandish environmental \npolicies. But if you look at the history, this has been a bipartisan \napproach from the start. I ask the Senator from California, who has \nbeen our leader on this issue, if she could comment on that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Illinois \nfor his eloquence on this subject. Again, this isn't really a \ntheoretical thing at all. We see the progress that has been made during \nthe last 8 years. It is amazing to look at the difference because there \nwere, frankly, problems with the Superfund Program for a while. They \nweren't really doing a good job of it.\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n Under Carol Browner began a shake-up, and they began to get through \nall the problems.\n  Here we are. My friend is right. This is not only important for the \nenvironment, and not only bipartisan, as he pointed out, but it is \nreally, in my view, a probusiness situation. When they leave behind a \nmess such as this, then they go somewhere else and go before the \nplanning commission in some little place in Illinois, or California, or \nLouisiana, and this big company XYZ wants to come in and do some work \nover here with a plant, what is their record? Now the county supervisor \nor the planning commission can look back and say: Oh, my God, the XYZ \ncompany left a mess in California. The truth is that the company is not \ngoing to be welcomed.\n\n  To me, it is probusiness to clean up your mess. It is going to help \nyour business. It is, in fact, a part of corporate responsibility. It \nis our responsibility to make sure that polluters pay.\n  I want to share a chart with my friend that shows what has happened \nwith this program.\n  In 1995, 82 percent of the cleanup was paid by industry. Either \nthrough responsible parties coming forward and paying for the mess they \nmade, or the Superfund itself--as my friend points out, as opposed to \nthe dollars that are collected from a fee on polluters--only 18 percent \nhad to be made up by the general taxpayers.\n  By 2003, if the situation continues to deteriorate under this \nPresident, 46 percent of the cleanup is going to be paid for by our \nconstituents who had nothing to do with the dumping of those materials. \nThis should fall on the people who made the mess. The polluters should \npay. It is part of the Superfund.\n  As we talk about corporate irresponsibility and as we talk about ways \nwe can put confidence back into the system, we shouldn't forget that \ncorporate responsibility is reflected in the Superfund Program. It has \nbeen reflected. It has been a successful program. That is why it was \nembraced by many Republicans. That is why I hope it will be again \nembraced by many, although I am very concerned, frankly, that the \nbipartisan nature of this is slipping away in this atmosphere today.\n  I am very proud to have Senator Chafee of Rhode Island as the key \nRepublican sponsor of the Superfund legislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for one last question, is this \nnot the same basic concept as protecting pensions? If a corporation \naccepts the responsibility of going into business, hiring people, \nmaking a promise that the people who work for them when they retire \nwill have a pension, then that corporation violates its trust and \nresponsibility and destroys the pension, like the Enron officers \ncashing in on stock while the pensioners were losing everything they \nhad in their 401(k)s isn't this a similar situation where if a business \nin America says, I want to create a business here and I want to try to \nmake a profit and I am going to hire people to do it, isn't there kind \nof a social contract involved here that says: You can't pollute the \nland and walk away from it as part of doing business in America; part \nof your responsibility as a corporation is to take responsibility for \nkeeping that natural heritage we all respect so much protected.\n  Eliminating Superfund takes away the responsibility of these \ncorporations to clean up their own mess and says no to the families at \nlarge and businesses across America: It is now your responsibility.\n  It seems to me, whether we are talking about pensions or the \nenvironment, corporate responsibility really applies at the same level. \nI ask the Senator from California, does she see a distinction here? I \ndo not.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is an excellent analogy. If a corporation makes \ncertain promises to the people they employ and that is part of the \ncontract and if a corporation comes into a community to be a good \nneighbor and that is part of the deal, then they should not walk away \nfrom either. That is why it is important sometimes that the Government, \nthe House and Senate, the President, make sure that we get in and \nrestore justice.\n  Talk about justice, a lot of these sites--take a look at the sites \nshown in purple on the chart--are the major polluted sites. They are in \nevery State but North Dakota. My State has the second number. New \nJersey has the first. Illinois is up there, unfortunately. There are \nmany States that are affected.\n  We are talking about walking away from a lot of places when we \ndeplete the Superfund. We are walking away from ``polluter pays.''\n  I thank my friend. There is a definite analogy to be made. He has \nmade it very clearly, as he usually does when we talk about the issue \nof corporate responsibility.\n  Today we are concentrating on the WorldComs and Global Crossings and \nthe Enrons and Arthur Andersens and the ImClones. We know those names \nnow. Those names and what is behind those names has propelled us in the \nSenate to take up the very important Sarbanes bill. The Leahy bill will \nbe added, and the bill will become the Sarbanes-Leahy bill. We have \nbeen propelled into action because of, as President Bush says, these \nbad actors.\n  I think it goes beyond that to the system. There are no checks and \nbalances in that system. If we don't have a Superfund, I say to the \nSenator, we have no check and balance on those bad actors who would \nwalk away.\n  Let me say to my friend, is he familiar with that site I talked about \nthat was cleaned up?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am. I say to the Senator from California, we have three \nSuperfund sites in the State of Illinois, another 18 that must go on \nthe list, and 6 others we think could be eligible. Frankly, if the Bush \nadministration's proposal goes through, it means no Superfund, no \nmoney, no cleanup. That means the public health hazard will remain.\n  Today the President will go to New York to talk about corporate \nresponsibility. He wants to throw the bad actors in jail. That makes \nsense. The simple fact is, an actress accused of shoplifting in \nCalifornia is facing potentially more prison time than any officer of \nEnron is facing today. I might say, if the President's premise, his \nprinciple is sound, why do we stop and say it is just when it comes to \naccounting? If a corporation walks away from its responsibility in \nterms of cleaning up the environmental mess they have left behind, why \naren't we talking about that as being the kind of misconduct that \nshould not only be condemned but punished?\n  Instead, the administration has said: We don't even want to hold them \nliable for paying for it. No penalty, no crime, they are not even going \nto be liable for paying for the cleanup.\n  The Senator from California has made the point so well today: \nCorporate responsibility goes way beyond accounting. It goes into the \nhandling of pensions. It goes into the environmental responsibility \nthat corporations have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6436-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 2673, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2673) to improve quality and transparency in \n     financial reporting and independent audits and accounting \n     services for public companies, to create a Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board, to enhance the standard setting \n     process for accounting practices, to strengthen the \n     independence of firms that audit public companies, to \n     increase corporate responsibility and the usefulness of \n     corporate financial disclosure, to protect the objectivity \n     and independence of securities analysts, to improve \n     Securities and Exchange Commission resources and oversight, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Daschle], for Mr. Leahy, \n     for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Harkin, \n     Mr. Cleland, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Biden, Mr. Feingold, \n     Mr. Miller, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Corzine, and Mr. \n     Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 4174.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Leahy and others, \nI offer this amendment which is identical to the Corporate and Criminal \nFraud Accountability Act, S. 2010, passed unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee some time ago.\n  I view the Leahy amendment as a necessary complement to the Sarbanes \nbill. In fact, I think of them as two parts of a vital whole--one \nelement guarantees the truth and honesty of corporate accounting. The \nother is a deterrent. It says that corporate misrepresentation will be \nforcefully punished--with jail time.\n  We need both. We need to improve oversight and independence of the \naccounting profession and hold corporate wrongdoers accountable for \ntheir actions.\n  We need to act comprehensively to fulfill our promise to the American \npeople that integrity, honesty, and accountability will be restored to \nour markets.\n  Last week Senator Leahy and I wrote to the President requesting his \nviews on this bill and the Sarbanes accounting reform bill.\n  Unfortunately, the President has not answered our letter yet. But I \nhope to hear today--and I think we need to hear today--that he supports \nand will sign both.\n  We welcome the President's apparent new enthusiasm for reforming our \ncorporate culture, and we look forward to working with him.\n  The administration needs to understand that the time for half \nmeasures has long passed. The American people expect and deserve \ncomprehensive reform.\n  Combining the Leahy bill and the Sarbanes bill accomplishes just \nthat. The Sarbanes bill revamps the regulatory structure that protects \nour markets. There will be better rules and a new oversight body to \nsend corporations and accountants a clear message that they must tell \nthe truth on their balance sheets.\n  The Leahy bill is every bit as vital. Let me summarize a few of its \nprovisions very quickly. The amendment has three aims: punishing \ncriminals; preserving evidence; and protecting victims.\n  The Leahy amendment punishes criminals by creating a tough new 10-\nyear felony for securities fraud. It provides prosecutors with a new \ntool that is flexible enough to keep up with the most complex new fraud \nschemes and tough enough to deter violations on the front end. It also \nprovides a mechanism to raise the fraud sentences that are already on \nthe books.\n  The amendment also preserves evidence of fraud. It creates two new \ncriminal anti-shredding provisions in federal law. As we say in the \nArthur Andersen case, even the most straight-forward obstruction of \njustice cases can be difficult to prove under current law.\n  Senator Leahy's bill closes the loopholes and makes document \ndestruction in fraud cases an unambiguous crime.\n  The amendment does not just protect ``paper evidence,'' it also \nprotects valuable testimony from people. For the first time, the Leahy \nbill creates federal protection for whistleblowers. People like Sherron \nWatkins of Enron will be protected from reprisal for the first time \nunder federal law. This bill is going to help prosecutors gain \nimportant insider testimony on fraud and put a permanent dent in the \n``corporate code of silence.''\n  Finally, the amendment will protect victims of fraud. By extending \nthe time period during which victims can bring cases to recoup their \nlosses, the Leahy bill removes the reward for those fraud artists who \nare especially gifted at concealing what they've done for lengthy \nperiods of time.\n  Cases where victims have lost their entire life savings should be \ndecided on the merits, not based on procedural hurdles that may now be \nused to throw legitimate victims out of court.\n  The Leahy bill also prevents fraud artists from declaring bankruptcy \nto shut out their victims. The amendment would accomplish this by \nmaking security fraud debts nondischargeable in bankruptcy.\n  Again, the Leahy provisions enjoyed broad bipartisan support in the \nJudiciary Committee when passed unanimously in April. They are needed \nnow more than ever, as the number and magnitude of corporate \nmisstatements continues to pile up and the lost jobs, lost pensions, \nand ruined lives continue to mount.\n  We must act to punish criminals, no matter what color their collar. I \nhope all Senators will support this amendment.\n  Madam President, the country will be listening intently to what the \nPresident says this morning. A crucial test will be whether he \nexplicitly supports--and pledges to sign--the Sarbanes bill with the \nLeahy legislation attached. We cannot restore confidence in the \nintegrity of our markets with anything else.\n  Senator Leahy is on the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I very much appreciate what my good \nfriend, the distinguished majority leader, has said. I also compliment \nhim for his leadership on corporate accountability. Sometime ago, he \nasked the Chairs of the various committees with possible jurisdiction \nin this area to get together and craft comprehensive legislation. I \nrecall that meeting very well. I recall the majority leader--back at \nthe time of Enron, before WorldCom and these other business scandals \ncame forward--expressing his concern that not only is this a blight on \nthe business community, it is a blight on our system of doing things. \nHe also spoke about how terrible it was for those people, not only \nworkers who had their pensions tied up in the fortunes of the companies \nthey are working with and are relying on for truthfulness--what they \nassumed is the truthfulness--of the accounting statements of those \ncompanies, but also many other people who invest, whether it is a \nfarmer in South Dakota or a merchant in a small town in Vermont who is \nputting savings in and hoping this will be part of his retirement.\n  The majority leader made it very clear to all of us that we were to \nset politics aside, we were to set any kind of special interests aside, \nand we were to bring up the best legislation possible for the people of \nAmerica. That was what Senator Daschle charged us to do, and that is \nwhat I am trying to do with this amendment.\n  We have excellent accounting reform legislation, S. 2673, crafted by \nChairman Sarbanes and the Senate Banking Committee. I commend Senator \nSarbanes and the other members of the Banking Committee--for their \nbipartisan leadership. Senator Sarbanes had people on both sides of the \naisle come out with this legislation, and I am proud to cosponsor it.\n  My amendment is to add to Senator Sarbanes' legislation, not to \ndetract from it. As he knows, I offered to add a criminal penalty and \nother provisions that are within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senator McCain and the majority \nleader, Senators Durbin, Harkin, Cleland, Levin, Kennedy, Biden, \nFeingold, Miller, Edwards, Boxer, Corzine, Kerry, Schumer and \nBrownback. Our amendment is identical to S. 2010, the Corporate and \nCriminal Fraud Accountability Act that was reported unanimously by both \nRepublicans and Democrats in the Judiciary Committee on April 25.\n\n  Again, following the very clear direction the distinguished majority \nleader gave us when he said we have to protect the people of this \ncountry, we have to make sure corporate America can do its best to help \nour economy, this would create tough new penalties for securities fraud \nand would preserve evidence of fraud to make sure there is \naccountability for crimes that not only cheat investors but rob the \nmarkets themselves of the public trust. The markets have stolen the \npublic's trust.\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\n  According to press reports, President Bush has changed his mind on \ncorporate reform and may support new penalties for corporate fraud, and \nI welcome the President's change of heart. The Corporate and Criminal \nFraud Accountability Act creates tough, new, criminal penalties for \ncorporate fraud, and Senator Daschle and I have written to the \nPresident asking for his support.\n  The time for watching and hand-wringing is over. We have to take \naction to start the slow but critical process of restoring confidence \nin the books of our publicly traded companies.\n  The collapse of Enron has become a symbol of a corporate culture \nwhere greed has been inflated and accountability devalued. \nUnfortunately, Enron is no longer alone. Joined by Arthur Andersen, \nGlobal Crossing, Tyco, Xerox, and, most recently, WorldCom, the \nmisrepresentations about the financial health of our Nation's largest \ncompanies have shaken confidence in our financial markets.\n  If we do nothing to learn and apply the repeated lessons of the last \nmonths, we are only going to compound the problem. That was obviously \nthe belief of the unanimous Judiciary Committee vote when the committee \napproved S. 2010. Innocent consumers, investors, and employees depend \non stock investments for their children's college funds, for their \nretirement nest eggs, and for their savings. Every week brings news of \na new financial scandal. Just look at the effect on the stock market. \nIt has been devastating. This has repercussions not just for companies \nthat depend on our capital markets to grow their businesses and our \neconomy, but certainly also for the average American family. More than \none in every two Americans invest in our financial markets, and they \nare watching what we do here. They deserve action.\n  Those who defraud investors should be held accountable for their \ncrimes. The Leahy-McCain amendment, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud \nAccountability Act, is all about accountability and transparency--two \nbedrocks of our market.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair states that the majority leader has \nyielded for a question only while retaining the floor. Is that the \nintent of the majority leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it was my intention to yield for a \nquestion, but I thank the distinguished chair of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his extraordinary leadership and the effort he has made \nto bring this legislation to the floor.\n  This is the Leahy amendment and, as I noted, it passed unanimously in \nlarge measure because I think he was able to work with our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle.\n  I am happy to yield the floor so he and others may seek recognition.\n  Mr. LEAHY. My question would be this to the majority leader: Would he \nagree, in his experience, that nothing would focus the attention more \nof those executives who have defrauded their own companies and \ninvestors than the idea that they would actually go to jail for it, and \nnot walk off with hundreds of millions of dollars?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, it is for that reason that I believe \nthis package ought to be viewed in its entirety. The Sarbanes bill lays \nout the framework. The Leahy bill lays out the penalties for violating \nthat framework. So I don't know that you can have one without the other \nand not have a complete package.\n  So I appreciate very much the work of the Judiciary Committee, and \nthe chair of the Judiciary Committee especially, for the work in \nallowing this package to come to the floor. I thank him again for the \ncontributions he made.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I seek recognition in my own right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4175 to Amendment No. 4174\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the rule on recognition? Is it not the Senator who \nseeks recognition first?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands that the managers of the \namendment are entitled to be recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. On my amendment? May I be recognized on my own amendment \nwhich is pending before the Chair? Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers of the legislation have priority.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas, the manager of the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Would the managers of the amendment include the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Kentucky? Is he one of the managers?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The managers of the legislation are the \nSenator from Maryland and the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Presiding Officer has recognized, \nhowever, the Senator from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has recognized the Senator from \nTexas. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm], for Mr. McConnell, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4175 to amendment No. 4174.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will continue.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to make sure people understand \nwhat the Leahy-McCain amendment is. I realize there may be those who \nwant to amend it to make life easier.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from Vermont suspend? The \nregular order is the reading of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to calling off the reading \nof the amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for certification of financial reports by labor \n  organizations and to improve quality and transparency in financial \n  reporting and independent audits and accounting services for labor \n                             organizations)\n\n       At the end of the amendment add the following:\n\n     SEC. 302.

The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, so people understand what the Leahy-\nMcCain amendment is, it is the Corporate and Criminal Accountability \nAct. It is about accountability, and it is about transparency. I think \neverybody--investors, corporate managers, or anybody else--will tell \nyou that accountability and transparency are the bedrock of our \neconomy, of our markets.\n  If one is going to invest in a company, one wants to know what the \ncompany does and what the books say. One wants to be able to rely upon \ntheir reports.\n  Transparency will instill confidence, and accountability helps \nenforce transparency and forthright financial decisions. We do not just \nrely on the better angels of our nature; we rely on the fact that \nsomebody is going to be there to enforce it.\n  We cannot stop greed, but we can stop greed from succeeding. This \nbipartisan amendment is going to send wrongdoers to jail and save \ndocuments from the shredder, and that sends a powerful and clear \nmessage to potential wrongdoers: Don't do it.\n  The measure enjoys wide support. The amendment is supported by law \nenforcement officials, regulators, and numerous whistleblowers, and \nconsumer protection advocates. I have letters of support from these \nadvocates, and I will, at the end of my statement, ask consent to print \nthem in the Record.\n  Let me summarize some of the provisions. This bipartisan amendment \nhas three prongs to restore accountability: punishing and preventing \nfraud, preserving the evidence of fraud, and protecting victims of \nfraud.\n  S. 2010, as unanimously reported, accomplishes these goals in a \nnumber of ways. It is going to create a tough new Federal felony for \nsecurities fraud for a 10-year maximum penalty. The idea of 10 years in \nthe slammer is going to focus the attention of those who are more \ninterested in taking their money and hiding it in offshore bank \naccounts.\n  As one who was a prosecutor, I was surprised to learn that unlike \nbank fraud, health care fraud, and even bankruptcy fraud, there is no \nspecific Federal crime of securities fraud to protect victims of fraud \nrelated to publicly traded companies.\n  Can you imagine, Madam President, while all this talk has been going \non, it turns out there is no specific crime of securities fraud. This \nbill would create such a felony with a tough 10-year jail sentence.\n  The amendment provides for a review of the existing sentencing \nguidelines for fraud cases and for organizational misconduct to make \nthem tougher as well.\n  The new crimes and enhanced criminal penalties in this bill were \nworked out among Senators Hatch, Schumer, and me, and unanimously \nsupported by the Judiciary Committee, and I thank Senators Hatch and \nSchumer for their support.\n  The Leahy-McCain amendment also creates two new anti-shredding \npenalties which set clear requirements for preserving financial audit \nguides and close loopholes in current anti-shredding laws.\n  These provisions close loopholes in current laws and set a clear \nrequirement that corporate audit documents must be saved for 5 years. \nWe, incidentally, picked that time period because that is the statute \nof limitation for most Federal crimes.\n  These provisions are crucial in preventing recurrences of what \nhappened at Arthur Andersen.\n  These provisions will preserve evidence that helps law enforcement \nofficers and prosecutors focus immediately on the evidence. It takes a \nfew minutes to warm up the shredder, but it can take years for \nprosecutors and victims to put together a case without key documents.\n\n  The amendment protects corporate whistleblowers. Senator Grassley and \nI worked out these bipartisan measures in the Judiciary Committee. I \nthank the Senator from Iowa for his assistance and his constant \nleadership over the years on whistleblower rights.\n  When sophisticated corporations set up complex fraud schemes, \ncorporate insiders are often the only ones who can disclose what \nhappened and why.\n  Unfortunately, the Enron case also demonstrates the vulnerability of \ncorporate whistleblowers to retaliation under current law. This is a \nmemo from outside counsel to Enron management. They were afraid there \nmight be a whistleblower. It said:\n\n       You also asked that I include in this communication a \n     summary of the possible risks associated with discharging (or \n     constructively discharging) employees who report allegations \n     of improper accounting practices.\n\n  Then he goes on to give them the good news:\n       Texas law does not currently protect corporate \n     whistleblowers. The supreme court has twice declined to \n     create a cause of action for whistleblowers who are \n     discharged. . . .\n\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\n\n  In other words, if they dare tell about corporate misdeeds, fire \nthem, it is not going to hurt.\n  After this high-level employee of Enron reported improper accounting \npractices, the Enron executives were not thinking about firing the \naccountants who were doing wrong; they wanted to fire the \nwhistleblower, their own employee. Why? Because they were pocketing the \nmoney. They were getting that money out to their bank accounts as fast \nas they could, and they did not want anybody to say so.\n  The bipartisan whistleblower protections are supported by the \nNational Whistleblower Center, the Government Accountability Project, \nand Taxpayers Against Fraud. They call S. 2010 ``the single most \neffective measure possible to prevent further recurrences. . . . ''\n  The measure lengthens the statute of limitation by extending it from \nthe earlier of 1 year from discovery or 3 years from the fraud to 2 \nyears from discovery or 5 years from the fraud.\n  Senators Feinstein and Cantwell worked hard to craft a fair \ncompromise on this provision in the Judiciary Committee.\n  Indeed, the last two SEC Chairmen from both parties, Arthur Levitt \nand Richard Breeden, both agreed that the current short statute of \nlimitations is unfair to fraud victims.\n  Attorney General Christine Gregoire testified before the Judiciary \nCommittee in the Enron State pension fund litigation that the current \nshort statute has forced some States to forego claims against Enron.\n  In Washington State alone, the short statute of limitations could \ncost hard-working State employees--firefighters and police officers--\nnearly $50 million in lost Enron investments.\n  Last week, Xerox announced it was restating its revenue back 5 years \nby $6.4 billion. Madam President, as a law student, I remember sitting \nin the gallery listening to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Dirksen, give his well-known speech: ``A billion here and a billion \nthere, and soon you're talking about real money.''\n  Imagine a corporation claiming they made a mistake in their revenue \nof $6.4 billion for the past five years. The disclosures raise the \nspecter of innocent investors who, through no fault of their own, will \nbe barred from recouping losses.\n  We make the debt from security law violations nondischargeable in \nbankruptcy. We protect fraud victims by amending the bankruptcy code to \nmake judgments and settlements based upon security law violations \nnondischargeable. Corporate leaders should not be allowed to take the \nmoney, run, file bankruptcy, and keep from ever paying any securities \nfraud judgment. The State security regulators strongly support this \nchange. You cannot have one set of rules which say if you steal $500 \nfrom a store, you can go to jail. But if you steal $50 million from the \ncorporate boardroom, keep the money. That makes no sense. Everywhere I \nwent in the State of Vermont last week, people were saying: If I \ncommitted an act, if I stole something, if I cash a bad check for $100, \nI run the risk of going to jail.\n  But what do you do if you get $50 million or $100 million? You are \nhome free.\n  Criminal conduct deserves criminal penalties. Corporate CEOs who rob \ntheir company, who rob the pension funds of their employees, who rob \nthe trust of the American people, are criminals. They ought to go to \njail.\n  The steel bars, maybe that will give a conscience to some of these \npeople like Kenneth Lay and others who obviously do not have one. This \ngives prosecutors, the investigators, and victims the tools to hold \ncorporate wrongdoers accountable.\n  The people who are involved in such massive criminal activity ought \nto pay. The American people ought to know they will have to pay. If \nthey don't, there will be a whole lot more fraud.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have a number of letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Taxpayers Against Fraud,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n\n                            Government Accountability Project,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: The Government Accountability Project (GAP) \n     and the Taxpayers Against Fraud (TAF) reaffirm our support \n     for the Leahy Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability \n     amendment to S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform \n     and Investor Protection Act of 2002.\n       Initially introduced as S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal \n     Fraud Accountability Act, was unanimously reported by the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on May 6, 2002. This amendment is \n     a landmark proposal. It promises to make whistleblower \n     protection the rule rather than the exception for those \n     challenging betrayals of corporate fiduciary duty enforced by \n     the Securities and Exchange Commission. It would be the \n     single most effective measure to prevent recurrences of the \n     Enron and Worldcom debacles as well as similar threats to the \n     nation's financial markets, shareholders and pension holders.\n       GAP is a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest law firm \n     dedicate since 1976 to helping whistleblowers, those \n     employees who exercise freedom of speech to bear witness \n     against betrayals of public trust that they discover on the \n     job. GAP has led the campaign for passage of nearly all \n     federal whistleblower laws over the last two decades. TAF is \n     a nonprofit, nonpartisan public interest organization \n     dedicated to combating fraud against the Federal Government \n     through promotion and use of the federal False Claims Act and \n     its qui tam whistleblower provisions. TAF supports effective \n     anti-fraud legislation at the federal and state level.\n       The Leahy amendment to S. 2673 is outstanding good \n     government legislation. It closes the loopholes that have \n     meant whistleblowers proceed at their own risk when warning \n     Congress, shareholders, and their own management's Board \n     Audit Committees of financial misconduct threatening the \n     health of their own company, investor confidence and the \n     nation's economy. We hope we can count on your support to add \n     this state of the art whistleblower protection system in S. \n     2673. If you have any questions regarding the Leahy \n     amendment, please call Tom Devine at GAP (202-408-0034 ext. \n     124), or Doug Hartnett (ext. 136).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jim Moorman,\n                                          Executive Director, TAF.\n                                                       Tom Devine,\n     Legal Director, GAP.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         North American Securities\n\n\n                            Administrators Associations, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: NASAA supports S. 2673, The Public \n     Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act of \n     2002, and opposes efforts to weaken its provisions. State \n     securities regulators believe there is an immediate need to \n     restore investor confidence in our securities markets.\n       Passage of the Leahy amendment, which incorporates S. 2010, \n     the Corporate and Criminal Fraud and Accountability Act of \n     2002, into the accounting reform bill would send a strong \n     deterrent message to potential securities violators by \n     providing prosecutors with new and better tools to punish \n     those who defraud our nation's investors. Our focus is on \n     Section 4, which would prevent the discharge of certain debts \n     in bankruptcy proceedings. At the present time, the \n     bankruptcy code enables defendants who are guilty of fraud \n     and other securities violations to thwart enforcement of the \n     judgments and other awards that are issued in these cases.\n       We support passage of the Leahy amendment because it \n     strengthens the ability of regulators and individual \n     investors to prevent the discharge of certain debts and hold \n     defendants financially responsible for violations of \n     securities laws. This issue is of great interest to state \n     securities regulators, and we hope you'll support it on the \n     Senate floor.\n       In addition, state securities regulators enclose Title V of \n     S. 2673--Analyst Conflicts of Interest--in its current form \n     and strongly oppose any amendment to this title that would \n     reduce our ability to investigate wrongdoing and take \n     appropriate enforcement actions against securities analysts. \n     An amendment drafted by Morgan Stanley was circulated that, \n     we believe, would have prohibited state securities regulators \n     from imposing remedies upon firms that committed fraud, if it \n     involved securities analysts and perhaps even broker-dealers \n     that deal with individual investors. Clearly this approach is \n     ill-advised, especially in today's climate. What message \n     would be sent to Main Street investors if the states' \n     investigative and enforcement authority were weakened? \n     (Additional information on this proposal was delivered to \n     your office last week.)\n       Please vote for passage of S. 2673, for the Leahy \n     amendment, and against any amendments to curtail state \n     securities enforcement actions.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joseph P. Borg,\n       NASAA President, Alabama Securities Director.\n     Christine A. Bruenn,\n       NASAA President-elect, Maine Securities Administrator.\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                  American Federation of Labor and\n\n\n                          Congress of Industrial Organization,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Legislative Alert!\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The sudden and spectacular collapse of \n     Enron has jeopardized the retirement security of millions of \n     hardworking Americans and exposed systemic failures of our \n     securities laws. If we are to prevent future Enrons and \n     restore the credibility of America's capital markets, \n     aggressive reform is required. This week the Judiciary \n     Committee will markup S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal \n     Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, which is an important part \n     of this effort and deserves your support.\n       The measures embodied in S. 2010 will help protect working \n     families and their retirement funds from future Enrons by \n     strengthening the penalties for securities and accounting \n     fraud, and destruction of audit papers. The bill provides \n     strong civil and criminal penalties for conduct such as \n     document shredding by auditors and conspiracies to defraud \n     investors; and bars those who commit securities fraud from \n     using the bankruptcy system to avoid compensating the victims \n     of such fraud. It also lengthens the statute of limitations \n     for civil lawsuits by the victims of securities fraud, making \n     it more difficult for those who commit these crimes to escape \n     having to compensate their victims.\n       S. 2010 is an important part of the comprehensive reforms \n     Congress needs to enact in response to the conflicts in the \n     capital markets exposed by the collapse of Enron. The AFL-CIO \n     urges you to support S. 2010 at this week's Judiciary \n     Committee markup.\n           Sincerely,\n     William Samuel\n       Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Consumers Union,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Re Support for S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud \n         Accountability Act of 2002\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation \n     of America urge your support for S. 2010, the Corporate and \n     Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, sponsored by \n     Senator Patrick Leahy, when it comes before the Judiciary \n     Committee for markup on Thursday. This proposal adds \n     important provisions to the civil and criminal laws, which \n     will both, deter and when necessary, punish securities fraud.\n\n\n        Enhancing Enforcement and Sanctions for Securities Fraud\n\n       S. 2010 takes the following important steps to strengthen \n     enforcement and penalties for securities fraud:\n       It creates a new felony for the act of defrauding \n     shareholders of publicly traded companies.\n       It creates a new felony for destruction of evidence or \n     creation of evidence with intent to obstruct a federal agency \n     or criminal investigation.\n       It provides whistleblower protection to employees of \n     publicly traded companies when they act lawfully to disclose \n     information about fraudulent activities within their company.\n       It enhances the ability of state attorneys general and the \n     SEC to use civil RICO to enforce existing law; currently only \n     the US attorney general has such authority currently under \n     RICO.\n\n\n              Adopting a Realistic Statute of Limitations\n\n       S. 2010 also increases the ability of defrauded investors \n     to recover their losses by lengthening the statute of \n     limitations. The bill would set the statute of limitations to \n     the earlier of 5 years after the date of the fraud or three \n     years after the fraud was discovered.\n       The current statute of limitations, the result of a 5-4 \n     vote in a 1991 Supreme Court decision, sets up an \n     unrealistically short timetable for bringing private suits \n     and needs to be corrected. Former President Bush's SEC \n     Chairman Richard Breeden, former President Clinton's SEC \n     Chairman Arthur Levitt, and state securities regulators have \n     all supported an extension of the statute of limitations.\n       Suits by defrauded investors have long been recognized by \n     securities regulators, including former SEC Chairman Levitt, \n     as an important deterrent against fraud. Moreover, securities \n     fraud is often well-concealed and not readily apparent to \n     investors until, in some cases, years after the fraud has \n     been committed. As Chairman Levitt testified in 1995 before \n     the Senate Banking Committee, ``Extending the statute of \n     limitations is warranted because many securities frauds are \n     inherently complex, and the law should not reward the \n     perpetrator of a fraud who successfully conceals its \n     existence for more than 3 years.''\n       Justices O'Connor and Kennedy, in their vigorous dissent in \n     the 1991 Supreme Court case, also supported a longer statute \n     of limitations. Justice Kennedy wrote, ``The most extensive \n     and corrupt schemes may not be discovered within the time \n     allowed for bringing an express cause of action under the \n     1934 Act. Ponzi schemes, for example, can maintain the \n     illusion of a profit-making enterprise for years, and \n     sophisticated investors may not be able to discover the fraud \n     until long after its perpetration . . . By adoption of a \n     three year period of response, the Court makes a 10(b) action \n     all but a dead letter for many injured investors who by no \n     conceivable standard of fairness or practicality can be \n     expected to file suit within three years after the violation \n     occurred. In so doing, the Court also turns its back on the \n     almost uniform rule rejecting short periods of response for \n     fraud-based actions.''\n       Indeed, some states' pension funds may have to forego \n     claims against Enron for securities fraud that occurred in \n     the late 1990s because of this short statute of limitations. \n     Washington State's Attorney General discussed this problem \n     when she testified before your Committee in February of this \n     year. ``In fact, for Washington State, our claim in the \n     [Enron] case is for approximately $50 million, when in fact \n     our losses are in excess of $100 million. But because of the \n     statute of limitations, we're not able to make that claim.'' \n     (underlining added).\n       The current statute of limitations rewards those who are \n     able to conceal their fraud for a relatively short time with \n     immunity from private liability. It also includes a limit of \n     one-year from the time of discovery, which encourages a rush \n     to the courthouse.\n       The criminal conduct surrounding the collapse of Enron, and \n     the fact that many claims for fraud will be time-barred by \n     the current short statute of limitations, have drawn \n     attention to the need for reform. S. 2010 includes important \n     investor protection measures. We urge your support for this \n     bill in the Judiciary Committee April 18.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Sally Greenberg,\n                                                   Senior Counsel.\n                                                  Travis Plunkett,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              U.S. Public Interest\n\n\n                                               Research Group;\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2002.\n     No More Enrons--Support S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal \n         Fraud Accountability Act of 2002\n       Dear Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee: We are \n     writing on behalf of the members of state Public Interest \n     Research Groups to urge your strong support for S. 2010, the \n     Corporate and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, \n     sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, when it comes before the \n     Judiciary Committee for markup on Tuesday. This proposal adds \n     important provisions to the civil and criminal law to both \n     deter and, when necessary, punish securities fraud. Please \n     oppose weakening amendments.\n       S. 2010 takes the following important steps to strengthen \n     enforcement and penalties for securities fraud:\n       It creates a new felony for the act of defrauding \n     shareholders of publicly traded companies.\n       It creates a new felony for destruction of evidence or \n     creation of evidence with intent to obstruct a federal agency \n     or criminal investigation.\n       It provides whistleblower protection to employees of \n     publicly traded companies when they act lawfully to disclose \n     information about fraudulent activities within their company.\n       It enhances the ability of state attorneys general and the \n     SEC to use civil RICO to enforce existing law; currently only \n     the U.S. attorney general has such authority currently under \n     RICO.\n       Importantly, S. 2010 also increases the ability of \n     defrauded investors to recover their losses by lengthening \n     the statute of limitations. The bill would reasonably and \n     sensibly set the statute of limitations to the earlier of 5 \n     years after the date the fraud occurred or three years after \n     the fraud was discovered. A securities law violation is often \n     a complex, multi-year enterprise. Indeed, Enron's recent \n     accounting restatements went back five years. Under the \n     fraudster-friendly current law, some state pension fund \n     claims against Enron may be time-barred.\n       S. 2010 includes numerous important investor protection \n     measures to assist whistleblowers, fraud victims, and law \n     enforcement agencies. We urge your strong support for this \n     bill to help restore investor confidence in the Judiciary \n     Committee April 18. Please oppose weakening amendments.

Maria Cantwell,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Cantwell: The National Whistleblower Center \n     strongly supports S. 2010, the Corporate and Criminal Fraud \n     Accountability Act of 2002. This law would protect employees \n     who disclose Enron-related fraud to the appropriate \n     authorities.\n       One of the most notorious loopholes in current \n     whistleblower protection law exists under the securities \n     laws, in which employees who report fraud against \n     stockholders have no protection under federal law. It is\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n     truly tragic that employees who are wrongfully discharged \n     merely for reporting violations of law, which may threaten \n     the integrity of pension funds or education-based savings \n     accounts, have no federal protection.\n       This point was made abundantly clear by the recently \n     released internal memorandum from attorneys for Enron. \n     According to Enron's own counsel, employees who were blowing \n     the whistle on Enron's misconduct were not protected under \n     federal law, and could be subject to termination. \n     Unfortunately, the Enron attorney was correct.\n       It is imperative that the next time a company like Enron \n     seeks advice from counsel as to whether they can fire an \n     employee, like Sharon Watkins (who merely disclosed potential \n     fraud on shareholders), the answer must be a resounding \n     ``no.'' That can only happen if the Corporate and Criminal \n     Fraud Accountability Act is enacted into law.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                                 Kris J. Kolesnik,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                          of Attorney General,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 3, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: It has come to my attention that the \n     substance of S. 2010, the Corporation and Criminal Fraud \n     Accountability Act of 2002, will be offered as an amendment \n     to S. 2673, the Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor \n     Protection Act of 2002, as early as next week.\n       I have attached a letter to Senator Leahy from seven \n     Attorneys General written last April in support of the \n     substance of S. 2010, in order to make these views known as \n     you consider this legislation.\n       If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to \n     call Blair Tinkle, NAAG's Legislative Director at 202-326-\n     6258.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Lynne Ross,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                            Attorneys General,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: We would like to take this opportunity \n     to express our support for your bill, S. 2010, the Corporate \n     and Criminal Fraud Accountability Act of 2002, which is \n     pending before the Senate.\n       As you know, the proposal would allow state Attorney's \n     General to seek to enjoin racketeering activities under the \n     federal RICO statute. Such added authority would enhance the \n     ability of Attorneys General to protect their citizens from \n     unlawful activities by organizations both within and outside \n     the borders of our individual states.\n       In addition, to restore accountability, S. 2010 provides \n     prosecutors new and better tools to effectively prosecute and \n     punish criminals who defraud investors by:\n       Creating a new, 10-year felony specifically aimed at \n     securities fraud.\n       Enhancing fraud and obstruction of justice statutes where \n     evidence is destroyed and in fraud cases, where there are \n     many victims or where any victim is financially devastated.\n       Creating two new document destruction felonies establishing \n     a new felony shredding crime and requiring the preservation \n     of audit documents for 5 years.\n       Creating new protections for corporate whistleblowers.\n       Finally, the bill protects victims' rights by:\n       Protecting securities fraud victims from discharge of their \n     debts in bankruptcy.\n       Extending the statute of limitations in securities fraud \n     cases.\n       We appreciate your efforts to enact this important \n     legislation. Please feel free to contact us if we can provide \n     further assistance in this effort.\n           Sincerely,\n         Carla J. Stovall, Attorney General of Kansas, President \n           of NAAG; Hardyress, Attorney General of Oregon, \n           Chairman, Enron Bankruptcy Working Group; Christine \n           Gregsire, Attorney General of Washington; William H. \n           Sorrell, Attorney General of Vermont; Ms. Edmonds, \n           Attorney General of Oklahoma, President-Elect of NAAG; \n           Thurbert E. Baker, Attorney General of Georgia; Betty \n           D. Montgomery, Attorney General of Ohio.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the distinguished majority leader introducing \nthis amendment and yielding to me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. I was going to send an amendment to the desk but I \nunderstand there is one pending. I ask unanimous consent I have up to 8 \nminutes to discuss this amendment now, which I will send later.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I probably will \nnot, I hoped for an opportunity to briefly explain the second-degree \namendment that is pending at the desk. If the Senator thinks it might \nbe helpful just to determine the order of discussion, perhaps it is \nmore appropriate to discuss the amendment that is pending over one that \nmight have been pending.\n  Mr. MILLER. The Senator from Kentucky is correct. I would like to get \nin the queue somewhere along the line.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the question of the Senator from Kentucky, How long \ndoes the Senator from Kentucky wish to speak?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will be happy to wrap up in 5 or 6 minutes. I want \nto summarize what the amendment is about.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Kentucky be recognized for 5 minutes to speak to the second-degree \namendment that has been offered, that is pending, and that be followed \nby the Senator from Georgia to speak for 8 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wonder if I may be recognized after \nthe sequence that has been discussed for about 1 minute.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the original request \nof the Senator from Maryland?\n  Mr. REID. I do not object to the original 13 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky will proceed.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Georgia. I will briefly discuss \nthe second-degree amendment. I expect to vote for the underlying bill, \nbut we ought to, in the name of equity, apply the same principles in \nthe underlying bill we are seeking to apply to corporations to labor \nunions.\n  The amendment I sent to the desk requires union financial statements \nto be audited by an independent accountant using procedures that mirror \nthose of public companies under Federal securities laws. It imposes \ncivil penalties for violations of these new auditing requirements that \nmirror those imposed on the Security Exchange Act of 1934. Third, it \nrequires that the Union President and Secretary-Treasurer certify the \naccuracy of financial reports, mirroring a similar requirement for CEOs \nand CFOs in the Sarbanes bill.\n  We are debating how to better oversee and enforce the audit \nrequirements for large corporations that were first established under \nthe Securities Act of 1933. It may shock many to learn that labor \nunions are not even required to have independent audits of the \nfinancial statements they file with the Department of Labor--or should \nI say that they are required to file. Many unions apparently thumb \ntheir nose at the requirement. A study by the Office of Labor \nManagement Standards found that 34 percent of all unions filed late \nfinancial reports or no reports at all.\n  If we are serious about protecting the investing public from the \nfinancial fraud of corporations and accountants, we should be equally \nserious about protecting the day-to-day American worker--the plumbers, \nthe machinists, the longshoremen, and the steelworkers--from the \nfinancial fraud of union officials.\n  One prominent union official recently said that:\n\n       Over the coming months you will no doubt hear more about \n     the Enron scandal and the many thousands of people who have \n     lost their pensions because of corporate greed.\n\n  I agree with that. What we do not hear enough of are the stories of \nunion greed. It is only fair to share some of them today. I have a \nrather long list I will discuss later in the debate, but let me cover a \nfew of them in my allotted time. We have heard of Arthur Andersen, but \nhas anyone heard of Thomas Havey? That is the accounting firm where a \npartner confessed to helping a bookkeeper conceal the embezzlement of \nhundreds of thousands of dollars from a worker training fund of the \nInternational Association of Ironworkers. And in an eerie parallel to \nthe Enron scandal, the Havey accountants revealed startling \ninformation--10 years ago, the then General Counsel for the Ironworkers \nUnion said that if the accounting firm refused to assist in the union \nscheme to conceal financial mismanagement, the accounting firm should \nbe fired. Sadly, the accounting firm complied.\n  We have all heard of Global Crossing, but has anyone heard of ULLICO? \nThat is the multibillion-dollar insurance company owned primarily by \nunions and their members' pension funds that invested $7.6 million in \nGlobal Crossing. Apparently, ULLICO directors received a sweetheart \ninvestment deal that allowed them to make millions on the sale of \nstock. The union pension\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nfunds, however, dried up with Global Crossing's demise.\n\n  There is much more. An accountant within the National Association of \nLetter Carriers embezzled more than $3.2 million from union funds over \nan 8-year period to buy 8 cars, 2 boats, 3 jet skis, a riding mower, \nand 105 collectable dolls. A former official of the Laborers' Union \nDistrict Council in Oregon, Idaho, and Wyoming is in jail for accepting \nhundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks for directing money into \na ponzi-like investment scheme that defrauded Oregon labor unions of \n$355 million.\n  I have a number of additional examples that I wish to get to later, \nbut I do want to say in summary, again, what my amendment is about, \njust so everyone will understand as we move subsequently to a vote. It \nfirst requires union financial statements to be audited by an \nindependent accountant using procedures that mirror those of public \ncompanies under the Federal securities laws; second, it imposes civil \npenalties for violations of these new auditing requirements that mirror \nthose imposed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and, third and \nfinally, it requires that the Union President and Secretary-Treasurer \ncertify the accuracy of their financial reports, which mirrors a \nsimilar requirement for CEOs and CFOs in the Sarbanes bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, there is a special statutory arrangement \nthat governs labor organizations. I take it this proposal--has this \ncome to us from the Department of Labor?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to the Senator from Maryland, it did not come \nfrom the Department of Labor. It came from my office. This is something \nwe have been looking at over the last week or 10 days, thinking that, \nsince the very worthwhile requirements of corporations and accounting \nfirms, under the bill of the Senator from Maryland, make sense if we \nare looking to protect investors, we should also protect union members \nfrom similar kinds of casual exploitation.\n  Mr. SARBANES. But under the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure \nAct, the Department has certain authorities it can invoke in dealing \nwith the kind of problems the Senator has outlined. At least that is my \nunderstanding under the current state of the law. Is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't know what the position of the Department of \nLabor is on the amendment I am offering. But it is my belief that if \nthe amendment were not necessary, we would not be offering it here \ntoday. This is something I am sure we are going to discuss further as \nwe move along.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am sure the Senator would be able to find out from \nthe Secretary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I expect I could find out from the Secretary of Labor, \nbut I chose not to do that.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't know whether you could or not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. She has her job and I have mine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4176\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside so I be allowed to offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Miller] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4176.\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to require the \nsigning of corporate tax returns by the chief executive officer of the \n                              corporation)\n\n       At the end add the following new title:\n\n                   TITLE VIII--CORPORATE TAX RETURNS\n\n     SEC. 801. SIGNING OF CORPORATE TAX RETURNS BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE \n                   OFFICER.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6062 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (relating to signing of corporation returns) is \n     amended by striking the first sentence and inserting the \n     following new sentence: ``The return of a corporation with \n     respect to income shall be signed by the chief executive \n     officer of such corporation.''.\n       (b) Executive Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to returns filed after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  There is a little bit of confusion. I want to be sure he is setting \naside the entire amendment, the Leahy and the McConnell amendment, and \nhe is offering a first-degree amendment? That is what I understood when \nI talked to the Senator and to what I had agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the Chair's understanding.\n  Mr. SARBANES. No. What was the request? I thought the unanimous \nconsent request was to set aside the McConnell amendment and offer the \nMiller amendment to the Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It was the pending amendment.\n  Madam President, I wanted to be sure that we set aside both Leahy and \nMcConnell. This is a new issue, a first-degree amendment. That was the \nbasis that I understood it on and on the basis of that I had no \nobjection to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair understands the Senator from Georgia \nwas going to offer an amendment that would be considered at a different \ntime, an independent first-degree amendment, to be spoken about now and \nconsidered at a later time. Is that the understanding of the Senator \nfrom Vermont?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure I fully \nunderstand. What is the request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no request pending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sorry. I thought there was a request to lay aside my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request has been granted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. But then my--what is the parliamentary situation with my \namendment? Maybe that is the best way to ask it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia obtained the consent \nto set aside the pending amendment in order to offer a first-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I understand.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the call for the regular order at the completion \nof the statement of the Senator from Georgia, or disposition of his \namendment, bring back before the body the Leahy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it would.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator from Georgia spoke to me earlier. I do not \nwant in any way to interfere with that. I do want to accommodate him. I \njust wanted to make sure, also for my own schedule, where we stood.\n  I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer and I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee and of course I thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Madam President, there is a good old boy from down in Georgia named \nJerry Reed, who went to Nashville several years ago and made it big as \na tremendous guitar picker, singer, and songwriter. He had a big hit a \nwhile back. Maybe some of you remember it. It was called ``She Got the \nGold Mine and I Got the Shaft.''\n  I thought about that song of Jerry Reed's as I watched what has \nhappened lately on the corporate scene. The big shots of Enron and \nWorldCom and others, they got the gold mine while the poor employees \nand the innocent stockholders got the shaft.\n  If a picture is worth a thousand words, take a look at this gold \nmine. It was built partly on the backs of those Georgia schoolteachers \nwho, each month, put their hard-earned money into the Georgia teachers' \nretirement fund. The fund in Georgia lost $78 million from Enron and \nanother $6 million from WorldCom. Think how many monthly contributions \nby how many struggling teachers that represents. And think about those \nother thousands of employees who have lost their life savings, not even \nto mention the thousands of employees who have lost their jobs--at \nleast 450 jobs were wiped out in Georgia alone so far.\n  Yes, a few big shots got the gold mine and a lot of little folks got \nthe shaft.\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\n  I am as probusiness as anyone in this body. I yield to no \nofficeholder when it comes to supporting business issues. As Governor \nand Senator, I have worked to give tax cuts and tax incentives and pay \nfor the training of their employees--all to provide a probusiness \nenvironment in which the entrepreneurial spirit can thrive and prosper \nand create jobs. But, folks, there comes a time when so much greed and \nso many lies become so bad--even if it is only by a few--that something \nmeaningful has to be done. We must act quickly to protect the investor, \nprovide some security for the worker, and restore confidence in the \nmarketplace because, make no mistake about it, today we have a crisis \nin the integrity of corporate America.\n  That is why I have worked with Senator Sarbanes in perfecting his \nbill, and I strongly support it. I am pleased that it is before us this \nweek. I also commend President Bush for making the strong \nrecommendations he is going to be making in New York.\n  But I think we need to do at least one other thing, so I have a \nsimple amendment. It is only two short paragraphs in length, but it \ngoes to the very essence of fairness. It simply says that, when the \ntaxman cometh, we all--workers and high-dollar bosses alike--must face \nhim just alike, without any go-betweens or liability firewalls or \ncorporate veils.\n  This is how it would work. There is a standard tax form called 1040. \nI know there are more sophisticated ones for big business, but the \nprinciple I am getting at is the same. This is what it says:\n\n       Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined \n     this return and accompanying schedules and statements, and to \n     the best of my knowledge and belief they are true, correct \n     and complete.\n\n  And then it is signed here by Joe Sixpack. Joe Sixpack of America \nsigns those kinds of forms. There were more than 14 million of those \nforms filed in April. If Joe Sixpack is required to sign this oath for \nhis family, why shouldn't Josepheus Chardonnay be required to sign that \nsame oath for his corporation?\n  So my little amendment simply requires that henceforth the chief \nexecutive officer of all publicly owned and publicly traded \ncorporations must sign the corporation's annual Federal tax return.\n  Currently, there is an IRS rule that corporations can designate any \ncorporate officer to sign their tax return. That will not get it. Let's \nbe specific. Let's put it into law: The CEO is the one who is to sign \nthe tax return and must be accountable for it.\n  Where I come from it is expected that those being paid ``to mind the \nstore'' should at least know whether the store is losing or making \nmoney.\n  Harry Truman had a sign on his desk in the Oval Office that said, \n``The Buck Stops Here.'' For Truman, it meant that he was accountable.\n  He took the blame. He suffered the consequences when things went bad.\n  For some of today's CEOs, it is just the opposite. They want no \naccountability. They shift the blame to others. They hide behind that \ncorporate veil. And, it seems, they rarely if ever pay the \nconsequences.\n  Their former workers cancel plans for their children to go to college \nwhile they sip from champagne flutes in their mansions in Boca and \nAspen.\n  For these CEOs, Truman's famous sign has changed from ``The Buck \nStops Here'' to ``The Bucks Go Here.''\n  Our system of collecting taxes is based upon the premise that \nindividual taxpayers will take all steps necessary to ensure that the \nfinancial information in the tax return is accurate.\n  If Joe Sixpack fudges the numbers, he doesn't get a pass from paying \npenalties or going to jail. I find it outrageous that the same is not a \npart of the mind set for those in the corporate culture.\n  If any CEO is not willing to sign the company tax return--if they are \nnot willing to take steps to satisfy themselves that their corporation \nis accurately reporting financial information--then those CEOs have no \nright to the prestige and respect that goes with the position they \nhold.\n  What is good for the goose is good for the gander. So I urge my \ncolleagues to simply hold our CEOs to the same standard that we now \nimpose upon our average wage earners.\n  Treat them the same, ``Treat 'em'' the same. That is the American \nway. That is what the voters out there want us to do and that is what \nthey expect us to do. ``Treat 'em'' the same.\n  And you can take that back home this summer and explain it. Some of \nthese other reforms, I fear, will be more difficult to explain.\n  Treat 'em the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6444-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6444-S6451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n S.J. RES. 34--APPROVAL OF YUCCA MOUNTAIN DEPOSITORY MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, in accordance with the rules of the \nSenate as set forth in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, Senator Bingaman, introduced S.J. Res. 34 on \nApril 9. The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held 3 days of \nhearings. On June 5, the measure was favorably reported to the Senate.\n  As the ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \npursuant to the recommendations of the committee and in accordance with \nthe rules of the Senate as set forth in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nthat contemplates Senate action within 90 days of introduction, I now \nmove to proceed to S.J. Res. 34.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, during the last little bit we have been \nworking on an orderly way to proceed on this matter. We knew before the \nbreak that the minority was going to bring this matter up, and we did \nnot know exactly when.\n  I spoke a couple times yesterday with the distinguished Republican \nleader. I spoke to my colleague, Senator Ensign, on a number of \noccasions. And the day has arrived and the motion has been made. As a \nresult of that, even though Senator Ensign and I are extremely \ndisappointed, this matter is now before us. It is here.\n  We think it would be best resolved as follows: I ask unanimous \nconsent that there be 4 hours 30 minutes for debate on the pending \nmotion to proceed, equally divided between Senator Reid of Nevada and \nSenator Murkowski, or their designees; that upon the use or yielding \nback of that time, the Senate vote on the motion to proceed; that if \nthe motion to proceed is agreed to, then H.J. Res. 87 be read a third \ntime and the Senate vote on final passage of the joint resolution; that \nthe motion to reconsider that vote be laid on the table, and the \npreceding all occur without any intervening action or debate.\n  If I could say just one thing, Madam President, the reason that I \nfelt so strongly, as did Senator Ensign, about this is it is important \nthat Members have the benefit of some debate prior to this most \nimportant vote. So that is the reason. I appreciate the general tenure \nof what is going on here. I know there are strong feelings on both \nsides. Nobody is happy with what we are doing, but it is the best we \ncould do.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do reserve the right to object but state in the beginning \nI would not and will not object. I think this is an appropriate way to \nproceed. This is something that has been fully disclosed to all on both \nsides of the argument. We certainly understand and respect the desire \nof the Senators from Nevada, Mr. Reid and Mr. Ensign, to have an \nopportunity to make their case and to maximize their effort against \nthis proposal.\n  I also made it clear that it was the intent of the proponents, with \nthe leadership of Senator Murkowski and others on both sides of the \naisle, that under the law there is a time limit. We have to act on this \nissue by July 27 or, in fact, this proposal could not go forward. The \nveto of the Governor, in effect, would be upheld by inaction.\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\n  Not wanting to get squeezed down to the end of the session and having \nit unclear as to how we would proceed, we thought the fair thing to do \nto both sides was to say on this Tuesday, we would move to proceed to \nthe issue which would be nondebatable unless agreement was worked out \nto the contrary.\n  As a result of that being what our intent was, the motion was made, \nand we have now worked out this unanimous consent agreement which is \nagreeable to all sides. There would be debate before the vote, and then \nthere would be a vote on the motion to proceed which would be really, \nin fact, the vote. So this afternoon somewhere not later than 5:45, or \nperhaps earlier, as I understand it--Senator Reid can maybe comment on \nthis--there would be a vote on the motion to proceed.\n  While nothing else is precluded, it would be clearly my understanding \nthat it would not be necessary to have a vote on final passage if the \nmotion to proceed is agreed to. Everybody understands that is the vote. \nWe have checked on both sides of the aisle, and this agreement is \nacceptable. That would be the vote.\n  Another good thing about this is it allows everybody to know when the \ncritical vote will come. It also means, instead of 10 hours, we will go \n4\\1/2\\ hours. There is no demand or desire that we go beyond that. Then \nwe can get back to other business; hopefully, defense-related \nappropriations bills and the auditing bill and get that work done this \nweek.\n  This is a fair way to proceed. Everybody is on notice. I am glad to \nwork with the opponents and proponents to come to this agreement.\n  With that statement, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. As the leader has indicated, both sides have sought to \ndetermine if there would be a requirement for a rollcall vote, and both \nsides have come back no. If there is anyone who attempts in the ensuing \nperiod to be mischievous in that regard for whatever reason, it would \nbe very hard for them to get a second for that vote. I think we should \ngo forward on this basis.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me echo the comments of the two \nleaders relative to what we have before us. I would like to point out \nin the spirit of cooperation, the motion to proceed is nondebatable. We \nhave agreed on a 4\\1/2\\-hour time limit. It is my anticipation that we \nwill yield some time back.\n  I just wanted to point out the reality that any Member could have \nbrought this up for action. We worked with Senator Reid and the other \nconcerned Senators trying to reach some accord. We think this is a fair \nand equitable arrangement within the Senate prerogatives, particularly \ngiven the opportunity on both sides for 4\\1/2\\ hours of debate, and \nthen expedite final disposition so we can move on to other business. I \ndid want to point out, the motion to proceed ordinarily is \nnondebatable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill not object, I wanted to emphasize a couple of points. First of \nall, Senator Reid and I obviously vehemently oppose this bill and \noppose this bill even being on the floor today. Given the reality of \nwhat we were dealing with, we knew that we could not delay this bill \ncoming to the floor beyond the July 27 deadline that has been talked \nabout. Because of that, we believed the procedural vote was so \nimportant that we have some debate prior to the vote. As Senator \nMurkowski has pointed out, it is a nondebatable motion. We appreciate \nthe cooperation of the other side because it is such a precedent-\nsetting motion that we believed it was important to have the debate.\n  We appreciate the cooperation for this 4\\1/2\\ hours of debate prior \nto the motion to proceed, understanding that if our side loses that \nvote, it will automatically go to a voice vote and nobody is going to \nrequest--although not precluded--no one will request a recorded vote.\n  I will not object at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, it is my understanding that the unanimous \nconsent request has been accepted; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair has asked if there is further \nobjection to the request.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess between the hours of 12:30 and 2:15 today for the \nweekly party conferences.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time not be charged to either side as it \nwill be for a short time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I yield time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I start my remarks today by saying a lot \nof the information that I am going to talk about this morning on this \nprocedural vote--I will be talking more about the substance of the \nissue this afternoon, but this morning on the procedural vote, a lot of \nthe information has been gathered through hours and hours of research \nwith the Congressional Research Service, with the former \nParliamentarian of the Senate, Bob Dove, as well as several \nconversations with the current Parliamentarian.\n  I believe strongly this research is accurate and that the precedent \nwe will be setting is a very dangerous precedent.\n  Today's vote is not just about whether the Senate should allow \nnuclear waste to be dumped in Nevada. It is also about the authority of \nthe majority leader, and the very meaning of a Senate majority.\n  According to the rules of the Senate, it is true, any member may \noffer a motion to proceed to a bill or resolution. In practice, we all \nknow that's not the way it works. The Senate isn't governed just by \nrules; it is also governed by traditions. And one of those traditions \nis that the majority leader--and only the majority leader--can set the \nSenate's agenda by deciding which legislation will be considered. As \nSenator Byrd's history of the Senate makes clear, it is the exclusive \nrole of the majority leader to ``determine what matters or measures \nwill be scheduled for floor action and when.''\n  That's why--the rules notwithstanding--never in the history of the \nmodern Senate has anyone--I repeat, anyone--other than the majority \nleader or his designee successfully offered a motion to proceed with \nlegislation. It is simply not done.\n  Why? Because if such a motion prevails without the majority leader's \nconsent, then his office has been impaired. His ability to control the \nagenda of the Senate--which is the basis of his power and that of the \nmajority party--would be dealt a devastating blow.\n  That is why Senators of the majority party have always deferred to \nthe majority leader's authority to set the Senate's agenda--and have \nvoted with him to protect this power even when they disagreed on the \nsubstance of the issue at hand. Because they know that if they lose, \nwhat is at stake is their very power as the majority party. if any \nSenator can set the Senate agenda, then all the minority has to do to \nhijack the Senate agenda is convince a handful of Senators from the \nmajority party to join them on any given issue.\n  Indeed, that is why, from time to time, the minority has sought to \nchallenge the majority leader's power by offering motions to proceed. \nAs a matter of fact, I believe the current majority leader did so when \nhe was in the minority. He did so because he knew the consequences if \nhe succeeded. And those high stakes were the very reason\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\nhe was unsuccessful--because the majority party has always rallied \naround its leader.\n  We call today's vote a procedural vote. But it is in effect, a test \nof the power of the majority.\n  That being said, I suspect few on the other side of the aisle are \njumping at the chance to proclaim the stakes in this vote because they \nhope, perhaps, that no one will notice--that it will be like a tree \nfalling in the woods. If no one hears, perhaps it will not make a \nnoise.\n  But this vote will make a loud noise--and will change the way the \nSenate operates. It will do so because--as of this moment--every \nSenator knows that even though the Standing rules of the Senate permit \nany Member can make a motion to proceed, no one has ever done it \nsuccessfully, save for the majority leader or his designee.\n  After today, if the minority succeeds, it will be a different story. \nEach Senator will be able to decide how to interpret the results. Will \nit be OK for any Senator to offer a motion to proceed on any bill or \nresolution? Or just measures considered under expedited procedures, \nsuch as this bill? Or just those considered under expedited procedures \nwhich explicitly state that any member can make a motion to proceed? \nTake your pick, Madam President. Like beauty, this precedent is in the \neye of the beholder. And that's what makes it so dangerous.\n  Our opponents argue that this is a unique circumstance. They are \nsimply wrong. The procedure in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act is not \nunique.\n  There are many statutes containing expedited procedures. And 6 \nexpedited procedures in current law, including the Nuclear Waste Policy \nAct, contain language that explicitly states that ``any Member of the \nSenate'' may offer the motion to proceed. That language merely restates \nthe rules of the Senate. Still no one has ever successfully done so \nwithout the express consent of the majority leader.\n\n  There have been times when Congress has determined that is \nappropriate to override the traditional power of the majority leader to \nschedule the Senate's agenda, and this is important when this has been \nthe will of Congress, Congress has passed legislation like the National \nEmergencies Act and the War Powers Act to do so,.\n  The War Powers Act states that,\n\n       Any joint resolution or bill so reported (from Committee) \n     shall become the pending business of the House in question \n     (in the case of the Senate the time for debate shall be \n     equally divided between the proponents and the opponents), \n     and shall be voted on within three calendar days thereafter, \n     unless such House shall otherwise determine by yeas and nays.\n\n  Madam President, unlike the War Powers Resolution, the nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act does not make the resolution the pending business of the \nSenate. It does not take away the prerogative of the majority leader by \nmaking a resolution the pending business without any motion to proceed \nbeing required. Had the Senate wished to do so in this case it could \nhave followed the language of the War Powers Resolution, but it did \nnot.\n  Unlike this War Powers provision, there is no requirement in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act for Congress to take any action with regard to \nthe Yucca Mountain resolution. The procedure spelled out in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act is not required; it is merely permitted. In other \nwords, it is left up to the majority leader whether or not to proceed.\n  Indeed, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act anticipates that a vote on the \nYucca Mountain resolution might not occur that it might be blocked. \nThat is why, if the deadline passes, then the statute giving the State \nof Nevada a veto will have been carried out. That was part of the 1982 \ncompromise.\n  The junior Senator from Alaska stated that he does ``not know that it \nreally matters very much'' who makes the motion to proceed to the Yucca \nMountain resolution.\n  Well, I say that it does matter. It matters very much. The majority \nleader has made clear he opposes proceeding with this legislation. He \nhas staked his reputation and his office on this matter. I--and the \npeople of Nevada--appreciate his courage in doing so.\n  So let me be clear: any Senator who offers a motion to proceed in \nthis matter is posing a direct challenge to the powers of any majority \nleader. For the majority leader to lose such a vote would be \nunprecedented.\n  As I said, it may be in my interest as a member of the minority to \nsee the majority leader lose such a vote. But the majority leader has \nput a lot on the line for Nevada, which is why I am standing here \ntoday--a Republican Senator--defending the prerogatives of the Democrat \nmajority leader.\n  I am doing so because this issue is the most important matter for the \nState of Nevada to come before the U.S. Senate. No single issue unites \nNevadans--no single issue transcends region, political party, or \nindustry--like our fight against becoming the Nation's nuclear dumping \nground.\n  In conclusion, let me restate how important the precedent we are \nsetting today is if the majority leader is overruled. Every Senator \nneeds to reflect on this vote very carefully because this vote could \nliterally change the entire way the Senate operates. Many people \nbelieve this issue is vitally important. Some of us believe it is \nwrongheaded, as I do.\n  Regardless of how one Senator feels on this issue, the procedures of \nthe Senate need to be preserved. The precedent set today will be a \ndangerous one and the unintended consequences in the future could be \nvery dire. I encourage all my fellow Senators to think long and hard \nbefore they vote. It is not just a vote on whether or not to proceed on \nYucca Mountain but a vote on violating the rules of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire.\n  Let me first point out that it has been a long time coming. We have \nbeen approximately 20 years on this issue of nuclear waste, and we are \nmoving in an orderly process, but I feel compelled to respond to my \ngood friend from Nevada on the point on which he most eloquently \ncommented relative to the authority of the majority leader in cases of \nthis nature.\n  I am going to comment on the motion to proceed, and I think what my \ncolleagues need to understand is that despite what has been said, we \nare proceeding under Senate rules, make no mistake about it. This \nparticular provision was identified under procedures set forth in the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act. They were very carefully developed and \nadopted as part of the rulemaking powers of the Senate.\n  I quote that portion to address the concerns of my friend from \nNevada.\n\n       They are deemed a part of the rules of the Senate.\n\n  We are not excluding the rules of the Senate. We are not excluding \nthe authority of the majority leader. This procedure is deemed part of \nthe Senate rules. So I hope we can put to rest the matter that somehow \nwe are violating or circumventing Senate rules.\n  Some have objected to the provision that allows any Member to make \nthe motion to proceed, but they forget, or perhaps ignore, the history \nof the provision and how integral it was to the 90-day limit on \ncongressional consideration.\n  This came before the Senate in 1979 and 1980 when the Senate and \nHouse were attempting to resolve this issue, as we are today. That \nprovision was considered and passed by the Senate.\n\n  Further, it was included in the nuclear waste measure that was \nintroduced in 1981 by then-Chairman Jim McClure of Idaho, who had \nassumed the chairmanship of the committee. It was also included in \nlegislation offered by Congressman Udall on the House side, and it was \nincluded in the substitute amendments that were reported from the \nEnergy Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee which \nhad joint referral of the legislation.\n  It was included in the legislation that passed the Senate in April \nand then was included in the final legislation that was enacted in \nDecember of 1982. It was part of the proposal insisted on by Senator \nProxmire, Senator Mitchell, and others who wanted a stronger State veto \nprovision. It was, in fact, what made work the compromise suggested by \nCongressman Joe Moakley, the chairman of the House Rules Committee.\n  I find it somewhat off the point, if you will, and kind of a \ndiversion that\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\nsome are speaking about violating the integrity of the Senate when we \nare moving a bill in line with what the Senate had already adopted. \nAgain, I refer to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and the manner in which \nthis process was considered under the rulemaking powers of the Senate, \nand included in the rule are the words, `` . . . are deemed to be part \nof the rules of the Senate.''\n  Let me comment briefly on the role of the majority leader. I have the \nutmost respect for procedure and traditions. As to the role of the \nmajority leader, there should be no misunderstanding that this process \ndoes not in any manner detract from his authority or responsibility. By \nits very terms, this process applies in the situation of a resolution \nof approval only under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and no other \nsituation. So no Member of this body should be misled. This process \napplies only to the situation of a resolution of approval under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act.\n  This resolution should not come as any surprise to any Member. All \nsides have known this was coming since last year. We certainly have not \ncircumvented the procedure. Once the Secretary of Energy made his \nrecommendation to the President, we all took out the calendars and \nfigured out that 90 days would expire sometime before the end of July, \nspecifically July 27. The majority leader was very much aware of this \ntimeframe. Madam President, that day fast approaches.\n  The chairman of the committee introduced the resolution as required \nby law, and we had a fairly good idea of exactly when the Senate needed \nto act. Throughout the process--hearings, full committee consideration, \nand reporting--the majority leader has been aware of the status of the \nlegislation and the need for the Senate to act, indeed, within the \nstatutory timeframe.\n  The majority leader has also been aware of the desire of the chairman \nof the committee and mine as ranking member, together with other \nMembers of the Senate who support the resolution, to find a time that \nwas convenient for him, given his responsibilities to schedule \nactivities on the Senate floor.\n  The majority leader's office, in fact, proposed a unanimous consent \nrequest almost immediately after we reported the resolution to the \nfloor. We responded, and there have been several attempts to work out a \nsuitable time and schedule as well.\n  It should not come as a surprise, Madam President. Everyone in the \nSenate knows what the issue is and what the issue is not. No one is \ntrying to undermine the majority leader. No one is trying to circumvent \nthe Senate rules.\n\n  When I brought the nuclear waste legislation to the floor last \nCongress, I tried to fully accommodate the desires of my colleagues \nfrom Nevada, and I certainly intend to see that they have every \nopportunity to express their concerns today.\n  I also advise my colleagues again that under the motion to proceed, \nwhich is nondebatable, we have agreed to a reasonable debate, 4\\1/2\\ \nhours. This shows good faith on the part of those of us who believe \nthis matter should be brought to a head and resolved.\n  As I indicated, the motion to proceed is nondebatable. We could have \nrelied on the statute to proceed, but we have worked out a satisfactory \ncompromise that is fair and equitable. I think the method under which \nwe are proceeding is a fair one, given the circumstances, but I want \neveryone to understand that we have gone the extra mile to accommodate \nprocedure, the majority leader, each Member, and of course our friends \nfrom Nevada.\n  Provisions in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act are there to allow the \nleader to decide that he would not make the motion to proceed but allow \nsomeone else to do it. I did that this morning by proposing the motion \nto proceed, and we have now agreed on a procedure.\n  We have a choice to make. The Senate will today decide very simply \nwhether we should permit the Secretary of Energy to apply for a license \nto operate a repository at Yucca Mountain.\n  Madam President, I am going to yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I inquire of the distinguished manager \nif I may ask him a question or two. I discussed this with Senator \nMurkowski.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will be happy to respond to my friend from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska.\n  The question of concern to this Senator and I think many others is \nthe issue of safety in transporting this nuclear material. What are the \nplans in the general sense? That is, how will the material be \ntransported? By truck? By rail? And in a general way, what will the \nroutes be? Will they pass through densely populated areas?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. In response to the Senator from Pennsylvania, under \nthe licensing process, I emphasize the action we are taking today does \nnot address the transportation system or the procedure associated with \nthe transportation system. That would come under the licensing process \nwhich takes place at a later time.\n\n  All we are authorizing today is the procedure to allow the Secretary \nto apply for the license. So the licensing process will in great detail \nexamine all parameters associated with transportation safety, the \nmanner in which the waste will be not only transported by rail and by \ntruck but containers, and the safety of the containers to ensure they \ncan withstand any anticipated exposure associated with derailment or \nwhatever.\n  What we have in the transportation of nuclear waste is a number of \nhistoric examples of moving spent nuclear fuel. We have had about 2,700 \nshipments in the last 30 years. The distance these have been shipped \ntotals almost 2 million miles. There has not been a single release of \nradioactivity.\n  Now, in other parts of the world--in Europe--they have shipped over \n70,000 tons in the last 25 years. The estimates are 175 shipments to \nYucca Mountain will take place over a 24-year period. I could go on and \nenlighten my friend at great length relative to the procedure, but I \nemphasize what we are doing today is giving the administration and the \nSecretary the authority to proceed with the licensing. The licensing \nwill address the transportation issue.\n  I am happy to respond to further questions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, my next question is, is the Senator \nfrom Alaska in a position to respond to what the tonnage would be, over \nhow long a period of time, and how many shipments there would be to \nhandle the nuclear waste involved in the projection for being a \nrepository of Yucca Mountain?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That Department estimate is 175 annual shipments to \nYucca Mountain.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Over how long a period of time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Over 24 years; that is 4,300 shipments. In comparison \nto 300 million hazardous material shipments that take place annually in \nthe United States today with no notice given because these are military \nshipments associated with the breakup of reactors, most associated with \nour nuclear Navy fleet.\n  That is strict guidelines for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and \nthe Department of Transportation. In testimony before the Senate Energy \nCommittee, both the NRC and the DOT testified they can and will take \nall precautions necessary for safe and secure transportation. As I am \nsure the Senator from Pennsylvania is aware, the transportation is in \nnearly impenetrable casks. For every 1 ton of spent fuel there are 4 \ntons of protective shielding. The casks have to pass the test to ensure \nthere will be no breach. Tests show they can withstand a 120-mile-per-\nhour crash into a concrete wall and prolonged exposure to fires at \n1,475 degrees.\n  Some of that will depend, of course, on routing and volume. But 175 \nshipments is a responsible estimate.\n  Annual numbers, as I indicated, depend on transportation plans and \nthe combination of truck or train is not yet decided. This will be \ndecided under the licensing process. It is fair to say we will have \nanother opportunity for input on the adequacy of the transportation \nplan once the licensing process is undertaken. The action of the Senate \ntoday will lead to that next step.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, when I inquire as to the next step, the\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nSenator from Alaska comments we will have another opportunity to make \nan inquiry. Will these procedures, if I may inquire of the Senator----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let me finish the question.\n  Having been here for 22 years, having come to the Senate the same \nday, we can almost communicate without speaking very much. But my \nquestion goes to the issue of another vote here. You say we will have \nanother opportunity. Will there be something presented to the Senate \nwhere we have an opportunity to vote on our views as to the adequacy of \nthe safety procedures?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding there will not be another \nopportunity for a vote. The licensing process is a procedure under the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission that will examine and certify the safety \nof the transportation mode, but there will not be another opportunity \nfor a vote.\n  Under the rules of procedure we have outlined, this is quite \nexplicit. It allows the licensing process to go ahead. The licensing \nprocess will determine the adequacy of transportation and safety. We \nshould recognize we have moved nuclear waste, military waste--primarily \nmilitary waste--throughout the country for many years and have done it \nsuccessfully. There is no reason to believe we cannot use \ntransportation methods we have and technology we have to move high-\nlevel nuclear waste to one site as opposed to leaving it in 131 sites \nin 34 States.\n  Clearly, the Yucca Mountain provision which identifies it at one \ncentral location and without transportation, obviously, is going to \nhave to stay in the States where it currently is located, which were \nnot designed for a permanent repository.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, another couple of questions. In the \nabsence of a vote, my question to the Senator from Alaska would be, \nWhat congressional oversight is possible? Sometimes licensing \nprocedures are fine and sometimes they are not, but they do not have \nthe assurance which this deliberative body can apply.\n  So my specific question is, What level of oversight would the Senator \nfrom Alaska envisage with the licensing procedures?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to give my friend from Pennsylvania the \ncomfort that suggests we are the parties in making a determination of \nsafety. We certainly have the obligation of oversight. But the \nappropriate agencies that have this responsibility are the Department \nof Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of \nTransportation.\n  They have the obligation to address, if you will, transportation \nprocedures, safety, routing, the manner in which casks are stored and \nsafeguarded. It is fair to say that the National Academy of Sciences is \na participant in the process as well.\n  What we have is the very best science, engineering, and technology to \naddress the legitimate concerns of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \npersonally believe they have the expertise, the experience, and have \ncertainly a record that suggests there has not been an accident. It \ndoes not mean there couldn't be, but all the necessary precautions \nwithin reason have been taken.\n  Of course, in comfort to the Senator from Pennsylvania, again, we \nhave legitimate oversight of the agencies I have named and will \ncontinue to have and maintain that which I would hope would be \nsufficient to meet the concerns of the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My final question relates to the issue as to the \nprecautions in the event, perhaps unlikely, that there would be an \naccident. What assurances are there, if it should happen, for example, \nin Russell, KS, my hometown--what could happen in Alaska could happen \nin the hometown of the Senator from Alaska--\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I could respond, I would almost make sure the waste \nwould not go through my State or through Russell, KS.\n  Nonetheless, it is a legitimate question. In the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission proceedings there is obviously work in progress where there \nwould be a response procedure associated with any inevitability of an \naccident at any time. That is part of the responsibility of the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, and they would work, of course, with Federal and \nState agencies to respond. It would involve the Department of \nTransportation and the Department of Energy. These procedures are \nalready established.\n  Again, recognizing the movement of this waste over a period of time, \nthere would be an increased degree of sophistication because, unlike \nmilitary waste, which moves with little notice, clearly it would be \nknown when nuclear waste was moving from reactors to the Yucca Mountain \nsite so there would be special escorts, special procedures, and so \nforth, to safeguard it because it wouldn't be done without the \nknowledge, obviously, of the public.\n  What precautions are taken are outlined in the spent fuel \ntransportation procedure, which has been put out by the Department of \nEnergy, Office of Public Affairs. I would be happy to share this.\n  It is a lengthy list of what precautions the Government has taken in \ntransportation routing. It covers routing, it covers security, it \ncovers tracking, it covers coordination with State officials, as well \nas State participation. It involves training procedures. It involves \nwhat the Government is doing with emergency procedure assistance. It \nidentifies the specific States, proposed routing, casks, and so forth. \nI am further advised there is a certification here by the Chairman, Mr. \nMeserve, of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It reads as follows:\n\n       Federal regulation of spent fuel transportation safety is \n     shared by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n  It relates to the transportation of all hazardous materials. It \nfurther goes on to say:\n\n       For its part, NRC establishes design standards for the \n     casks used to transport licensed spent fuel, reviews and \n     certifies cask designs prior to their use. Further, cask \n     design, fabrication, use and maintenance activities must be \n     conducted under an NRC-approved Quality Assurance Program.\n       NRC has reviewed and certified a number of package designs. \n     . . .\n       We believe the safety protection provided by the current \n     transportation regulatory system is well established [and \n     they] continually examine the transportation safety program.\n\n  I think that pretty much addresses the input, the testimony at the \nhearings by those responsible for oversight.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for those \nresponses.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Who yields time?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I wonder if the junior Senator from Alaska will yield for \na question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. While the Senator from Pennsylvania is still here--this \nwas part of the hearing. I think it is something important for us to \nget cleared up.\n  The 175 shipments per year the Department of Energy--and you have \nmentioned this morning that has been a common number that has been \ntossed around. The piece of paper I have in my hand is page J-11. It is \nfrom the final EIS statement. I am sure your staff has a copy of this. \nThis is part of the final EIS statement from the Department of Energy, \ntable J-1, a summary of the estimated number of shipments for the \nvarious inventory, national transportation analysis scenario \ncombinations.\n  They go through the various types of ways that we would ship and the \nminimums and maximums.\n  From what I understand, the 175 per year would be if every shipment \nwas in dedicated trains, which the Department of Energy so far has been \nopposed to because of the expense of dedicated trains.\n  The other thing is that we have no rail built in Nevada to make \npossible the rail segment or the rail scenario. You have to have the \nrail built in Nevada to be able to go from rail to rail, and there is \nno rail leading to the Nevada Test Site.\n  The reason I bring this up, and the reason I would like at least to \nhave this on the record as part of the Senate debate is because it is \nhuge amounts\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\nmore of shipments, from what I understand, unless it is all dedicated \ntrains. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think, in response to my good friend from Nevada, he \nhas to understand where we are. The licensing plan will address the \nlegitimate mass questions because there is no rail into the area. That \nis going to come under the licensing plan. But there is a Union Pacific \nroute that is adjacent to the area. It would not be difficult to put a \nspur in. This was discussed in hearings and so forth.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. It is about 400 miles it has to go, 300-some depending on \nthe route, it may have to go, from the Union Pacific to the Nevada Test \nSite.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This line of consideration, while appropriate, is \nreally part of the transportation plan which will come out of the \nlicensing procedure. That is not what we are here for today. We are \nhere to advance the process so the appropriate agencies can address \nwhether they are going to issue a license. They might not issue a \nlicense. But what we are doing is giving the authority for the \nadministration to proceed to try to obtain a license. That will be from \nthe Department of Transportation, it will be from the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, and it will be from the Department of Energy. \nAnd they will address the questions of how access is provided, whether \nit be by rail or certainly truck is available as well; we can talk \nabout these things, but these are all proposals that are going to be \naddressed in due course.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, if the Senator will continue to yield, the \nreason I brought it up and the reason I thought the question of the \nSenator from Pennsylvania was so appropriate is because this stuff that \nmay be proposed is very important, first of all, because the cost of \nrail is not included in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The cost of the \nrail into the Nevada Test Site is not in the budgetary projections.\n  The second thing is that if a Senator is voting on whether this thing \nis going through--in other words, if I am a Senator from Pennsylvania, \nand I have a couple of nuclear powerplants, but I know I have a lot \nmore shipments may be coming through my State--if I think there are \nonly going to be 20 shipments a year through my State versus maybe \n1,000 shipments through my State, that may make a difference on how I \nwould vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I could point out, I do not mind \nresponding to questions, but we are dividing time here. It is \nimportant, if the Senator from Nevada wants to speak, it is on his \ntime.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. That is fine. If Senator Reid has control of the time, it \nis fine with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Boxer is due here any minute. I was \nwaiting for her to speak. She is not here. I ask my friend from Nevada \nif he wants an extra 5 minutes now, or would he rather wait.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, 5 minutes now I would really appreciate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say to my friend from Idaho that I \nhope the Senator from California will be here at that time. If she is \nnot, I will yield. But Senator Murkowski could yield some time. I yield \n5 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what is the remaining time on either \nside so we can start off anew relative to where we are?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska controls 106 minutes, \nand the Senator from Nevada controls 125 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I understand that after the Senator \nfrom Nevada speaks, the Chair will recognize the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. REID. When the Senator from California is here, I have explained \nto the Senator from Idaho that she would go first.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska would engage, I \nthink it is an important part of our discussion.\n  The point I was making was that if a Senator were worried about \ntransportation coming through their State--it seems to be one of the \nbiggest issues, and I think it should be one of the biggest issues, if \npeople are thinking about the way to vote on this issue--it is \nimportant to know how many shipments, or approximately how many \nshipments, or the types of shipments that are going to be coming \nthrough the State.\n  As the Senator from Alaska has said, that is going to be determined \nin the future. But as was pointed out, the only chance for the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania to vote is today. Today is the only chance to vote on \nwhether or not I have 20 shipments coming through my State or whether I \nmay have 100 shipments coming through my State. The numbers can be that \ndifferent.\n  Once again, based on table J-1 on page J-11, in the final EIS report, \nif we have a mostly truck scenario just on one of those proposed \nactions, we would have 52,000 shipments over the period of time that \nYucca Mountain is open. Under mostly rail, we would have around 11,000 \nshipments. When we have dedicated trains, the numbers go way down. But \nthese aren't dealing with dedicated trains. In fact, the final EIS \nDepartment of Energy report did not contain dedicated trains.\n  That is the reason I was asking the question and why I wanted to get \nit cleared up. If we don't know we are going to be using dedicated \ntrains, how can the Senator from Alaska and others, including the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, say there are 175 shipments per year? We \ntoss that number around as if it is a fact when, in fact, it is not a \nfact. It is something that is conjecture, pure conjecture, from the \nDepartment of Energy based on dedicated trains when they are not even \nputting that in their final EIS report.\n\n  The Senator can answer it on my time. If the Senator from Alaska \nwould like to comment on that, I think it is very important to try to \nclear this up, because when the Department of Energy testified, they \ncertainly didn't clear this up in the committee.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. This is an estimate. It is all it can possibly be at \nthis time because, clearly, we do not ship this material. We have had \nexperience in shipping in the United States. We had 2,996 shipments of \nspent fuel under the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nfrom 1964 to the year 2000. We have shipped that waste 1.7 million \nmiles. There it is on the chart. Low-level radioactive waste--you can \nsee it on the chart--896 shipments. That is what we have done in the \npast.\n  I cannot in good conscience do anything more than submit what we have \nbeen given as an estimate of the number of shipments. I will not make a \ndetermination as to whether that is factual, but it is their best \nestimate. There is no reason to believe it should not be relatively \naccurate.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, reclaiming my time, the Senator said there \nwere the 175 shipments as a statement of fact. He said, as a matter of \nfact, he is relatively sure of that statement. Because he said he was \nrelatively sure of that statement----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think in this interpretation I used the word \n``estimate''--an estimate. It is all it can possibly be. It couldn't be \nanything else other than an estimate because it is has not shipped.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Except, according to the EIS--and I don't know whether \nthe Senator will address the EIS--on dedicated rail, it is around 175 \nshipments per year. According to their EIS, they don't use 175. That is \nonly if it is dedicated rail.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond to the Senator from Nevada, that may \nbe only dedicated rail. There are other alternatives other than rail.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. What those might will be determined by the licensing \nprocess. But I would encourage my colleagues to recognize the reality \nhere: Do we want this waste to stay where it is or do we want to move \nit to one central repository? You don't get it to a central repository \nand out of the States unless you move it.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I understand my time is up. I think this \nis an important question which we will have to deal with a little more \nthis afternoon. I yield the floor so the Senator from Idaho can be \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from California is not here. I \nask the Senator from Alaska to yield time to the Senator from Idaho.\n\n[[Page S6450]]\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, might I ask how much time the Senator \nfrom Idaho is going to require?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will consume the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield the remainder of the time for this morning to \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, already this morning we have seen an \nexample of the kind of record that is attempting to be made in part by \nthe Senator from Nevada who would, first, argue a procedural issue that \nI and others, including renown Parliamentarians, argue does not exist. \nClearly, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 established an \nextraordinary procedure--not a precedent-setting procedure. \nParliamentarians have agreed that is the case.\n  But even today, as the Senator from Alaska has mentioned, we have \nbeen willing to shape that to accommodate the Senators from Nevada to \nallow debate on a motion to proceed prior to that vote. Clearly, the \nmajority leader was not engaged on the floor. He already engaged us by \nsaying he would not schedule a vote. He has walked away from his \nresponsibility, if in fact it was there. I would argue that it was not \nthere. Any Senator, by an act of Congress and by the law of the United \nStates, could have done this.\n  When we talk about precedent-setting action on the floor of the \nSenate as it relates to the rules of the Senate, we talk about the \nnormal processes of configuring the schedule. I agree with the junior \nSenator from Nevada on that statement. This is not a precedent-setting \naction today. In fact, I think those who have observed it have \nrecognized the kind of flexibility and give and take and the \nresponsibility that this Senate had to take under the 1982 law.\n  I believe the record will be complete. I do not believe that complete \nrecord in any way can or will demonstrate that future Parliamentarians \nwould argue that a precedent has been set. Quite the opposite has \nhappened. The Senate of the United States voted in 1982 to establish a \nprocess. Therefore, the Senate collectively spoke. It was clear in its \nspeaking that a motion could be placed. And the reason they did that \nwas very clear. They did not want a single person, a majority leader, \nDemocrat or Republican, blocking the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment as it related to a necessary step in the process of \ndetermining whether this Nation would establish a deep geologic, high-\nlevel waste nuclear repository; that it was more important than one \nSenator, in that case the majority leader.\n  It set in place a time schedule. It even gave the State of Nevada--\nthe two Senators are on the floor speaking in behalf of phenomenal \npower--the power to veto. They have vetoed this. But even in that case, \nit did not allow a total State prerogative because this is a national \nissue of very real importance. And that is why we are on the floor \ntoday.\n  We can debate procedure, if we want. But I think that is clear and it \nhas been well established, and several Parliamentarians argue on either \nside of the case.\n\n  What is clear is a law, and a law clearly stating and a law being \npassed by the Congress itself and signed by a President. That is what \nis important. It is from that law that we act today. But because, as \nthe Senator from Nevada has spoken, we wanted and we believed it most \nimportant to accommodate my colleagues from Nevada--as I would want to \nbe accommodated if this were happening in my State--we have given that \nkind of flexibility inside the law by a unanimous consent. And it is \nunder that action that we are currently debating Senate Joint \nResolution 34.\n  What are we doing today? We are taking another step forward. This \naction today does not, in itself, establish a deep geologic repository \nfor high-level nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. It says that \nwe, the Senate, agree with the Department of Energy that a \ncertification process has gone forward to determine the minimum \nstandards and capabilities of geology and water tables and all of those \nkinds of things to meet tremendously high level protocol, and now we \nhand it forth into the next step, and that is licensure.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is concerned about transportation, as \nhe should be. But the Senator from Alaska responded appropriately. That \nis part of a very meticulous effort at licensing a facility, how it \nwill be constructed, under what conditions it will be constructed, how \nthe waste will move from the State of Pennsylvania or from the State of \nIdaho to that facility.\n  Yes, we have ample oversight capacity and capability, and we ought to \nexercise it. I serve on the Energy Committee from which this resolution \ncame. I want to make sure the Nuclear Regulatory Commission handles \nthat transportation portion of the licensing well. We also have \nmultiple jurisdictions--the Department of Transportation. Therefore, \nEnvironment and Public Works will have some say in oversight.\n  Will there be another action or another vote? No. That is not \nprescribed within the law. But I also know the State of Nevada is not \nthrough either. They will exert phenomenal oversight, as they should, \nas this process goes forward if--if--the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \ndetermines that a license is appropriate for this facility under all of \nthese kinds of conditions.\n  I would suggest that we have also spent $4 billion. And $4 billion is \nan important figure. It was not our money. It was not taxpayer money. \nIt was ratepayers' money from the 39 States that have commercial \nnuclear reactors operating power-generating facilities who have paid \ninto a fund to take us this far, a fund that continues to grow, and a \nfund that will, in large part, finance the construction and the \noperation of this facility.\n  So we are taking the next step, the important step. I must tell you, \na vote today on a motion to proceed is a vote to take the step or to \nnot step at all. If we do not, we step back 20 years--20 years--into a \ndebate about how to manage high-level nuclear waste with commercial \nfacilities, and temporary repositories filling up with waste as we \nspeak.\n  Do we say, if we do not speak today, there will be no future for the \nnuclear industry in this country? Well, we certainly say we have no \nresolution of how to manage its high-level waste stream, except to \nleave it in well over 100 facilities spread across 39 States.\n  Will the States then respond by allowing additional repositories to \nbe built in those States when they were promised that those were the \nonly repositories and that high-level waste would move out and move to \na permanent repository, as the Congress decided, in a single location? \nThose are the unknowns.\n\n  But what is known today is that the 20 percent of the electrical \nenergy of this country that is generated through nuclear reactors is \nthe cleanest electrical energy outside of hydro in the United States. \nSome who are concerned about climate change and want even cleaner \nenergy--and this Nation demanding even higher volumes of high-quality \nelectrical energy--are recognizing that, at least under current and \nimmediate-future technology, the nuclear industry is the right industry \nto turn to for advanced generation.\n  So do we want to walk away from that industry today, as we will if we \nvote down a motion to proceed? Or do we want to take a step forward in \na licensing process that says the whole industry can move to, \npotentially, a future opportunity of producing 25 or 30 or 40 percent \nof our electric energy needs of this country in a clean and responsible \nfashion?\n  Let me talk for a few moments about transportation. I do not fear \ntransportation. The reason I do not fear transportation is the history \nof transportation of radioactive materials and high-level waste in this \ncountry. There have been 2,700 shipments, over the last 30 years, of \nspent nuclear fuel; some 300 million hazardous and radioactive \nshipments annually in this country; and there are currently about 3 \nmillion shipments annually of radioactive material in this country. So \nthere is a lot of movement going on.\n  So why the alarm? It is a tactic. It is an alarmist political tactic \nto try to kill this very effort. Should we be concerned about \ntransportation? You bet we should. But we have a very good record to \ndate of a lot of movement of nuclear waste in this country and \nradioactive material in a safe and sound fashion.\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\n  The reason is quite clear: Because the Federal Government has \ndemanded from day one that those shipments be done in extraordinary \nways, extraordinary super-built containers, much of it traveling by \nrail. The high-level waste that comes to Idaho is naval waste. It comes \nby rail. But the low-level waste that leaves Idaho leaves by highways \nin very well designed, tremendously strong containers, and well-\nmanaged, selected routes, all of it guided and monitored by GPS. It is \ntremendously safe today as that waste goes from Idaho to the Waste \nIsolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, NM.\n  Yes, we have a right to be concerned, but we do not have a right to \nuse alarm and fear where they should not exist. But we have a right to \ndo what is responsible to keep it out of our populated areas, to move \nit in appropriate fashions in less populated ways.\n  The Senator from Nevada speaks about rail and an appropriate and safe \nway to handle it, well demonstrated, well proved. And the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission may well want even enhanced containers. But what \nI would suggest is that if we fail to act today to determine the next \nstep, and many of these utilities go to a private location and \nestablish a private repository--as some are now contemplating--then \nthere is a strong possibility that, in a much less regulated way, in a \nmuch less orchestrated and monitored way, we will see nuclear waste \nmoving across this country simply because we failed to act and failed \nto organize and failed to respond to a highly regulated, highly \ncontrolled, and highly monitored transportation system.\n  Those are the realities of where we are today with this industry and \nwhere we are today with the volume of nuclear waste, high-level spent \nfuel nuclear waste that is building up in repositories across the \ncountry. It isn't damned if you do and damned if you don't. It is a \nresponsible and important step to take to move this resolution through \nto a licensing procedure which will then have full transparency, which \nwill then have the ability of the Senate of the United States and the \nHouse to do the kind of oversight necessary to make sure that we can \nrecognize what both Senators from Nevada, who are in the Chamber, need: \nThe best assurance possible, in a zero sum game, if you can get there, \nthat this has been done to the maximum capability of the engineering \ntalent of the best we have to offer.\n  The 10,000-year protocol established all of those kinds of things \nthat meet the standards that are so critically necessary to do what is \nright and responsible for this country: store our high-level waste in a \ndeep geologic repository; cause the next step to happen; advance the \nfuture of the nuclear industry; advance clean electrical energy for our \ncountry well into the future.\n\n  It is a responsible act that the Senate undertakes today to allow \nthat very kind of thing to happen. I hope this afternoon, when we have \nan opportunity to vote on the motion to proceed, which, in fact, is a \nvote on whether we will allow the process to go forward, a majority of \nthe Senate will vote in favor of that motion to proceed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6451-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, the Senate today is faced with an \nimportant decision about whether to ship extremely hazardous, high-\nlevel nuclear waste to a permanent repository in Yucca Mountain. Let \nthere be no doubt in anyone's mind, I would like to see this nuclear \nwaste shipped safely out of Minnesota. I wish I could responsibly vote \nto support this resolution. I regret that I cannot today vote in favor.\n  I have consistently said that before the Department of Energy and the \nCongress make a final judgment that we are ready to begin shipping \nhigh-level nuclear waste to a repository, there should be a carefully \nthought out, detailed plan in place, approved by the NRC and the DOE, \nto transport this radioactive waste and to manage all of the risks \nassociated with that transportation.\n  Although it has had over 30 years to do so, the Department of Energy \nhas failed to develop such a safe--I emphasize ``safe''--waste \ntransportation plan.\n  While I want this high-level nuclear waste out of our State and think \nYucca Mountain may very well be the most sensible location, I don't \nthink we should move forward and commit ourselves irrevocably until we \nhave all of the transportation and security issues addressed.\n  Therefore, I have come to the conclusion, through a careful \nexamination of congressional testimony, meetings with DOE officials, \nincluding the Secretary of Energy, State energy officials and local \nleaders, that there are too many uncertainties, too many unresolved \nissues, and the risks are simply too high for the citizens of \nMinnesota.\n  I cannot now support this resolution. We urgently need to develop a \ncomprehensive waste transportation plan and policy that protects the \nhealth and safety of local communities and all Americans. We should \nhave such a plan in place before moving forward on a permanent \nrepository plan.\n  It is unacceptable to me as a Senator that the Department of Energy \nhas ignored the very real and daunting task of developing a secure, \ncomprehensive transportation plan before seeking to authorize the Yucca \nMountain site.\n  The simple fact is, the Congress should not be considering nor should \nthe DOE have recommended authorization of the Yucca Mountain site \nbefore State and local officials were consulted and a comprehensive \ntransportation plan has been finalized which takes into account their \nconcerns and the people they represent.\n  Madam President, even though the Department of Energy has had years \nto develop such a plan, they don't have one. By the way, I thank \nSecretary Abraham. I have talked with him over the phone. He has been \nvery gracious, and I appreciate that. But when he testified May 16, \n2002, that the ``Department is just beginning to formulate its \npreliminary thoughts about a transportation plan,'' to me, that is not \nenough for my State or the country.\n  The Department spent $7 billion looking into Yucca Mountain geology \nbut less than $2 million on the transportation of the nuclear waste. \nThat works out at less than $10 million a year for the last 20 years. \nThis is a fundamental flaw in the Department's approach. So, to me, \nfailing to plan for the safe and secure transport of nuclear waste \nbefore approving the repository site would be irresponsible.\n  I recognize the industry has had a generally safe record of \ntransporting small amounts of nuclear waste over the last 35 years. But \nshipments to Yucca Mountain would be at an unprecedented level. The \nDepartment of Energy estimates that transportation to a central \nrepository could involve the shipment of more than 46,000 tons of high-\nlevel radioactive nuclear waste across 40 States in 53,000 trucks or \n20,000 railcars. It is worth noting that even if the shipments were to \nbegin today, there are more than 200 million Americans living in the \n700-plus counties that are traversed by DOE's potential roads and rail \nlines. The population is only going to grow, and grow more quickly, \nduring the time DOE needs to move nuclear waste across the country.\n  Beginning in 2010, the DOE estimates that over 1,000 truck and rail \nshipments of nuclear waste could well travel through Minnesota, through \nour most populated cities and towns such as Minneapolis-St. Paul, \nMankato, Rochester, and the Twin City suburbs. So 683,000--looking at \nthe proposed route--Minnesotans would live within 1 mile; 2,213,612 \nMinnesotans would live within 5 miles; 3,121,718 Minnesotans would live \nwithin 20 miles. That is about half of the State's population.\n  This raises a very important and yet unanswered set of questions \nabout the risks of possible accidents or terrorist\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\nattacks, and how local communities through which the waste would travel \nwould manage the risk. That is why the Conference of Mayors passed a \nresolution just this past June expressing serious concerns about the \nissue and urging the Congress to prohibit the transport of waste until \nall cities--I include Minnesota cities and towns--along the proposed \ntransportation route have been consulted and have received adequate \ntraining and equipment to protect the public health and safety of the \ncitizens in the event of an accident.\n  Again, I thank the Department of Energy and I thank the Secretary for \nhis graciousness. Unfortunately, DOE has yet to hold any public \nmeetings in recent years in Minnesota on the topic of, again, where is \nthis going to go, what kind of training is there going to be, and how \nare we going to prevent an accident? To me, this is a key issue.\n  Example: The DOE environmental impact statement maintains that \nshipping high-level spent fuel casks on mixed general freight trains is \nacceptable. This would permit casks of high-level nuclear waste to be \nmixed among cars of corn, soybeans, autoparts, and other goods. I am \nconcerned that the DOE's regulations appear to be market driven; mixed \nfreight trains are cheaper than dedicated trains.\n  As the American Association of Railroads testified, DOE's position is \n``driven, no doubt, by economic consideration.'' But the safe \ntransportation of these highly toxic materials must take precedence \nover any cost considerations. I agree with the American Association of \nRailroads that dedicated trains would be a safer and more prudent \nalternative. I would like to have that laid out for me before we have a \nfinal vote on the repository.\n\n  Madam President, I believe a transportation plan for nuclear waste \nshipments should have a ``zero accident'' goal, but as yet the DOE \ndoesn't even have a plan. A zero accident goal would reflect a culture \nin which safety is paramount and drives all aspects of the \ntransportation system. That goal encourages a culture of safety.\n  I know there are safety concerns about these materials being stored \nwhere they are. The Department of Energy has argued that we need to \nconsolidate this waste in one location. But that argument overlooks the \nfact that authorization of Yucca Mountain as a permanent repository \ndoesn't solve these concerns. The only reactors that will get rid of \ntheir waste completely, according to the DOE, are those that are closed \ntoday--and those are not in Minnesota.\n  According to the draft environmental impact statement prepared by \nDOE, the Monticello and Prairie Island reactors will still have 111 and \n344 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste, respectively, onsite when \nYucca Mountain is full.\n  Despite what the proponents would have us believe, the DOE's proposal \nfails to eliminate Minnesota's nuclear waste. Nationwide, when the \nYucca Mountain project is completed, there will roughly be the same \namount of high-level nuclear waste at powerplants across the country as \nthere is today. We simply cannot afford to overlook the real and \npressing security concerns inherent with the transportation of this \nfuel, nor can we ignore the fact that the next generation will still be \nleft with similar problems of what to do with the waste.\n  I will conclude this way. We urgently need to achieve a real solution \nto our storage problem with high-level nuclear waste, as opposed to \nforcing authorization of Yucca Mountain before there is a comprehensive \nplan for transporting the waste safely and securely before it is in \nplace.\n  I believe the Department of Energy needs to immediately begin a true \ncollaborative process, seeking broad-based stakeholder input on the \nreal challenges of transportation safety and emergency preparedness. \nWhile the Department of Energy has elected to proceed with significant \nquestions remaining unresolved, a comprehensive transportation plan \ndeveloped through a consultative process would give DOE's proposal for \nYucca Mountain the credibility it now lacks. The DOE should immediately \norganize a stakeholder task force to develop transportation \nrecommendations that include the experts on the ground, such as \nGovernors and their safety agencies, local elected officials of the \nlarge and small towns where the waste will travel, emergency \npreparedness experts, and public health and safety officials, and \ndevelop a responsible plan that would transport this waste safely \nbefore a final decision is made.\n  I believe there are a whole host of issues surrounding the \ntransportation of nuclear waste material that must be addressed before \nfinal decisions are made on Yucca Mountain. We can make the decision \nnext year or the year after. That would be fine with me--if these \nconcerns can be met first.\n  Unfortunately, the administration has elected to force the issue \nbefore all these concerns can be sufficiently addressed. I want to be \nable to support this resolution. I would like to be able to vote to \nmove the high-level nuclear waste out of Minnesota. But I cannot, in \ngood conscience, do this before there is a comprehensive plan in place \nto protect Minnesotans as this radioactive waste is moved through our \nState to Yucca Mountain, and from our State to Yucca Mountain.\n\n  I think forcing the issue before such a comprehensive plan is in \nplace would be a serious mistake, and that is why I intend to vote no \non this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, while I have the attention of the \nSenator from Minnesota, the Department of Energy did a comprehensive \nanalysis called ``The Spent Nuclear Fuel Transportation System,'' which \nI think encompasses a good deal of the concerns of the Senator from \nMinnesota. I encourage that he review it at his leisure.\n  I also remind my colleagues that the issue before us is simply \nlicensing and the authority that this body gives the Department of \nEnergy to proceed with the license. That licensing process will \nlegitimately conclude in an evaluation of the adequacy of the \ntransportation proposals either by rail, road, or a combination of \nboth involving the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of \nTransportation, the Department of Energy, and the National Academy of \nSciences. They are judged to be the best experts as opposed to those of \nus who obviously are not necessarily specialists but generalists in \nthis area, although we have some expertise in legislation.\n\n  I also remind my colleagues that this is the formal process of some \n20 years in evolution of addressing the procedure to address the waste.\n  I am sensitive to the needs of my colleagues from Nevada who \nobviously do not want the waste in their State, but I remind my friend \nfrom Minnesota that there are 835 metric tons of nuclear fuel stored in \nMinnesota in two locations, and that Minnesota has three nuclear \nunits--Prairie Island 1 and 2 and Monticello.\n  As a consequence of the procedures we have initiated, there appears \nto be one of two solutions: We either proceed and let the experts in \nthe agencies address a transportation plan in the sequence that has \nbeen laid out that follows after the licensing, or we are going to be \nright back where we were 20 years ago on what to do with the waste. I \ncan assure my colleagues, nobody wants it, but we have created it, and \nwe have an obligation to take care of it.\n  I would like to identify, so we can move along in sequence, those \nspeakers who have requested time on our side. We have Senator Bingaman, \nwho has asked for 10 minutes; Senator Thomas, some 8 to 10 minutes; \nSenator Crapo, 5 minutes; Senator Kyl, 10 minutes. I would like to \nreserve some time for myself, about 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I will say quickly that this document \nabout which my friend from Alaska refers is not worth the paper on \nwhich it is written. It talks about 4,300 shipments on trains--they \nhave no trains at Yucca Mountain, 100 miles from any train. This piece \nof trash--and that is what it is--is typical of what the Department of \nEnergy has done. It is one big lie after one big lie.\n  As indicated by anyone who looks at it, there are 292 reports that \nthey did not even wait to see what the answers would be. The General \nAccounting Office said that, not some radical environmental group--the \nGeneral Accounting Office. So the statements of my friend from \nMinnesota are directly on point. This means nothing.\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\n  Madam President, in keeping with having some degree of preciseness on \nthe floor--I will be happy to yield some time to my friend--I am going \nto yield 10 minutes in a minute to the Senator from Minnesota and then \nit is my understanding the Senator from Alaska will yield 10 minutes to \nthe Senator from New Mexico, and following that, I will yield 10 \nminutes to the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, who almost made it \nhere this morning. Then if the Senator from Alaska has somebody who \nwishes to speak, that is fine; otherwise, I will yield time to the \nPresiding Officer, who will be out of the chair at that time, just to \ngive an idea of how we are proceeding.\n  How much time does the Senator from Minnesota wish before I yield to \nhis colleague?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to the Senator from Nevada, 1 minute.\n  Mr. REID. I yield my friend 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Alaska, I \nhave over and over--my position is a somewhat different position than \nthe Senator from Nevada--over and over I have said do not separate \nYucca Mountain; you already put $7 billion into it. Why not lay out a \ncomprehensive plan about how you are going to transport this safely to \nYucca Mountain? That has been my issue over and over. I have asked the \nDepartment of Energy when will there be such a plan? Two years? Three \nyears? Four years? I think we are now talking about several years in \nthe future.\n  I want to make it crystal clear to me that to vote for Yucca Mountain \nwithout those assurances, without the assurances about how it is going \nto be done safely, without the input of local communities, without the \ncommitment that people will be trained, without any of those assurances \nwhatsoever, it seems to me to be not responsible. That is my first \npoint.\n  My second point is to one more time say to my colleague and say to \nall colleagues, though there are those who would have us believe Yucca \nMountain will eliminate Minnesota's nuclear waste, as a matter of fact, \naccording to the draft environmental impact statement by the DOE, we \nstill will have 111 and 344 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste in \nMinnesota onsite at Monticello and Prairie Island.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, a little simple math: 77,000 tons now \nexist. They can move at most 3,000 tons to someplace; let's say Yucca \nMountain. These reactors produce over 2,000 tons. I repeat, the math is \nnot very much. The big lie has been the fact that they say they are \ngoing to have only one repository. They are still going to have 131 \nrepositories. That is the way it is going to be. This is a big lie they \nhave perpetuated for many years now, and it is absolutely false that \nthey are going to have one repository. They will continue to have 131, \nplus the mobile Chernobyls that will be all over America on trucks, \nbarges, and trains.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank my very distinguished colleague from Nevada \nfor granting me time. I join with my senior colleague from the State of \nMinnesota who spoke very eloquently before me. I have come \nindependently to the same conclusion as he that I will vote against \ndesignating Yucca Mountain as a national nuclear waste repository at \nthis time.\n  I do so because there are simply too many unanswered questions, \nuntested designs, and unproven procedures to approve a project that has \nsuch enormous consequences.\n  Building a safe and secure storage site at Yucca Mountain and then \nfilling it with some 77,000 tons of nuclear waste will take the next 30 \nto 40 years. That is the rest of my generation's lifetime.\n  Throughout those three and four decades, the design, the \nconstruction, the loading, the unloading, and the safe transportation \nof over 150,000 pounds of extremely poisonous nuclear waste must all be \ndone perfectly--at least almost perfectly. One accident, one rupture, \none attack would have devastating effects on the lives of people today \nand for generations to follow, as one look at a victim of the Chernobyl \nnuclear accident would confirm.\n  That is the easy part, those 30 to 40 years. Now those 150,000 pounds \nor as much as 200,000 pounds of radioactive waste has to be stored, \ncontained, and isolated perfectly--almost perfectly--for thousands of \nyears.\n  That it must be nearly perfect does not mean it is unattainable or \nunsustainable, but it does mean that the standards for approval must be \nvery high. The standards of reliability, of proven technology, of \npublic safety must be extraordinarily high. They must be met and \nmaintained with certainty, and that certainty must be guaranteed to the \nAmerican people.\n  This project is nowhere near that standard today, not even close. \nThat is why we should not even be considering the approval we are being \nrequired to give or to deny today. This is not what the law proscribes.\n  The law states, as it has for the last 20 years, that within 90 days \nafter Congress's final approval, which will be today if this body so \ndecides, the Department of Energy shall submit its application to the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  According to the Secretary of the Department of Energy, the \nDepartment is at least 2 years or more away from being ready to submit \nthat application. According to the private project manager, Bechtel \nCorporation, DOE is 4 years or more away from being able to submit an \nacceptable application.\n\n  I was not here in 1982 when the law was passed, but clearly the \nlawmakers intended, and I believe wisely so, that Congress's final \nreview of this project would be within 90 days, or very shortly before \nthe Department of Energy made its application to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission; in other words, after all the testing and design and \nevaluation had been completed. Today we can do nothing more, if we are \nso inclined, to say it looks OK or it does not look OK. A lot more has \nto be done.\n  As the Senator from Nevada pointed out correctly, the Department of \nEnergy has still almost 200 tests and assessments remaining that it \nagreed, itself, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have to be \ncompleted before the Department of Energy could even submit an \nacceptable application for site construction to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. Just to develop an acceptable application, it has to \ncomplete some 200 more assessments. Then the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission has up to 4 years to review. There is no one else who has \nthe expertise beyond ours and is associated with this project who \nmaintains it is even ready to begin to be considered. Why are we put in \na position of acting on it today? Why even consider approving it today?\n  Given those high standards that are necessary, some of the recent \ncritiques of expert advisory boards and commissions are truly alarming. \nA January 24 letter of this year to Congress by the U.S. Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board stated:\n\n       The Board's view is that the technical basis for DOE's \n     repository performance estimates is weak to moderate at this \n     time.\n\n  Weak to moderate is a long ways from perfect.\n  In a September 18, 2001, letter to the Chairman of the U.S. Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Waste \ndocumented its review of the Department of Energy's performance \nmodeling called TSTA-SR. The committee's ``principal findings are that \nthis system does not lead to a realistic risk-informed result and does \nnot inspire confidence in the TSTA-SR process. In particular, the TSTA-\nSR reflects the input and results of models and assumptions that are \nnot founded on realistic assessment of the evidence. The consequence is \nthat TSTA-SR does not provide a basis for estimating margins of \nsafety.''\n  Others who have written and raised similar questions and concerns. I \nbelieve we should say no to the Yucca Mountain site today, not to \nremove it from further consideration but we should not commit ourselves \nto a decision that will affect the lives of millions of Americans today \nand for generations and generations to follow based on insufficient \nevidence, inadequate testing, incomplete analyses, undocumented \nstrategies. In a sense, the Senate would be put in a position to make \nthat attestation today which\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\nno one could responsibly make about this project, particularly given \nthis level of assurance that the American people deserve.\n  Finally, as to the citizens of Nevada, they have been remarkably, \nextraordinarily well served by the two Senators from that State, \nSenators Reid and Ensign. We preside in the Senate in inverse \nproportion to our seniority, which means I--being 100th in seniority--\nspend as much time presiding as anyone else; I therefore have a chance \nto observe what is going on in the Senate. The senior Senator from \nNevada, Mr. Reid, has been unbelievable in his tireless pursuit of \nevery Member of this body to discuss and to reason and implore their \nrecognition of the facts as he has so well articulated. Senator Ensign \nis in his first term and has encountered an enormous responsibility to \nhis State which he has also performed remarkably well.\n\n  Regardless of the outcome of today's vote, I cannot imagine any two \npeople who could have possibly done more, tried more, put more of \nthemselves, heart and soul, into doing what they believe with all their \nfervor is the right thing for the people of Nevada, and I believe for \nthe people of the United States, including the people of Minnesota, \nwhich is to vote no against Yucca Mountain as a site today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, before I yield to the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee 7 to 10 minutes, I point out \nthat for the past several decades we have moved nuclear waste safely in \nthis country. We have had 2,700 shipments in the past 30 years. We have \nshipped 1.7 million miles. We have not had a single harmful release of \nradioactivity. This is substantiated by the testimony in the committee. \nBoth the Regulatory Commission and the Department of Transportation, \nthe agencies responsible testified that the waste can be ``safely and \nsecurely transported.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from Alaska \nyielding me a few minutes to express my views on this issue.\n  We are in a debate now about whether to proceed to consider S.J. Res. \n34 which would approve President Bush's recommendation of Yucca \nMountain as the site for the development of a nuclear waste repository. \nThe resolution does not authorize construction of a repository. \nSimilarly, it does not authorize the transportation of nuclear waste to \nYucca Mountain. What the resolution does do is allow the Department of \nEnergy to apply to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a license to \nbegin construction of the repository. The Department of Energy still \nneeds to persuade the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that the repository \nwould be safe before construction could begin and before shipments to \nthe repository could begin. Failure to approve the resolution that we \nare talking about, S.J. Res. 34, would terminate the Nation's nuclear \nwaste program.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, passed before I came to this \nSenate, gave the Governor of Nevada the power to veto the President's \nsite recommendation, and the Governor of Nevada exercised that \nauthority in April. If the President does not join the House of \nRepresentatives in voting to override the Governor's veto by the 27th \nof this month--this July--the Governor's veto stands. If the Governor's \nveto is sustained, either the waste will stay where it is, in temporary \nabove-ground holding tanks at 72 nuclear powerplant sites and 4 \nDepartment of Energy nuclear weapons plants in 39 States, either it \nstays where it is in those locations from now on, or Congress will have \nto pass a new law to authorize the Department of Energy to search for a \nnew site, leaving the waste where it is safe enough in the short run.\n  I am not one who is saying there is an imminent health risk or safety \nrisk from leaving the waste where it currently is in the short run. \nHowever, it is not an acceptable long-term solution. It would require \nconstant monitoring where it now is and frequent replacement of the \nstorage containers for thousands of years, or the waste will escape \ninto the environment. That is based on the expert testimony we received \nin the committee hearings.\n  Looking for another site, without allowing the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission to consider Yucca Mountain, to consider an application for a \nlicense to use Yucca Mountain, is not a realistic course of action. We \nhave spent 20 years; we spent $4 billion looking at Yucca Mountain \nalready. No one has found a technical or scientific reason that makes \nit unsuitable as yet. We are not likely to find a better site next \ntime, but, of course, if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission determines \nthat another site has to be found, then we can take on that task.\n\n  The Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, which I chair, of \nwhich my colleague from Alaska is the ranking member, carefully \nconsidered the arguments against the repository that have been raised \nby opponents of the project. I am the first to admit that not all of \nthe questions that have been raised by the opponents have yet been \nadequately answered. They have not been. Many of those are questions, \nthough, that are best answered by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in \nits licensing procedures and nothing in the record before us justifies \na decision, in my view, to terminate the program at this stage.\n  The hearing record that we compiled in the Energy Committee supports \napproval of the resolution and it supports allowing the waste program \nto continue. While not prejudging whether it will approve a license \napplication for Yucca Mountain, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nitself--and we had the Commission members there testifying before our \ncommittee--testified that they believed nuclear waste can be safely \ntransported and safely buried at a repository. Not necessarily this \none--that will be a decision they will make in the future--but at a \nrepository.\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board testified that:\n\n       No individual technical or scientific factor has been \n     identified that would automatically eliminate Yucca Mountain \n     from consideration.\n\n  The Environmental Protection Agency testified that the radiation \nprotection standards that will apply to this repository are ``among the \nmost stringent in the world.'' If the repository complies with them it \n``will be fully protective of public health and the environment.''\n  That is ``if'' the repository complies with these standards. As I \nsay, that is a decision the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will make in \nthe future.\n  In addition to these agencies of the Federal Government, we also \nheard from the U.S. Geological Survey. They stated:\n\n       The scientific work performed to date supports a decision \n     to recommend Yucca Mountain for development of the nuclear \n     waste repository [and that] no feature or characteristic of \n     the site . . . would preclude recommending the site.\n  So based on this record, the committee found no reason to terminate \nthe program.\n  The National Academy of Sciences has said:\n\n       [G]eological disposal remains the only scientifically and \n     technically credible long-term solution available to meet the \n     need for safety without reliance on active management.\n\n  We have a responsibility to dispose of these wastes rather than leave \nthem for future generations to deal with. I do not favor just kicking \nthis can down the road and leaving it for someone else to act.\n  In sum, a vote for the motion to proceed on the resolution is not a \nfinal vote to put nuclear waste in Yucca Mountain. It is a vote to let \nthe Department of Energy apply for a license, a vote to let the \ntechnical experts at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission decide whether \nYucca Mountain is, in fact, safe.\n  A vote against the resolution is a vote to stop the program in its \ntracks, to leave the waste where it is with no alternative strategy for \nfinding another site, and, frankly, with little or no chance of putting \ntogether a political consensus to find another site in the foreseeable \nfuture.\n  On the basis of those reasons, I urge my colleagues to approve the \nmotion to proceed and to approve the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I will yield to my friend from California in a minute, but \nthis is another one of the fallacies of this\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\nwhole debate. Isn't it too bad we have worked on it all this time, and \nif it doesn't go through, what are we going to do?\n  Chairman Meserve of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said less than \na month ago:\n\n       If Yucca Mountain were to fail because of congressional \n     action, that does not mean all of a sudden from a policy \n     point of view that the country is at a stalemate and is \n     confronting imminent disaster.\n\n  Of course he would say that. We have nuclear reactors around the \ncountry that are using their facilities to store the stuff onsite--\nsafely, in dry cask storage containment. You don't have all the worries \nof transportation. It is safer than trying to haul this stuff past our \nschools and homes. This is an argument that is without foundation. It \nwould not mean the end of the nuclear world at all.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from California who, I would state, \nis the chair of the environmental task force Senator Daschle has set up \nand who has done an outstanding job pointing up the environmental \nproblems we have in America today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, it is indeed an honor to stand with my \nfriend from Nevada on this issue because there can be no higher calling \nthat we have than to protect the health and safety of the people we \nrepresent--no higher calling.\n  It seems to me very interesting that, as we are about to address a \nvery important subject of corporate irresponsibility and try to fix the \nmess that is happening on Wall Street, we would be disrupted from that \ntask to go to an issue such as this, which is so very harmful to our \npeople. I am going to take some time to explain it.\n  My State of California is one of the most affected by the Yucca \nMountain project because Yucca Mountain is only 17 miles from the \nCalifornia border and from Death Valley National Park. Scientific \nstudies have shown that the regional ground water aquifer surrounding \nYucca Mountain discharges into Death Valley because Death Valley is \ndown gradient from Yucca Mountain. If the ground water is contaminated, \nthat will mean the demise of the park and the surrounding communities.\n  The tests that have been done on the site are not what we would want \nto see. We see leakage; we do not see dryness. We see problems with \nYucca Mountain that would lead most people to assume there will be a \nproblem with leakage into the ground water. It is an absolute travesty \nwaiting to happen to my State.\n  The long-term viability of the fish, the wildlife, and the human \npopulation is dependent on this aquifer. Water is life in the desert. \nWater quality must be preserved. Given the threat posed by Yucca \nMountain, I have opposed it, and that was before 9-11.\n  Since 9-11, we have a whole other area of concern and that is taking \nthis waste from all over the country and putting it on trucks or trains \nand shipping it across this country. It is an absolute disaster waiting \nto happen. This is so hot that it has to be cooled for--I say to my \nfriend from Nevada, Senator Reid, am I correct in saying that waste is \nso hot that it has to be cooled? And for how long does it have to be \ncooled?\n  Mr. REID. I will respond to my friend from California. National \nGeographic this month has a wonderful article on nuclear waste. Among \nother things, it confirms what we have known for a long time. The \nnuclear reactors in America and around the world are 97 percent \ninefficient. That means you put in a fuel rod in a nuclear reactor and \nwhen they take it out, it still has 97 percent of its radioactivity. It \nhas only used 3 percent.\n  The nuclear reactors are so inefficient they have to take them out of \nthe reactors and put them in water. You cannot take them out of the \nwater for at least 5 years for them to cool down.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Five years.\n  Mr. REID. Five years for them to cool down. So I say to my friend \nfrom California, all this talk about we need to have one site, we don't \nneed to have 131 sites--the fact is, they are always going to have \nspent fuel at the sites of the power-generating facilities.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend. I knew this waste was so hot that it \nwould have to be cooled down, but I wasn't aware that it was for 5 \nyears.\n  Post 9-11, you would think this administration would think twice, or \nthree times, or six times, before they would go ahead and give the \norder for this waste to move. We have given the airlines billions of \ndollars. We are spending so much to make airports safe and here we have \nthis administration, the one that tells us we are in a war--there is \nnot a speech this President makes that he doesn't remind us that we are \nin a war--is ready to put this kind of material on our roads.\n  I am just incredulous. The only thing I can come up with is, who is \nreally behind all of this?\n  I have a list of some of the people who are pushing for this. Let us \nput that on the floor since we are talking about corporate power this \nweek.\n  We have the Nuclear Energy Institute. There are 260 companies in the \nNuclear Energy Institute pushing this. They include Enron, First \nEnergy, Bechtel, Duke Energy, and General Electric, to name a few. \nThere are a lot of special interests--260, to be exact--pushing this.\n  But where are the people? The people will be living in fear, I \nguarantee you, when this starts.\n  Let me show you a map which I think my colleague must have shown \nbefore. Let me show you a map first of just one area, Sacramento. The \nred area is within 1 mile of one of the proposed routes. The yellow \narea is within 3 miles of the proposed route, and the light yellow is \nwithin 5 miles.\n  If you look at all of this, you see these little arrows. They are \nactually schoolhouses. These are the schools located so close to this \ntraffic. The H's are the hospitals. We have 167 schools that are within \n5 miles in this area. There are seven hospitals within 5 miles.\n  The PTA has sent us a letter against this project.\n  Where are my colleagues? You would think 9/11 never happened. You \nwould think 9/11 was just something in a movie. The PTA has basically \ntold us: Don't do this until you have a plan that you can prove is \nsafe.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator mentioned the 260-plus companies that make up \nNEI. Is the Senator aware that there is a lawsuit now pending to have \nthe Vice President of the United States divulge who he met with at \nthose energy companies and what they talked about? Is the Senator aware \nof that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am certainly aware of that.\n  Mr. REID. I felt so strongly about that issue that I filed an amicus \ncuriae brief joining with the GAO to have him divulge that information. \nI will bet a significant number of the 261-plus companies met with him \nto develop the energy policy this administration came up with. Does the \nSenator suggest that is probably true?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Given the track record of this administration in terms of \nits energy policy and the President's lack of anything very exciting in \nterms of how we are going to regain the confidence and trust of the \npeople, it is very possible--indeed, probable, in fact--that these \ncompanies, or certainly their representatives, met with the Vice \nPresident.\n  I will tell you, when that comes out, we will know even more why, \neven after 9/11, they had this plan.\n  This is just one area--Sacramento. I want to show you Los Angeles. We \nare not talking philosophy or ideology. We are talking about the \nhottest, most dangerous waste known to humankind coming near schools \nand hospitals in my State and in almost every other State.\n  Again, the red area is within 1 mile of the route. The yellow area is \nwithin 3 miles. The light yellow area is within 5 miles. We have 446 \nschools within 5 miles of these routes. Is this what we owe those \nlittle kids? Is this what we owe them? Are they going to close the \nschool down when they transport this near by? There are 23 hospitals \nwithin 5 miles.\n  I am amazed we are debating this issue. I am amazed we are debating \nthis issue. The Department of Energy doesn't tell us what the final \nplan is. You know why? It is because of the outcry in the country when \nthat final plan comes forward.\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n  Attorney General Ashcroft has said we should worry about a ``dirty'' \nbomb. And we all do. We already know it has been disruptive. That is a \n``dirty'' bomb. That is material that doesn't even come close to the \ndanger of this material.\n  I want to give you the facts about what happens in California with \nthe transportation of this waste.\n  We have 35 million people in our State. Seven million people in \nCalifornia live within 1 mile of the proposed route.\n  I ask my colleague for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I yield the Senator from California 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 more minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There are 231 hospitals within 1 mile of the proposed \nroute. There are 3,500 schools within 1 mile of the proposed route. \nNuclear waste shipments in California over the life of the project, if \ndone by truck, will be 14,000-plus; if done by train, 13,000-plus; \n2,040 metric tons of nuclear waste at facilities throughout California \nnow--which means that even with the Yucca Mountain we are going to have \nnuclear waste in the State, which is also the case with most of our \nStates.\n  Our Attorney General had a press conference about the potential of a \n``dirty'' bomb. We worry about where the terrorists are going to get \nthis material. This administration has been backing the transportation \nof the most dangerous nuclear waste and not even mentioning 9/11. It is \nalmost like a Rip Van Winkle situation when it comes to Yucca Mountain. \nWell, we have done it; we spent the money; and, we have invested it. It \ndoesn't matter--9/11, or anything else. You could have another \nterrorist and it would still be here for Yucca Mountain.\n  Loud special interests are behind this vote. That is the only way you \ncan come to any other conclusion.\n  I will tell you some of the people who oppose this. I mentioned the \nPTA. I will give you some more: The Alliance for Nuclear \nAccountability, American Land Alliance, American Rivers, American \nPublic Health Association, Clean Water Action, Environmental Action \nFoundation, Environmental Defense, Fellowship of Reconciliation, \nFriends of the Earth, and the Government Accountability Project. It \ngoes on: League of Conservation Voters, International Association of \nFirefighters.\n  Do you want to be a fireman and get called to a fire when one of \nthese accidents happens? The Department of Energy has said they know \nalready there are going to be accidents. Is that 100 accidents?

Madam President, I want to conclude and say I could show \nyou other charts that show the impact on other States. But I have made \nmy point. This nuclear waste is going to go by schools, it is going to \ngo by hospitals, it is going to go by our families, it is going to go \nby our children, it is going to go by our homes, and it is going to go \nby our businesses. And post-9/11 we don't even have the final plan.\n  I am proud to stand with my friends from Nevada. I am going to be in \nthis fight if they need me because I believe there are some moments on \nthis floor when you have to step up and realize you are here for a \nbrief time, but decisions we make can come back to haunt us. I hope \ntoday people will think about that and vote with my colleague from \nNevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me point out a couple of facts \nthat perhaps some Members have not reflected upon.\n  There are no proposed routes. There are only potential routes.\n  While the Senator from California points out routes around Sacramento \nor Los Angeles, they have simply taken every major route that has the \npotential of moving nuclear waste and said this is, in fact, a proposed \nroute.\n  That is hardly accurate. It is fair to say there is no Yucca \ntransportation route yet. What opponents have done is they have \nselected every major highway in the U.S. and simply called it \n``proposed.'' That is certainly stretching things to suggest it is \ngoing to go by hospitals, it is going to go by schools.\n  Clearly, there are efforts being made by the responsible agencies. If \nwe create these agencies, we have the oversight. If we do not have the \nfaith in them to do their job--the Department of Transportation, the \nDepartment of Energy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission--are we to \nmicromanage, if you will, when waste has been moving safely across this \ncountry for decades, and to suggest that somehow we cannot move it \nsafely?\n  California is 17-percent dependent on nuclear energy. I am looking at \na spreadsheet. Cumulative spent fuel, in California, at the end of the \nyear 2000, was 1,954 metric tons, not including 98 metric tons from the \nSan Onofre Nuclear Reactor. There are 403 metric tons at shutdown \nreactors, 11 metric tons in dry storage. It is going to stay there \nunless it is going to be moved somewhere. It has to be moved by a \nroute. It has to be moved safely. Is it going to be moved by train or \nby highway?\n  Clearly, we have moved 2,700 shipments in 30 years 1.7 million miles, \nand with not a single harmful release of radioactivity. We have had \nshipments to WIPP in New Mexico--900 shipments, since 1997, 900,000 \nshipment miles, and not a single harmful release of radioactivity.\n  Do you think we are the creators of moving this stuff? In Europe \nthere has been 70,000 tons shipped safely over 25 years. So this isn't \nsomething that has just happened.\n  We have moved high-level nuclear waste across this country. Now we \nare talking about moving waste out of our reactors. We are talking \nabout doing it responsibly.\n  Some of these arguments--we have heard the term ``red herring.'' \nWell,\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nthis is a ``nuclear herring,'' if you will. Maybe it glows in the dark. \nBut it certainly suggests, in this debate, that somehow we are doing \nsomething new in this country, that we are doing something that is high \nrisk in which we have not had any experience.\n  Again, in reference to bringing this discussion in the parameters, we \nare not moving it to Yucca Mountain today. We are simply authorizing \nthe administration to proceed with the license process which will \naddress the legitimate transportation questions that are coming up in \nthis debate.\n  I yield the floor to my good friend from Wyoming.\n  How much time would the Senator from Wyoming require?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I think about 10 minutes, please.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is an issue we have talked about for \na good long time. Some of the things I have heard today are quite \ndifferent than what we have talked about before. Nevertheless, everyone \nis entitled to their own views.\n  I think, as has been mentioned, we ought to remind ourselves what the \npurpose of this particular vote is about. It is to make it possible for \nthe Secretary to apply for a license to construct a site at Yucca \nMountain. If this fails, then ever since the 1980s, 24 years of work, \nand $4 billion worth of expenditures will be halted and nothing more \nwill happen.\n  This is not the final issue to be talked about. This is not the issue \nof transportation. This is the issue of whether or not to move forward \nand license the site, which will then provide the opportunity and the \nnecessity of moving on to other issues, such as defining the \ntransportation routes and dealing with the safety of transportation.\n  I think we ought to keep in mind what we are doing here and that is \nto authorize them to move forward in licensing the site. The site, of \ncourse, is one of the most important issues before us. It has been said \na number of times that there are 131 different sites where waste is \nstored. Not all of those sites will disappear, of course, but many of \nthem will. Those that have been Government used, that are not \ncontinuing to be used, will be gone. We will have fewer sites.\n  I do not hear anyone talking about solving the problem. All I hear \nabout is avoiding coming to a decision. I think we need to ask \nourselves which is better in terms of safety: to have it generally in \none place or to have 131 different sites?\n  Talking about trying to have protection and security, how much \nsecurity do you think there is in every one of these sites? If you are \ntalking about September 11, you have to talk a little bit about having \nall these sites. We are trying to consolidate some.\n  So it has been interesting to hear the kinds of reactions that we \nhave had. The site is there, of course, because Yucca Mountain is 90 \nmiles from the nearest population centers. It is one of the most remote \nplaces in the country. The climate is conducive to storage. There are \nmultiple national barriers in order that tunnels can be stored. There \nis great depth, 2,600 feet deep underneath, an isolated basin.\n  So this is something that has been selected with a very great deal of \nstudy from a number of places. This is the one that was decided upon to \nbe the best. So that is where we are.\n  It is interesting, all we hear about are problems. I think it is up \nto us to talk about some solutions. I hope we can do that. In fact, I \nthink to say this Energy Department material is not useful is a \nstretch. Certainly this material has been studied. Experts have put \nthis information in there.\n  Some of the information we are hearing lacks a little bit. At the \nhearings we held, there was a gentleman who had been the past director \nof highway safety who was talking about highways. I asked him who he \nwas working for. It turned out he had been paid by the State of Nevada. \nTalk about people being in support of the idea and causing people to \nhave their positions the way they are.\n  Let me talk a minute, though, about transportation. Obviously, \ntransportation could very well be going through our State of Wyoming, \nalthough, as the Senator from Alaska points out, those decisions have \nnot been made. Everyone is talking about where it is going to go. That \nhas not been decided. In fact, I have written a letter to the Secretary \nof Energy to ensure, as we move through this particular decision, that \nwe will move on, then, to an equally difficult decision about \ntransportation, and also to get assurance--which he has assured us--\nthat the Governors and officials in the States will coordinate and will \nbe cooperative workers in terms of deciding what the routes are.\n  In any event, we have talked a little bit about the history of \ntransportation. It is very impressive. We have had 30 years of \ntransportation of nuclear waste of various kinds without an incident. \nWe have had that over 1.5 million miles. It is handled safely.\n  I was surprised. At the hearing, they had a sample on the floor of \nthe kinds of containers that spent nuclear material is in. I had no \nidea, frankly, what it was. But they are in solid pellets, \napproximately the size of a pencil eraser. And they are secured in \nmultiple layer metal tubes. They are hard, and they are solid.\n  Nuclear waste is not fluid. It is not a gas. It will not pour or \nevaporate. It is in these big, hard vats that are set up for it. \nNuclear waste, nuclear fuel does not burn, as a matter of fact. It is \nnot flammable, even if it is engulfed in fire.\n  Spent nuclear fuel cannot explode. We sort of get the notion that it \nis going to go up in a big puff. That is not the case. It is \ntransported in strong thick-walled casks, casks that have been dropped \nfrom 30 feet in a free fall from helicopters to be tested. And they \nhave a puncture test with a special way to do it. They have flatbed \ntrucks that have been smashed into a 700-ton concrete wall at 80 miles \nan hour.\n  There is safety here. Safety, of course, is a high issue for all of \nus. No one would suggest it should not be. Most of it will be done by \ntrain, not on the highways. These are the things we will have to deal \nwith and we will deal with over a period of time.\n  We should start, of course, with dealing with the question. We have \nagreed, in 1982, to take care of this waste, particularly in the \ncommercial uses that have been there. They have been taxed $17 billion \nto do something with it. What they are doing with it now is not the \nsafest thing that can be done.\n  I know when you talk about nuclear, everybody swells up, but it is \ninteresting to also recall that Illinois, for example, generates over \n30 percent of their electricity with nuclear. Of course, there is \nnuclear waste. But we need to do something with it. We are going to be \nmoving more toward it.\n  On the other side, it is one of the cleanest kinds of electric \ngenerating fuels we can have. I guess if I have been impressed by \nanything in this discussion, it is that we haven't really dealt with \nthe problem, How do we solve it? What we have talked about, what we \nhear about almost all the time, is how do we avoid making a decision on \nan issue that is there, and one that is obviously going to be there \nuntil we do something about it, until we follow through on what we \nagreed to do in 1982 and have not done since, and haven't heard much \nabout, as a matter of fact. We spent $4 billion in Nevada. We didn't \nhear much about that. Fine.\n  I hope we can go ahead and deal with this, support this portion of \nthe total decision that needs to be made, move forward on this site, \nand then deal with the other issues that come before us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will yield to my friend from Michigan in a \nsecond. I do want to say, however, that of course the routes Senator \nBoxer talked about are the routes proposed by the DOE in their final \nenvironmental impact statement. They have said they are not sure this \nis the final transportation plan they will have, but that is what they \nhave said so far.\n  Jim Hall, former head of the National Transportation Safety Board, \nsaid in testimony: What I find more shocking about the Yucca Mountain \nproject is that DOE has no plan to transport spent nuclear fuel to its \nproposed repository.\n  Secretary Abraham testified last week that DOE is just beginning to \nformulate preliminary thoughts about a transportation plan, even though \nin\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nthe final environmental impact statement they did give us these routes \nabout which Senator Boxer and others have talked.\n  Puncture tests? Sure, there are puncture tests. We know a shoulder-\nfired weapon will go through one of those canisters of spent fuel rods. \nWe know that. The tests have been proven. We also know they don't \nwithstand fire. Diesel fuel burns at 1,400 degrees. They have only had \nthese tests go up to 1,200 degrees. If you have a fire and a diesel \ntruck is carrying this, it will breach the container.\n  The things we are being told simply have no validity. We talk all the \ntime about all this dangerous stuff that has been hauled. Let me tell \nyou about the WIPP facility. The WIPP facility is the waste isolation \nproject in New Mexico. WIPP is the most highly planned nuclear shipment \nwe have ever had. Yet the first shipment went the wrong way, 28 miles \nthe wrong way, and was turned around by the local police department. \nThe DOE satellite tracking system didn't work. The truck was going 28 \nmiles the wrong way. It turned around. It was 56 miles on a road on \nwhich they were not supposed to be.\n  Eighty percent of all traffic accidents are not as a result of \nanything going wrong with the equipment; it is human factors. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  No harmful releases of radiation? That is laughable, Mr. President. \nThere have been accidents, and there have been releases over these \n2,700 shipments. Some of those have dealt with pounds of stuff, not \ntons. On one of these trucks, the cannister alone was 10 tons. There \nhave been releases over the years that they have been doing this. The \nDOE itself says there will be at least 100 accidents. That is in their \nproposed findings in the environmental impact statement.\n  Someone can vote against this with goodness in their heart. They are \ndoing the right thing. This is not good for the country.\n  My friend mentioned France and Germany. They may have hauled a lot of \nstuff, but they haven't hauled a lot of stuff lately because it has \nbeen stopped in its tracks. Germany has given up trying to haul it \nbecause people lie down in the streets and chain themselves to railroad \ntracks.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues from Nevada for \ntheir leadership on this very important issue for all of us. I know my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in saying there is \nnot a more revered Member of this body than our senior Senator from \nNevada. I thank him for his leadership, his intelligence, his \ncompassion, and his advocacy on this particular issue as well as many \nothers.\n  When I was in the Michigan Senate, I helped to lead an effort to stop \nputting casks along Lake Michigan and our nuclear facilities because of \nmy concern about the waste being along Lake Michigan. I certainly still \nhave that concern. We lost that, and the waste is there.\n  On first blush, when I was in the House of Representatives, I thought \nsupporting a permanent nuclear storage site at Yucca Mountain was a \ngood idea. I want the waste out of Michigan. There is no question about \nit. My preference, if we could say, ``Beam me up, Scottie,'' would be \nto move the waste out of Michigan.\n  Unfortunately, by very close examination of the facts and information \nfrom the Department of Energy, their current documents, I have come to \nthe conclusion that this proposal not only will maintain existing \nthreats to the Great Lakes but will create new ones, new security \nrisks, new environmental threats for the Great Lakes and for Michigan \nfamilies. I am deeply concerned about that and frustrated because \nfundamentally I want the waste out of Michigan. But I do not want to \ncreate more threats in the process.\n  It goes without saying that the world has changed since September 11. \nWe know that. We hear that all the time from our President. We say that \non the floor of the Senate practically every day. The world has changed \nsince September 11.\n  Since the tragedies in New York and Pennsylvania and the Pentagon, we \nhave administration officials who daily tell us that we are going to \nsee further attacks. On May 19 of this year, the Vice President stated \non ``Meet the Press'' that the prospects of a future terrorist attack \nagainst the United States are almost certain and not a matter of if but \nwhen. That should be a concern--and I know it is--for all of us. It \nshould in some way be a shadow over every decision we make today in \nthis body for our families, for the families we represent.\n  On June 10, as we all know--just a month ago--the American people \nbecame aware of a plot to potentially detonate a so-called ``dirty'' \nbomb which could kill thousands of people and send poisonous nuclear \nmatter throughout the air, exposing hundreds of thousands more people \nto nuclear radiation. This causes me to pause and look at what we are \ndoing in a new light. September 11 and the ongoing war against \nterrorism has, in fact, put this in a new light for me. I have examined \nhow the nuclear waste from Michigan's storage sites would be \ntransported across Michigan to Yucca Mountain and, unfortunately, I am \nvery concerned there is not a plan by the Department of Energy to \nprotect those shipments from terrorist attack.\n\n  I have asked the questions of our State government, I have asked the \nquestions of our Department of Energy, and I am told, as we have heard \nover and over again, that the Department is only beginning to look at \ndeveloping a transportation plan and designating transportation routes. \nYet we are asked to decide today on this project without that \ninformation.\n  I am also very concerned the Department has not implemented any \nadditional security requirements for transporting nuclear waste since \n9-11 to ensure safety and protect the shipments from terrorist attack. \nIn addition, I am very deeply concerned to find that there is no \nGovernment agency that has conducted full-scale physical tests of the \ncasks that would be used to transport high-level nuclear waste to Yucca \nMountain; nor have these test requirements been reviewed or \nstrengthened to take into account how the casks would perform under a \npotential terrorist attack.\n  This is a new day. There are new questions and new tests that need to \ntake place in light of our current reality as Americans.\n  I am very concerned today, when I pick up the Washington Post and \nfind that they further reveal that the EPA has been keeping under wraps \na February 2002 report that concludes that they are not fully prepared \nto handle a large-scale nuclear, biological, or chemical attack. The \nEPA is the primary agency for providing support to State and local \ngovernments in response to a discharge of nuclear or hazardous \nmaterials, and they are not fully prepared to deal with current \nsecurity threats.\n  How well prepared will they be once thousands of nuclear shipments \nbegin to travel by our schools, our hospitals, through our communities, \nour residential neighborhoods, en route to Yucca Mountain.\n  I also discovered, Mr. President, in my examination of the Department \nof Energy's own documents, that most of the waste stored in Michigan \nwill never make it to Yucca Mountain. That is a pretty big discovery \nfor me. Most of the waste in Michigan will never make it to Yucca \nMountain. As long as nuclear powerplants operate in Michigan, new \nnuclear waste will have to be stored in cooling pools, as indicated by \nmy colleagues, on the shores of the Great Lakes for 5 years at a time \nso they can be cooled before they are transported anywhere. Much of the \nnuclear waste in Michigan will not be moved to Yucca Mountain because \nYucca Mountain will reach its full capacity within the first 25 years \nof operation.\n  While I want the waste out of Michigan, away from its shores, We have \na worst case scenario for the people of Michigan. The nuclear waste \nwill continue to sit on the shores of the Great Lakes and also be \ntraveling on our roads and railways--and, Heaven forbid, even barges on \nthe Great Lakes--past our communities, neighborhoods and schools.\n  Let me speak to that new threat that, unfortunately, is in the \nenvironmental impact statement the Department released just a few \nmonths ago,\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nwhich raised a tremendous red flag for me. The Department of Energy's \nfinal environmental impact statement describes barging nuclear waste on \nthe Great Lakes as a transportation option. Now, in fairness, they \nindicate that while there could be as many as 431 barge shipments of \nnuclear waste on Lake Michigan, that is not their preferred option. I \nam glad that is not their preferred option, but, unfortunately, when \nwriting the Secretary, he would not take it off the table as an option. \nIn fact, he indicated that the Department of Energy ``has made no \ndecision on the matter.''\n\n  I cannot imagine putting high-level nuclear waste on barges and \nsending it across Lake Michigan. There is not a plan in the world that \nI would support to do that. The answer of the Department on this issue \nis simply not good enough. I cannot support any plan that includes a \ntransportation option that endangers one-fifth of the world's \nfreshwater supply and the source of drinking water for the entire Great \nLakes region.\n  Mr. President, today's vote, unfortunately, will be the last time \nCongress will have a real voice on this issue. We certainly can express \nourselves as it moves through the regulatory process, but this is the \ntime for us to say, yes, we know enough to move forward or, no, we do \nnot. If we say no, we can ask that more information be given to us, \nthat more tests be done, and that we receive assurances, such as I \nneed, to know that there will not be, under any circumstances, barging \non the Great Lakes. We can get that information and then we can proceed \nagain.\n  This is not the end. We can proceed further--those of us who want \nmore information, more assurances, and want to know that our \ncommunities will be safe and the environment will be safe. There is no \nreason we cannot work on getting those assurances and the plans in \nplace first.\n  Based on my examination of the Department of Energy's own documents, \nas well as further information, I do not believe this administration \nhas a safety plan for transporting waste to Yucca Mountain that \nprotects my citizens, Michigan families, or the Great Lakes. Therefore, \nI cannot support the Yucca Mountain resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me point out that the State of \nMichigan is currently 18.2 percent dependent on nuclear energy. \nCurrently, in the State of Michigan, there are 1,627 metric tons of \nspent fuel of which 58 tons is in shutdown reactors, and 177 tons is in \ndry storage.\n  As a consequence of the alternatives we face, the recognition is \nobvious that if we do not move this waste, it is going to stay where it \nis. The nuclear power generation in Michigan consists of four nuclear \nunits: Cook 1 and 2, Fermi 2, and Palisades. As a consequence of the \nrecognition that there are six storage locations covering the 1,625 \nmetric tons, we have to address the reality of how much longer the \nnuclear plants can continue to operate without a permanent repository. \nThat is what the contemplated vote is all about.\n  Questions have been raised by Members concerning the routing. Again, \nI point out the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves all routes and \nsecurity plans with States and tribes, including the Department of \nTransportation, Department of Energy and, of course, the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. For security, armed guards are required through \nheavily populated metropolitan areas if they are indeed selected. At \nthe discretion of the Governor of each State, all shipments are \nrequired to have 24-hour escorts.\n  Tracking: The Governor of each State is notified in advance of spent \nfuel shipments. These shipments are required to have an escort into the \ncentral transportation command facility every 2 hours to ensure that \nproblems do not exist. All shipments are closely coordinated with local \nand Federal law enforcement agencies.\n  As far as training, States and tribes have and will continue to \nreceive Federal support for specific training. On the question of what \nis the Government doing with emergency preparedness assistance, since \n1950, the Federal Government has had its own experienced teams of \nemergency responders. Emergency responders receive assistance and \ntraining from the Department of Energy, Department of Transportation, \nFEMA, and others, and are specially trained and prepared to respond to \na variety of incidents and accidents, and DOD will continue to provide \ntraining to emergency responders. The Department has directly trained \nover 1,200 responders.\n  In addition, DOE has trained instructors and have provided training \nto additional emergency personnel in the State, tribal, and local \nresponse groups. Training materials have been distributed.\n\n  It is fair to say efforts are made to train local government \nentities. There is a misconception somehow that if there is an \naccident, there is likely to be a fire, some kind of an explosion. That \nis not the case. If, indeed, there is a penetration of a cask, which is \nextraordinarily unlikely, there will obviously be an awareness, and the \narea will be roped off. The material is very heavy. It does not blow \naround in the wind. Unless you get in and mess with it, why, it can be \ncleaned up by experienced personnel.\n  This is not a matter, as some suggest, that if there is a \npenetration, there is going to be a nuclear explosion of some kind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask how much time is remaining \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 62\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri, Mrs. Carnahan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, when I speak to people throughout \nMissouri, security continues to be their primary concern. They are \nconcerned about threats from abroad and about security in their daily \nlives--job security, health care security, retirement security.\n  In this day and age, when we are making extraordinary efforts to \nprotect ourselves, people are more fearful than ever about shipments of \nnuclear waste through their neighborhoods and communities.\n  In Missouri, this is especially a sensitive issue because of our \nrecent history of nuclear waste shipments. Two summers ago, Governor \nCarnahan succeeded in getting a shipment rerouted around Missouri. But \nlast year, the Department of Energy scheduled another shipment to go \nthrough Missouri. The route the Government selected went through the \nmost populated areas in the State, through the heavily populated \nsuburbs of St. Louis, straight through Columbia, past Independence, and \nthen on through Kansas City.\n  The Government's plan would ship nuclear waste along Interstate 70 \nand other roads that are crowded and in disrepair. Interstate 70 \nthrough Missouri is one of the oldest stretches of Federal interstate \nhighway in the Nation. The newest stretch is 37 years old. The oldest \nstretch is 46 years old. But the original design life was only 20 \nyears.\n  I-70 is one of the most vital transportation corridors in the Nation. \nIt is in need of more than just basic maintenance. It is in need of \ntotal reconstruction.\n  Everyone who travels over I-70 knows it is in horrible condition. The \nnumber and severity of traffic-related accidents along I-70 between \nKansas City and St. Louis have grown steadily in recent years and will \ncontinue to grow with projected increases in travel. Unless the road is \nrepaired and expanded, conditions will continue to deteriorate, \ncongestion will increase, and transportation costs will rise.\n\n  There are two scenarios: Either I-70 will remain in poor condition \nor, as I would prefer, it will undergo massive reconstruction over the \nnext decade. Either way, I-70 should not be the superhighway for \nnuclear waste.\n  If Yucca Mountain is built, that is exactly what will happen. \nPreliminary estimates by the Department of Energy show that within a \n25-year period, over 19,000 truck and 4,000 rail shipments of nuclear \nwaste will go through Missouri on their way to Yucca Mountain. That is \ntwo trucks a day every day passing through St. Louis, Boone County, \nJackson County, and many other counties across the State.\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the manner in which last year's shipment of nuclear \nwaste through Missouri was conducted does not inspire confidence in the \nway the Department of Energy handles these shipments. While the State \nof Missouri and the Department of Energy were negotiating about this \nshipment, the Department announced that it would not allow waste from a \nresearch reactor in Columbia, MO, to be shipped out of State.\n  The linkage of these two issues was inappropriate. While Governor \nHolden was negotiating safety protocols, the Department was playing \npolitics with nuclear waste.\n  I intervened to ensure these issues would be handled separately so \nthat the Governor could continue to insist upon proper safety \narrangements for the shipment.\n  After all this, the shipments showed up in St. Louis at rush hour and \nwould have passed through Kansas City during a Royals baseball game. \nThe shipment had to be held at the border for a number of hours.\n  In my view, we have not focused enough on the transportation issue to \napprove the Yucca Mountain site at this time. The transportation casks \nhave not been thoroughly tested for possible terrorist attack. The \nfinal transportation routes have not been selected, and security of the \ntruck and train shipments has not been studied. There are no concrete \nplans for training emergency responders in local communities along \ntransportation routes. And, as I mentioned, the roads remain in sad \nrepair.\n  All these issues need to be properly addressed before I will consider \nvoting to approve the Yucca Mountain site. It is more important to make \nthe right decision than it is to make a quick decision.\n  Every nuclear reactor in the country has onsite spent fuel. These \nstorage facilities will continue to be used even if the repository at \nYucca Mountain is built because the spent fuel that comes out of the \nreactor must cool for approximately 5 years. Most of these facilities \nwill be upgraded and expanded if and when necessary, and in Missouri \nour single nuclear powerplant will not experience shortage difficulties \nuntil 2024. So there is plenty of time to upgrade and further expand \nits storage facility if necessary.\n  Before committing to ship tons of nuclear waste through the \nheartland, I believe we should spend much more time in determining \nwhether we can transport this waste safely and keep these shipments \naway from our most densely populated communities. I am confident that \nis what the people of Missouri want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I see a couple of Senators, Mr. Crapo \nand Mr. Kyl. I want to point out to the Senator from Missouri that \nnuclear energy includes about 13 percent of the power generated in \nMissouri. Coal is 82 percent. It is about 95 percent in combination.\n  Mr. President, 388 metric tons of spent fuel are currently in the \nState of Missouri. As a consequence, I think it is important--and if I \ncan have the attention of the Senator from Missouri--to point out this \ntransportation route because currently the shipment of waste, this \ntransuranic waste, goes out of Missouri and routes under this highway \nsystem into New Mexico. There is no proposed existing transportation \nroute that will be taking the waste through Missouri. This waste is \ncurrently at the University of Missouri research reactor. It goes out \non 70, up on 55, comes over on 880, and down on 25 into New Mexico.\n  My point is, while it is obviously possible that the Department of \nEnergy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of \nTransportation would choose other routes, it is clear to point out that \ncurrently there has been and there is no logic to suggest there would \nbe a movement of waste through the State of Missouri when currently \ntransportation routes to WIPP do not go through Missouri; they actually \nremove waste from the State of Missouri.\n  We should keep these discussions in the context of accuracy relative \nto what is contemplated vis-a-vis the current transportation route.\n  I yield to my friend from Idaho for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor his graciousness in yielding me this time.\n  I rise today to add my voice and my strong, unequivocal support for \nSenate Joint Resolution 34, a resolution approving development of a \npermanent nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV, \nnotwithstanding the disapproval of the Governor of Nevada.\n  Before I get into my main remarks, I wish to talk a moment about my \ncolleague from Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, who, as a member of the \nEnergy Committee in the Senate, has been tireless in his efforts to \nmake certain that the procedural maneuvers and the substantive debate \nover this issue move forward expeditiously and that we address the \nissues that the law provides so we can make certain the Yucca Mountain \nfacility is able to maneuver forward into the permitting process.\n  As many of those who have debated today have already stated, this \ndebate is not about whether to open the Yucca Mountain facility so much \nas it is about allowing the process of permitting to begin to take \nplace. As my colleagues know, this is the required legislative \nprocedure spelled out by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.\n  In 1982, 20 years ago, Congress made the decision we should begin \nresolving this issue and set forth a series of legislative and other \nprocedures that must be followed to assure that every question--that of \nnational security, safety, of individual State rights, and all the \nother issues--were adequately addressed as we deal with this critical \nissue. Over those 20 years, the importance of dealing with this issue \nhas grown.\n  Now the issue of the role of nuclear power in the portfolio of \nAmerica's energy policy and the manner in which we will resolve the \nhandling of the spent nuclear fuel has become a national security \nissue, in my opinion.\n  I come to this debate with a long history of working on this issue. \nThe State of Idaho, which I have the honor to represent, hosts the \nDepartment of Energy's Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory, NEEL, which currently stores a large volume of spent \nnuclear fuel and high level nuclear waste.\n  The INEEL now has 56.5 percent by volume and 11 percent by weight of \nall spent nuclear fuel in the DOE complex. This spent nuclear fuel \nincludes the Navy's spent nuclear fuel, the spent fuel and rubble from \nThree Mile Island and other commercial power plants, foreign research \nreactor fuel that is coming to the United States from other countries \nfor nonproliferation reasons, and spent fuel from the dozens of \nreactors operated at the INEEL, Argonne-West, and other DOE facilities \nthroughout the country. Under the Idaho Settlement Agreement, the \nNavy's spent nuclear fuel in Idaho must be some of the first fuel to go \ninto Yucca Mountain.\n  Defense high-level waste is the waste that resulted from reprocessing \nspent nuclear fuel. At the INEEL, this high level waste is in \ngranulated ``calcine'' form. DOE is currently deciding how this high \nlevel waste can be prepared and shipped to Yucca Mountain. In the past, \nDOE looked at turning this waste into glass logs in a vitrification \nplant as required by law, but Bechtel and DOE now hope they can make \ndirect shipments of the calcine waste to Yucca Mountain using a \nstandard package similar to that used for spent fuel.\n  The INEEL also manages the DOE National Spent Nuclear Fuel program. \nThis program performs the analysis and technology development to \nsupport inclusion of DOE-owned spent nuclear fuel in the repository \nlicense application. As Yucca opens, this program will play a larger \nrole for DOE and the INEEL.\n  Because of the history of the INEEL, located near my hometown of \nIdaho Falls, I have been involved in nuclear issues for many years. I \nvisited Yucca Mountain and I have seen the dry, isolated location \nPresident Bush has recommended as the site for our Nation's permanent \nrepository for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\n  Right now, across the Nation spent nuclear fuel is stored in \ntemporary facilities near cities, homes, schools, rivers, lakes, and \noceans. These temporary storage facilities were never intended for \nlong-term storage, but they have become that because our Nation has \nbent over backwards to do all of the science needed to ensure permanent \nstorage of nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain can be done safely. After \nspending billions of dollars, our Nation's best scientists say nuclear \nwaste can be stored safely at Yucca Mountain. No one can dispute the \nlogic that it makes more sense for the environment, for national \nsecurity, and for our Nation's energy policy to store spent nuclear \nfuel in one isolated location in the desert of Nevada instead of \nleaving it scattered across the country at over 130 temporary \nfacilities.\n  Some of the opponents of Yucca Mountain say we should not support \nS.J. Res. 34 and development of Yucca Mountain because we cannot safely \ntransport this material. To these opponents I say we have safely sent \nthousands of shipments of nuclear waste across the country for decades.\n  I know other speakers have already repeated this information before. \nBut it is critical to reiterate that in this country we have seen 1.7 \nmillion miles of shipments conducted safely without a release of \nradioactivity. That is over 2,700 shipments. As the Senator from Alaska \nsaid earlier, in Europe where they have been doing this for two and a \nhalf decades, they have had over 70,000 tons of radioactive material \nsafely transported. Compare that record to the risk that we would face \nif we do not transport it.\n  For those in favor of stopping the development of Yucca Mountain, the \nissue of terrorism has been raised. If we have over 131 sites across \nthis country where much of this material is not stored safely--in a \nremote underground facility--the risk of terrorism would rise. Even the \nrisk from a hypothetical earthquake would be much greater at the 131 \nsites if they were left untreated or unresolved than at one central \nunderground location that is safe, secure, and protected.\n  Whether one is looking at the safety record of transportation or the \nrisk of leaving these facilities with the stored nuclear fuel in them \nspread throughout the country in unsafe conditions, the conclusion must \nbe that for our safety, for the environment, and for our national \nsecurity, we must move toward one underground, safe depository.\n  There is also an equity issue before the Senate. For decades, energy \nusers across this country who have received their electricity from \nnuclear power have paid a surcharge on their energy bill to pay the \nFederal Government to dispose of this waste. The Federal Government \nfaithfully collected these fees and assumed the responsibility under \nlaw for developing a nuclear repository. Now after collecting these \nfees and doing the necessary science, the Federal Government has an \nobligation to provide for the permanent disposition of spent nuclear \nfuel.\n  Development of the repository at Yucca Mountain will greatly enhance \nour Nation's energy balance by demonstrating that we can dispose of \nnuclear waste created by nuclear power. Today, with our dependence on \nforeign oil for so much of our energy supply, it is critical we broaden \nour energy portfolio in this country. When one looks at the amount of \nmoney we pay to nations such as Iraq for oil, when we could expand our \nreliance on other sources of energy, including nuclear power, one has \nto recognize the national security implications of this vote today.\n  Nuclear power should play a greater role in our Nation's energy \nportfolio. A path forward for spent nuclear fuel will remove one \nbottleneck in the nuclear energy fuel cycle. Under the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, if Congress does not approve this resolution, the Yucca \nMountain project cannot go forward. There will not be a nuclear \nrepository at Yucca Mountain and nuclear waste in 39 States across this \ncountry will stay where it is.\n  I ask my colleagues, Are we going to vote today to leave spent \nnuclear fuel and nuclear waste in New York, Vermont, Illinois, Georgia, \nMichigan, Connecticut, Washington, Idaho, and the many other States in \nwhich it is now located or are we going to move forward with a \npermanent repository for spent nuclear fuel that makes sense for this \nNation and the environment? I urge strongly my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of S.J. Res. 34.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alaska said if something \nhappens and one of these casks is breached, there will be an explosion. \nBut understand, standing within 3 feet of a spent fuel rod is a lethal \ndose--three feet. It will kill you. It may not kill you immediately. \nBut you are dead. It will kill you pretty quickly.\n  As has been brought out by my friend from Nevada, the shipments are \nnot dangerous, relatively speaking.\n  I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Nevada to talk about that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I do want to address the map that the \njunior Senator from Alaska has put up over here. When he was talking to \nthe Senator from Missouri, talking about the transportation through \nMissouri, he was saying these things are already happening, going \nthrough Missouri, going through her State, because that was the major \nreason she was voting against the Yucca Mountain proposal.\n  This is not the same kind of waste that is going to Yucca Mountain; \notherwise, you would need a different kind of repository. This is not \nas high a level of nuclear waste as is coming to Nevada. So to equate \nthe two is irresponsible, I believe. We should not even have that map \non the floor.\n  I want to clear up two other quick things. The first is, the Senator \nfrom Idaho just said, Isn't it better to have one site? If, in fact, we \nhad one site, and we are going to have all the nuclear waste at one \nsite, that would be true. Except we are not going to have just one \nsite. We are going to continue to have sites all over the United States \nwith nuclear waste. Here is a very simple graph to understand.\n  Currently we have 45,000 metric tons of nuclear waste in America. By \nthe time Yucca Mountain is supposed to start receiving waste in 2010, \nwe will have 65,000 metric tons. When Yucca Mountain is completed in \n2036, it will have 70,000 metric tons in Yucca Mountain, but because we \nare producing new nuclear waste every year, spread around the country \nstill will be 47,000 metric tons, virtually the same as we have today \nspread out all over the country.\n  The Senator from Idaho has a very good argument to get the stuff out \nof his State. He has one of the few good arguments, but everybody else \ndoes not: If you have nuclear powerplants in your State, you will \ncontinue to have nuclear waste in your State for as long as you have \nnuclear powerplants operating.\n  It is not a question of national security. It is going to be safer to \nhave it in one site. But we are still going to have all these other \nsites, so national security is focused on transportation more than it \nis anything else.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am going to yield 10 minutes to the \nPresiding Officer in a second.\n  Another thing my friend from Alaska said is it is not going to travel \nthrough Missouri. This is one of the problems. It is like the \n``immaculate reception.'' One day we will wake up and it is suddenly \ngoing to be there. I don't know, there are no transportation routes, \nbut it will get there because the DOE says it will.\n  It can only go by train, truck, or barge, and for barge \ntransportation, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the \nonly tests that have been done are by computer. They have never stuck \none of them in the water. It has all been done by computer.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  (Mr. REID assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the deputy majority leader for \nyielding this time to me.\n  On the floor this afternoon I see three, maybe four Senators--four of \nwhom I have been privileged to serve with in the House of \nRepresentatives, one of whom I have just been privileged to serve with \nfor the last year and a half.\n  The senior Senator from Nevada knows the great affection I hold for \nhim. He and I were elected to the House of Representatives in 1982. We \ncame to Congress together in 1982. We began our first years in the \nHouse of Representatives many mornings working out together in the \nHouse gym. I\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\nhave had the privilege of knowing his family and watching his kids grow \nup. For me, and I know for many of us, this important policy decision \nis also a decision that is intertwined with the respect and admiration \nwe have for our colleagues. I have great respect and admiration for \nboth the senior and junior Senator from Nevada.\n  As some of you know, I spent a fair number of my years in the Navy, 5 \nyears on active duty, another 18 years as a Reserve naval flight \nofficer, most of that time on airplanes but other times on ships. I \nhave been on ships that are nuclear powered. They included aircraft \ncarriers and submarines. I have known hundreds of people who lived many \nyears of their lives on nuclear-powered vessels. When you have that \nkind of background, you are maybe more comfortable with nuclear power \nthan those who have not literally lived on a floating nuclear \npowerplant.\n  I acknowledge there are a lot of people who have legitimate concerns \nabout the various aspects of nuclear power--a few of them have been \npretty well vetted here today. One of them is transportation: how to \nmove this nuclear waste through dozens of States and do so safely, \nespecially in an age of terrorism.\n  There are concerns about the terrorists themselves and whether or not \nthey might strike, either at a site such as Yucca Mountain or at a \nbarge or a railroad or a highway.\n  Before I served in the Senate a year and a half ago, I served as \nGovernor of Delaware. During those years, I became all the more mindful \nof the transportation of hazardous waste through my State and alongside \nmy State via the Delaware River and the bay which divides the State of \nthe Presiding Officer and my State. Every day hazardous materials make \ntheir way up and\ndown the Delaware River. Throughout\nI-95/I-495, which crosses my State and the railroads of my State, the \nNorfolk Southern and CSX, we have dangerous materials every day \ntraverse throughout Delaware--sometimes hazardous materials, sometimes \nexplosive materials. We have learned to deal with them and deal with \nthem safely. In Europe, they have shown a record over time of being \nable to transport nuclear waste in a way that is safe as well.\n  I know people who are concerned about nuclear power because of the \npossibility there will be an accident at a nuclear powerplant. I \nacknowledge those concerns are not illegitimate. The safety record of \nthe nuclear power industry has been better in the last 10 years than \nprobably in all the years before, and it continues to improve.\n  While I acknowledge, on the one hand, the legitimate concerns about \nnuclear power being a viable, growing part of the generation of \nelectricity in our country, I want to talk briefly about the virtues, \nthe advantages of nuclear power. We had a great debate on energy policy \nover the earlier part of this year. We talked about the growing demand, \nthe rise in price of foreign oil, now up 50 percent. We talked about \nthe huge and growing trade deficit we have in this country, over $300 \nbillion last year, maybe $400 billion this year, and a significant part \nof that is oil imports.\n\n  I think we have begun a serious discussion and debate about what to \ndo with respect to air emissions, how we can curtail sulfur dioxide, \nmercury, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen oxide from powerplants in this \ncountry and other sources.\n  Nuclear power, whether we like it or not, does not create sulfur \ndioxide emissions. It doesn't create mercury emissions. It doesn't \ncreate nitrogen oxide emissions. It doesn't create carbon dioxide \nemissions--it doesn't contribute to those. With respect to our \nenvironment and the quality of our air, I think nuclear power is, if \nanything, a friend.\n  I, as have a number of my colleagues, had a chance to go to Yucca \nMountain. I visited the place. I talked to people who worked on that \nproject for any number of years. I met with people in Nevada who oppose \nthe designation of Yucca Mountain and those who favor it. I have had \nthe opportunity along with many of my colleagues to participate in \nhours of hearings and other meetings with advocates and opponents of \ndesignating Yucca Mountain and licensing Yucca Mountain.\n  In the end it comes down to maybe two votes: one, a procedural vote \nas to whether or not we are going to vote to proceed to the final vote \nand that is one that would carry on to the licensing of Yucca Mountain. \nI said to my colleagues on the Energy Committee a month or so ago, I \nhave agonized with this vote probably as much as any in my memory, \ntrying to do, on the one hand, what I think is the right thing for my \ncountry and trying to treat my dear colleagues the way I would want to \nbe treated. It is a tough call. It is tough for me and I know it is for \nmany of us.\n  We have two votes. On the first vote, on the motion to proceed, if my \nvote is needed--and I am going to stand in the well there--if my vote \nis needed in order to be able to proceed to the final vote, I will vote \nyes--if my vote is needed.\n  On the final vote, if the motion to proceed is approved, I will vote \nyes on the designation of Yucca Mountain.\n  With that, I thank the deputy majority leader for yielding his time \nto me.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, to respond very briefly, under the \nagreement, there will be a rollcall vote on the motion to proceed; then \nthe agreement is that there will be a voice vote on the final \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARPER. I appreciate that. When we vote, I will be here to vote. \nWhen the yeas and nays are asked for, my voice will say yes on that \nfinal vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska, having served here \nas long as he has, has certainly on occasion when there has been a \nvoice vote wanted to be listed as voting yes or no. That certainly can \nbe stated in the Record. I have done it on a number of occasions \nmyself.\n  Senator Ensign and I wish to speak longer. Senator Kyl is here. It is \nmy understanding you would like to yield some time to him.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, would you advise me on how much time is \nremaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator has 50 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How about here?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five minutes remains for the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me make a general statement, and also preliminarily comment on \nthe debate that has been conducted by the two Senators from the State \nof Nevada. They have been tenacious in the representation of their \nposition. I take no pleasure in opposing their position. They are both \nfine Senators and are extraordinarily good at representing the \ninterests of their constituents in this particular case. I know it is \nnot just a matter of representing the people who have spoken out from \nthe State of Nevada. I have talked to Senator Ensign a lot, and he has \nargued his case with a lot of personal conviction that you don't always \nsee in this body. I commend both of them and make the point that I take \nno pleasure in opposing them.\n  I do, however, strongly believe it is time for us to move forward \nwith this process, and the next step in the process is the approval of \nthis legislation. Then there are other things that have to be done, \nincluding the Department of Energy action.\n  I want to make a comment about this issue of the storage of nuclear \nwaste because the Palo Verde nuclear-generating station just west of \nthe city of Phoenix is the biggest in the country. It is a huge, \nsuccessful, good nuclear-generating station. It stores an awful lot of \nwaste. In fact, I believe, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute, \nmore than 45,000 metric tons of high-level radioactive waste are housed \nat the 131 sites in 39 States--sites such as Palo Verde.\n  If we don't use a storage facility such as Yucca Mountain, the \nproblem only gets worse. Each year, about 2,000 more tons of \nradioactive waste are being added to the total.\n  Senator Ensign made the point that even if we have a site such as \nYucca Mountain, of course, we are still going to have the other storage \nsites around the country. That is very true. But I think it begs the \nquestion of what we are going to do with the majority of this waste.\n\n  It is a little like saying since every Wednesday morning everybody in \nmy\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\narea of Phoenix is going to put their garbage out, and because we keep \nproducing garbage, we should not have a dump to where all of that \ngarbage is taken. It is certainly true that every Wednesday everybody \nis going to put their garbage out. We produce more garbage, and to \nstore it onsite is in effect storing it on the curb. That doesn't argue \nfor the proposition that there should not be a central repository where \nthat material is taken and disposed of in a proper way.\n  That is what we are talking about here. We are going to continue to \nproduce waste. There will have to be a place to temporarily store it at \neach of these nuclear-generating facilities around the country. But \neventually, when it cools off, it is put into these casks and \ntransported to Yucca Mountain. That is where most of the scientists \nhave decided is the right place to put it.\n  As a matter of fact, the scientific reports of the Department of \nEnergy conclude that a repository at Yucca Mountain would protect the \npublic health and safety in accordance with the EPA and NRC guidelines. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission is in support. The Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board is in support. The experts on the National \nAcademy of Sciences panel who recommended the site note that there is \n``worldwide scientific consensus'' for the idea.\n  I might also add that there is now a new element that is injected \ninto the debate. That is the element of terrorism. We can't talk about \nthat a lot on the floor of the Senate. I am on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I can assure my colleagues that it is a significant issue to \nhave this waste dispersed at a variety of sites around the country in \nthe conditions that currently pertain. It would be much better if we \nwere able to take a majority of it, when we could, to one site that is \nclearly safe from terrorism. Yucca Mountain is a remote location. It is \n100 miles away from the nearest metropolitan area. It has the highest \nsecurity--again, because of its general proximity to the Nevada Test \nSite and Nellis Air Force Range. Those are reasons we think it is \nimportant to go ahead with the next step of the process and get this \nmaterial to Yucca.\n  With respect to transportation, we know that there have been a lot of \nquestions raised. But the truth is we have had 45 years of experience \nand 3,000 successful shipments of used nuclear fuel. That is not \nexactly the same as this fuel, but we have much better casks now--these \nsteel casks that have been described in detail here on the floor that \nwill be used for the transportation of the material.\n  There have been no radiation releases, fatalities, or injuries, nor \nany environmental damage that has occurred as a result of the \ntransportation of this radioactive cargo in the past.\n  I am a little distressed by the fact that people have been scared. I \nam very disappointed that some people--clearly not those on the floor \nof the Senate today--but there are some who have really attempted to \nscare people in individual communities with the notion that somehow \nthere will be some great catastrophe as a result of the transportation \nof this material. That is so unlikely as to be something that should \nnot be of concern to us as we move forward with this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize that at some point something has to \nbe done. We can't just allow the waste to sit where it is. There is a \nsafe, scientifically proven location where the material can be stored. \nThe transportation has also been throughly considered by the scientific \ncommunity. A method for transporting it has been developed. Sandia \nLaboratories, which has done a lot of testing, assures us it would \nwithstand the most extreme accident scenarios.\n  For all of these reasons, I think it is important for us to move on, \nget beyond this next step, and allow the DOE now to look at this Yucca \nMountain site for licensing.\n  Again, I commend all of my colleagues for the way in which this \ndebate has been conducted. This is an emotional issue with a lot of \npeople around this country. But the debate has been responsible and \nserious and based upon good science. I commend both the proponents and \nthe opponents for the way they have conducted this debate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I am prepared to vote in support of \nS.J. Res. 34 which approves the site at Yucca Mountain for the \ndevelopment of a repository for spent nuclear fuel, pursuant to the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, but I do so with great caution.\n  The vote we cast today does not give carte blanche to move this \nwaste. Instead, it signals a continuation of a process begun in \nCongress more than two decades ago. The risks are not insignificant and \nin the coming months and years many steps must be satisfied and many \nscientific tests undertaken before a license is issued by the Nuclear \nRegulator Commission and a single shipment of waste is moved. In \naddition, there must be open dialogue among industry, organizations, \ntransportation experts, and government entities at the Federal, State, \nand local level to determine a safe and workable transportation system. \nIf the ongoing scientific, environmental, or public safety tests are \nnot satisfactory, or a transportation system is deemed unworkable, then \nthe site should not be licensed.\n  For Congress to stop the process today with no viable, permanent \nalternative solution on the table is short-sighted and wrong. I \nrecognize the limitations on the amount of waste that Yucca Mountain \ncan accept and the length of time it will take to transport the waste. \nI further understand that some waste will necessarily remain on site at \nindividual facilities even if Yucca Mountain is licensed, as nuclear \nreactors continue to operate and generate waste.\n  But to keep all of the current and future waste on-site at \napproximately 100 sites in above ground storage is not a prudent long-\nterm solution. In fact, many facilities will be reaching their storage \ncapacity long before their licenses expire. For these reasons, while we \ncontinue to move forward with Yucca Mountain, we must also step up our \nsecurity at all the nuclear facilities sites around the country. If all \nsystems are a go with Yucca, it will be at least 10 years before any \nwaste is moved.\n  My record is clear. I have supported nuclear power and the obligation \nof the Federal Government to take responsibility for nuclear waste. I \nam one of a handful of current Senators who was here in 1982 to vote on \nthe National Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. I supported that \ninitiative and again in 1987, I supported amendments to the 1982 act \nwhich singled out Yucca Mountain to be examined as a nuclear waste \nrepository. However, I have voted against both the idea of interim, \nabove ground consolidated storage and moving forward with the process \nbefore the Secretary of Energy formally recommended Yucca Mountain.\n  No one knows the costs and benefits of nuclear energy more than the \nresidents of my State. Connecticut has two operating nuclear facilities \nand two permanently shut down facilities that are undergoing \ndecommissioning. Nuclear energy provides more than 45 percent of the \nelectricity generated in Connecticut. Only Vermont, New Hampshire, New \nJersey, Illinois and South Carolina have a larger percentage of \nelectricity generated by nuclear power.\n  It is a fact that while I have supported nuclear power, I have also \nbeen one of its most vocal critics when I believed the industry and \noversight agencies failed to exercise appropriate controls over the \nfacilities in my State.\n  I have also been a champion of the need for alternative energy \nsources, including renewables, to meet our growing energy needs and \noffset our dependance on energy sources that generate waste, pollute \nour environment and cause public health concerns. I applaud people, \nincluding many of my colleagues, who champion these issues, drive fuel \nefficient and cleaner burning automobiles, and make personal choices to \nuse alternative energy sources in their daily lives.\n  We will be judged by future generations not only by the decisions we \nmake in the coming months and years regarding nuclear waste, but also \nby the bold choices we make regarding our future energy security and \nthe health and welfare of our planet.\n  This is not a perfect solution, but a reasonable step if the risks \ncan be managed. I hope that it will be looked upon as such in years to \ncome.\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\n  Having said that, while I support the substance of this resolution, I \nvoted against the motion to proceed. As chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I take the rules of the Senate very seriously. It is my \nbelief that despite what may have been written into the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982 and 1987, I believe it is the fundamental \nprerogative of the Majority Leader to set the agenda of the Senate. My \nunderstanding is that at no time in the recent history of the Senate \nhas that prerogative been violated. Moreover, I fail to see why my \ncolleagues felt the need to violate that prerogative today. There are \nstill more than 2 weeks to bring this matter to the floor under \nestablished practices of the Senate. Furthermore, it is worth noting \nthat this matter was brought up by the minority during the middle of a \nvery important debate to address wrongdoings and shortcomings in the \naccounting industry and corporate sector. I want to make this very \nclear, my vote against the motion to proceed was not against S.J. \nResolution 34, but out of respect for the practices and prerogatives of \nthe Senate. If there had been a recorded vote on S.J. Res. 34, I would \nhave voted aye.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of establishing \na permanent nuclear repository at Nevada's Yucca Mountain. Establishing \na single site for high-level nuclear waste is the best thing we can do \nto meet our growing energy needs in an environmentally sound manner, \nsupport our domestic economy, and protect our national security.\n  One of my goals in coming to the Senate was to enact a comprehensive \nU.S. energy policy that harmonizes our energy and environmental needs. \nI worked hard with my colleagues on the Energy bill and after 6 weeks \nof debate, this body finally passed legislation that does just that. \nOur challenge in the energy bill was to encourage development of \ndomestic energy sources in a balanced way that respects seemingly \ncompeting needs, the economy and the environment. These are not \ncompeting needs, however. A sustainable environment is critical to a \nstrong economy, and a sustainable economy is critical to providing the \nfunding necessary to improve our environment.\n  In order to maintain a strong economy, we will have to produce more \nenergy to keep up with the growing demand. According to the Department \nof Energy, we need to increase by 30 percent the amount of energy we \nproduce in the United States by 2015 in order to meet our county's \ndemand. To ensure that consumers have access to low-cost, reliable \nenergy, we must make use of every available resource instead of putting \nall of our eggs in one basket. We need to increase our production of \noil, gas, coal, nuclear energy, and renewables. Keep in mind that only \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent of our total electricity comes from wind and \nsolar power. At the same time, we need to continue to increase \nconservation efforts which have already substantially contributed to \nreducing our reliance on imports. We simply must diversify the source \nof our energy supply and we can do so while protecting our precious \nnatural resources.\n  One of our great untapped resources is nuclear energy. It is an \nimportant part of meeting our Nation's energy needs and harmonizing our \nenergy and environmental policies. Over the past 40 years, we have seen \nhow safe and reliable nuclear energy can be. We use it today. \nNationally, we obtain 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear energy \nplants and in my State of Ohio, nuclear power provides 12 percent of \nour total.\n  But this level is far below what other countries do. For example, \nFrance derives 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear power; Sweden \nuses 39 percent; South Korea 41 percent; and Japan uses 34 percent.\n  One of the reasons these countries use so much nuclear energy is that \nit produces zero harmful air emissions. None. I am not sure that many \npeople realize this. Throughout my career, I have been actively \ninvolved in the debate concerning how to reduce emissions from power \nplants and continue to provide safe and reliable electricity to \nconsumers. This has been difficult, however, because so many so-called \nenvironmentalists raise issue with all of our energy alternatives.\n  For example, here's what they say: coal, which supplies 52 percent of \nour energy, is too dirty. Hydropower, which supplies 7.3 percent of our \ntotal energy, is criticized because the dams can disrupt the ecosystem. \nDue to lengthy and complicated environmental regulations, it is nearly \nimpossible to build new pipelines for natural gas, which supplies 16 \npercent of our energy. Even windmills, the source so many of my \ncolleagues point to, has siting difficulties due to their noise and \nunsightly appearance. Nuclear power, which supplies 20 percent, has \nbeen demonized because of the waste issue, which can be solved.\n  The science for using nuclear energy has been rapidly developing over \nthe past several decades and nuclear energy offers one of the best \nalternatives for the future: a clean-burning and reliable source of \nenergy.\n  Since 1973, the use of nuclear energy has prevented 62 million tons \nof sulfur dioxide and 32 million tons of nitrogen oxide from being \nreleased into the atmosphere. Nuclear energy also releases none of the \nso-called greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide. In fact, \naccording to the Energy Information Administration, nuclear power has \noffset more than 3.1 billion metric tons of carbon emissions between \n1960 and 2000 that would have been generated by fossil fuels.\n  Nuclear energy has incredible potential as an efficient and clean \nsource of energy, yet we face some major impediments that prevent us \nfrom taking full advantage of its benefits. During consideration of the \nenergy bill, I offered two amendments to address these problems and \npromote the growth of nuclear energy. Both amendments were included in \nthe Senate version of the energy bill, and I hope the conferees will \nkeep them in the final version.\n  The first amendment reauthorizes the Price-Anderson program, which \nprovides liability protection to the public paid by the industry. The \nsecond amendment provides needed Nuclear Regulatory Commission reforms \nto address the human capital crisis that is impacting the NRC, improves \nlicensing and decommissioning oversight, and strengthens anti-trust \nprotections by moving the review process from the NRC to the Justice \nDepartment.\n  But the biggest impediment to the growth of nuclear energy could not \nbe addressed in the energy bill and that is what brings us here today. \nCongress recognized the importance and necessity of having one storage \nsite for spent nuclear fuel in 1982 with the passage of the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, which was signed into law. That law required the \nDepartment of Energy to locate, build, and operate a deep, mined \ngeologic repository for high-level nuclear waste.\n  In response to this law, the Energy Department identified, studied, \nand selected viable potential sites for this purpose. In 1987, Congress \nthen amended the law and designated Nevada's Yucca Mountain as the only \nsite that could be considered and stipulated the further study was \nrequired to determine whether that site was suitable.\n  Congress stipulated that the nuclear waste storage facility was to be \ncompleted by January 31, 1998. Obviously, this deadline has not been \nmet because the Energy Department wanted to be thorough and base their \ndecision on science. Some of my colleagues would have you believe that \nthis was a rash decision. On the contrary, Secretary Abraham \nrecommended Yucca Mountain after two decades and $7 billion of \nscientific research.\n  In addition, President Bush affirmed this recommendation. The House \nof Representatives affirmed this recommendation overwhelmingly by a \nvote of 306 to 117 in May. The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources affirmed this recommendation by a vote of 13 to 10 in June. \nNow it is the Senate's turn.\n  All of this support is based on science. This is exactly what we want \nto see in the formation of public policy; science driving the policy.\n  Yucca Mountain is located approximately 90 miles from Las Vegas in an \narea that averages about seven inches of rainfall a year. The Energy \nDepartment does not expect water to come into contact with any of the \nnuclear material that will be stored there for more than 10,000 years. \nSurrounded by unsaturated rock layers, nuclear waste would be stored \napproximately 1,000 feet above any water, which is still about 1,000 \nfeet below ground.\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\n  Even if water somehow infiltrated Yucca Mountain and corroded the \nseal and then penetrated the robust fuel containers before 10,000 years \npassed, natural and engineered barriers would prevent or limit any \nrelease of radiation. Furthermore, Yucca Mountain is located in a \nhydrologic basin, in which water does not connect to any rivers, \noceans, or the groundwater system that serves Las Vegas. Through years \nof scientific research, it has been determined that the site is secure \nand that radiation exposure to the public would be well below both the \nstringent EPA limits and natural background radiation levels.\n  Let me emphasize: The resolution we are considering allows the Yucca \nMountain program to continue to the next step; it is not the end of the \nprocess. The site must still go through a rigorous licensing review, \nwhich is expected to last up to five years. Moreover, the NRC still \nmust address a whole host of issues including monitoring and testing \nprograms, quality assurance, personnel training, and certification, \nemergency planning, and more.\n  Additionally, the NRC must use standards adopted by the EPA \nspecifically and exclusively for Yucca Mountain. These strict standards \nprovide that an engineered barrier system should be designed to work in \ncombination with natural barriers so that, for 10,000 years following \ndisposal, the expected radiation dose to an individual would not exceed \n15 millirems total effective dose equivalent per year, and 4 millirems \nper year for groundwater exposure.\n  These are exceedingly stringent standards designed to protect the \npublic from any harmful exposure, now or in the future. To illustrate \nwhat the numbers mean, let me offer two examples. In Denver, Colorado, \ndue to the higher altitude and cosmic radiation from the sun and stars, \nresidents are subject to at least 15 millirems of radiation more per \nyear than people who live in my hometown of Cleveland. On average, \nAmericans are exposed to 4 millirems of radiation per year through the \nnaturally occurring radioactive potassium in the 140 pounds of potatoes \nthat an individual eats on average each year.\n  This rigorous licensing process combined with the full completion of \nthe site is expected to take 10 years. Therefore, unlike most of the \nattention this matter has received in the media, our action in the \nSenate will not begin the transportation of nuclear waste to the \nrepository. Instead, this resolution simply affirms the science behind \nthe project and allows the experts to continue to move ahead with their \nanalyses and reviews.\n  While some people have concerns about the transportation of nuclear \nwaste, many people may not realize that nuclear waste has been shipped \nacross our country since 1964 and that it has an amazing track record \nof safety. During this period, more than 3,000 shipments have traveled \n1.7 million miles on roads and railways with only eight minor \naccidents: no injuries, fatalities, or release of any radiation.\n  There are two reasons for this success. First, the containers for the \nwaste have been tested rigorously under extreme conditions, including \nbeing dropped from buildings, hit by trains, and burned at high \ntemperatures. Second, there are numerous safety measures that federal \nagencies and state and local governments have developed, including \nsatellite positioning, designation of special routes, police escorts, \ninspections, and emergency response planning.\n  Over the next 10 years as new scientific discoveries are made, it is \nlikely that new regulations, procedures, and technology will offer \nfurther improvements to the safety and security of transporting spent \nnuclear fuel to Yucca Mountain. And the NRC in conjunction with other \nfederal agencies will continue to examine the safest and most effective \nmeans of transport and storage.\n  Failure to approve this resolution will have serious costs to our \neconomy and national security. Our nation has already spent $7 billion \nover 20 years researching this specific site. The greater cost is the \ncurrent danger we face across our nation with 131 facilities in 39 \nstates storing more than 40,000 tons of spent nuclear material. To put \nthese numbers in perspective, about 160 million Americans live within \n75 miles of these sites.\n  Establishment of a repository at Yucca Mountain would allow all of \nthe nuclear waste to be stored in one place, underground in a remote \nlocation. The site is on federal property with restricted access to the \nland and airspace, and as a further safeguard, the Nellis Air Force \nRange is nearby. From a national security perspective, one site is \neasier to defend then many facilities scattered throughout the nation.\n  The current situation is also costly in terms of capacity. The \nfacilities which currently store this spent fuel are only designed to \nbe used on an interim basis and space is limited. The Energy Department \nestimates that replacement facilities at each interim site would have \nto be built every 100 years with major repairs every half century.\n  Nuclear power is a necessary and sound part of our energy future that \nmakes sense for our environment and our economy. Furthermore, because \nit protects national security and the safety of all Americans, I urge \nmy colleagues to listen to the science and support this resolution to \naffirm the President's recommendation to establish a permanent nuclear \nrepository at Yucca Mountain.\n  Mr. ALLARD. In 1982, Congress passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. In \n1987, after being ranked as the site that possessed the best technical \nand scientific characteristics to serve as a repository, the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act was amended to direct the Department of Energy to \nstudy Yucca Mountain as a potential storage site.\n  The Federal Government has spent over 20 years and $8 billion \nanalyzing and studying potential sites for disposal of nuclear waste. \nThis serious investment of money and human capital has led to the clear \nconclusion that Yucca Mountain is indeed scientifically and technically \nsuitable for development.\n  As a result of this massive effort, on February 14, 2002, Secretary \nof Energy Spencer Abraham formally recommended to President Bush that \nthe Yucca Mountain site in Nevada be developed as the Nation's first \nlong-term geologic repository for high-level radioactive waste. I fully \nsupport this designation, and I will vote to move forward with the \nprocess, allowing the bipartisan regulatory experts at the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to make a final determination of whether to allow \nstorage at the site.\n  Colorado, and indeed the Nation, has much to gain from the opening of \nYucca Mountain. Material that is currently scattered throughout the \nUnited States will finally find a safe long-term shelter at Yucca \nMountain--isolated in the remote Nevada desert.\n  Those opposed to opening Yucca continue to argue about the method of \ndelivery to Yucca Mountain. Much has already been said in this respect, \nbut I would like to point out that in the last 40 years, more than \n3,000 shipments of spent nuclear fuel have traveled 1.6 million miles \nin the United States with no radiation related injuries or deaths. The \nNuclear Regulatory Commission has performed numerous safety tests on \nthe multi-layered containers that carry the nuclear substance. These \ntests, often exceeding regulatory requirements, have never yielded any \nnegative or potentially harmful results. Additionally, nuclear waste is \na solid that is not flammable and cannot explode. The casks have \nsurpassed expectations during rigid drop tests, puncture tests, heat \nexposure trials and submergence drills.\n  Public safety has always been a priority, but has become even more \nimportant in this unprecedented time of threat to our national \nsecurity. I believe that the centralization of our used nuclear waste \n1,000 feet beneath the earth's surface in a single, highly secure \nlocation is preferable to the current scattered distribution of nuclear \nwaste in 131 temporary surface facilities in 39 States.\n  Without Yucca Mountain, the fuel at the Fort St. Vrain facility will \nremain there indefinitely. This means that the 2.6 million people in \nColorado that live within 75 miles of a nuclear facility will continue \nto live in close proximity; our citizens will be forced to wait another \n20 years and spend 8 billion more taxpayer dollars to find another \nsuitable site. Without Yucca\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\nMountain, major metropolitan areas in my State will still have only 20 \nmiles between their town limits and a nuclear facility that stores fuel \nabove ground. Without Yucca Mountain, waste being stored at facilities \nthat are safely designed to hold waste for 50 to 100 years will have to \nwait untold years for a new destination, costing billions of dollars. \nWithout a favorable decision on Yucca Mountain, a facility that is \ndesigned to store nuclear material safely for 10,000 years will shut \ndown.\n  It is important to note that this vote does not mean that Yucca \nMountain will open tomorrow. What it does mean, is that the next phase \nof science can begin in earnest--highly skilled nuclear experts will \ndetermine whether the facility merits a license to begin accepting the \nmaterial. After that, any shipping is subject to strict Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission and U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines \nand regulations, and would not begin, if Yucca is finally approved, \nuntil 2010.\n  I support the Yucca Mountain Project, and will continue to be an \nactive participant in the debate. I encourage my fellow colleagues to \nsupport the project, and fulfill the requirements of the law imposed by \nCongress some 20 years ago.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \npreparing to vote on the resolution that would allow continued \nevaluation of Yucca Mountain's suitability for a high-level nuclear \nwaste repository. I compliment Senator Bingaman on his resolution and \non his success in reporting that resolution out of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee.\n  Members don't need to be reminded of the vital role that nuclear \nenergy plays in our national security. There is no question that it \ndirectly impacts our environmental security and our energy security. \nWithout nuclear energy, we would have far dirtier skies and be far more \ndependent on foreign energy supplies.\n  I have argued repeatedly that our nation must maintain nuclear energy \nas a viable energy source far into the future. With advanced \ntechnologies, it can become a fuel for centuries into the future. Its \nclean reliable baseload power will be essential in powering our \neconomic growth for future generations, just as it is a vital component \nof today's economic successes.\n  For nuclear energy to continue to support our economy, we must \naddress the waste issue. There is no denying that these wastes \nrepresent an area of risk but every energy source requires a balance of \nbenefits and risks. The risks associated with nuclear waste are ones \nthat we can fully control.\n  I am well aware that hundreds of outstanding issues have been \nidentified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. And the Department is \nwell aware that they must address each and every one of the NRC issues \nbefore the Commission is going to move towards a final license.\n  In many meetings with the NRC chairman, as well as many of the \ncommissioners, I have always been impressed with their intent to deal \nwith this, or any licensing issue, through careful study of the \nrelevant scientific facts. The NRC has the expertise to evaluate these \noutstanding issues, and I am confident that they will do so with great \ncare.\n  It is not up to the U.S. Senate to decide on the complex scientific \nissues that will eventually determine the fate of a license for Yucca \nMountain. Our vote today is solely on the question of whether the \nlicensing process continues.\n  I have been very sorry to see the overblown concerns on \ntransportation by those who wish to block further evaluation of Yucca \nMountain. Apparently the opponents of Yucca Mountain are so intent on \nwinning this battle that they are willing to use transportation issues \nto frighten the American people into abandoning nuclear energy. That \nwould be a colossal mistake for our nation and would seriously \nundermine national security.\n  The simple fact is that transportation of nuclear materials is a \nchallenging and risky operation, but it is also an operation that has \nbeen extensively studied and engineered for success. In the United \nStates, as well as in other countries, the record for transporting \nspent fuel is superb. Opponents need to remember that the shipping \ncasks for spent fuel are designed to withstand the most rigorous \nconditions, and routes will be carefully chosen to further limit risks.\n  In the United States, since 1960, we have shipped spent fuel about \n2700 times and it's traveled over 1.6 million miles. Sure, there have \nbeen a few accidents. But no radiation has ever been released in any of \nthem.\n  The record at the Waste Isolation Pilot Project is also spectacular. \nIn their 3 years of operations, they have logged about 700 shipments \ntraveling over 1.5 million miles. And in Europe, over 70,000 metric \ntons of spent fuel have been shipped, an amount roughly equal to the \ntotal authorized limit for Yucca Mountain.\n\n  Furthermore, in any debate about transportation, the simple fact is \nthat route selection and detailed planning will begin at least 5 years \nbefore the first shipment and that the total number of shipments in a \nyear will be around 175, a far cry from the 300 million annual \nshipments of hazardous materials that are currently moving around the \ncountry. There will be plenty of time to debate and optimize shipping \nplans before any spent fuel moves.\n  In responding to the outstanding issues raised by the NRC, I'm sure \nthe Department will continue to analyze the mountain and improve their \nmodeling and simulation. That is certainly important research that I \nfully support. But I want to note that other research is also vital.\n  I have spoken on many occasions with my concern that the Nation's \npolicy of simply treating spent fuel as ``waste'' deserves careful \ndebate. Spent fuel has immense residual energy content. I am not \nconvinced that we should be making a decision today that future \ngenerations will have no interest in this superb energy source.\n  I have noted that alternative spent fuel management strategies should \nbe carefully studied and evaluated. Reprocessing and transmutation \ncould not only recover residual energy, but could also vastly reduce \nthe toxicity of the final waste products.\n  I am pleased that the Department plans for all spent fuel in Yucca \nMountain to be fully retrievable for at least 50 years. We may find \nthat these new approaches can even be applied to the spent fuel in \nYucca Mountain and they certainly will influence any additional \nrepositories that we may need.\n  In my view, the Nation is far better served by beginning to move \nspent fuel into a single well-secured repository than to leave it \nstored in temporary facilities at 131 sites in 39 States. I support the \njoint resolution to override the veto of the Governor of Nevada and \ncontinue evaluation of Yucca Mountain as our Nation's future \nrepository.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak regarding the \nproposed national nuclear waste repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. After \nserious consideration of this issue over the last several years and \nafter carefully studying the track record of the nuclear industry in \nthe United States, I have concluded that I will not stand in the way of \nsending this waste to a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. I also \nunderstand the reservations expressed by many of my colleagues in this \nChamber, and I have certainly taken such considerations into account in \nmaking my decision.\n  Utahns have a right to be skeptical about government promises with \nregard to the handling of nuclear materials. In Utah, we have had more \nthan our share of victims from government activities relating to atomic \ntesting and the uranium industry. I have met with too many Utahns who \nare suffering needlessly. These Utahns were my inspiration when I \npassed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act through Congress and \nwhen I improved this legislation a few years ago. Over the years, the \nact has provided compensation to thousands of downwinder victims.\n  One of the top considerations in my decision on this issue has been \nthe future of a proposal for a temporary storage site on the Skull \nValley Goshute Indian reservation in Utah. Skull Valley has been \ntargeted by a private consortium of nuclear electric generators as a \ntemporary site for nuclear waste en route to Yucca Mountain, NV. I have \nconcluded that if the plan to send high level nuclear waste to Yucca \nMountain is not approved, Skull Valley will likely become the targeted \nalternative for permanent storage even though it is a private project \nonly\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\nbeing considered as a temporary facility.\n  I have many concerns regarding the proposed Skull Valley site. Chief \namong these is that it would pose a serious threat to the nearby Utah \nTest and Training Range, which is one of the most important bombing \nranges available to our military. The dangers involving live ordnance \nor aviation accidents in the vicinity of the proposed above-ground \nnuclear storage casks present an unacceptable risk. Secretary Abraham \nof the Department of Energy has made it clear to me that the Department \nwill not reimburse the nuclear industry for storing nuclear waste at \nSkull Valley. By not funding the Skull Valley site, the Department of \nEnergy provides a significant incentive for generators of high level \nnuclear waste to find solutions to storage problems either on-site or \nto send materials directly to the permanent site proposed at Yucca \nMountain.\n  Also a top concern for me and many Utahns has been the issue of the \nsafe and secure transportation of these materials through Utah as they \ntravel to Yucca Mountain, NV. As you may be aware, well over 80 percent \nof the high level nuclear waste proposed to be stored in Yucca Mountain \nis projected to travel through populated areas of Utah.\n  Only after receiving a firm commitment from Secretary Abraham that \nthe Department of Energy will work with the State of Utah to formulate \nan enhanced and updated transportation plan do I feel confident in \ncasting this vote today. The plan will address operational procedures, \nadditional emergency first responder training, and coordination efforts \nbetween State governments and the Department of Energy regarding the \nsafe transit of nuclear materials to Yucca Mountain. I would like to \nmake it clear that the Utah congressional delegation will closely \nmonitor the development of this updated transportation plan.\n  In closing, I want to underscore how difficult this decision has been \nfor me. I could never support any policy that would place Utahns at \nrisk, and I believe that my decision to support the Yucca Mountain \nproject is consistent with that. This decision has come down to my \ncommitment to fight against the ill-advised and under-equipped facility \nproposed for Skull Valley, UT, and a firm commitment from the \nDepartment of Energy concerning the safe and secure transportation of \nthese materials. With these strong commitments from Secretary Abraham, \nI have decided that I should not stand in the way of sending this waste \nto its permanent resting place in Yucca Mountain.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on designating \nYucca Mountain as the Nation's waste repository in the State of Nevada.\n  But before I start, I would like to get a few things clear. First, I \ndon't oppose nuclear power. Nuclear power is an efficient and clean way \nto generate electricity. The obvious downside to nuclear power is that \nits waste is harmful to people. Yet, several States benefit from the \nrelative clean power that nuclear plants generate. Clean air, clean \nwater, and efficient power are significant benefits that some enjoy.\n  My opposition to designating Yucca Mountain is deeply rooted in my \nstrongly held belief in States' rights. I believe that States should \ndetermine their own destiny--when States elect or choose to benefit \nfrom a program or policy, then those States should correspondingly \nassume the costs, costs that might not only be monetary.\n  My State of Colorado did not choose to build nuclear power plants. My \nState of Colorado did not choose to enjoy the benefits that nuclear \npower offers. Correspondingly, my State of Colorado never chose to \nassume the responsibility of storing nuclear waste and, therefore, we \ndo not.\n  Some States favor storing nuclear waste and enjoy the economic \nbenefits of doing so. My neighbor to the south, New Mexico, for \nexample, chose to store nuclear waste in Carlsbad. The WIPP facility \nthere is a major source of revenue for the community and the State. \nAlthough it has some detractors, I think that it is widely regarded as \na big plus. The State of Nevada, however, unequivocally opposes storing \nwaste at Yucca Mountain. It objects for a variety of reasons. Whereas \nthe State of New Mexico considers storing nuclear waste good for \nbusiness, the State of Nevada believes that storing nuclear waste at \nYucca will kill business. Nevada's economy relies, perhaps more than \nany other State in the Nation, on tourism.\n  I cannot, in good conscience, vote to override a Governor's veto, \nwhen the long-term effect has the potential to destroy that State's \neconomy. During hearings before the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources on designating Yucca, I noted my moral opposition. Today, I \nreiterate that argument.\n\n  I likened the issue to a homeowner who builds his big house on a \nsmall lot, and then realizes that he failed to build a septic tank for \nthe house. Rather than change his design, the homeowner just puts the \nseptic tank on his neighbor's property. I don't want someone else's \nseptic tank on my property. The State of Colorado doesn't want a septic \ntank. We shouldn't force Nevada to be a septic tank for other States.\n  Furthermore, I am concerned about the routing of nuclear waste \nshipments going through Colorado toward Yucca. I realize that the \nroutes that have been referred to are not certainties, but they are \ncertain possibilities. After this vote, the Congress will have a very \nlimited voice in choosing routes. I share many of the same \ntransportation concerns some of my colleagues have expressed. I don't \nwant to restate all of their points. Rather, I just want to note that \nif Yucca mountain moves forward, Colorado will likely be a major \ntransit route for nuclear waste with nearly 13,000 rail shipments over \n38 years, one of the highest in the Nation.\n  And what is not transported by rail will be transported by truck in \nI-70 and through Vail Pass, a difficult mountain road winding through \nColorado's Rocky Mountains. Trucks wreck all the time on I-70. I am \nhappy to know that we have not had any major nuclear waste accidents by \ntruck, but am troubled by the possibility, just the same.\n  A colleague made a logical argument about the benefits and risk. For \nhim, the benefits of designating Yucca mountain make the risks \ntolerable. I am unable to make the determination. Because I don't know \nwhat the transportation routes will be and my Governor does not have \nauthority to designate or oppose routes, I can't engage in a cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n  In the absence of state oversight authority to regulate, and without \nsufficient information on route designations, the risks are too great \nfor this Senator to approve Yucca Mountain.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I represent a State with one active nuclear \nreactor powerplant and a second decommissioned nuclear power plant, \nboth of which are storing nuclear waste far beyond their initial design \nlimits. I can assure you there is much concern within my State over \nwhat the government plans to do with nuclear waste and a sense of \nurgency to get something done. I cannot in good conscious however vote \nto make Yucca Mountain the destination for all of our nuclear waste \nwhen a number of studies urge caution and further study to make sure \nthat we are not making a mistake, a mistake that could plague the \npeople of Nevada and potentially more than 40 other States in which we \nwill transport this nuclear waste in the years to come.\n  In the late-1970s President Carter, himself a nuclear engineer, \ninitiated an Interagency Review Group, IRG, to solve once and for all \nthe high-level nuclear waste problem in the United States. The IRG \ntasked the Department of Energy with finding the best sites in the \ncountry for storing our nuclear waste. At the same time, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, NRC, were tasked with developing criteria for the selection \nof sites. Then, in 1982, Congress enacted the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, \nNWPA, which included a commitment to identifying two sites. Between \n1982 and today, however, the process was changed. In 1987, Congress \namended the NWPA by directing DOE to develop only one site, Yucca \nMountain. Yucca Mountain was selected as the only site for purely \npolitical reasons.\n  Over the years, the EPA has lowered standards when they discovered \nthat Yucca Mountain could not meet the existing ones. They abandoned a \ncollective radiation dose limit when it was discovered that the Yucca \nsite could not meet it, and, just last year, the\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\nEPA promulgated final standards for licensing Yucca Mountain that rely \non dilution of nuclear waste as opposed to containment. In other words, \nwe changed the standards so that we did not have to change the site. \nYucca Mountain was picked, in part, because it is an arid, unpopulated \narea already owned by the federal government, which used it as a \nnuclear test site from the 1950s to the early 1990s. The original \ntheory was that, if canisters deteriorated, there would be little water \nin the dry ground to carry the radioactive waste to other areas. But \nthat theory has already been thrown as Chlorine-36, a radioactive \nisotope created during nuclear weapons tests over the Pacific Ocean in \nthe 1950s, was recently discovered 1,000 feet below ground at Yucca \nMountain. In just 50 years, that material traveled in the atmosphere to \nNevada, was delivered as rain at Yucca Mountain and traveled at least \n1,000 feet below the surface--the level where the nuclear waste would \nbe stored. Such rapid movement was completely unexpected and required a \nrevision of models of water flow in the area.\n  Because of this Chlorine-36, the DOE plans to bury the waste in \ncanisters made of Alloy 22--a new composite metal containing nickel, \nchromium and molybdenum--and then lined on the inside with stainless \nsteel. Alloy 22 is resistant to corrosion from water, but it is a \nmanmade substance that has existed for only about 20 years. The DOE has \nonly about 2 years of data on the effects of corrosion on it. Using \nsuch limited data, the government is predicting the life expectancy of \nthe canisters 10,000 years into the future. No other nation is planning \nto use Alloy 22 to bury its nuclear waste, and the material does not \nexist in nature, so there is no way of naturally predicting how strong \nit will prove to be. Clearly, further study is needed before reliable \npredictions can be made.\n  I am concerned that President Bush approved Yucca Mountain despite \nthe fact that the General Accounting Office back in December of last \nyear, identified more than 200 important scientific and technical \nquestions about Yucca Mountain that remain to be answered. This is \nespecially troubling because Presidential candidate Bush promised back \nin 2000 that ``sound science, not politics, must prevail'' in \ndetermining whether to bury nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain. The GAO \nreport urged the administration to postpone a decision until these \nquestions could be answered. I am disappointed that the administration \nhas failed to listen to the GAO.\n  There are transportation issues as well. I am not entirely convinced \nthat we have a well-thought-out plan for moving all of this nuclear \nwaste from around the country. The safety record of nuclear waste \ntransportation should give us pause. Between 1964 and 1997, the DOE \nmade approximately 2,913 shipments of used nuclear fuel. During this \ntime, there were 47 safety incidents involving nuclear shipments, \nincluding six accidents. Much is left to be decided on transportation \nand I for one am reluctant to proceed until we have answers as to how \nthis material will be shipped, on what routes, by what means and near \nwhat major cities. None of these questions have been answered, and I \nbelieve we should know if we can move this radioactive waste safely \nbefore we designate a national repository.\n  The routes for transporting nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain have not \nbeen finalized by DOE. The DOE is currently considering three modes of \ntransportation, rail, truck and barge, but the DOE has not finalized \nthe modes nor the routes. In the Final Environmental Impact Statement, \nEIS, for the Yucca Mountain project, DOE proposed a set of truck, barge \nand rail routes. These routes make use of major highways and pass \nthrough several of the Nation's largest metropolitan areas. The EIS for \nMassachusetts shows that if trucks are used to move the waste, 456 \ntruck trips would originate in the Bay State and another 1,469 trips \nwould transit the state en route to Yucca Mountain. Under the rail \nscenario, the EIS showed that 39 rail trips would originate in \nMassachusetts and another 511 would pass through the state en route to \nYucca. In addition, the NRC is responsible for testing the containers \nthat the waste will be shipped in. Thus far, all of the NRC tests \nrelied exclusively on computer simulation to test the storage \ncontainers against fire and water damage. I think we can all agree that \nmore testing is needed with actual storage containers to ensure the \nsafety of all Americans.\n  Because of this lack of testing and with real concern for their \ncities, the Conference of Mayors recently passed a resolution calling \non the Federal Government to oppose the Yucca Mountain repository until \nthe serious safety concerns in the transport of nuclear waste were \nanswered. Some of these concerns include the lack of physical testing \nof the transport casks and the lack of money and knowledge in our \ncities needed to deal with an accident involving nuclear waste. I \nbelieve we would be wise to listen to our mayors.\n  None of us here today want this waste to stay onsite forever, but we \nneed a safe and responsible solution for disposal of the waste we have \ncreated. And we urgently need to develop a policy that protects the \nhealth and safety of local communities and all Americans. There are too \nmany unanswered questions about the long-term effects of storing the \nwaste at Yucca Mountain and the means by which we transport that waste \nthere, and that is why I am voting no today.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I vote today against the motion to \nproceed to the consideration of the Yucca Mountain resolution. I have \ncast this vote for several reasons. First, on procedural grounds, I \nagree with the majority leader that to consider the issue now would be \nan unacceptable divergence from Senate practice and procedure. It is \nthe right of the majority leader to schedule the consideration of \nlegislation on the floor of the Senate, and for me to vote for this \nmotion would be to sanction what I view as an inappropriate procedure.\n  But the biggest problem is the substance of this plan. I don't \nbelieve that the Yucca Mountain site is ready to be approved by the \nCongress. There is an old saying: ``underpromise, overperform.'' \nUnfortunately, the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste storage plan \noverpromises and underperforms for the people of my State. I have \nstudied this issue carefully, mindful of how important nuclear power is \nto Connecticut, and of how concerned Connecticut families are about the \nhealth and safety effects of storing nuclear waste on site. They are \nright to be concerned. But after many months of deliberation, I have \ndecided that the plans aren't ready. Voting to create a waste \nrepository at Yucca Mountain today would solve no problems and create a \nfew new ones for the people of my state. It is not wise policy.\n  I believe the most obvious indication of this fact is the Department \nof Energy's plans to apply for a license from the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. Even though the Nuclear Waste Policy Act instructs the \nEnergy Department to submit an application to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission 90 days after Congress acts, Secretary Abraham has stated \nthat his agency will not submit an application until December 2004 at \nthe earliest. Obviously, the Energy Department is not ready to make \ntheir case for this site. Why should we be endorsing the project long \nbefore the Department is ready?\n  From studying the plans for the site, I believe that the reason that \nthe Energy Department is not ready to submit its application is \nbecause, simply, too many unanswered questions remain. In dealing with \nnuclear waste, we should first do no harm.\n  It is too soon to say conclusively that the Yucca Mountain plans meet \nthat standard. Consider the storage problems. In a December 2001 report \nto members of Congress, the General Accounting Office wrote of \n``uncertainties'' relating to the ``longevity of [engineered] waste \ncontainers,'' and noted that ``significant work is needed'' before the \nsafety of the containers can be substantiated. The GAO also felt that \nmore studies needed to be completed before the physical characteristics \nof the site could be declared suitable for the project. Most notably, \nthe report stated the GAO's uncertainty on ``how the combination of \nheat, water, and chemical processes caused by the presence of nuclear \nwaste . . . would affect the flow of water through the repository.'' \nAmong the remaining physical ``uncertainties,'' the GAO prominently \nlisted: faulting and fracturing of the\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\nrepository rock; the flow of water through the repository rock; and the \nstability of the repository rock under heated conditions and conditions \ninvolving seismic events as main concerns.\n\n  The GAO's view of uncertainties was seconded by the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board--an independent review board that acts as a \ncheck for the Energy Department's view of the science. In a January 24, \n2002 letter to Congress, the Review Board offered criticisms of the DOE \nstudy, finding that, ``as a whole . . . the technical basis for the \nDOE's repository performance estimates is weak to moderate.''\n  But, the most important point for my home state of Connecticut is \nthat, even if Yucca Mountain worked perfectly, with none of the \npotential problems that many experts have raised, it would not answer \nour problem of nuclear waste storage. It gives the people of my State \nthe false hope of a solution to this serious problem. In fact, the plan \nmay well create new problems in many areas of the state that are now \nfree of nuclear waste problems.\n  It is not as if, if we were to approve this site, the tons of nuclear \nwaste in Connecticut would be instantly transported to Nevada. Rather, \nit would take 40 years and thousands of shipments to transport that \nwaste across the country, and by the time Yucca was filled, we would \nhave generated just as much waste at each of Connecticut's nuclear \nsites. So the opening of Yucca Mountain will not free us of the \nterrorist threat at each of the sites. To the contrary, it will \ndisperse the waste even more than it is currently dispersed.\n  And the most dangerous waste of all--the ``hot'' waste that has just \nbeen removed from the reactors--cannot be moved off of our sites in \nConnecticut until it has cooled for at least 5 years. Thus, as long as \nwe are operating nuclear plants in Connecticut, we will have dangerous \nnuclear waste at those plants. In other words, the current Yucca \nstorage plans do not resolve Connecticut storage issues.\n  Finally, I am concerned that the transportation of the waste would \nbring new problems to regions of Connecticut that do not face them. The \nEnergy Department has formulated no logical and systematic plan \nregarding the transportation of waste. To transport the approximately \n40,000 tons of nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain, over 100,000 truck \nshipments or 36,000 combined rail and truck shipments would be needed, \nto be spread over the next 40 or so years. This would include waste \nfrom other States coming across on Connecticut highways and railroads. \nThe attacks on September 11 have created major new questions about the \ntransport of this waste, which could have a major effect on my State \nand which have not been addressed. Until some safe and proven plan to \ntransport this waste is offered, I am troubled by the danger on our \nroads and rails.\n  We need to deal with this nuclear waste--but no one has demonstrated \nyet that Yucca Mountain is the answer. With technology advancing every \nday, perhaps it will be the answer tomorrow. Or perhaps in the future \nwe will find another, much better solution. Until then, the imperfect \nstatus quo is better than a highly uncertain and incomplete plan such \nas this one.\n  This proposal is simply not yet ready for our consideration. \nUnfortunately, the Energy Department has stated that it will not \ncontinue to consider the site if this vote does not go its way. I think \nthat is the wrong approach--the questions I have raised today may be \nable to be answered satisfactorily with more planning and better \ntechnology, and if they are, I would probably support the site. But \nthis proposal is not ready for prime-time, and I am concerned that it \nwill not be responsible to proceed to its consideration at this point.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, we are voting today on whether to move \nforward on development of Yucca Mountain as a permanent disposal site \nfor our Nation's nuclear waste.\n  Nuclear power provides an emissions free energy source. My State of \nVermont, along with 39 other States, relies on nuclear power for a \nlarge portion of its electricity generation. It is an important part of \nour energy mix.\n  Nonetheless, we must be realistic in dealing with the downsides \nassociated with nuclear power. Over 30 years ago, as Vermont's Attorney \nGeneral, I was concerned about the impact of nuclear waste on our \nenvironment and the health of Vermonters. As Attorney General, I fought \nto improve the safety standards at Vermont Yankee by calling for the \nuse of new technology that dramatically reduced airborne radiation. \nWhen the industry resisted, I required Vermont Yankee to enter into a \ncontract with the State to use the best available technology to control \nradiation and to accept State monitoring, protecting the Connecticut \nRiver and the people of Vermont. The Atomic Energy Commission later \naccepted these technologies as their industry standard.\n  Throughout my time in Congress I have continued to work for a \ncomprehensive solution to our nuclear waste problem. Back in 1977, I \nintroduced a bill in the House calling for a comprehensive nuclear \nwaste disposal strategy. I maintained then, as I do now, that finding \nan effective solution to the waste problem is critical to the future of \nnuclear power in this country.\n  So I have been working on this problem for a long time. I have \nsupported the Yucca Mountain proposal in the past, in the belief that \nit would resolve the problem, and contain both our past and future \nnuclear waste.\n  However, the truth is that Yucca Mountain will not provide this \nsolution. It is now clear that Yucca Mountain will only take part of \nthe waste, leaving some, if not most, of the future waste that will be \nproduced sitting along the banks of rivers, beside both our small local \ncommunities and our largest population centers. This is not adequate. \nThis is not acceptable.\n  Therefore, despite my past voting record on this issue, I will cast \nmy vote today against the sitting resolution for Yucca Mountain, \nbecause it does not finish the job we must do. Unlike my previous \nunderstanding, the Yucca site will not provide a sound, permanent and \ncomprehensive solution to the problem of our nuclear waste disposal. \nAll it does it provide a partial measure, one that can lull us into a \nfalse sense of security that the issue is taken care of. It is not.\n  I understand that Yucca Mountain, if approved today as I assume it \nwill be, will take some of the waste, both from my State and others. \nThat is of course helpful, as far as it goes.\n  But Americans should not be misled into believing that the Yucca \nMountain site will solve America's waste problem. I would be derelict \nin my duties were I not to dispel this motion. I do so with my vote \ntoday in opposition to the Yucca Mountain proposal, under its current \nlimitations. I do so not because I don't recognize that Yucca has the \npotential to provide some relief to storage concerns at Vermont Yankee \nand other sites. I take this vote instead because we cannot allow it to \nbe viewed as the panacea to our nuclear waste storage problem.\n  We must continue to work with the nuclear industry and with the \nadministration to find a safe and comprehensive solution to this \nextremely vexing problem. We cannot rest on our laurels for the next \n10, 20 or 30 years, only to wake up to expanded nuclear waste piles \nwith nowhere to go.\n  I trust my vote today will help emphasize this continuing need, and \nour continuing obligation.\n  I take this vote only after many long hours of carefully examining \nthe facts of this matter. The truth is, I am more concerned than ever \nthat we are just delaying the problem. Vermonters need to know that \nunder the Yucca ``solution'' high-level waste is still likely to be \nstored forever on the banks of the Connecticut River. All Americans \nneed to know similar waste storage problems will still exist on our \nNation's waterways.\n  Over the years, I have consistently supported a central storage \nsolution for nuclear waste. I continue to believe that it is essential \nthat we find a permanent, central storage site if we are to continue to \nproduce nuclear power.\n  The current proposal before us is merely a partial, interim step, and \nmust be recognized as such. We must not just blindly continue to \nproduce nuclear power, without a comprehensive and safe solution to the \ndisposal of the waste we produce.\n  I urge my colleagues and this administration to not relax our \ndiligence in focusing on the next step, a real and\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\ncomprehensive solution to nuclear waste disposal.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am voting against this resolution. I \nsupport the development of a long-term strategy of storing our Nation's \nnuclear waste. However, a single storage repository is not the answer \nto our nuclear waste problem.\n  I have three major concerns about the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear \nwaste repository: first, the repository's inadequate storage capacity, \nsecond, the environmental risks of storing nuclear waste at the site, \nand third, the risks of transporting nuclear waste to the site.\n  Based on these factors, I believe it would be a mistake to bring all \nof our Nation's nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. Instead of a single \nrepository, it would be better to develop regional nuclear waste \npermanent storage facilities which would increase overall storage \ncapacity and reduce risks associated with transporting waste great \ndistances.\n  Today nuclear waste is stored at 131 facilities in 39 States. These \nfacilities hold nearly 47,500 metric tons of nuclear waste. This amount \nis growing rapidly. Within 40 years, it is estimated that our country \nwill have generated nearly 108,000 metric tons of nuclear waste.\n  The Yucca Mountain repository, as I understand it, is authorized to \nhold only 70,000 metric tons. So at our current rate of nuclear waste \nproduction, we will have generated this amount by the earliest \nestimated date of the repository's opening in 2010. In fact, we may \ngenerate the full 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste before the site \never opens.\n  What is the point of creating a storage site that will be filled to \ncapacity before it even opens?\n  I am very concerned about the environmental risks surrounding the \nsite storage. DOE was supposed to recommend or reject the Yucca \nMountain repository with geologic considerations to be the primary \ncriteria. I find it disturbing that the suitability of the Yucca \nMountain repository has instead focused on container material.\n  These titanium waste containers are DOE's principal method of \nproviding safety and security of the nuclear waste and repository and \nensuring the protection of surrounding areas.\n  Yet how can we be so confident in our support of such containers when \nwe don't know about their longevity and durability?\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, which was established by \nCongress specifically to ensure that a repository adequately protects \nthe public health and the environment and it has voiced similar \nconcerns. Last year, the board termed the technical basis for DOE's \nrepository performance estimates as ``weak to moderate.''\n  As a result, the NWTRB has limited confidence in current performance \nestimates generated by the DOE's performance assessment model. The \nboard has found that high temperatures in the DOE's repository design \nincrease uncertainties and decrease confidence in the performance of \nthese metal storage containers.\n  According to Dr. Jared Cohon, the chairman of the board, ``gaps in \ndata and basic understanding cause important uncertainties in the \nconcepts and assumptions on which the DOE's performance estimates are \nnow based.''\n  The half-life of these titanium storage containers is still unknown. \nScientists have found that the first container failures could occur \nafter 10,000 years, although one board member said it was ``hopeless'' \nto know how long the container would last, given just a few years of \nresearch. Perhaps failure could occur much sooner.\n\n  In comparison, Uranium 235, the basic fuel used by nuclear reactors, \nhas a half-life of 704 million years.\n  It would be simply irresponsible for us to bury such hazardous \nnuclear waste when we don't have a good idea about how long the \ncontainers could hold up.\n  One of the most significant problems found at the site is the amount \nof subsurface water present under Yucca Mountain. Water promotes \ncorrosion and movement of radioactive material and its presence in a \nrepository is a serious drawback. As the titanium casks erode over \ntime, we could face a potential disaster as this water becomes \ncontaminated and flows into the water table.\n  California counties have expressed their rightful concerns of \nsubsurface water at Yucca Mountain surfacing at populated areas \ndownstream of the site.\n  For instance, Inyo County in California, with a population of 17,945, \nlies downstream of the proposed repository. Contaminated water could \nvery easily spread from the repository directly into their towns and \nhomes.\n  Death Valley, one of our Nation's ecological and environmental \ntreasures, is also only about 20 miles from the repository. Water \ncontaminated with nuclear waste could destroy one of the jewels of our \nNational Park System.\n  DOE refutes the idea of possible harm of water contamination based on \nthe titanium casks the Department has proposed to store the nuclear \nwaste.\n  Yet in March of 2001, the NWTRB wrote to DOE expressing its concern \nthat important water flow processes around Yucca Mountain remain poorly \nunderstood and should be further studied.\n  The board has criticized the lack of critical corrosion data on the \ntitanium casks in the DOE's basic design concept. According to the \nboard, ``We are betting the performance of the systems on the long term \nperformance of these effectively new materials.''\n  The fact is we simply do not know enough about the durability of \nthese containers and how they will hold up under intense natural \nconditions for thousands of years.\n  If we are so confident of the safety and durability of these titanium \nstorage casks, why not use them to store nuclear waste at or near \nexisting reactor sites and thereby eliminate the risk of transporting \nthese hazardous materials across the country?\n  The most immediate question that need to be answered, however, is, \nhow will we transport all of our nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain? While \nsome argue that the repository will increase national security by \ndecreasing the number of storage sites, the transportation of nuclear \nwaste to the site would actually create thousands of moving targets.\n  In order to move the Nation's nuclear waste to the Yucca Mountain \nrepository, DOE would have to transport thousands of metric tons of \nnuclear waste across the country and those shipments would take decades \njust to move the waste that has already been generated.\n  Keep in mind that nuclear power provides a quarter of our Nation's \nenergy needs and we generate hundreds of spent nuclear fuel rods each \nday and nearly 2,200 metric tons of nuclear waste each year.\n  If we had a way to magically move all of the nuclear waste to Yucca \nMountain, it might be safer to have a single repository. However, this \nis not the case and the transportation of nuclear waste poses \nunnecessary risks for accidents and attacks.\n  According to DOE, it would take an estimated 24 years for the full \n70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste to be transported to Yucca \nMountain.\n  DOE has not yet determined exactly how this nuclear waste would be \ntransported. The Department estimates that it would take 53,000 trips \nby truck over the proposed 24-year time period. If the nuclear waste \ntraveled by train, that scenario would involve an estimated 10,700 rail \nshipments.\n\n  The site is scheduled to open in 2010 according to DOE's earliest \npredictions and at the end of all shipments in 2034, there would still \nbe: nearly 42,000 metric tons of commercial nuclear waste stored in 63 \nnuclear power plant sites in 31 States; and about 7,000 metric tons of \nDOE generated waste stored in 4 states.\n  This is why I believe a single repository is not capable of meeting \nour long-term nuclear waste storage needs.\n  Such shipments present unnecessary risks in transporting numerous \nshipments of hazardous materials from New England to Nevada.\n  As a result of this plan, significant amounts of nuclear waste will \nundoubtedly move through or near populated urban areas, potentially \njeopardizing the safety of millions of Americans.\n  And commercial spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power reactors would \ncomprise about 90 percent of the waste shipped to the repository. DOE \nhas acknowledged that this waste is ``usually intensely radioactive.''\n  According to DOE's Final Environmental Impact Statement, (FEIS)\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\nmore than 123 million people currently live in 703 counties traversed \nby DOE's proposed highway routes and 106 million live in counties along \nDOE's proposed rail routes.\n  Using potential truck and rail transportation routes identified by \nDOE, the Environmental Working Group, a national environmental research \norganization, estimated that waste shipments to the Yucca Mountain \nrepository could pass within a mile or less of 14,510 schools, 933 \nhospitals and the homes of 38.5 million people.\n  When the distance from routes is expanded to 5 miles, waste shipments \ncould pass 36,228 schools, 1,831 hospitals and the homes of 109 million \npeople.\n  Preliminary routes in Southern California slate waste from the Diablo \nCanyon powerplant to be shipped about 200 miles on a barge to Port \nHueneme in suburban Ventura County just north of Los Angeles, which is \none of California's five busiest ports and the nation's biggest export \nsite for citrus.\n  These shipments pose potential threats to some of the most densely \npopulated areas in the U.S.\n  Additionally, routine radiation from shipping casks poses a \nsignificant health threat to workers handling such shipments.\n  In the most extreme example, motor carrier safety inspectors could \nreceive cumulative doses large enough to increase their risk of cancer \ndeath by 10 percent or more and their risk of other serious health \neffects by 40 percent or more.\n  According to the Nevada Agency for Nuclear Projects, public \nperception of transportation risks could also result in economic costs \nto those communities along shipping routes. Even without an accident or \nincident, property values near these routes could decline by 3 percent \nor more. In the event of an accident, residential property values along \nshipping routes could decline between 8 percent and 34 percent, \ndepending on the severity of the accident.\n  DOE takes great pride in its record of safe transportation of \nhazardous materials for over more than 30 years. During that time, \nthere have been only eight accidents and none of them resulted in the \nharmful release of radioactive material.\n  However, during that time period, we were moving fewer than 100 \nshipments per year.\n  Over the next 24 years, there would be an estimated 2,200 shipments \nper year heading to the Yucca Mountain repository alone. There would \nalso be more than 10,700 cross-country shipments occurring at an \naverage of 450 per year.\n  This enormous increase in shipments would greatly increase potential \naccidents.\n  According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \n457,000 large trucks were involved in traffic crashes in the year 2000 \nalone.\n  According to the FEIS, a very severe highway or rail accident could \nrelease radioactive materials from a shipping container, resulting in \nradiation exposures to members of the public and latent cancer \nfatalities among the exposed population.\n  The July 2001 Baltimore rail tunnel fire has been cited as an example \nof the dangers of shipping nuclear waste by train.\n  The fire burned for 3 days with temperatures as high as 1500 degrees \nFahrenheit. A single rail cask in such an accident could have released \nenough radioactive material to contaminate an area of 32 square miles.\n  In addition to the harm inflicting surrounding populations, the FEIS \nestimates the clean-up costs of such an accident could potentially \nreach $10 billion.\n  Failure to clean up the contamination of such an accident could cause \n4,000 to 28,000 cancer deaths over the next 50 years. Between 200 and \n1,400 latent cancer fatalities would be expected from exposures during \nthe first year.\n  A successful terrorist attack using high energy explosives could \nresult in similar destruction and damage.\n  The FEIS concedes that a high-energy explosive device could rupture \nthe wall of a truck cask, leading to the dispersal of contaminants into \nthe environment. A single blast resulting in 90 percent penetration of \na truck cask could lead to 300 to 1,800 cancer fatalities. Full \nperforation of a cask could cause 3,000 to 18,000 cancer fatalities. \nCleanup and recovery costs of such an incident would exceed $10 \nbillion.\n  These threats should be taken very seriously and this assessment \nfurthers my belief that the long and complex transportation of nuclear \nwaste to a single site is a threat to our national security.\n  Based on these concerns, I do not believe that Yucca Mountain is the \nanswer to our current nuclear waste security nor our long term nuclear \nwaste storage problem.\n  According to Dr. Victor Gilinsky, a former Commissioner of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, Yucca Mountain is not needed to \ncontinue, or even expand, nuclear power use. There is ample opportunity \nto expand existing, NRC-approved, on-site storage. As he testified \nbefore the Senate Energy Committee:\n\n     the important thing now is to recognize that there is no \n     immediate crisis, that there is time to do this and to do a \n     good job and responsible job in terms of safety and security, \n     and to do it at a much lower cost to taxpayers than Yucca \n     Mountain represents.\n\n  I believe a regional system will provide us with both immediate and \nlong-term results. Immediate in the sense that we can explore expanding \nstorage at current NRC-approved sites. Long-term in the sense that it \nwill produce a system of regional permanent storage sites that will \nmeet our long-term nuclear waste storage needs.\n  I cannot support a site that does not have the capacity to meet our \nNation's long-term nuclear waste storage needs and poses serious risks \nto our environment and national security. A system of regional storage \nrepositories could eliminate these risks and provide the adequate and \nsafe permanent storage of nuclear waste that our country needs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to House Joint \nResolution 87, the Yucca Mountain resolution, to approve the \ndevelopment of a repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive \nwaste and spent nuclear fuel, pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1982.\n  Since the advent of nuclear power nearly 50 years ago, we have been \nconcerned about the problem of waste generated by the production of \nelectricity. Today we are considering a decisive step towards a \nsolution to the dilemma of high-level nuclear waste as mandated by the \nact. But the path forward is not risk-free.\n  There are problems associated with the siting. The General Accounting \nOffice has raised serious questions regarding the seismology, stability \nof the repository, and long-term effects of heat, water and chemical \nprocesses in and around the waste containers.\n  I am concerned about dangers posed by transporting thousands of tons, \nand thousands of shipments, of high-level nuclear waste through 43 \nStates. Each truck could potentially carry more long-lived \nradioactivity than released at Hiroshima. I am sympathetic to those \nStates that face the risk of transportation-related accidents or \nterrorist attacks. Because of our experience in the Pacific with \nnuclear testing and resulting exposure to radioactivity, I urge caution \nwhen dealing with long-lived radioactive material.\n  We have similar transport problems on the world's sea lanes. Last \nweek, Japan returned a shipment of mixed plutonium-uranium oxide fuel, \nMOX, to the United Kingdom because it was sent to Japan with falsified \nsafety data and without proper safety checks. The safety and security \nof nuclear waste, whether transported on the highways or the high seas, \nshould be of great concern to Americans. During my tenure in the \nSenate, I have closely monitored the safety and security of shipments \nof MOX from Europe to Japan for nuclear power purposes. On numerous \noccasions I have voiced concerns with transportation plans and \nassociated security measures for the shipments of nuclear material in \nthe Pacific. Recent warnings and alarm over the threat of procurement \nand use of nuclear materials for crude explosive devices known as \n``dirty bombs'' heightens the need to be vigilant and careful in the \ntransport of nuclear material.\n  I am not convinced that the plan proposed by the administration has \naddressed all of these risks. Clearly, we can't walk away from the \nnuclear waste dilemma, and the nation must address this intractable \nproblem. We need a scientific rather than a political\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\nsolution. In a new approach, Congress should not pre-select a site but \nprovide a process that leads to a scientifically sound solution. I will \noppose the motion to proceed, as I am not convinced that this is the \nbest path forward.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the advent of nuclear power more than 50 \nyears ago brought with it both great promise and great responsibility. \nOur ability to harness the power of the atom has paid substantial \ndividends for our society, but it has also left us with the formidable \nchallenge of safely storing the byproducts of nuclear power generation. \nThis is a challenge our Nation must meet so that future generations are \nnot endangered by today's nuclear waste.\n  Presently, all of the spent fuel from nuclear power plants and \nresearch reactors throughout the country remains on-site at each \nreactor. None of these facilities was designed to safely store that \nwaste on a permanent basis, and leaving spent fuel in temporary storage \naround the Nation poses both a security threat and an environmental \nhazard. In Illinois, nearly half of our electricity is generated from \nnuclear power. Our State contains seven nuclear powerplants, two \nnuclear research reactors, and more commercial nuclear waste than any \nother State.\n  We need to find a safe and permanent way to store this material, and \nsuch a storage site has been proposed at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. I \nhave been to Yucca Mountain, which is located 90 miles from Las Vegas \non Federal land at the remote Nevada nuclear test site. The waste would \nbe stored more than 600 feet underground but more than 500 feet above \nthe water table, sealed in steel containers placed under a titanium \nshield. A security force at the Nevada test site is in place to protect \nthe area, and the airspace around Yucca Mountain is already restricted.\n  When this issue has come before Congress in the past, I have opposed \nefforts to move waste to a temporary facility at Yucca Mountain before \nthere was a scientific determination of whether waste could be safely \nstored there on a permanent basis. I had no interest in moving this \nwaste to a temporary place, only to move it again when a permanent \nrepository is finally determined. I also opposed earlier measures that \nwould have mandated dangerously low standards for environmental \nprotection at the site.\n  Recently, however, I have been encouraged by the fact that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has established radiation and \ngroundwater contamination standards for the Yucca Mountain storage \nsite. These standards were derived from recommendations by experts at \nthe National Academy of Sciences and were developed after extensive \npublic comment and scientific analysis. All of these standards greatly \nexceed the standards debated by Congress in the two previous bills I \nopposed. Under three bills Congress considered in the past on this \nissue, the EPA would have been required to issue a single standard \nlimiting the lifetime risk of premature cancer death to 1 in 1,000, or \n.001. The current EPA standard assumes a risk of 8.5 in 1,000,000, or \n.0000085. Furthermore, these bills would have prohibited a standard for \ngroundwater, which EPA has now put in place. If the Department of \nEnergy is able to move forward with a licensing application for Yucca \nMountain, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will be charged with making \nsure that the Department of Energy proves it can meet the EPA's \nstandards. If it cannot prove this, the Yucca Mountain project cannot \nmove forward.\n  No site will ever be perfect for the storage of high-level nuclear \nwaste, but I believe the studies which have already been conducted and \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission review still to come provide \nsufficient assurances that Yucca Mountain is the most appropriate site \navailable and should be used as the permanent national nuclear waste \nrepository.\n  I am still concerned, however, with the movement of thousands of tons \nof nuclear waste across the country to Nevada. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy, Illinois would rank seventh in truck shipments in \nwhat is called the ``mostly truck scenario.'' The same Energy \nDepartment analysis concludes that Illinois would rank sixth in rail \nshipments in the ``mostly rail scenario.'' Although waste has been \nshipped through Illinois and other states in the past, approving Yucca \nMountain would initiate the largest waste shipping campaign in the \nhistory of our country, both in terms of the number of shipments and \nthe amount of miles traveled for high level nuclear waste.\n  Unless we scrutinize safety factors and security risks, the large-\nscale transportation of radioactive materials has the potential to \ncause a host of serious challenges to cities and communities along \nshipping routes. The U.S. Conference of Mayors has expressed concerns \nabout the transportation plan, and I am submitting for the Record a \nletter sent to President Bush on this matter, signed by Mayor Richard \nM. Daley of Chicago and 17 other mayors. This issue is all the more \nimportant in light of the terrorist threats we are likely to face in \nthe years ahead.\n  Illinois is home to one of the busiest transportation corridors in \nthe Nation, putting our State squarely at the intersection of the \nnuclear crossroads. With the safety of Illinoisans at stake, finding \nthe safest way to move nuclear waste to a location where it poses the \nleast risk is imperative.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation in the Senate that would \ndirect the Federal Government to develop a comprehensive safety program \nfor nuclear waste transportation. This legislation would require the \nwaste containment casks to be tested to ensure they could withstand \nintense fires, high-speed collisions and other threats that may occur \nduring transport. My bill also would require States to be consulted on \nthe selection of transportation routes and would require a 2-week \nadvance notification of waste shipments. I also would ban inland \nwaterway shipments of nuclear waste, require dedicated trains and \nestablish a minimum number of trained escorts to accompany each nuclear \nwaste convoy. I am looking forward to working with my colleagues who \nshare my interest in this legislation.\n  Congress should move forward with making Yucca Mountain the central \nrepository for our Nation's nuclear waste. It is, I am convinced, the \nbest solution to a complicated problem we have debated for decades. But \nbefore shipments to Yucca Mountain begin, we need to establish a \ntransportation plan to ensure the safety and security of the \ncommunities that lie in the path of those shipments, and we must begin \nthat work today.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The U.S. Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                                February 23, 2002.\n     Hon. George W. Bush,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Your approval of Yucca Mountain in \n     Nevada as a nuclear waste repository was a historic moment in \n     the history of the project. Quite literally, it is the \n     culmination of over 50 years of scientific research and \n     analysis. Since the Atomic Energy Act was passed in 1954, the \n     federal government has been searching for methods to dispose \n     of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.\n       As a single largest federal government project in the \n     history of the United States, we acknowledge that the Yucca \n     Mountain project has detractors and supporters. Regardless of \n     the final repository location, we have serious concerns about \n     the transportation of spent nuclear fuel from reactors all \n     over the country to Yucca Mountain or any other repository.\n       So far, the preliminary estimates that have been released \n     call for up to 10 shipments of nuclear fuel each day for \n     close to 40 years. These shipments will travel through \n     America's cities past our schools, homes and places of \n     business.\n       In 1996, The United States Conference of Mayors adopted \n     policy on the transportation of radioactive waste that calls \n     for the federal government to fund training and equipment \n     that will be needed by local emergency response personnel \n     along transportation routes, to upgrade medical facilities \n     which would treat victims of transportation accidents, and to \n     upgrade highway and railroad or highway bypasses to ensure \n     safe transportation corridors. It also calls on the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission to certify shipping transportation \n     containers after a public process that includes both physical \n     testing and computer modeling to ensure that the containers \n     can withstand severe accidents.\n       As mayors, we are concerned that the Department of Energy \n     (DOE) has not yet fully researched the methods for the \n     transportation of nuclear waste. A recent incident that \n     illustrates our concern is the 2001 Baltimore Tunnel fire. \n     Five days passed before fire fighters could gain access to \n     the blaze\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n     and control the flames. Several studies have been done to \n     determine the environmental impact if that train had been \n     carrying spent nuclear fuel--and the results have been \n     disturbing.\n       Given the long-term nature of the Yucca project, it seems \n     only natural that the DOE would include transportation \n     analysis and an environmental impact study in its final \n     report. We respectfully request that the Office of the \n     President of the United States initiate one.\n       As the mayors of potentially affected cities, we urge you \n     to continue your dedication to public safety and homeland \n     security by supporting a thorough study on nuclear waste \n     transportation to the final repository.\n       We look forward to working with you on this very important \n     issue.\n           Sincerely,\n       (Signed by 18 mayors.)\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 34, a \njoint resolution approving the site at Yucca Mountain, NV, for the \ndevelopment of a repository for the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level radioactive waste, pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1982.\n  As we are aware, under current law, Energy Secretary Abraham \nrecommended the Yucca Mountain geologic site as the repository for the \nNation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste to the \nPresident on February 14, 2002, and the President then recommended the \nsite to Congress the next day. Under law, on April 8, Nevada Governor \nGuinn exercised his right to veto the Yucca Mountain site. This veto \nwill block further development of the site unless the Congress acts by \npassing an approval resolution that is signed by the President by July \n27.\n  In 1982, legislation was crafted in response to the need to dispose \nof the Nation's spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste \nthat has been collecting since the growth of the nuclear power industry \nstarted in the 1950s. The waste is now being stored in various ways in \n131 locations across the country.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the NWPA, called for disposal \nof this spent nuclear fuel in a repository in a deep geologic formation \nthat would not be disturbed for thousands of years. An office was \nestablished in the Department of Energy to develop such a storage \nrepository, the costs of which would be covered by a fee on nuclear-\ngenerated electricity and paid into the Nuclear Waste Fund.\n  My experience with the storage of the Nation's high-level nuclear \nwaste covers the entire 20 year lifetime of the NWPA. In the 99th \nCongress, I introduced a bill in the House, H.R. 4664, with 23 other \nRepresentatives to amend the NWPA. The bill called for the disposal of \nhigh-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel in a single \nnational repository. At that time, the NWPA called for two \nrepositories, one in the East and one in the West. I was also a \ncosponsor of H.R. 4668, the Broyhill bill that removed the requirement \nof a second repository for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste \nand spent nuclear fuel.\n  Our successes came in the next Congress, the 100th Congress, when \nlanguage I developed with then Representative Mo Udall was ultimately \nincluded in the fiscal year 1988 Concurrent Budget Resolution that went \non to be signed into law as Public Law 100-203. The language called for \nthe establishment of one national repository. Language was also added \nat that time that established Yucca Mountain as the only site to be \nconsidered for the repository.\n  Through all of those years, and especially since 9/11, I have \ncontinued to believe that the Nation's spent nuclear fuel could be more \nsafely stored at one secure federally guarded facility than at \ntemporary storage facilities all around the country. It would also be \nless expensive to State governments, which have already taken on the \nresponsibility of dealing with the storage of low-level radioactive \nwaste within their borders.\n  I do not believe that leaving the spent fuel at commercial and DOE \nsites for 10,000 years while having each site take the necessary \nsecurity precautions and storage upgrades is the best approach, \nespecially as the DOE itself has predicted that leaving the spent fuel \nstored on all of the numerous sites throughout the country would result \nin a radioactive material release, contaminating soil, surface water, \nand groundwater.\n  In Maine, we have a nuclear plant being decommissioned--Maine \nYankee--that has been waiting for the Federal Government to take the \nwaste that it should have taken by law by 1998, but has still failed to \ndo so since no facility is ready to store the waste. In fact, Maine \nYankee is seeking $120 million through a lawsuit against DOE because \nthe Federal Government has not lived up to their part of the bargain.\n\n  The nuclear power plant stopped operating in 1997, but 1,434 spent \nfuel assemblies still sit at the site waiting for a permanent Federal \nsolution. The company has now spent about $60 million to build a dry \ncask storage facility and will spend at least $4 million per year to \noperate it. This is not a unique case as there are a total of 26 power \nplants no longer in operation that also have waste waiting to be \nshipped. By 2006, 60 reactors will run out of original storage space, \nwith 78 running out by 2010.\n  Even after we pass this resolution and the President signs it, the \nrepository will still need to meet the strict requirements of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission to be licensed, and if the Yucca Mountain \nsite receives approval, it will not even be ready to accept spent fuel \nbefore 2010 at the earliest. We simply cannot wait any longer to move \nthis issue forward.\n  I understand that concerns have been raised about the transportation \nof the spent fuel--and these should be raised and the public should be \nassured that security plans are in place for safe transportation. We \ndo, however, have a decade to assure that the waste will be safely and \nsecurely shipped to the Yucca Mountain site from all parts of the \ncountry. Indeed, history tells us that past shipments have been \ncarefully managed. The nuclear industry has completed 3,000 shipments \nof spent fuel over 1.7 million miles by highways and railroads since \n1964. Eight accidents have occurred, four of which had fuel in the \nshipping containers, but no radiation was released. In the next decade, \nwe can expect even greater safety of shipments through improved \ntechnology.\n  I was pleased to support Senator Carnahan's amendment to the recently \npassed Senate energy bill that calls for a National Academy of Sciences \nstudy on how DOE chooses spent nuclear fuel transportation routes, and \nto do risk assessments of all of the potential routes. This should \nclarify the transportation issue even more for the public and I urge \nthe conferees to keep this provision in the conference report.\n  The Federal Government has already spent $7 billion on the Yucca \nMountain site, and will ultimately spend about $50 billion more up to \nthe time when the site is expected to reach capacity and is closed in \n2019. We must move forward responsibly to once and for all safely and \nsecurely store the Nation's highly radioactive spent fuel and nuclear \nwaste at a single national location or, as the DOE has projected, the \ncost will climb to the trillions of dollars. We can neither afford this \nor afford to wait any longer.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in 1982, Congress required the Federal \nGovernment to find a permanent repository for the disposal of spent \nnuclear fuel. Now, 20 years later, we are finally taking the necessary \naction to move ahead with this plan.\n  Yucca Mountain was recently designated as a suitable site for \ndevelopment as the Nation's permanent repository, with over 24 years of \nFederal research and scientific evaluation. The Secretary of Energy, \nafter thoroughly examining the relevant scientific and technical \nmaterials, concluded that the site is scientifically and technically \nsuitable for construction of a repository. Now, it is up to Congress to \nensure that we provide a safe, permanent storage facility.\n  In this time of heightened terrorist threats, it is absolutely \nnecessary that the Government provide safe and secure permanent storage \nfor our spent nuclear fuel. Currently, spent nuclear fuel and high-\nlevel radioactive waste is stored at 131 sites in 39 States.\n  We can no longer afford to continue storing nuclear waste in \ntemporary sites that are too often located near densely populated areas \nand water supplies. It seems only logical to want to safeguard public \nhealth and safety by storing nuclear waste at a site that\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\nwould be highly guarded against any terrorist activity.\n  Even in my home State of Iowa, spent nuclear fuel from the Duane \nArnold plant is stored just outside of Cedar Rapids near the town of \nPalo. Like too many other facilities in the United States, the plant is \nbeing forced to construct temporary storage because of the Federal \nGovernment's lack of action on a permanent facility.\n  And, just 10 miles from the Iowa border, at a plant that ceased \noperation in 1987, sits 42 tons of nuclear waste in a waterpool that is \ndesigned for temporary storage during operation, not permanent storage. \nIt's for these reasons that it is crucial the Senate move forward in \ndesignating Yucca Mountain as a permanent storage facility. Storing \nnuclear waste at Yucca Mountain would protect public safety, health and \nthe Nation's security.\n  Opponents continue to raise questions concerning the safety of the \ntransportation of this material to Nevada. For over 30 years, there \nhave been 2,700 shipments of spent nuclear fuel without a single \nrelease of radioactive material harmful to the public or the \nenvironment. It is important to remember that because spent fuel is \nstored at over 100 temporary sites across the Nation, shipments of \nspent fuel will cross the country whether or not Yucca Mountain is \napproved.\n  Secretary Abraham has assured that the Department of Energy will \ndevelop a transportation plan and work with State and tribal \ngovernments regarding shipments to Yucca Mountain. Iowa's Governor, Tom \nVilsack, has also shared with me his support for designating Yucca \nMountain, based on the outstanding record of safely transporting \nnuclear material. Given Iowa's geographic position across major \ntransportation routes, Governor Vilsack relayed that Iowa has \nconsistently met its responsibilities in this regard.\n  Lastly, those who oppose the transportation of the waste across the \ncountry because it could be a terrorist target have clearly disregarded \nthe fact that spent fuel in secure transit to a permanent repository is \nfar less of a target than the spent fuel scattered across the country \nat over 100 temporary, stationary sites.\n  With over 2,000 tons of spent nuclear fuel in Iowa or on it is \nborders, it's imperative that the Senate take the necessary action \ntoday to finally begin the process of developing a permanent \nrepository. To protect our national security, enhance our energy \nsecurity, and ensure the safety of the public, we must support this \nresolution and move ahead on this project.\n  I request that a copy of Governor Vilsack's letter to me dated May 8, \n2002, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    State of Iowa,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                          Des Moines, May 8, 2002.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Bldg., Washington, DC.\n       I am writing to encourage your support for the recent \n     decision to go forward with development of Yucca Mountain, \n     Nevada as a permanent repository for our nation's used \n     commercial nuclear fuel and defense nuclear fuel and defense \n     nuclear waste. The State of Nevada has exercised its right to \n     object to the decision. As a result, it is now your \n     responsibility, as a member of Congress, to evaluate, \n     considering the effects on national interest, the decision \n     and affirm its wisdom.\n       In 1982 Congress established our nation's policy on \n     managing used commercial nuclear fuel and defense waste, \n     i.e., interim storage by commercial reactor operators at \n     their sites and permanent storage at one or more national, \n     geologic repositories by the Federal government. Further, \n     Congress provided for the collection of a fee, levied on \n     customers of electricity generated by nuclear power plants, \n     to be paid into the Federal Treasury and appropriated by \n     Congress for the study and development of a permanent \n     repository. In 1987, Congress, acting to focus the U.S. \n     Department of Energy's efforts, instructed the DOE to \n     exclusively study the site at Yucca Mountain, Nevada.\n       The DOE acting in accordance with Congress' instructions, \n     studied the Yucca Mountain site in extensive detail. This \n     study validated the scientific wisdom that led to focusing on \n     the Yucca Mountain site in 1987. We should now move on to the \n     next phase of activities and begin the processes of design, \n     licensing, construction and operation of a permanent \n     repository. This is with the full understanding that the \n     licensing and operation of Yucca Mountain still must \n     withstand the detailed scrutiny and additional questioning by \n     the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission which is charged by \n     law to decide whether or not to issue a license to the DOE \n     before a single bundle of used nuclear fuel can move to Yucca \n     Mountain.\n       Used nuclear fuel is currently stored at commercial reactor \n     sites within and on the borders of the state of Iowa. While \n     this storage has been and continues to be accomplished \n     responsibly, these facilities were never intended as sites \n     for permanent storage and are operated on the presumption \n     that the Federal government will go forward with its \n     responsibility for providing a permanent repository. These \n     same reactor sites provide nearly 25% of Iowa's electric \n     energy.\n       Customers have paid into the federal fund for the purposes \n     of developing a repository. Study is but a single step \n     towards the final end of developing a useful facility. With \n     the completion of that study there is a ``light at the end of \n     the tunnel'' for those same customers who are bearing the \n     expense of the interim storage within or on the borders of \n     our state.\n       Congress, in 1982, when it enacted the policy of a national \n     repository, recognized that used nuclear fuel and defense \n     nuclear waste must be transported to that repository. History \n     provides us an outstanding record of transportation of \n     nuclear material. The state of Iowa, with its geographical \n     position across major transportation routes, has consistently \n     met its responsibilities in this regard. The same 1982 act \n     provides for federal support to states to insure that the \n     safety record of future transportation is equally good, if \n     not better.\n       The decision to move forward on Yucca Mountain and the \n     subsequent objection by Nevada have turned the issue back to \n     Congress to fulfill the national policy it established in \n     1982: providing a permanent Federal repository for used \n     nuclear fuel and defense nuclear waste. Science affirms the \n     wisdom of Congress' decision in 1987 to focus on Yucca \n     Mountain. Customers and our nuclear reactor operators have \n     provided money and interim storage while waiting for a \n     permanent repository.\n       It is now time for Congress to stand behind its original \n     decision and vote to move forward with Yucca Mountain. I ask \n     for your support on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Thomas J. Vilsack,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today the long struggle to find a permanent \nrepository for nuclear waste came one step closer to completion. The \nSenate has decided to over rule Nevada's objection to storing nuclear \nwaste at Yucca Mountain with a strong majority. This is a victory I \nsupported, but not one I can be happy about because it forced me to \nvote against my leadership.\n  I supported moving the waste to Yucca Mountain for three main \nreasons. First, the opening of Yucca Mountain means that Wisconsin will \nhave one less site storing nuclear waste as the Dairyland Power \nCooperative's decommissioned reactor will finally be able to get rid of \nthe waste stored at its defunct reactor. Second the site has been \nproven safe after 20 years of study by the Department of Energy and the \nNational Academy of Sciences. Third, the electricity rate payers of \nWisconsin have paid more than $250 million over the years for this \nsite, and the Federal Government should fulfill its side of the bargain \nby providing the repository it promised.\n  I still have concerns regarding transportation of the waste through \nour population centers. This is a high stakes situation and every \neffort needs to be made to choose the best routes, prepare the local \nemergency response units, and continue to improve the casks in which \nthe waste will be moved. However, the industry's record of thousands of \nshipments of nuclear waste around the country and around the world \nwithout an accidental release of radiation leads me to believe that \nthese concerns will be adequately addressed.\n  I understand the concerns some of my colleagues have on the safety of \nthe Yucca Mountain site. What we are asking science to do by proving \nthat this site will be safe for tens of thousands of years is unheard \nof, and may well be beyond our current capabilities. But this site, on \nthe Nevada Nuclear Test site, is certainly safer than leaving this \nwaste at 132 sites nationwide. Sites scattered around the country that \nwere never designed to be a permanent solution. This mountain has been \ncarefully studied and will continue to be closely monitored. We will \nnot walk away from Yucca Mountain but will watch it closely for \ngenerations to come.\n  Burying our waste problems for future generations to deal with is not \nsomething we should be proud of. I hope the Congress and the \nadministration will continue to fund nuclear research that will \ninvestigate ways to\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\nneutralize this waste. The repository at Yucca Mountain doesn't have to \nbe the last word on nuclear waste, and I hope we can do better in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to share my views on the Yucca \nMountain resolution. Specifically, I want to review the issues that I \nhave considered in examining this legislation that have led me to vote \nagainst the motion to proceed to this measure. In short, while I \nbelieve that Yucca Mountain ultimately may be the appropriate place to \npermanently store our country's nuclear waste, the Senate is \nconsidering proceeding to this resolution today without having \naddressed two key concerns: the Congress has not ensured that the Yucca \nMountain site is of sufficient size to house our country's nuclear \nwaste and the Congress does not yet know the Administration's plans for \nensuring that the transportation of waste to that site is safe and \nsecure. In addition, considering this premature resolution does nothing \nto get the waste to Yucca Mountain more quickly because the Federal \nGovernment must complete a number of remaining regulatory steps and \nbuild the site.\n  Let me first express my grave concern about the process by which this \nresolution has been brought to the floor. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nof 1982, amended in 1987, establishes a process for the Federal \nGovernment to designate a site for a permanent repository for civilian \nnuclear waste. In February 2002, this process culminated in a \nPresidential recommendation for a repository at Yucca Mountain, NV. On \nApril 8, 2002, the State of Nevada exercised its authority under the \nlaw to disapprove the site. As a result of this State disapproval, the \nsite may be approved only if a joint resolution of repository siting \napproval, which we are now considering, becomes law.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act also establishes an expedited procedure \nfor congressional consideration of the Yucca resolution. The purpose of \nan expedited procedure is to facilitate the ability of Congress to \ndispose of the matter specified in a timely and definitive way. To this \nend, it establishes a means for Congress to take up, and complete \naction on, the resolution of approval or disapproval within a limited \nperiod of time. I am concerned that we are taking this action today and \nwe are still several years away from a final siting decision on Yucca. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission is still several years away from \nissuing a construction license for Yucca, there is no transportation \nplan, and the transportation containers to be used for waste shipments \nto a permanent storage site have also not been approved by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. Thus, while Yucca may be the right site, this is \nthe wrong time to have Congress ``approve'' the site while so many \nregulatory questions are yet unanswered.\n  I have always felt that we should be certain that Yucca is the final \nsite before we proceed with final Congressional approval. For those of \nus who represent states that are grappling with nuclear waste storage \nquestions, the short time frame mandated in law for the consideration \nof this resolution has made it extremely difficult to analyze its full \neffects on behalf of our constituents. The issues raised by this \nresolution are serious policy issues. The Bush Administration knows the \nresolution approval process is designated by law and has statutorily \ndefined deadlines for Congressional consideration. The Administration \nshould not have jumped the gun and set the clock in motion while there \nis still a possibility that Yucca might not receive final siting \napproval in the regulatory process.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have consistently said that I would \nprefer that once nuclear waste leaves the State, it leaves permanently. \nWisconsinites want nuclear waste removed from our State and stored in a \npermanent geologic repository out of State so that it has no chance of \ncoming back to Wisconsin. I opposed nuclear waste legislation in the \nlast Congress that sought to build large scale interim storage \nfacilities before the permanent storage site was ready and would have \njeopardized consideration of the permanent site. This resolution \ncommits the Federal Government, at least for the near term, to build \none such large scale permanent site.\n  I have heard concerns, however, from some constituents that this \nresolution to build at Yucca makes Wisconsin more likely to be the next \npermanent geologic storage site. I am concerned that Yucca, as \ncurrently authorized, will not be of sufficient size to take all of \nWisconsin's waste. In previous Congresses, though I did not ultimately \nsupport interim storage legislation for other reasons, I supported \nprovisions in interim storage bills to expand the size and capacity of \nthe Yucca site. At best, when Yucca is opened, it will leave nearly a \nquarter of the waste currently in Wisconsin still sitting at our \nplants. Moreover, if our nuclear plants in Southeast Wisconsin re-fuel \nin the next few years, the Yucca site is not currently expected to take \nany new waste.\n  Yucca's size is an important issue for Wisconsin because Congress is \nrequired under law to approve the study and construction of a second \nwaste site, if one is needed. This resolution does nothing to change \nthat provision of law, and it remains unclear whether the Department of \nEnergy would look again at Wisconsin or the other sites considered in \nthe 1970s and 1980s. If it needed more storage capacity, the Department \nof Energy could ask Congress to expand Yucca's size or recommend \nanother alternative geologic site. As a Wisconsin Senator, I have \nserious concerns regarding the construction of a geologic storage site \nin Wisconsin. In the past I have opposed legislation opening up the \npossibility of a second site, and would express those concerns strongly \nin any discussion of a second permanent location.\n  One of my main concerns has always been the safety and security of \nshipping nuclear materials from their current locations to a permanent \ngeologic storage site outside of the State. Obviously, there is a risk \nthat, during the transportation, accidents may occur. While many have \nsuggested that waste has been shipped safely across the country during \nthe history of nuclear power in this country, there has never been a \ncoordinated efforts to ship waste to a centralized storage location. \nThe opening of Yucca Mountain would initiate an unprecedented shipping \nprogram. I am concerned that the Final Environmental Impact Statement \nfor Yucca Mountain now includes barge transport on the Great Lakes and \nextensive truck transport on highways as potential transportation \nroutes in addition to rail transport.\n  This resolution does not enhance our transportation safety, and our \ncurrent transportation regulatory program must be strengthened. In \nfact, I believe that additional legislation may be needed to address a \nnumber of transportation issues. I still feel that the Senate must act \nin the near term to ensure that state and local governments have the \nfinancial and equipment resources they need to respond to accidents and \nprotect public safety. Congress must insist on a comprehensive safety \nprogram for nuclear waste transportation. We must require the waste \ncontainment casks to be tested to ensure they could withstand intense \nfires, high-speed collisions and other threats that may occur during \ntransport. It is also essential that states be consulted on the \nselection of transportation routes and are given longer advance \nnotification of waste shipments. Other measures that need to be \naddressed include banning both open water and inland waterway shipments \nof nuclear waste, requiring dedicated means of shipping, and \nestablishing a minimum number of armed escorts to accompany each \nnuclear waste convoy.\n  In conclusion, I cannot support this proceeding to this legislation \nwhich purports to provide an interim fix to the country's nuclear waste \nproblem. I realize that this action is not the final say on Yucca \nMountain and that we have many more steps to go before Yucca is built. \nBut this site cannot serve its national purpose if we cannot get the \nwaste there safely or if it is too small to hold the waste. We should \nhave addressed these important considerations before proceeding to this \nresolution.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am supporting the Yucca Mountain \nResolution today because we need to take the next step in resolving the \nproblem of nuclear waste in this country. It makes more sense to store \nthe Nation's high-level nuclear waste in a single place than it does to \nleave it at 131 sites spread all around the country, many close to \nsignificant population centers\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\nand all located on bodies of water, including the Great Lakes and major \nriver systems. I do not feel that it is environmentally responsible to \nallow spent nuclear fuel to sit indefinitely in temporary facilities on \nthe shores of the Great Lakes. We set up a procedure 20 years ago to \ndeal with this problem, and we should use it.\n  I have heard from citizens all over Michigan on both sides of this \nissue. The Michigan Municipal League, the Michigan House of \nRepresentatives, and over 75 counties and communities have contacted me \nto express their support for the effort to establish a permanent \nrepository at Yucca Mountain. This resolution will permit the \nDepartment of Energy to submit an application to the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission so that the Commission can determine whether established \nregulatory requirements for the protection of public health, safety and \nthe environment have been satisfied. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act, \nwhich was passed 20 years ago, did not leave it up to Congress to \ndecide whether or not Yucca Mountain is a suitable location for our \nnuclear waste. Rather, it left this decision up to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. If this resolution is approved, a license \napplication will be submitted by the Department of Energy for Yucca \nMountain and over the next several years, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission will go through all of the scientific and environmental data \nand look at the design of the repository to make sure that it can meet \nenvironmental and safety standards. This will be done by scientists and \ntechnical experts.\n  I share the concerns of many people regarding the storage and \nshipment of nuclear waste. Terrorism and transportation issues need to \nbe thoroughly addressed in the licensing process. Transportation plans \nwill be developed in a staged process over time and all plans will go \npublic with opportunities for input from the States and local \ncommunities. The actual transportation routes are a long way from being \ndetermined. Further, the Department of Energy assures us that there are \nno plans to use barges to transport waste, and I will oppose any effort \nto do so.\n  Since 1983, the people of Michigan have committed more than $400 \nmillion to the Nuclear Waste Fund for environmental protection that \nthey have not received. The Palisades nuclear power plant near South \nHaven has a total of 432 spent fuel assemblies stored in 18 dry casks \nlocated on site. An additional 649 spent fuel assemblies remain in the \nspent fuel pool and will ultimately be transferred to dry casks. The \nBig Rock Point nuclear plant near Charlevoix retains all of its spent \nfuel in a pool inside the containment building. The plant is \npermanently shut down and is in the process of being decommissioned. \nBeginning early next year, the plant's 441 spent fuel bundles will be \nloaded into 7 dry casks and stored on site. These casks are designed to \nbe an interim measure. They are not a permanent solution. Each nuclear \nplant site in the U.S. has become a de facto spent fuel storage \nfacility. It would be more efficient and more secure to move all of the \nspent fuel to one central facility where it can be safely stored \nindefinitely. Further, in the case of Big Rock Point located near \nCharlevoix, the plant and equipment will be completely removed from the \nproperty within the next few years. All that will remain will be the \nspent fuel, sitting on a large concrete pad about one-half mile from \nthe lake. Re-use of the property cannot be accommodated until the spent \nfuel is removed.\n  Finally, a permanent repository is also important to support the \ncleanup of contamination and waste generated by the cold war production \nof nuclear weapons and materials for these weapons. Currently the \nDepartment of Energy is treating high level waste materials, \nstabilizing them and getting then into other safe configurations so \nthat the waste can ultimately be shipped to a permanent repository. \nMoving the treated and stabilized waste is particularly key to the \ncleanup of sites such as the Savannah River Site in South Carolina and \nthe Hanford Site in Richland, WA.\n  If this resolution does not become law, the only alternative for \ngetting waste out of these many temporary storage sites into a \npermanent site will be terminated, which would move us in the wrong \ndirection. Leaving the nuclear waste at temporary sites and leaving \nthis decision to future generations is not the responsible thing to do \nand is not a solution to this problem.\n  In supporting this resolution, I am supporting an open and rigorous \nprocess for answering the concerns raised by so many. Only through this \nprocess will we be able to protect the health of the people and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, since my first days in the U.S. Senate, I \nhave expressed strong concerns about nuclear power. The claims made in \nthe 1970s that nuclear power was going to bring our country cheap, \nreliable and clean energy have turned out--as many warned at the time--\nto be far from the truth. While electricity from nuclear power has been \nreliable, it is neither cheap nor clean. The waste from these plants is \nan enormous and undisputed economic liability for the Nation, and it is \nfar from environmentally clean.\n  After all these years of coasting on these false promises about \nnuclear power, the bill has come due. Today we have 29 years of nuclear \nwaste in Vermont in the form of spent fuel in temporary storage on the \nbanks of the Connecticut River, and we cannot ignore that it needs to \nbe managed. Part of that management, especially since September 11 and \nall of our heightened security since then, is to better secure on-site \nwaste until it can be transported to a safer location. And part of that \nmanagement is to create that safer location, officially designating \nYucca Mountain as the single, high-security site for the bulk of \nnuclear waste that is now dispersed across our country.\n  While I know that some waste will always be located on-site at \noperating nuclear plants, we must locate the bulk of the waste at a \nsingle, secure site. Governor Dean and the Vermont Public Service \nDepartment have consistently called on me to support the repository, \nand today I again respect the wishes and long-term interests of my \nState.\n  The vote in the Senate today was about establishing a single national \nrepository for tons of hazardous nuclear waste. I voted in favor. But \nthe question of how nuclear material is safely transported to the Yucca \nMountain site brings up a new set of difficult decisions that Congress \nhas yet to face. For the past several months, I have expressed my \nstrong concerns about prematurely transporting nuclear waste across the \nNation without a plan that addresses growing concerns of State \ngovernments and local communities.\n  Especially in light of fears after September 11, nuclear waste \ntransportation concerns need to be discussed, debated and addressed by \nour Nation's leaders. Congress has worked with the administration to \nimprove security at airports, border crossings and public buildings. \nYet throughout this Yucca Mountain debate, the Bush administration has \nfailed to fully inform Congress about security improvements envisioned \nfor shipping nuclear waste. It has failed to respond to repeated \nquestions from the American people and their local communities, and \nthat is unacceptable.\n  Vermonters, in the tradition that has so distinguished our State, \nhave actively studied the issues involved in the Yucca decision. Many \nhave shared their views and suggestions with me, on both sides of this \nquestion, and I deeply appreciate their counsel. The approval of Yucca \nas a repository is one issue that has taken years for Congress to \ndebate and address. This vote does not end the federal government's \nobligation, by any means. I believe the administration must answer the \nconcerns raised by many Americans in many States about nuclear waste \ntransportation security before any material moves across the country \nand through hundreds of large cities and small towns. Until then--and \nuntil the Yucca Mountain site is truly operational--we must focus our \nenergy on ensuring that all nuclear waste is secured in the safest, \nstrongest on-site storage facilities possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. The \nSenator from Idaho I think would require some 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the Senator from Idaho \nspoke to me and indicated he would like to go now. Senator Ensign and I \nhave to be\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nhere, and you have to be here. He doesn't have to be here all the time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sure he is relieved to hear that, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you.\n  I thank my colleague for allowing me some additional time to visit \nwith you about what is probably one of the most important environmental \nvotes we will have this session in both the short-term and the long-\nterm perspective of good government policy dealing with the waste \nstream of our nuclear era and hopefully dealing with it in a way that \nallows us to move forward to new reactor design.\n  Ultimately, ensuring America it will continue to have a nuclear \nindustry that will provide the quality of electrical power on which our \ncountry will so depend in an environmentally sound way is really an \nunderlying premise of this debate.\n  Before I discuss that a little more, I thought I would add to the \nRecord an interesting fact about precedent. I know my colleague from \nNevada is concerned about that as it relates to procedural activity on \nthe floor and what this motion to proceed may or may not mean.\n  As you know, the comment was made that if anyone other than a \nmajority leader were to make a motion to proceed, the Senate would be \nseriously harmed. Let me give you a small excerpt of history.\n  On July 8, 1957, Senator Knowland of California, the Republican \nminority leader of the Senate, rose and made the motion to proceed to \nthe consideration of H.R. 6127, which was being blocked by the majority \nand the majority leader.\n  On July 16, 1957, after a week of debate on just that issue, the \nSenate voted 71 to 18 to take up the legislation. In other words, they \nvoted on a motion to proceed proposed by the Republican minority \nleader.\n  This legislation was the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The majority \nleader was the then-Senator Lyndon Johnson. And he survived the assault \non his leadership very well. I think history will certainly attest to \nthat. The Senate itself has also survived very well.\n  But what we got through that fight was probably one of the most \ncritical pieces of legislation of a generation if not in the history of \nthis country; and that was the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n  The procedures we are following and that set forth in the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act are a part of the Senate rules. By the term of the \nstatute, those procedures could be amended in the same fashion as any \nother rule.\n  For 20 years, no one has complained about the procedures developed by \nSenators Jackson, Johnston, Proxmire, and McClure, and others, and \neventually put forward by Congressman Joe Moakley, the chairman of the \nHouse Committee on Rules.\n  No damage was done to the Senate in 1957, and it was that precedent \nthat found its way into the 1982 act. Failure to not proceed to and not \napprove the resolution will not, obviously, in my opinion, advance the \nissue at hand.\n  Having said that, I ask unanimous consent that the Record of July 8, \n1957, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [Excerpt from the Record of July 8, 1957]\n\n                              Civil Rights\n\n       Mr. Knowland. Mr. President, the motion I am about to make \n     is to enable the Senate of the United States to perform its \n     legislative function to consider, debate, and vote upon such \n     amendments as may be offered and upon H.R. 6127, otherwise \n     known as the civil-rights bill.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       I hope that within this week the Senate of the United \n     States will be allowed to vote on the motion to proceed to \n     the consideration of this important bill.\n       I feel certain that the Members of this body are both \n     reasonable and fair. If the opponents of the proposed \n     legislation will argue the merits of their case on the bill \n     itself and on the amendments when the bill is before the \n     Senate, they will find that we who favor the Senate's \n     functioning as a legislative body will not be unfair in our \n     judgments or unreasonable in our actions.\n       The mere fact that a majority may favor bringing this bill \n     up for consideration will not cause us to depart from a \n     procedure of parliamentary conduct that we would consider \n     fair and equitable if applied to us if we were in the \n     minority on this or any similar measure.\n       Again I appeal to my colleagues to permit the Senate as a \n     part of a coordinate branch of the Government of the United \n     States, to function under section 1, article I of the \n     Constitution, which reads as follows:\n       ``All legislative power herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.''\n       Mr. President, I move that the Senate now proceed to the \n     consideration of Calendar No. 485, H.R. 6127.\n       The President pro tempore. The bill will be stated by title \n     for the information of the Senate.\n       The Chief Clerk. A bill to provide means of further \n     securing and protecting the civil rights of persons within \n     the jurisdiction of the United States.\n       The President pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to \n     the motion of the Senator from California.\n       Mr. Douglas. Mr. President, what the Senator from \n     California has moved is merely that the Senate proceed to \n     consider the civil rights bill. He is not, at this time, \n     moving its passage. He is simply trying to bring the issue up \n     before the Senate, so that we may then have the chance to \n     discuss and to vote on it.\n       If the motion of the Senator from California prevails, \n     then, and only then, will it be germane for us to debate the \n     merits of the bill itself and to consider such amendments as \n     may be proposed. But for the present, all that is before us \n     is that we take a prior step and clear the decks so that we \n     can thereafter consider the all-important question of civil \n     rights.\n       This very simple parliamentary fact creates two guides for \n     action. First, that to filibuster against such a preliminary \n     step as deciding that we will later consider the bill would \n     be a purely negative and obstructive act. The second \n     consequence is equally clear. Until this motion is adopted, \n     it is inappropriate and premature to discuss at any length \n     either the merits of the bill or to consider any amendments \n     thereto. All this will properly come later. But for the \n     moment, all we are contending for is the right of the Senate \n     to take the earlier step, which is logically prior to the \n     discussion of amendments.\n       Let this immediate issue be crystal clear, and let it be \n     not confused by a deluge of words and a multitude of false \n     leads. It should not need any argument on our part.\n       Since the motives of those who are supporting this proposed \n     legislation have, however, been called into question, it may \n     be proper if we briefly restate our purpose. What we are \n     trying to do is to make effective in actual life the \n     constitutional rights of all citizens--regardless of race and \n     color--primarily the right to vote. As we all know, this \n     right is guaranteed by the 15th amendment in the following \n     words:\n       ``The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall \n     not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any \n     State on account of race, color, or previous condition of \n     servitude.\n       ``The Congress shall have the power to enforce this article \n     by appropriate legislation.''\n       Not only does Congress have the power, but it also has the \n     duty to protect this right to vote against interference by \n     State officials under not only the 15th but also the ``equal \n     protection of the laws'' clause of the 14th amendment.\n       Furthermore, the Supreme Court has held (U.S. v. Classic \n     (313 U.S. 299)) that this right to vote in Federal elections \n     is also guaranteed by article I, section 2 of the \n     Constitution, and can be protected by the Federal Government \n     against infringement by individuals as well as by State or \n     local bodies.\n       All of us know--and this knowledge is supported by \n     statistics and press accounts--that the right to vote is \n     denied to vast numbers of Negroes, particularly in those \n     areas where they are found in large numbers, namely the \n     Southern States. Frequently, this is done by legal and \n     procedural subterfuge, often by social pressure, sometimes by \n     economic pressure, and--upon occasion--by outright coercion. \n     The net effect of all these methods is the practical \n     disenfranchisement of the vast proportion of potential Negro \n     voters of the South.\n       We believe this is to be a denial not only of \n     constitutional rights, but also of the principles of true \n     religion and of the ideals upon which our Republic was \n     founded. We seek to realize those ideals not by criminal \n     prosecutions after the fact, but by the preventive use of \n     injunctions to prevent such abuses from occurring. All that \n     is asked is that officials and citizens should conform to the \n     law and to the Constitution. If this is done, nothing else \n     need follow, since our aim is prevention, not punishment.\n       We are concentrating our efforts upon making the right to \n     vote effective, because if this right is guaranteed then many \n     other abuses which are now practices upon the disenfranchised \n     will be self-correcting.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Mr. Dirksen.

Mr. President, I move that the Senate \n     reconsider the vote by which the motion was agreed to.\n       Mr. Knowland. Mr. President, I move to lay that motion on \n     the table.\n       The Vice President. The question is on agreeing to the \n     motion of the Senator from California [Mr. Knowland].\n       The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me also talk about one other issue that we discussed \nwhen we talk about the capacity of Yucca Mountain and, therefore, that \nthere will always be waste out there somewhere in these temporary \nrepositories at these nuclear reactors generating our commercial power.\n  Yes, there will be temporary storage for periods of cooling \npretransportation. There would be anyway under any circumstance. But \nwhat we are talking about--and the Senator from Nevada showed a dip--is \nthat you can just double the numbers at each one of those, if you want. \nAnd doubling the numbers, in my opinion, does have a risk factor, \ncertainly a management factor.\n  What is most important is that many of these temporary repositories \nwere licensed under State authority for a certain volume. To exceed \nthat means you have to go back to the same State authority that was \ngranted 15 or 20 years ago, versus today, and the politics have changed \na great deal, and we know that, because those States were led to \nbelieve that the Federal Government would react responsibly in building \na permanent repository and the temporary facility would be just that--\nit would not become a permanent facility. Therefore, it would be a \npoint to cool and a point to transfer. That is what those temporary \nrepositories were always intended to be.\n  So this really was the hand-in-glove scenario. Do not suggest that \none goes without the other at all because they were licensed not for \npermanency but for temporary status while the Federal Government moved \nthrough that time of establishing a permanent repository.\n  In that context, when we talk about the 70,000 ton cap at Yucca \nMountain as a statutory limitation, it may be statutory but it is not \nphysical. We do not know what the physical capability of Yucca Mountain \nbeyond 70,000 tons would be. It could be increased over time 30 years \nout if, in fact, all of the geology and everything else met the \nstandards that the scientists, through the licensing process, had \nestablished.\n  Twenty years from now, 30 years from now, I will not be here. I doubt \nthat the junior Senator from Nevada will be here. But on another day \nand in another place, and if that science meets those standards, and it \nis strong and stable, and the world's perspective has shifted, then, \nremember, we are dealing with a statutory cap, not a physical \nlimitation, as it relates to Yucca Mountain.\n  The reason the statutory cap was put in place originally was because \nwe were looking at other repository locations in Vermont, in Washington \nState, and other places at the time. That is why there was a cap put in \nplace.\n  I know Senators Cantwell and Jeffords and Wellstone have talked about \nthe limitations and, therefore, the argument that temporary \nrepositories would still have material in them. Remember, of course, \nany of us who legislate know that a statutory cap is one that could be \nchanged if the politics and/or the science would argue a change were \nthere to do so. So let us not, in any way, fall prey to that argument \nof limitation.\n  In that context, let me suggest that limitation is, in part, tied to \nthe geology of Yucca Mountain. I cannot tell you that I was there at \nthe beginning, but I was there during the legislative time when we were \nlooking at a variety of locations for repositories. I had examined them \nall as a legislator. I read all of the preliminary geologic surveys.\n  It was determined at that time, in the mid-1980s, that Yucca Mountain \nwas, by far, the site that appeared to be the most desirable other \nthan, if you will, the large granite deposits in Vermont.\n\n  Granite has a unique shielding capability, and it is possible to \nassume that you could put repositories deep into the granite of Vermont \nand it would be an ideal situation. But our country did not go there. \nOur country decided not to have multiple repositories, but a single \none, largely because of the politics of it.\n  Governor Guinn, in his arguments of vetoing it, suggested that Yucca \nMountain is unsuitable for a permanent repository because it is at the \ncenter of volcanic activity, earthquake vault zones, and rapid ground \nwater flow. In other words, that is the geology of the mountain, as \nspoken to by the Governor of Nevada.\n  Secretary Abraham has asserted Yucca Mountain is geologically stable \nand experiences little ground water flow or rainfall.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey agrees, stating that the arid climate and \nlow probability of repository-piercing earthquakes or volcanic activity \nsupport the recommendation of Yucca Mountain.\n  The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board also concurred, stating:\n\n       No individual technical or scientific factor has been \n     identified that would automatically eliminate Yucca Mountain \n     from consideration at this point.\n\n  That is a quote directly from the report by the technical review \ngroup.\n  Based on these factors, the Energy Committee, on which I serve, \nexamined it and determined that it was fair that we bring this issue to \nthe floor in the form of a resolution and allow ourselves to go to the \nnext step.\n  And oh, by the way, the U.S. Geological Survey agrees with us. The \nGovernor asserted that the geology of Yucca Mountain is so bad that DOE \nhas given up on geologic isolation of waste in favor of manmade \nbarriers. In other words, the original concept was to create a facility \nso deep in the Earth that the Earth itself would create the natural \nbarriers, and that you would not need to build a barrier within a \nbarrier, in other words, a manmade barrier.\n  Secretary Abraham points out that a balance of both natural and \nengineered barriers has always been planned for the repository.\n  Existing geologic barriers are likely sufficient to prevent waste \nfrom reaching ground water, but the engineered barriers provide \nadditional protection.\n  Do you remember what we did a couple years ago? Because we wanted to \nmake sure we did it right, because we wanted to address the arguments \nthat were being made, we put EPA into the mix and we extended the idea \nof engineering out into the future a facility that would withstand \n10,000 years of any kind of threat. That is when the barrier within the \nbarrier concept really began to develop.\n\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the Secretary to consider \nengineered barriers when making this recommendation to the President.\n  Long before the Governor got into the argument, and long before the \nGovernor tried to find arguments that would fit his political need, we \nhad already thought of that. It was in the 1982 act. The Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission, not the committee or the Senate, must ultimately \ndecide if the barriers are sufficient to prevent the seepage of \nradionuclides. The committee agreed with Secretary Abraham's conclusion \nthat the consideration of man-made barriers is appropriate.\n  The Governor claims that DOE's computer models are unable to \nadequately predict emission rates for\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\n10,000 years. The NRC will rely on these models for licensing, as \nabsolute proof of compliance with EPA radiation protection standards is \nnot obtainable. DOE must be able to demonstrate compliance with EPA's \nstandards for the 10,000-year cycle.\n  The committee is concerned that DOE models are not adequate. The \nNuclear Waste Technical Review Board has expressed similar concerns but \nhas given guidance to DOE on improving the quality of its assessments.\n  In other words, what we are talking about and what the Secretary made \nhis recommendations on was the science far enough along to get us to \nthe point of moving it the next step. The science is not cooked. It is \nnot done. It is not over. It is evolving.\n  What I am suggesting is that as we question the science, the science \nwe now have is adequate to arrive at reasonable comfort under all of \nthe best engineered scenarios to allow the safety that is required. But \nfor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and others to require additional \nscience is possible.\n  The committee expects DOE to improve its computer models but does not \nbelieve that existing weaknesses are sufficient to stop the \nconsideration. In other words, we are not even satisfied with the work \nthat has been done, although it is clear--and I must say for the Record \nthat the work that has been done is adequate, clearly adequate to get \nus to this point of consideration. If we can make the best better, and \nif in that we create the kind of both political and real comfort that \nthe State of Nevada needs, then we ought to do that. That is our \nresponsible role as public policymakers.\n  Let me conclude with the Governor's objection on what he calls the \ncompleteness of the design. The Governor notes that DOE has not \ncompleted the design of Yucca Mountain and cites 293 unresolved \ntechnical issues. Because of these, the DOE will be unable to submit a \nlicense application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission until 2004, \nviolating a statutory requirement to file an application within 90 days \nof congressional approval of the President's recommendation. That has \nbeen the argument placed by some.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act requires the Secretary to determine site \nsuitability before making a recommendation to the President. It does \nnot require him to complete the repository design or satisfy every \nobligation for license application. In other words, the step required \nby law was met, determining site suitability. It is from that process \nwithin the law that moves us to where we are today.\n  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is confident that the DOE can \nsupply all necessary information for license review. The 293 unresolved \nissues are commitments from the DOE to supply additional information. \nForty-one of these issues have already been completed, reducing the \nnumber to 252.\n\n  The Yucca Mountain project is already 12 years behind schedule. The \nDOE's inability to file an application within 90 days is unfortunate \nbut not a violation of the statute. The provision is a directory, and \nnot a mandatory requirement.\n  In other words, like the science, we have met the standards but we \nwant to achieve a greater level.\n  In that regard, as it relates to the law and as it relates to an \napplication to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, we have met \nsuitability as we now work to address the other issues that will become \na part of the licensing process of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alaska. We both have limited amounts of time to give, but we \ndecided the Senator from Nevada would be given 15 minutes; following \nthat the Senator from Alaska would be recognized to use up whatever \namount of his 25 minutes he wished; and following that I will speak \nand/or the majority leader. That should take all of our time.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, Nevada's slogan is ``battle born.'' It is \non our State flag. It reflects the firmness of purpose and the \nwillingness to fight for what is right that is so much a part of what \ncharacterizes Nevada. This is as true today as it was when our State \nentered the Union during the Civil War.\n  When it comes to Yucca Mountain, we intend to fight. Nevada's other \nmotto is ``all for our country.'' This is proudly displayed on our \nState seal. Nevadans have always been for our country. The ore taken \nfrom Nevada's Comstock load financed the means by which we preserved \nthe Union during the Civil War, and Nevada has hosted aboveground \nnuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site, the result being a weapon of \nsuch mass destruction that it swiftly brought the end to the World War \nII conflict.\n  Too many innocent people in Nevada and Utah died from horrible \ncancer-related disease from the radiation fallout. So when it comes to \nour national defense, Nevadans have always proudly stood tall for our \ncountry.\n  Yucca Mountain is not needed for our defense and goes way beyond \npatriotic duty.\n  I want to address the transportation issue. These are some charts. \nOnce again, because we don't know the exact transportation routes, \nthese are the charts from the Department of Energy's final \nenvironmental impact statement. So it is all we have to go on.\n  The darker lines--it is probably very difficult to see the real light \nred lines which are the rail--are the highways. This happens to be in \nIllinois. Chicago is up here. These are all the various transportation \nroutes. Down here is St. Louis--all the various transportation routes \nthrough this part of the country upon which nuclear waste could and \nprobably will travel. This happens to be the State of California. My \nState is here, but all of these are various transportation routes going \nthrough major cities--Los Angeles, Oakland, Sacramento.\n  This happens to be Colorado, Denver, a major metropolitan area here \nas well.\n  This is Utah where we have Salt Lake City. We see the highways and \nthe railroads running through Salt Lake City.\n  This is Florida, with a huge amount of population today, a very \npopulated State--going through Miami, near Orlando and through Orlando, \nwith the train routes through Jacksonville, Tallahassee.\n  This is in Georgia--going through obviously their major population \ncenter in Atlanta.\n  This is a summary of the country. These are just the highways across \nthe country. We can see that so much of the country and so many \npopulation areas of the country are going to have nuclear waste \ntransported through them. Once again, we don't know the exact routes, \nbut these are the best routes we have to go on.\n  The Department of Energy and the nuclear industry wants Americans to \nbelieve that taking tens of thousands of tons of dangerous radioactive \nwaste, removing it from reactor sites around the country, and putting \nit on trains and trucks and barges now and moving it through cities and \ntowns and waterways across America so it can be buried on an earthquake \nfault line in southern Nevada is a good idea. It is not.\n  According to the Department of Energy, 50,000 to 100,000 truck \nshipments, 10,000 to 20,000 rail shipments, and 1,600 to 3,000 barge \nshipments would be required to transport high-level nuclear waste to \nYucca Mountain.\n  The Government is trying to convince us that this project is going to \nbe safe; as a matter of fact, they say more than safe. The Government \nwould have us believe that getting this waste to Yucca Mountain is the \nkey to keeping our children safe from radioactive waste that is going \nto be dangerous for tens of thousands of years.\n  Anyone who believes the argument that this dangerous waste can be \ntransported without incident only needs to look at what happened last \nJuly in the Baltimore Tunnel when a CSX freight train carrying \nhazardous waste derailed and set off fires that burned for days. The \ncasks have been studied at about 1,475 degrees using computer \nmodeling--casks similar to that. The Baltimore Tunnel fire burned at \n1,500 degrees for days, which is way beyond what these casks have been \nput through--at least in the laboratories. Imagine a similar incident \nto that which happened in Baltimore, except this time if it is \nradioactive waste.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  Forget an accident. What about a terrorist attack? People have talked \ntoday about the record of shipping nuclear waste across Europe and the \nUnited States. But post-September 11, we are in a different world. We \nneed to think about terrorism and the ways and uses and possible \nattacks on these nuclear canisters as they are traveling across our \ncountry. Hijacking or blowing up a truck containing nuclear waste would \nbe an easy way to devastate one of our metropolitan areas.\n  What we have on the chart here is difficult to see because it is \ntaken off of VHS footage. This is a canister that is very similar. This \nis a newer company using their best technology trying to compete with \nthe currently used canisters. This is a TOW missile fired down through \nthere, and you can see that it penetrates it or would breach one of \nthese nuclear waste canisters that are going to be shipped across major \nmetropolitan areas in the United States.\n  Indeed, the most senior al-Qaida leader in U.S. custody told \ninterrogators that al-Qaida is seeking to explode a ``dirty'' bomb in \nthe United States. Jose Padilla was arrested in Chicago after \nintelligence indicated that he was participating in a plot to detonate \na ``dirty'' bomb in the United States. But al-Qaida doesn't need to buy \nnuclear material to smuggle a ``dirty'' bomb into our country. Congress \nis doing the hard work for them.\n  Every truckload of nuclear waste going to Yucca Mountain on our \nhighways through our towns and cities is a potential ``dirty'' bomb. \nAll the terrorists have to do is breach one of these canisters on one \nof the trucks, trains, or barges, as the Senator from Michigan talked \nabout, in the Great Lakes, and we will witness another severe act of \nterrorism.\n  So let's call this legislation what it is and what it is not: This is \nnot the Nuclear Waste Disposal Act. It is the ``terrorism facilitation \nact,'' and it needs to be defeated. Nuclear powerplant sites are among \nthe most secure commercial facilities in the country. Following the \nevents of September 11, they are being made even more secure, and there \nare even proposals for military protection at these sites.\n  Modest infrastructure improvements can further increase the level of \nprotection against any conceivable terrorist threat. Nuclear waste is \nsafe when stored onsite in casks surrounded by concrete. But it is \nanother story when these casks are going to be traveling by homes, \nschools, and churches. At this time, we cannot be sure they will \nsurvive real-world conditions. We may be able to develop the \ntechnology, but we don't have it today. So we should not have Yucca \nMountain go forward until we develop the technology.\n  As I have said earlier, the casks have not been tested in real \nfires--only with computer simulations, and not to the extent they need \nto be tested. I will repeat that because it is so important.\n  The computer simulation is for 30 minutes at 1,475 degrees \nFahrenheit. The temperature in the Baltimore Tunnel fire read 1,500 \ndegrees, and it burned for days. The NRC stated that it is doing a top-\nto-bottom review--partly because of September 11 and the Baltimore \nTunnel fire--to review the security requirements, including a review of \nthe transportation casks' vulnerabilities to terrorism. Let's make sure \nthese casks are properly tested before Congress votes on Yucca \nMountain.\n  I want to talk about the Government's big lie. Not only is the \nGovernment's plan dangerous for America, it also won't solve the \nproblem. The Government's big lie is that we Americans have a choice to \nhave one central nuclear waste storage site at Yucca Mountain or to \nhave waste stored at the reactor sites around America. We talked about \nit earlier today. That sounds as if it is an easy choice except that it \nis not true.\n  Even if, by some luck, waste is shipped safely across the country to \nYucca Mountain, there will continue to be nuclear waste stored at all \noperating reactor sites. You see, even if it were possible to \nimmediately and magically, as one of the Senators talked about today--\nlike our garbage is picked up, we simply, all at once, pick it up and \ntake it to the dump. It is not done that way with nuclear waste. There \nwill continue to be spent fuel stored at each and every operating \nreactor in the country. That is because nuclear waste is highly \nradioactive, thermally hot, and must be kept at reactor sites at water-\nfilled cooling ponds for at least 5 to 10 years. The only way spent \nfuel storage can be eliminated from a reactor location is to shut down \nthe reactor and wait many years to ship the material after that.\n  I don't think that option of closing down figures into the nuclear \nindustry's long-range plan. We will have 65,000 metric tons of \ncommercial nuclear waste by the time Yucca Mountain is scheduled to \nopen. We produce about 2,000 metric tons of nuclear waste per year. The \nDOE plans to ship about 3,000 tons. Just do the math. We won't get rid \nof the nuclear waste backlog in the country for nearly a century--even \nif, as somebody talked about, we expand Yucca Mountain, which would \nobviously be politically a very difficult thing to do--excuse me. Yucca \nMountain will be filled long before then--as we see on the chart, in \n2036.\n  I think it is important to understand this because the DOE and the \nSecretary of Energy have been saying that it is safer to have this fuel \nall shipped to one place. This is today. We have 45,000 tons of spent \nnuclear high-level radioactive waste around the country. In 2010, when \nYucca Mountain is scheduled to open, we will have 65,000 tons. If we \nstart shipping about 3,000 tons a year, by 2036, when Yucca Mountain is \nfull, we will still have virtually the same as what we have today. So \nwe really have not accomplished too much.\n  If we don't have Yucca Mountain, it will be way up, but there is not \na lot of difference. It is a management thing, not a security risk.\n  The other thing is after Yucca Mountain is full, we start producing \nmore of it, and we get out to 2056, we can see what happens. So Yucca \nMountain doesn't really solve the problems people say it is going to \nsolve.\n  Moving waste to Yucca Mountain will just create one additional large \nstorage facility. To do that, the cost will be tens of thousands of \nshipments of deadly radioactive waste on the Nation's highways and \nrailroads and waterways day after day, month after month. Obviously, it \nwill never end.\n  I want to talk briefly about the history of the process. This is \nreally Washington power politics. The reason I talk about this is \nbecause we are going to get to the cost of Yucca Mountain in a moment.\n  In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act gave the Energy Department \nuntil 1998 to open a permanent underground geological depository for \nhigh-level nuclear waste. At the time, they were studying several \nsites. But because of politics out of the States of Nevada, Washington, \nand Texas--Washington had the majority leader in the House, and Texas \nhad the Speaker of the House--Nevada ended up with the nuclear waste \n``queen of spades.''\n  The deal reached was not by a scientific determination of which \nlocation would be suitable. Basically, they just decided on politics \nthat Nevada would get this.\n  The site originally was for geology. They said: We are going to house \nthis waste underground, and it is going to protect us. Over the years, \nthey found that the geology would not protect us. So what they had to \ndo was build in manmade protections, and that drove the costs up \nsignificantly.\n  Prior to 1987 when they said they were going to study one site, the \noriginal cost estimate was $24 billion. In 1985 the cost estimate went \nto $27 billion, and in 1987 it was $38 billion. They were studying \nthree sites. They said: We cannot do that; we will just study one site.\n  Now they are studying one site. The cost in 1995 was $37 billion, in \n1998 the cost was $46 billion, and in 2001 the cost is $58 billion. \nThat is the equivalent of all 12 aircraft carriers for the United \nStates combined. As a matter of fact, that is more than in today's \ndollars the cost of the Panama Canal, the World Trade Center, and \nHoover Dam all combined.\n  That does not include building a rail site to Yucca Mountain which, \naccording to the DOE, is going to be needed. So this is a boondoggle, \nand we do not need to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. On the time of Senator Reid.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, according to the NRC Chairman, people have \nsaid: Do we have to do this right now? According to the NRC Chairman, \nwe do have the capacity to store these materials safely for decades to \ncome--NRC Chairman Richard Meserve.\n  There has been a lot made of one of the Senators talking about what \ndo we do with this waste if we do not transport it, and I wish to \nconclude my remarks by giving people an answer. If not Yucca Mountain, \nthen what?\n  Onsite dry cask storage is good for at least 100 years. We know that. \nThese canisters are safe for at least 100 years, according to the \nDepartment of Energy. It is about $4 billion to $5 billion to store it \nonsite, and that includes all of the costs associated with storing it \nonsite--$4 billion to $5 billion instead of $60 billion plus. It is \ngoing to be at least $60 billion, make no mistake about it.\n  Every year, we have been taking the cost up by over $10 billion in \nthe estimates. Where is the cost going to go from here? We know this \nsituation is going to be too expensive. What we need to do is keep the \nwaste onsite. It is a lot cheaper.\n  There is promising science. There is pyroprocessing. There is what is \ncalled accelerator technology transmutation. These are fancy scientific \nwords. The bottom line is they are modern recycling of nuclear waste or \npartially spent nuclear fuel rods. We are recycling everything we can \nin this country. We need to continue to invest in recycling technology.\n  For those who are supporters of nuclear power, as I am, recycling \nwill make nuclear power more viable in the future, I believe, because \nif we have solved the waste problem, instead of burying it in the \nground where it is too expensive and waste partially spent nuclear fuel \nrods, if we invest in recycling technology, we will have a permanent \nenergy supply for generation after generation of Americans.\n  If one believes in nuclear power, let's make it less costly and let's \ninvest in the recycling technology and keep it onsite without the risks \nof transportation.\n\n  I wish to make one other point before I close. The senior Senator \nfrom Idaho talked about 1957. We are talking about a procedural motion. \nHe talked about 1957 where somebody offered a motion to proceed, and I \nhave been saying all day we are violating Senate tradition today.\n  He said that in 1957, somebody in the minority offered a motion to \nproceed and that debate took a week. At the end of the week, that \nmotion to proceed actually was voted for by a vote of 70-something to \n28. While that vote is accurate, what he is inaccurate about is the \nmajority leader supported the vote. What we have said is no motion to \nproceed has ever come to the Senate floor successfully over the \nobjections of the majority leader, and that statement is still true, \neven with the 1957 precedent.\n  We think this still sets a very dangerous precedent on Senate \ntradition if this vote goes forward today.\n  Lastly, I wish to thank a few people in our State who have done a \nphenomenal job of fighting this fight for the people of the State of \nNevada and I believe for Americans in general. First, the senior \nSenator from Nevada, the assistant majority leader. No one has worked \nmore tirelessly on this issue than he has. His staff has done an \nincredible job, as has my staff. I am thankful for the yeoman work of \nour Gov. Kenny Guinn and other elected officials, both Republican and \nDemocrat, in our State who have tirelessly fought this issue.\n  If we lose this vote, I am committed to the belief that one day, \nyears from now, leaders will look back on what the Senate did today and \nsimply say: What were we thinking?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 26 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will take such time as I need.\n  Mr. President, it is fair to reflect on where we are. Today the \nSenate is going to decide whether the Secretary of Energy should be \nallowed to make an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for \nthe use of Yucca Mountain as a repository for spent nuclear fuel and \nhigh-level waste. That is the only issue before this body.\n  The Senate today is not--I repeat, is not--deciding whether science \nand engineering are sufficient for the Yucca Mountain site to be \noperated safely and in compliance with EPA and other agency \nregulations. That is really the job of the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission.\n  We have had a lot of discussion. Some of the discussion is associated \nwith fear. I have looked for a synonym for red herring. I do not know \nif fluorescent herring is as close as we are going to get. In any \nevent, we have to deal with this in a responsible manner.\n  Let me share with my colleagues what some of the public opinionmakers \nhave said. I quote from the New York Times. This is July 9, ``A \nCritical Vote on Nuclear Waste.'' It says:\n\n       Any Senator tempted to vote against the resolution must \n     recognize the severe consequences. A nay vote or a failure to \n     vote means that Yucca Mountain is effectively dead and the \n     nation must start anew to look for a disposal solution. A yes \n     vote means simply that the project can proceed to the next \n     step, a formal licensing application to the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, which will spend years analyzing all \n     aspects of the repository to see if it warrants a license to \n     operate.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this New York Times \narticle, ``A Critical Vote on Nuclear Waste,'' and a Chicago Tribune \narticle, ``Crossroads of Nuclear Waste Storage,'' dated July 9 both be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 9, 2002]\n\n                    A Critical Vote on Nuclear Waste\n\n       The Senate is facing a momentous vote this week that will \n     determine whether a plan to bury nuclear waste at Yucca \n     Mountain in Nevada moves to the next stage of regulatory \n     scrutiny or dies prematurely. Any legislative delay now will \n     be likely to terminate the project, and that must not be \n     allowed to happen. If Yucca is abandoned, the nation will be \n     right back where it was decades ago--with spent nuclear fuel \n     piling up at reactor sites around the country and no plan for \n     its permanent disposal.\n       In recent weeks the critics of Yucca Mountain have grown \n     increasingly alarmist in an effort to stampede any wavering \n     senators. They claim that Yucca has geological and technical \n     flaws that render it unsafe. But those are precisely the \n     issues that will be examined in excruciating detail by the \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission if a licensing application is \n     allowed to move forward. The critics also fret over the \n     possibility of catastrophic accidents while the fuel \n     transported from reactor sites to Nevada. But they seldom \n     mention that such shipments have gone on without incident in \n     this country and Europe for the past three decades--in \n     quantities that actually exceed the amount that would be \n     shipped to Yucca.\n       The Senate finds itself in this pivotal spot because the \n     statute that designated Yucca Mountain as the sole candidate \n     for a disposal site set up a tight timetable of necessary \n     approvals. The state of Nevada vetoed the project, as was its \n     right, thereby throwing the decision back to Congress. The \n     House has already voted, by a thumping margin, to go forward. \n     But unless the Senate also votes to override Nevada by late \n     this month, the designation of Yucca as the candidate \n     repository will expire.\n       Unfortunately, the Senate Democratic leadership is working \n     against the proposal. Harry Reid, the majority whip, who \n     hails from Nevada, is adamantly opposed to storage in his \n     state. Tom Daschle, the majority leader, opposes the project \n     and is refusing to schedule a Yucca Mountain vote. \n     Fortunately, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act allows any senator \n     to request that the Yucca resolution be brought to the floor \n     for time-limited debate and a vote, a step that Republicans \n     say they will take as early as this week, possibly even \n     today.\n       Any senator tempted to vote against the resolution must \n     recognize the severe consequences. A nay vote or a failure to \n     vote means that Yucca Mountain is effectively dead and the \n     nation must start anew to look for a disposal solution. A yes \n     vote means simply that the project can proceed to the next \n     step, a formal licensing application to the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission, which will spend years analyzing all \n     aspects of the repository to see if it warrants a license to \n     operate. Given the stakes, it would be irresponsible for the \n     Senate--most of whose members have little detailed knowledge \n     of the Yucca proposal--to decide this issue on the fly, \n     thereby blocking the detailed technical review that it \n     deserves.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n                [From the Chicago Tribune, July 9, 2002]\n\n                 A Crossroads in Nuclear Waste Storage\n\n                            (By Dick Durbin)\n\n       The advent of nuclear power more than 50 years ago brought \n     with it both great promise and great responsibility. Our \n     ability to harness the power of the atom has paid substantial \n     dividends for our society, but it has also left us with the \n     formidable challenge of safely storing the byproducts of \n     nuclear power generation. This is a challenge our nation must \n     meet so that future generations are not endangered by today's \n     nuclear waste.\n       Presently, all of the spent fuel from nuclear power plants \n     and research reactors throughout the country remains on-site \n     at each reactor. None of these facilities was designed to \n     safely store that waste on a permanent basis, and leaving \n     spent fuel in temporary storage around the nation poses both \n     a security threat and an environmental hazard.\n       Everyone agrees that we need to find a safe and permanent \n     way to store this material and such a storage site has been \n     proposed at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. I have been to Yucca \n     Mountain, which is located 90 miles from Las Vegas on federal \n     land at the remote Nevada nuclear test site. The waste would \n     be stored more than 600 feet underground but more than 500 \n     feet above the water table, sealed in steel containers placed \n     under a titanium shield. A security force at the Nevada test \n     site is in place to protect the area, and the airspace around \n     Yucca Mountain is already restricted.\n       When this issue has come before Congress in the past, I \n     have opposed efforts to move waste to a temporary facility at \n     Yucca Mountain before there was a scientific determination of \n     whether waste could be safely stored there on a permanent \n     basis. I also opposed earlier measures that would have \n     mandated dangerously low standards for environmental \n     protection at the site.\n       Recently, however, I have been encouraged by the fact that \n     the Environmental Protection Agency has successfully \n     established radiation and groundwater contamination standards \n     for the Yucca Mountain storage site. These standards were \n     derived from recommendations by experts at the national \n     academy of Sciences and were developed after extensive public \n     comment and scientific analysis. All of these standards \n     greatly exceed the standards debated by Congress in the two \n     previous bills I opposed.\n       No site will ever be perfect for the storage of high-level \n     nuclear waste. But I believe the studies, which have already \n     been conducted, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission review \n     still to come provide sufficient assurances that Yucca \n     Mountain is the most appropriate site available and should be \n     used as the permanent national nuclear waste repository. \n     Therefore, I have decided to support the Yucca Mountain \n     resolution, which would make that facility the national \n     nuclear waste repository.\n       I am still concerned, however, with the movement of \n     thousands of tons of nuclear waste across the country to \n     Nevada. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, Illinois \n     would rank seventh in truck shipments under what is called \n     the ``mostly truck scenario.'' The same Energy Department \n     analysis concludes that Illinois would rank sixth in rail \n     shipments in the ``mostly rail scenario.'' Although waste has \n     been shipped through Illinois and other states in the past, \n     approving Yucca Mountain would initiate the largest waste \n     shipping campaign in the history of our country--both in \n     terms of the number of shipments and the amount of miles \n     traveled for high-level nuclear waste.\n       Unless we scrutinize safety factors and security risks, the \n     large-scale transportation of radioactive materials has the \n     potential to cause a host of serious challenges to cities and \n     communities along shipping routes. This issue is all the more \n     important in light of the terrorist threats we are likely to \n     face in the years ahead.\n       In Illinois, nearly half of our electricity is generated \n     from nuclear power. Our state contains seven nuclear power \n     plants, two nuclear research reactors and more commercial \n     nuclear waste than any other state. In addition, we are home \n     to one of the busiest transportation corridors in the nation, \n     putting our state squarely at the intersection of the nuclear \n     crossroads. With the safety of Illinoisans at stake, finding \n     the safest way to move nuclear waste to a location where it \n     poses the least risk is imperative.\n       Congress must insist on a comprehensive safety program for \n     nuclear waste transportation. We must require the waste \n     containment casks to be tested to ensure they could withstand \n     intense fires, high-speed collisions and other threats that \n     may occur during transport. It is also essential that states \n     be consulted on the selection of transportation routes and \n     are given longer advance notification of waste shipments. \n     Other measures that need to be addressed include banning \n     inland waterway shipments of nuclear waste, requiring \n     dedicated trains and establishing a minimum number of armed \n     escorts to accompany each nuclear waste convoy.\n       We should move forward with making Yucca Mountain the \n     central repository for our nation's nuclear waste. But we \n     must not forget that the site can only serve its national \n     purpose if the waste is transported safely. Before shipments \n     to Yucca Mountain begin, we need to establish a \n     transportation plan to ensure the safety and security of the \n     communities that lie in the path of those shipments--and we \n     must begin that work today.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I will refer to a couple of other \narticles. A Seattle Times editorial, Sunday, June 2:\n\n       If the Senate does not follow the House lead, the Energy \n     Department must start over. The agency must look again at \n     other finalists--Deaf Smith County, Texas, or Washington's \n     own Hanford Nuclear Reservation.\n\n  I refer to the Oregonian, Saturday, June 8:\n\n       If Yucca Mountain is blocked, nuclear waste could sit \n     forever in temporary, poorly planned sites all across this \n     country, including the Trojan nuclear powerplant. Yucca \n     Mountain is clearly the best option available.\n\n  From the Washington Post, April 30:\n\n       Congress should override Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn's veto \n     and allow work on Yucca Mountain to proceed.\n       But while years of investigation have not answered all of \n     the questions, neither have they produced adequate reason to \n     stop the project in its tracks.\n\n  And April 21, the New York Times:\n\n       There is no question that the transportation issues will \n     need to be explored in great depth.\n       But the appropriate place for those issues to be addressed \n     is in a painstaking regulatory proceeding before the NRC.\n\n  Not before a rushed Congress debate.\n  So everyone understands, we are authorizing the licensing process in \nthe sense that the administration will now be able, if we prevail on \nthis vote, to proceed with a licensing process. That is all.\n  We had a lot of discussion, and I am inclined to think we have \nprobably spent 20 years or so moving this process along relative to the \ndisposition of the waste. People sometimes have different visions of \nwhat Yucca Mountain is all about.\n  This is a picture of Yucca Mountain. Yucca Mountain has environmental \nattributes that would contribute to the safe disposal of high-level \nwaste: Remote location with the nearest metropolitan area about 100 \nmiles away, high security because of the proximity to the Nevada Test \nSite and the Nellis Air Force range, arid climate, deep water table, \nisolated hydrologic basin without flow into rivers or oceans and \nmultiple natural barriers.\n  This is Yucca Mountain; this is the site of the tunnel. I have been \nthere. It is in existence. And $4 billion of taxpayers' money has been \nexpended.\n\n  It is important to know just what this location involves. This is a \npicture of the test site area. For the last 40 years, we have been \nusing this area as a test site for nuclear bombs and various nuclear \nweapons. It is an area that has levels of radioactivity associated with \nit. For all practical purposes, in spite of the fact we hate to admit \nwe do this, we put certain areas off limits. This is one because of the \nhigh levels of radioactivity, unexploded munitions, and so forth. Yucca \nMountain is included in this area.\n  While we have looked for other places, it is fair to say one of the \nconditions was this area had been set aside for a nuclear test site.\n  Now, another chart shows tests in other States. As we look at the \ndisposition, we should go back and look at events leading to the \nselection of Yucca Mountain for a study. There were nine potential \nsites. There was the Hanford site in Washington and Yucca Mountain in \nNevada. In Utah, there was Davis Canyon and Lavender Canyon. In Texas \nwas the Deaf Smith County site and the Swisher site and a couple of \nsites in Mississippi, sites in Texas. We made a cut. We cut from nine \nsites and left Hanford, we left Yucca Mountain, Davis Canyon, Texas and \nMississippi. Three sites were Presidentially approved: Washington, \nNevada, and Texas.\n  In 1986, there was one site left. It was selected. That was Yucca \nMountain. Congress passed the NWPA, as amended, mandating only the \nYucca Mountain site for the detailed site characterization.\n  This has been done. We have expended the money. We went through a \nprocess. If we do not take care of Yucca Mountain today, what are we \ngoing to do? Start this process all over. It will be Texas, Utah, \nWashington, Mississippi. We will go through this process--perhaps \nVermont. They have a lot of marble stabilization out there. The point \nis, we would be derelict to walk away from the obligation we have \ntoday.\n  The transportation systems we have heard so much about. This chart \nshows\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nthe existing transportation routes to WIPP, a low-level isolation pilot \nplant associated with the Livermore Laboratories and others in New \nMexico.\n  I have been there. It is in the salt caverns. You go down in the huge \ncaverns where they store this low-level waste. It is interesting to see \nthe routing, what States are affected and which are not. We move wastes \nfrom various laboratories. These are low-level transuranic wastes that \nmove across Highway No. 80 and so forth. Clearly, they go in one \nlocation.\n  For those arguing the merits of Missouri and waste going through \nMissouri, the waste leaves Missouri. I am not suggesting there is a \nfinal plan associated with it. This is where we have been moving the \nwaste so far. It is low-level waste. We do not know where the various \nagencies are going to make these decisions and those agencies--the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, and the \nDepartment of Transportation--will bear the responsibility of \ndetermining what routes are taken.\n  We have moved almost 3,000 shipments of spent fuel. This is high-\nlevel waste moved between 1964 and 2000. We moved them over 1.7 million \nmiles. We have had zero radiation releases. Low level to WIPP is 900 \nshipments, and almost 900,000 miles. We had 3,892 shipments and moved \nthem over 2.6 million miles with zero harmful radiation.\n  Now the importance of nuclear energy and a source of electricity: 51 \npercent is coal, natural gas is 16 percent, oil is 2.9 percent, hydro \nis 7.2 percent, miscellaneous is 2.2, nuclear is 20 percent.\n\n  There are those who would like to see the nuclear industry choke on \nits own waste and simply go away. That is an impractical reality. It \ndoes not flow. If we are talking about reducing emissions or talking \nabout global warming, clearly the nuclear industry in this country has \nto maintain its prominence. We have not had any new nuclear plants come \nonline in 20 years. Clearly, nuclear energy plays a major role. It is \nemission free. The problem is the problem we have in the Senate today, \nand that is addressing the disposal of the waste.\n  It is important to recognize where these plants are located: the \nState of Washington, California, Texas, and on to the east coast. \nClearly, there are a number of nuclear plants producing 20 percent of \nour electricity. This chart shows the States.\n  It is important to note the rationale that Congress developed to \naddress the disposal of this waste. That is those that use nuclear \npower would pay a special assessment into a fund that currently has \nabout $17 billion; $11 billion came from the ratepayer. The Federal \nGovernment takes that money and agrees to take the waste. They agreed \nin a contractual commitment in 1998 to take the waste. They did not \ntake the waste because they were not ready. They are in violation of a \ncontract. The litigation associated with this breach of the contractual \ncommitments is estimated to be somewhere between $40 and $70 billion. \nThat is a hit to the U.S. taxpayer.\n  The reality is that these ratepayers in Washington paid $98 million; \nin Arizona, $337 million; in Texas, $334 million; in South Carolina, \n$876 million; in Pennsylvania, $1 billion; Maine, $67 million. These \nare fees the ratepayers have paid to the Government to take the waste. \nWe have that obligation. The occupant of the chair is well versed in \ncontractual law. We have an obligation to perform if we enter into a \ncontract. We failed to do that.\n  The taxpayer bears the burden even though the ratepayers have paid to \nthe Federal Government under the terms of the contract. There you have \nthe responsibility associated with the issue: If this is a Government \nbailout, will this come to the Appropriations Committee for \nappropriations? No, the ratepayers have paid this amount.\n  Let's look at it State by State. Here is New York. New York is 23 \npercent dependent on nuclear energy; 18 percent coal; gas, 28 percent \nand so forth.\n  They have operating reactors, six, and three sites, and as a \nconsequence they have a significant portion of waste in their State. \nThe waste is on the small charts. It is important to reflect on what \nhappens to the waste that is in your State if, indeed, Yucca Mountain \ndoes not receive the approval of this body.\n  We find that there are 2,378 metric tons of nuclear fuel stored in \nNew York. Do you want that fuel moved? That is a question.\n  The next chart is Connecticut. Connecticut has 45 percent dependence \non nuclear energy. Again, the waste stored in that State is 1,500 tons. \nThat is not going to move unless we pass this legislation.\n  Illinois is almost 50 percent dependent on nuclear energy. They have \n5,800 tons of waste, high-level waste. I can go through the other \ncharts:\n  California, 17 percent dependent; Maryland, 27 percent dependent; \nMassachusetts, I think 14 percent dependent; New Jersey, 49 percent \ndependent; and Washington State is relatively insignificant at 8 \npercent.\n  Nevertheless, the point I want to make here is that nuclear energy is \nimportant, the energy development in these States and the waste is \npiling up, and it is significant.\n  Madam President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator has 11 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time does the Senator from Oklahoma need? I \nam going to use most of the remaining time, but if he would like 5 \nminutes? Why don't you take 4 minutes, and you will probably get 5.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for giving me a little bit of time. I \nbelieve it is necessary.\n  A number of people have asked me why it is that I support nuclear \nenergy when my home State does not have any nuclear power. My response \nis that nuclear energy directly benefits every Oklahoman even though \nnot a single kilowatt of energy is produced from nuclear power in our \nstate. Oklahomans benefit from nuclear energy in the form of decreased \npower bills and increased national and economic security.\n  Currently, nuclear power represents 20 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity generation. As an integral part of the U.S. energy mix, \nnuclear energy is a secure energy source that the nation can depend on. \nUnlike some other energy sources, nuclear energy is not subject to \nunreliable weather or climate conditions, unpredictable cost \nfluctuations, or dependence on foreign suppliers.\n  However, the lack of storage space for nuclear waste is now \nthreatening the existence of nuclear power. If Yucca Mountain is not \napproved, nuclear powerplants will be forced to start shutting down at \nsome point because there will be no place to store the waste. This \nwould have profound consequences for all Oklahomans.\n  Even though Oklahoma does not have any nuclear powerplants, if \nnuclear power goes off line, it would cause an economic crisis in \nOklahoma. The reason is simple. If you take 20 percent of the power \nsupply off line, other States' demands of Oklahoma's power would \nincrease, thus creating a smaller supply of energy, and a corresponding \nincrease in the cost of energy for Oklahomans. The days of utility \nrates in Oklahoma being 19 percent below the national average power \nrate would be over.\n  Higher energy prices affect everyone. However, when the price of \nenergy rises that means the less fortunate in our society must make a \ndecision between keeping the heat and lights on or paying for other \nessential needs. In a recent study on Public Opinion on Poverty, it was \nreported that one-quarter of Americans report having problems paying \nfor several basic necessities. In this study, currently 23 percent have \ndifficulty in paying their utilities. That is almost one out of every \nfour Americans. I will not support attacks on our energy supply, which \nhurt the poor in Oklahoma and around the Nation, in the name of an \nenvironmental crusade.\n  In the mid-1980s, I traveled around the country with President \nReagan's energy Secretary, Don Hodel, to bring attention to the need \nfor measures to decrease our Nation's energy dependence. Additionally, \nin January 1998, I elicited virtual consensus from the members of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff that energy security was a too-often-overlooked \naspect of our national security needs. Additionally, in just the last \ncouple of weeks, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said that \nU.S. dependency on foreign energy ``is a serious strategic issue . . . \nMy sense\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\nis that (our) dependency is projected to grow, not to decline.''\n  It is essential for a strong Navy.\n  The fact is we are at war right now. Every American is benefiting \nfrom the war on terrorism. Our subs are nuclear. Our aircraft carriers \nare nuclear. Every time we send American ships to a different part of \nthe world, whether to keep the peace or defeat an aggressor they head \nthere powered by nuclear fuel. Where does that spent fuel go? Right now \nthe material goes to Idaho. That is right. It is transported right now. \nIt's stored on the surface. So what happens if we fail to set up a \npermanent repository? We create what Secretary Abraham calls \nuncertainty regarding the ``continued capability of our naval \noperations.'' A strong Navy fuels our ability to remain a world power. \nAnd we need a safe way to handle what is fueling our Navy.\n  The cold war is over.\n  To those of us who grew up in a time when we had bomb shelters in our \nbackyards, nothing would be more welcome than seeing us dismantle \nweapons we no longer need. Every time I read about the plans for \nturning plutonium into ``mixed-oxide'' or MOX fuel, I see the results \nof our past determination to resist Soviet domination.\n  But whether surplus plutonium is made into MOX fuel or another form, \nwaste is still left over. And it must go to a permanent repository. And \nthat is not just for our own good. How can we urge other countries to \nget rid of their nuclear weapons if they don't see us doing it? We are \nnow turning swords into plowshares by helping Russia convert its \nsurplus weapons material into fuel for American reactors. Even the by-\nproducts of this fuel, once used, will need a repository. Yucca \nMountain will provide a safe place for the materials in weapons no \nlonger pointed at our enemies. And it will be a powerful example to \nother countries that no longer need weapons pointed at us.\n  Maybe a few years back we could not conceive of terrorists making \nbombs out of planes and striking at the very heart of America. We can \nnow. Make no mistake. They are out there and in our country. Yes, it is \ngood that we are racing to put neutron flux detectors and gamma ray \ndetectors at all our airports. But terrorists don't need to bring \nradioactive material into the United States. There is enough of it \nhere.\n  And these materials--relics of the cold war--are scattered around the \ncountry. Yucca Mountain will put this material where it belongs: safe \nand secure 1,000 feet underground. A few days back, after Jose Padilla, \nA.K.A. Abdullah al Muhajir, was arrested, I saw this headline in ``The \nWashington Post: U.S. Source of Isotopes Become Focus After Arrest.'' \nHere is what the Post said: ``Of the thousands of nuclear sources still \nin use, or decommissioned to known storage sites, many are thought to \nbe vulnerable to theft or black market sale.'' That is why Yucca \nMountain is so important. That is why we have to move now to create a \npermanent repository. That is why we need a central underground \ndisposal site, where spent fuel can be more safely and efficiently \nmonitored.\n\n  And so, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on Yucca Mountain. We caught \none terrorist. We can't catch them all. They will come through our \nairports. They will dock in our major ports. They will go through \ncustoms without a hitch because they possess not plutonium, but \nknowledge. Terrorists want to use that knowledge to threaten our way of \nlife. A vote for Yucca Mountain will make that hard for them.\n  What is America's record when it comes to transportation of nuclear \nmaterials? It is astonishingly safe. There are some people who act as \nif transporting nuclear fuel will be a new thing for America. The fact \nis that we've seen more than 3,000 shipments of it over the past 40 \nyears. In all those years, there has been zero danger to the \nenvironment, zero release of radioactivity, and zero fatalities.\n  We have seen 1.7 million miles of these shipments without any release \nof radioactive contents. And don't forget: The Energy Department also \naccepts used nuclear fuel from foreign research reactors under a non-\nproliferation pact. They come in from Europe and Latin America. They \nare brought by train to South Carolina. And we're going to do that \nuntil 2006--22,743 separate used fuel assemblies. This is something we \nknow how to do. Because we have done it. And we have done it \nexceptionally well.\n  Will we avoid transporting waste if we don't pass Yucca Mountain? \nAbsolutely not. A lot of sites are reaching their limits for keeping \nused nuclear fuel on location. 40 of them will need additional storage \nin the next 8 years. But they don't have the space for it. Where is \nthat waste going to go? Secretary Abraham put his finger on the issue \nwhen he testified last February. ``Our real choice is not between \ntransporting or not transporting used fuel, but between transporting it \nwith as much planning and safety as possible, or transporting it with \nsuch organization as the moment might invite.''\n  To keep that waste in 39 States is to keep it at 131 locations never \ndesigned for permanent disposal, never intended to manage this waste \nindefinitely. Clearly, any solution to the disposal of this waste \nrequires it be transported somewhere.\n  Furthermore, as skillful as America is at transporting hazardous \nmaterials, we are not the only people in the world who do that well. \nEurope has been doing it since 1966 about as much material as we want \nto send to Yucca Mountain. Fatalities? Hazards from radioactivity? \nZero.\n  There are those who see in this plan the heavy-handed approach of \nWashington. As a former mayor of Tulsa, I am always very sensitive to \nthe importance of local control. In fact, the way America handles the \nproblem of nuclear waste is a victory for local control. State and \nlocal governments can select alternate routes if they oppose those \nproposed by DOE and 11 States have done just that. As they should. \nMeanwhile, Federal and State and local authorities have worked \ntogether. Worked with training. Worked on contingency plans. Worked on \nmutual assistance agreements. Worked as partners. As we should. \nBuilding on our Nation's fine records, as the ranking member of the \nTransportation, Infrastructure, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, I look \nforward to working with the various Federal agencies to ensure the \nproper federal role in providing security for nuclear waste shipments. \nAs a former mayor of Tulsa, I will also keep in mind the critical role \nthat State and local governments must play in this process.\n  In an attempt to misinform and frighten the public, extreme \nenvironmentalists have been saying that the shipment of waste would be \ncreating thousands of ``mobile Chernobyls.'' I have already discussed, \nour Nation's safety record with regard to the shipment of nuclear \nmaterials. However, I must mention that, until the Yucca Mountain \nproject is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is \nabout 10 years off, the Departments of Energy and Transportation will \nnot designate shipping routes for nuclear waste to Yucca Mountain. If \nanyone implies that they know the routes, they are not telling the \ntruth because the decision makers of those routes will not consider \nroutes for many years.\n  As ranking member of the Transportation, Infrastructure, and Nuclear \nSafety Subcommittee, I am looking forward to my key role in working \nwith the various federal agencies to ensure the safe transportation of \nour commercial and military nuclear waste.\n  Make no mistake. A vote against Yucca Mountain is a vote against \nnuclear power, and, thus, a vote to hurt our energy, economic, and \nnational security.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for giving me a few minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent there be 10 \nminutes additional time equally divided between Senator Murkowski and \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I believe we have a Senator from the \nmajority coming over. But I will take--how much time may I ask is \nremaining on our side, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to take 10 minutes and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\n  As I indicated a few moments ago, there is only one issue before the \nSenate, and that is the reality that we are about to vote to determine \nwhether science and engineering are sufficient for the Yucca Mountain \nsite to be operated safely in compliance with EPA and other agency \nregulations in pursuing a license by the Department of Energy. That is \nthe question.\n  The ultimate transportation and other matters are going to be \ndetermined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is a very \ncompetent group. But the Senate is not now deciding whether or how \nspent fuel will be transported to a site if it is licensed and \nconstructed.\n  As I indicated, the Department of Transportation, the Secretary of \nEnergy, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, will proceed and that will \ntake some time.\n  What we have today is basically two choices: We could follow the \nrecommendations of the Secretary of Energy and the President of the \nUnited States--the U.S. House of Representatives has done its job, and \nthe Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources--and allow the \nSecretary of Energy to proceed and apply for a license or we can \nabandon some 20 years of work, over $7 billion invested in science, in \nengineering, and the peer-reviewed conclusions of responsible \nscientists within and outside Government, and then what do we do? We \nbegin the task all over at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  That is where we are. There is no middle ground and no way to duck \nthe issue or duck the responsibility. As we say in Alaska, it is time \nto fish or cut bait.\n  The Nuclear Waste Policy Act was deliberately and carefully crafted \nto ensure that both the Senate and the House would deal with the issue.\n  The House met its obligation by an overwhelming vote of 306 to 117. \nThe House agreed with the President's decision and voted to allow the \nSecretary of Energy to proceed with the license application. The \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources held 3 full days of hearings \nto examine all aspects of this issue, including a full day where we \nwelcomed the State of Nevada to select its witnesses who would appear \nin opposition to the resolution. The committee carefully reviewed each \nand every argument raised by the State of Nevada, either in the \nGovernor's message or by the State representatives.\n  I commend the report to the attention of my colleagues. We have that \nreport before us. Here it is. In a careful and methodical manner, this \nparticular report discusses each and every argument raised in the \nprocess.\n  Under any impartial analysis, there is no legitimate reason to object \nto the President's decision to deny the Secretary the opportunity to \napply for a license before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  What are the consequences if we fail to act? On the other hand, there \nare many serious consequences if we do not approve the resolution. The \nimmediate consequence is set forth in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. \nSection 115(b) is explicit. If the resolution is not approved within 90 \ndays--the 90-day period for congressional review--such site shall be \ndisapproved. The magic date is July 27. If this is not approved by that \ndate, the site shall be disapproved.\n  Further, it does not say that the decision is postponed or the \ndecision is simply put off for some reason to be revisited at a more \nconvenient time. It explicitly and without qualification says ``such \nsite shall be disapproved.''\n  There are the consequences of that disapproval, and those \nconsequences are serious. At a minimum, Congress will need to \nreconsider the previous sites--Hanford in Washington, Deaf Smith \nCounty, TX--giving serious consideration by using the Hanford \nReservation as an interim site to meet our contractual obligations to \nthe utilities and deal with defense in other ways.\n  We have a significant amount of defense waste already at Hanford. \nInstead of moving material from Hanford, we might have to consider \nmoving additional material there for the foreseeable future.\n  Should Congress not act and we start this process over, my guess is \nwe will have to go back to where we were in 1982 when there was serious \nconsideration of granite formations in the Michigan Peninsula, and \nelsewhere; salt caverns in Mississippi and Louisiana; granite in \nVermont, and so forth. Some have suggested that we use Federal \nreservations as interim sites, as has been proposed in the past. With \nthe transportation scenario, that will be far more complex than that \nwhich has been considered to date--perhaps simply leaving the spent \nfuel onsite in Vermont, Illinois, Maryland, California, or elsewhere.\n  Let there be no mistake. Because of the statutory time constraints \nand the directives in the law, a vote against the motion to proceed is \na vote to direct the Secretary of Energy to cease all further work at \nYucca Mountain and close the office until Congress decides otherwise.\n  I hope my colleagues will look around in the Chamber because only \nNevada--only Nevada--will not be in the next round.\n  There is an implication to the taxpayer because we have the nuclear \nwaste. Aside from taking Nevada off the table, there are other \nunavoidable and unpleasant consequences of failure to face up to our \nresponsibilities. Members may not recall, but the cost of permanent \nstorage of spent fuel is totally financed by ratepayers who use the \nenergy. The fee is collected by the utilities and every one of our \nconstituents who have nuclear energy as part of their energy mix have \nbeen paying into the nuclear waste to pay for storage. These costs do \nnot--let me repeat--do not come out of the General Treasury. They come \nfrom ratepayers that use nuclear energy. These ratepayers are in \nvirtually every State in the Union, including States that do not have \nnuclear powerplants. Those ratepayers and the States that either have \nnuclear powerplants or whose citizens pay for the use of nuclear power \nhave a contractual obligation to set in statute with the Federal \nGovernment to take spent fuel from their sites.\n\n  The last administration thought they could avoid the problem and \nsuggested there was no binding requirement. The courts thought \notherwise.\n  If you like the idea of coming up with $60 billion or $70 billion or \n$80 billion of taxpayer money--that is taxpayer, not ratepayer money--\nthen vote against the motion to proceed. The $60 billion to $80 billion \nwould likely not be the end of the toll for the taxpayer either \nbecause, as a matter of national interest, we will need to find the \nsolution, and the States will incur expenses as well as those \nassociated with liability. Leaving the waste is a consideration, but it \nis a bad idea.\n  In addition to economic issues, there is the health and safety issues \nassociated with continuing to leave both spent fuel and high-level \nwaste onsite. Remember, the current site-storage for the reactors is \nand was designed to be temporary. Yes, the present storage is the \nsafest, but it is not a permanent solution. It is an interim solution.\n  The Chairman of the NRC has been very up front, saying that the \npresent arrangement for the temporary storage of spent fuel at \ncommercial reactors is safe, and it is, as he states, a ``temporary'' \nmeasure.\n  Exchanging Yucca Mountain for 131 sites in 39 States and permanent \nrepositories scattered around the country is not something the Chairman \nrecommends nor that any other thoughtful person suggested. But that is \nprecisely what those who oppose the motion to proceed are endorsing. \nThere can be no other conclusion.\n  We also have the situation of utilities running out of room for \nstorage and needing to find an alternative site if Yucca Mountain does \nnot go forward. If a repository is not built, these utilities need to \nbe shut down. In shutting down the reactors, we are going to have to \nlook to alternative sources of fuel. What are they? Coal? Oil? Nuclear \nis clean power.\n  As we address our concerns over emissions and the recognition that \nnuclear provides about 20 percent of the electric power generated in \nthis country, it makes a significant addition in our energy mix. Do any \nof the opponents to the motion to proceed have a suggestion on how we \nare going to replace that 20 percent? I guess the answer is more fossil \nfuels.\n  There is no way that this Nation will ever approve the Kyoto targets \non climate change without nuclear power. There is no way to replace \nnuclear energy within our electric power mix.\n  For those of you who experienced shortages on the west coast last \nyear,\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nthink where this Nation would be and what we would be in for if we had \nto shut off 20 percent of our electric power simply because we could \nnot agree on a solution to the waste problem.\n  If you don't know how much of the electric power in your State comes \nfrom nuclear, I have gone through the numbers: Connecticut, 40 percent; \nIllinois, 50 percent; California, 17 percent; Vermont, 67 percent; New \nYork, 23 percent; Maryland, 28 percent; Michigan, 18 percent; and, \nGeorgia, 27 percent. How much waste is in those States that needs to \nget out? It is thousands and thousands of metric tons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe I have 1 minute. I will conclude. I see the \nmajority leader is seeking recognition. I want to respect the \ntraditions of the Senate.\n  I will conclude with the reality that the issue before us is clear. \nAll one has to do is read the commission report. The Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources performed the review, as we would expect. \nWe carefully considered every objection raised by the State of Nevada. \nWe conducted 3 days of hearings. We considered the issue in an open \nbusiness meeting and favorably reported on a bipartisan basis. We filed \na comprehensive report that discusses every argument raised by the \nState of Nevada, and why the argument is not persuasive or not relevant \nto the issue before the Senate.\n  I commend my colleagues, Senator Ensign and Senator Reid. I \nunderstand why the Senators from Nevada oppose the resolution, but I \ncannot understand why anyone else would.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use my leader time to make the \nstatement I am about to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we should not be having this vote \ntoday. There are still far too many questions about the wisdom and \nsafety of creating a national nuclear waste dump at Yucca Mountain for \nanyone to be able to cast an informed, responsible vote on this matter. \nBut we are here.\n  We are here because the Bush administration and some of its allies in \nCongress--and in the energy industry--are determined to exploit unique \nrules that were written 20 years ago and apply only to this bill.\n  I can't help but think how ironic it is that less than a week after \nAmerica celebrated the genius of our Founders, who intended this Senate \nto be the world's most deliberative body, we are being forced to vote \non a matter of such grave importance before we can have an informed, \nhonest debate.\n  Even more troubling than the break this vote represents with our \npast, is the threat it poses to America's future. Let us be very clear: \nThe claim that science supports building a national nuclear waste dump \nat Yucca Mountain is simply not true. The truth is, leading independent \nscientists have raised troubling questions about the scientific basis \nfor the Department of Energy's recommendation regarding Yucca Mountain.\n  A recent letter to Congress from the independent Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board contains a warning we should all pay great heed \nto. It warns that--quote--``the technical basis for DOE's repository \ndesign is weak to moderate at this time.''\n  Think about that. We are being asked to overturn a Governor's veto--\nand risk public health and safety--by approving a plan of ``weak to \nmoderate'' technical design. That is an extraordinary position for the \nadministration to take.\n  The General Accounting Office, Congress's independent watchdog \nagency, has also raised serious questions about Yucca Mountain. Eight \nmonths ago, the GAO released a report that questioned Secretary \nAbraham's recommendation to the President to move ahead on Yucca \nMountain despite the--quote--``significant amount of work remaining to \nbe done'' on the safety and feasibility of the project. The GAO report \nnoted that more than 200 unresolved technical issues identified by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission remain unanswered. It pointed out that \neven the Department of Energy's own contractor doesn't think those \nissues will be resolved in time to meet the 2010 deadline. In fact, it \nwill probably be years before we know definitively whether it is safe \nto store nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain.\n  So why are we having this vote today?\n  We are being forced to decide this issue prematurely--without \nsufficient scientific information--because this administration is doing \nthe bidding of special interests that simply want to make the deadly \nwaste they have generated somebody else's problem.\n  That is wrong. We ought to make this decision on the basis of sound \nscience, not pressure from the energy industry.\n  Two weeks ago, a mild earthquake shook Yucca Mountain. What would \nhappen to nuclear waste buried beneath Yucca Mountain when the next \nearthquake hits? And we know there will be another. Will the \nradioactive waste leak? Will it contaminate the soil? The groundwater? \nWe don't know.\n  The decision we make will have consequences that will last for tens \nof thousands of years. We owe it to the American people--and to future \ngenerations of Americans who haven't been born yet--to wait until we \nhave real answers. Yucca Mountain is less than 75 miles from Las Vegas, \nthe fastest-growing metro area in the country.\n  But it is not just Nevadans who are potentially in harm's way. \nSerious questions have also been raised not only about the safety of \nburying nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain, but also about the safety of \ngetting the toxic materials to Yucca Mountain.\n  We are talking about transporting roughly 70,000 metric tons of \ndeadly waste from nuclear facilities in 39 States across our Nation's \nhighways, railways, and waterways to Yucca Mountain. No one knows \nexactly what routes the waste would take. But, based on the routes the \nDOE used in its environmental impact statement, there are 14,500 \nschools and 38 million people within 1 mile of a proposed nuclear waste \ntransfer route.\n  This is extremely dangerous material: High-level radioactive waste. \nAccording to the non-partisan Environmental Working Group: Each rail \ncask carrying nuclear waste, for instance, contains 240 times as much \nlong-lived radiation as was released by the Hiroshima bomb. A person \nstanding 3 feet from an unshielded nuclear waste cask will receive a \nlethal dose of radiation in 2 minutes.\n  The administration has warned us repeatedly that terrorists may \nhijack trucks and strike at trains. We also know that there are \nsecurity problems with many of our ports. By shipping nuclear waste on \ntrucks and trains and barges, we may very well be creating hundreds, \neven thousands, of rolling ``dirty'' bombs. What sense does that make?\n  Even if we are fortunate enough to avoid terrorist attacks on \nshipments of radioactive waste bound for Yucca Mountain, there is a \nserious risk of accidents in transit, which would put Americans at risk \nof exposure to high-level radioactive waste as well. Almost a year ago \nexactly, a train derailment in a Maryland incident caused a tunnel fire \nthat burned for days. Temperatures in that tunnel exceeded 1,000 \ndegrees.\n  How much radiation would have been released to the environment had \nnuclear waste been on that train? How many people might have died?\n  There is so much we don't know about this ill-conceived project. But \nthere is one thing we do know: Contrary to what the special interests \nclaim, even if the Senate votes today to override Governor Guinn's \nveto, creating a national nuclear dump in Nevada will not solve \nAmerica's nuclear waste storage problem. That is because the site isn't \nbig enough. America produces far more nuclear waste than can be buried \nat Yucca Mountain. So beware if you are thinking of voting for this \nproposal. This time, the nuclear waste may be passing through your \nState. Next time, your State may be where the special interests want to \nbury their radioactive trash.\n  If we let them do it this time--without sufficient scientific proof \nthat it is safe--think how much easier it will be the next time.\n  During his campaign, President Bush promised Americans that if he \nwere elected, he would support regulations\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nrequiring energy companies to reduce their emissions of carbon dioxide, \na compound that nearly all scientists agree is causing global warming. \nWhen the time came to follow through on that promise, the President \nreneged.\n  At a stop in Las Vegas during the campaign, Vice President Cheney \nsaid a Bush administration would not muscle this project through. He \npromised that the final decision would be based on sound science. Now, \nat the urging of the energy industry, the administration has reneged on \nthat promise, too. They are pushing us to make this decision \nprematurely, at grave potential risk to this Nation.\n  There is no reason we have to make a final decision today. Scientists \nat the Nuclear Regulatory Commission have assured us that the nuclear \nwaste can stay where is it for 100 years--safe in dry cask storage--\nwithout posing any additional risk to public health and safety. It is \npremature, dangerous, and reckless to force a vote on this question \ntoday. We have more than enough time to make an informed, responsible \ndecision about Yucca Mountain. The question is: Will we have the \ncourage to take that time?\n  For the sake of all Americans--including those who will be born \ngenerations from now--I hope the answer is yes.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this proposal. We risk no harm \nby waiting for the scientists to finish their work. We risk \ncatastrophic harm by refusing to wait.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry: How much time \nremains on each side at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has no time remaining. \nThe Senator from Nevada has 27\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I will use my leader time. I realize \nSenators are expecting to vote on or around 6 o'clock. I hope we will \nbe able to do that.\n  In that vein, I will not speak too long, but I have to rise to urge \nmy colleagues to vote yes on the motion to proceed. That is the vote. \nThat will be the only vote today. This is not something that is new. \nThis is not a proposal that we are rushing into. In fact, the entire \ntime I have been in the Senate, and 6 years when I was in the House, \nthis process has been under way. It is 20 years that this has been in \nthe making. Nobody is being surprised. Nobody is being rammed. There \nare not going to be any dangers.\n  This is a part of a very long, thoughtful process based on science. \nTwenty years and $8 billion have already been expended. This is \nsomething we must do. Nuclear power is an important part of our overall \nenergy needs. It provides clean, efficient power. We need to include \nthat in our diverse package of power production.\n  I am still dumbfounded to hear people express concerns about how it \ncan be moved, how it can be stored. Senator Murkowski and a bipartisan \ndelegation took a look 10 years ago at how Sweden, France, and the \nJapanese have dealt with this problem. Yet in America we have not been \nable to come to grips with our future needs and how we are going to \ndeal with the problem.\n  We should not overexaggerate what this decision today will do. The \nSenate today will decide very simply whether to permit the Secretary of \nEnergy to apply for a license to operate a repository at Yucca \nMountain. It is not the end of the process. It is the very beginning. I \nknow from experience we are going to look at this issue every year, \ncongressionally, as we should, because funds will have to be used as we \ngo through the process. Senators from across the country are going to \nwant to know what is happening, how it is going. This is just to begin \nthe important part of the process.\n  We should not abandon all these years of effort. That is what would \nhappen. If we don't pass this motion to proceed, vote yes on it, I \ndon't know how we go forward. We will have wasted years and billions of \ndollars in research and effort.\n  In addition, there is a tremendous problem with the exposure the \nGovernment would have as a result. If we don't go forward, our Federal \nGovernment could face billions of dollars in liability for breach of \ncontractual obligations. Remember this: If we don't proceed, a lot of \ncompanies are going to start entering into private contracts. They will \nstart making arrangements for other types of repositories, probably not \nas safe, not as well thought out, not based on as much science, and \nalso still having to be moved. When you look at various States and \nwhere their nuclear waste is and its condition, you see that something \nis going to happen. Having a repository that we have studied so much \nand that will be so secure is better than the alternative of the \nliability to which we would be exposed and what then would begin to \nhappen all over the country.\n  We should not jeopardize our only realistic means of meeting global \nclimate concerns by cutting back 20 percent of clean electric power \nthat is supplied by these nuclear reactors. As a matter of fact, I am \nhoping we will have some more nuclear reactors activated in the \nTennessee Valley Authority region.\n\n  Clearly, there is a way that could be done, and there are some nearly \ncompleted reactors that could be put back on line. It would help us \nwith our energy needs as we move toward an ever growing economy. If you \nare going to have economic growth, you have to have power. I have just \nvisited some other countries that have seen real growth, and one of the \nconcerns they have--a country such as Ireland--is that growth. They \nhave new companies, but they are struggling to keep up with meeting the \npower needs that go with the economic growth.\n  If we don't proceed, do we go back to the beginning? Do we debate \nagain the repository siting and reexamine all the feasibilities of \nother sites such as the Hanford Reservation or the Michigan Peninsula. \nWhere would it be? What would we do?\n  Also, we would have to consider existing Federal reservations such as \nHanford and Savannah River. The complications that would be caused and \nthe irresponsible consequences of not agreeing to the motion to proceed \ntoday are almost incomprehensible.\n  There has been a lot of discussion about transportation, moving this \nwaste around the country. How can we deal with it? Certainly, getting \nthis waste moved to a single repository where we could have very strong \nsecurity is much better than what we have now with all of these sites \nin 39 States that are sitting there reaching their limits and exposed. \nIt would be much easier certainly to guarantee the security in a single \nplace.\n  I have also taken the time to look at how this transportation is \nhandled. These moving devices are very secure. You wouldn't believe all \nthe effort that goes into making sure they won't be exposed to any kind \nof accident. To my knowledge, there has never been one that has caused \na problem.\n  When you look at what we have done to paint this dire picture of what \nmight happen, the truth is, the picture of what will happen if we don't \ntake this action now, after all this time, all this money, all this \neffort, all this science--I don't know where we go from here. It all \nboils down to this vote for 39 States, including my State. If not now, \nwhen in the world are we going to do it? And if not in this way, if not \nin this place, where? There are a lot of Senators who would have to \nbegin to be very nervous about a whole reevaluation process and what it \nwould mean to their sites.\n  I understand the Senators from Nevada. They have made a valiant \neffort. They feel so strongly about it. I understand that. But I think \nthe Senate is committed to working with them to make sure that as we \nmove forward, it is based on good science and also that we do it in the \nmost secure fashion.\n  Let me again urge that we vote yes and that we do it within the next \nfew minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from Nevada talked about \ncourage. I yield 5 minutes to one of the most courageous legislators we \nhave had. She showed that courage in the House of Representatives and \nnow in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I rise today in opposition to the \nmotion\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\nto proceed to the Yucca Mountain resolution authorizing DOE to move \nforward with the siting of a national nuclear waste repository at Yucca \nMountain, Nevada.\n  Washington State is home to the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, the most \ncontaminated site in this country. My constituents have a very keen \ninterest in the development of a comprehensive, scientifically-driven \nnational nuclear waste policy. Unfortunately, I don't believe this \nproposal, the Yucca Mountain policy, represents the needs of Washington \nState. As far as I can tell, it is neither a comprehensive solution to \nthe fact that we have 54 million gallons of tank waste now stored at \nHanford, nor was the decision to recommend the site at Yucca Mountain \ndriven by a preponderance of scientific evidence.\n  This proposal, as billed, is supposed to be a long-term, \ncomprehensive solution for our nation's nuclear waste, yet it would \nleave as much as 87 percent of the high-level nuclear tank waste in my \nState. That is right. Under the Department of Energy's plan, as \noutlined in its Environmental Impact Statement, only 13 percent of the \nwaste from Washington State's underground tanks would move to Yucca \nMountain. Only 19 percent of all of Hanford's defense-related waste \nwould move. And that's to say nothing about the increase in the total \namount of commercial nuclear waste within our borders.\n  There are capacity issues, as is admitted in the EIS. Yucca Mountain \nwill, by statute, only be able to take up to 70,000 metric tons of \nheavy metal. And by the time the Yucca Mountain proposed site is open, \nWashington State will already have 150-percent more commercial nuclear \nwaste than we have today. So where is the waste in Washington State \ngoing to go?\n  The Seattle PI recently ran an editorial, ``Yucca Mountain Must Meet \nRigorous Standards,'' that talked about how we had created a monster in \nthe amount of nuclear waste in this country and asked what we are going \nto do about it. I ask unanimous consent to print that in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, July 8, 2002]\n\n              Yucca Mountain Must Meet Rigorous Standards\n\n       This country, in this century, has created a monster that \n     likely will live for hundreds of thousands of years. Long, \n     long after we are gone, Americans will look back at the \n     summer of 2002 to see how carefully we tamed the monster.\n       So imagine the pressure on the U.S. Senate this week as it \n     must decide whether to declare Yucca Mountain in Nevada the \n     permanent repository for this nation's most dangerous nuclear \n     waste.\n       Maybe Yucca Mountain should become the final resting place \n     for this radioactive Frankenstein. But Americans, and \n     especially citizens of Washington state, should be very sure \n     that the site meets the highest standards for effectiveness \n     and safety before it is officially designated.\n       Washington state's Hanford Nuclear Reservation, remember, \n     was very close to being chosen for this ugliest of \n     graveyards. We didn't want it any more than the citizens of \n     Nevada do.\n       Washington state has done its share for the country in \n     producing and enduring these dangerous wastes and waiting for \n     bureaucrats and politicians to recognize the environmental \n     threat with which we've been saddled.\n       Washington was able to escape doing even more to rid the \n     world of the nuclear-waste monster.\n       So this state cannt be party to sacrificing the health of \n     Nevada and its residents because we want to get rid of the \n     wastes piled up within our borders.\n       We owe Nevada--even more, probably, than other states do.\n       Washington doesn't necessarily need to join Nevada in \n     opposing the respository. But we and our congressional \n     delegation should be involved. We should insist that the \n     Department of Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and \n     the Nuclear Regulatory Commission make certain that this \n     repository is as safe as we would want it to be if the waste \n     were coming to Hanford.\n       The repository is supposed to separate high-level nuclear \n     waste from the human race for 10 centuries.\n       We've spent $7 billion studying Yucca Mountain, and for \n     several years, it's been the only place under consideration. \n     This has put a lot of heat on the EPA, DOE and the NCR to \n     lower or change standards to make sure the Nevada site makes \n     the grade.\n       That just adds to the need for the Senate to be cautious \n     about signing on to this plan. It can't be Yucca Mountain for \n     the sake of getting something--anything--done about nuclear \n     waste. Expedient is not good enough when the decision will \n     have consequences for thousands and thousands of years.\n       There can be no certainty when the timeline is unimaginably \n     long and the material unimaginably ugly.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. So why doesn't the ``trust us'' answer work for us when \nit comes to nuclear waste--when it comes to trusting the Department of \nEnergy? Washington State has had to fight and battle hard. By some \nestimates, we have already spent some $35 billion on Hanford cleanup--\nwithout producing a single log of vitrified waste from those \nunderground tanks that are leaking in my State. We will also spend \nanother $50 billion, according to estimates, to finish the job, and we \nare banking on the development of new technologies that have never been \nused in projects of this magnitude. Meanwhile, we are spending an \naverage of about $5.1 million per day on this effort.\n  Since starting this project, we have had lots of stops and starts. In \n1958, we tried converting our nuclear tank waste to ceramic forms. We \ntried again later in the 1980s, to turn the tank waste into grout. That \nplan didn't work, and it was abandoned.\n  Then, in 1998, DOE tried to privatize the construction of the \nvitrification plant. That didn't work either. After a series of cost \noverruns, DOE fired the contractor and we moved on to the next phase.\n  So we in Washington State know how hard this process can be. That is \nwhy we have a tri-party agreement with the Federal Government and our \nState agencies to make sure the Department of Energy lives up to its \nresponsibilities. But these are complex problems. So the fact that DOE \nhasn't answered all the questions about Yucca Mountain on the technical \nside and on the environmental side before proceeding puts a question in \nmy mind: Why do we have to execute today? Why do we have to move \nforward today?\n  Even the GAO, in its recent report, says that there was no way that \nthe questions left to be answered at Yucca can be answered in the \ntimeframe that the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act envisioned So, \nbasically, we are saying we will approve this site without conclusively \naddressing some 293, I believe, different technical questions that are \nstill out there.\n  As the GAO stated in its December 2001 report:\n\n       On the basis of information we reviewed, DOE will not be \n     able to submit an acceptable application to the NRC within \n     the express statutory time frames . . .\n       The GAO also criticized the lack of reliable cost estimates \n     for Yucca Mountain. How much will American taxpayers spend on \n     this proposal, with so many outstanding technical \n     uncertainties? No one really knows, but likely over $100 \n     billion. That's why this proposal is opposed by so many \n     taxpayer groups.\n\n  Madam President, my State, more than any, wants a real solution to \nour nation's nuclear waste problem. But more than anywhere else, my \nState also knows that that these solutions must be based on sound \nscience and technology, and that the people deserve real answers and \nnot a plan that will do little to nothing for moving waste out of our \nState. So when the DOE leaves so many questions unanswered and rushes \nto judgment, I am skeptical.\n  To quote another article in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, ``Cart \nbefore horse at Yucca,'' it said:\n\n       Been there, heard those empty promises about sure-bet \n     technological fixes for the past 50 years. That approach \n     hasn't produced a disposal solution so far, and there's no \n     reason to rely on that failed strategy now.\n\n  We need more specific answers on every aspect of the Yucca Mountain \nplan--on transportation, technology, and most importantly, from the \nState of Washington: Where is the rest of the 87 percent of our tank \nwaste going to go? The Yucca Mountain proposal fails to provide that \nanswer.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Missouri, Senator \nCarnahan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, for the Record, I want to correct the \nstatement made earlier regarding the shipment of nuclear waste or spent \nfuel through Missouri.\n  The Senator from Alaska stated that ``there is no proposed existing \ntransportation route that will be taking the\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nwaste through Missouri.'' He also said that ``there is no logic to \nsuggest that there would be movement of waste through the State of \nMissouri.'' These are simply untrue statements.\n  In fact, a shipment of foreign research reactor spent fuel was \nshipped through Missouri on I-70 in June 2001. The Department of Energy \nhas three highway routes selected for cross-country shipments of this \nspent fuel that we take back from foreign countries.\n  I have the map right here. I got it from the Department of Energy. \nTwo of the three routes go directly across Missouri. This map--not the \none used on the floor by the Senator from Alaska--is a much better \npredictor for the potential routes for the spent fuel that will be \nshipped cross-country to Yucca Mountain because it is currently used \nfor very similar nuclear waste.\n  These are the facts. I wanted the Record to be clear for the people \nof Missouri.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Nevada \nhave remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I know there are people in the audience \nall around here who are being paid lots of money. They are coming here \nto see what is going to happen. They are being paid lots of money. They \ndrive here in limousines and have Gucci shoes and nice suits. It is \ninteresting to know that in the places where they work, Washington and \nNew York, they have editorials supporting this bad situation, trying to \nship Yucca Mountain waste on our highways, railways, and our waterways.\n  In this morning's paper, it says the Senate should pass the Yucca \nMountain bill now. This is part of the unending stream of money. That \nis what this is all about--money, lots of money; money to run newspaper \nads; unlimited vacations to Las Vegas to look at Yucca Mountain for 2 \nhours and spend three days being wined and dined in Las Vegas; \nunlimited dollars to send representatives to Capitol Hill.\n  I know how this works. The State of Nevada had a few dollars and we \nwanted to hire a lobbyist, but we could not find one. They were all \nhired by the Nuclear Energy Institute. We could not hire them. They had \nconflicts of interest. So all you people here, just bill everybody, \nfeel good about it; you are perpetrating a travesty on the people of \nthis country.\n  We know that the information in this ad from the Washington Post are \nmyths. The law requires Senate action. That is not true, as has been \nindicated by the majority leader and everybody else. It is not true. \nThe chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said less than a \nmonth ago that if it didn't go forward now, no big deal, it is safe \nwhere it is.\n  Well, this argument that Yucca needs to happen is a big crock of \npotato soup. The fact of the matter is that the General Accounting \nOffice said there is 292 scientific investigative reports that are not \ncompleted.\n  Those independent scientists and analysts include the Nuclear Waste \nTechnical Review Board, General Accounting Office, a former NRC \ncommissioner, and other independent scientists.\n  Let's look at some of the myths of this ad:\n  It is right for the environment.\n  Now, that is a joke. It is right for the environment? Every \nenvironmental group in America opposes Yucca Mountain. There's your \nanswer. The transportation of it scares them. The Senator from Oklahoma \ncame and said ``why are they scaring people?'' Let's think about this a \nminute. The proposed route that goes through Oklahoma was just the \nscene of a horrible accident, where a barge hit a bridge and 23 cars \nwere knocked into the water and it killed 13 people.\n  I don't think that is scaring people. I think it is a scary fact. So \nit is good for the environment? That has to be a big laugh. Every \nenvironmental group in America opposes this. ``It has bipartisan \nsupport''? The PTA, the national Parent Teachers Association, opposes \nthis. The National Education Association and the Farm Bureau, because \nof the water situation, oppose this, along with the U.S. Conference of \nMayors. As is already in the Record from the Senator from California, \nhundreds of environmental groups and other organizations in America \noppose this.\n  It is right for the environment? Afraid not. ``It is right for \nconsumers''? Joan Claybrook, who spent hours out in the reception room \nearlier today, is the epitome of what consumers are about in America, \nand her group opposes it.\n  Right for consumers? If this boondoggle goes through, it will cost \nthe American taxpayers approximately $100 billion. The Department of \nEnergy itself acknowledges they will spend $69 billion, but they low-\nball everything and come back to Congress for more money. How can that \nbe right for hard-working American families.\n  ``It is time for action''? Afraid not. But this is the Gucci crowd. \nThey paid for this. They do it in New York and in Washington where they \nget the good editorials. They don't get the good editorials in other \nplaces because they have not been able to weave their web of money.\n  That is what this is all about. As the Senator from California \nindicated today, 261 groups make up the Nuclear Energy Institute. These \nare the same groups that our Vice President met with secretly. Now he \nwon't tell us anything about those meetings.\n  Let's see what USA Today said. They said there is no good reason to \nmove forward with this project. The view is best summarized by comments \nof the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission where he said:\n\n       If Yucca Mountain was to fail because of congressional \n     action, it does not mean from a policy point of view the \n     country is at a stalemate and confronting imminent disaster. \n     We do have the capacity to store the material safely for \n     decades.\n       There has been talk today on several occasions that these \n     sites are filling up; as a result, we are going to have to \n     move to unregulated private storage facilities. That's \n     another lie, because these private facilities still have to \n     be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n\n  I repeat, outside of Washington and New York, people realize how \nflawed this is. It certainly is the wrong way to go.\n  The Department of Energy has been saying we need to have Yucca \nMountain to consolidate all the waste that is sitting in existing \nnuclear facilities. If there were ever a big lie, that is it. I have \nhad Senators who support this come here all day today saying: What we \nneed is one site. That is what this is all about. Every State one looks \nat, we will find they do not gain anything. None of them are getting \nrid of nuclear waste.\n  We can run through all these places across America. When it is all \nover, Browns Ferry in Alabama will have 107 percent of the nuclear \nwaste they have right now, and we can go on down the list; 168 percent \nin Pennsylvania; 140 percent in South Carolina. There is one that is \n306 percent. That is in Virginia. There is one here for 380 percent. \nThey will have 380 percent more nuclear waste than when they started.\n  This is the big lie, that they are going to get rid of the nuclear \nwaste all around the country and have one place where there is nuclear \nwaste. That is simply not true. It will not happen. They are going to \nwind up with more nuclear waste.\n  A simple statement of fact: They can move at the most 3,000 tons a \nyear. They will generate more than 2,000 tons a year, and they have \n46,000 tons stored, and Yucca can only hold 77,000 tons. It does not \ntake a mathematician to figure out that we are not going to get rid of \nthe nuclear waste stored where it is.\n  Some of my colleagues have said the Nuclear Waste Technical Review \nBoard really has not said how bad this is. They have said it as clearly \nas one can. An important conclusion in the board's January letter is:\n\n       When DOE's technical and scientific work is taken as a \n     whole the Board's view is that the technical basis for the \n     DOE's repository performance is weak to moderate. . . .\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       While no individual technical or scientific factor has been \n     identified that would automatically eliminate Yucca Mountain \n     from consideration at this point, the Board has limited \n     confidence generated by DOE's performance market.\n\n  We are in the midst of a crisis in this country. The stock market has \nplummeted. People have lost confidence in corporate America. Today, we \nshould be working to fix those problems, not create another disaster \nfor the American people to help out big corporations. That is what this \nis about. Corporate America is driving this decision.\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\nThat is really too bad, Madam President. It is really too bad.\n\n  I extend my appreciation publicly to my friend from Nevada. Senator \nEnsign has worked very hard on this. He has done good work. Senator \nEnsign has done an outstanding job talking with every member of the \nminority. I am very happy with the work he has done. I publicly \ncongratulate him for the work he has done.\n  I have been tremendously impressed with the fact he has not in any \nway backed off, even though some say it is unpopular for him to oppose \nthe President of the United States.\n  Let me read a poem by Robert Frost to close this debate:\n\n     Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,\n     And sorry I could not travel both\n     And be one traveller, long I stood\n     And looked down one as far as I could\n     To where it bend in the undergrowth;\n\n     Then took the other, as just as fair,\n     And having perhaps the better claim,\n     Because it was grassy and wanted wear;\n     Though as for that the passing there\n     Had worn them really about the same,\n\n     And both that morning equally lay\n     In leaves no step had trodden black.\n     Oh, I kept the first for another day!\n     Yet knowing how way leads on to way,\n     I doubted if I should ever come back.\n\n     I shall be telling this with a sigh\n     Somewhere ages and ages hence:\n     Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--\n     I took the one less travelled by,\n     And that has made all the difference.\n\n  Madam President, Senators are being called upon to take that less \ntraveled road because it is going to make a difference.\n  Yucca Mountain is a bad project. We cannot transport nuclear waste \nsafely. We know that. Nuclear waste is subject to terrorist attack. We \nare talking about tens of thousands of truckloads and thousands and \nthousands of trainloads, and now they told us they are going to move \nwaste on barges. This is a road that should not be traveled, even \nthough some people want to go down that road.\n  I say let's take the road that makes all the difference. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  In the years to come, as indicated in the Seattle Post Intelligencer, \npeople are going to ask: Why did they do that? There is no reason to do \nit. Chairman Meserve has said:\n\n       If Yucca Mountain were to fail because of congressional \n     action, that does not mean all of a sudden from a policy \n     point of view that the country is at a stalemate and is \n     confronting imminent disaster.\n\n  That is true. But corporate interests are pushing this. In fact, we \nshould be talking about legislation to address these problems with \ncorporate American right now. We should be working a bill reduce the \npower of corporate America with which this administration has been in \nbed. The only person who could have stopped this corporate abuse today, \nit appears, is the President of the United States. He misled the people \nof Nevada. That is the reason he is President of the United States, I \nam sorry to say. If he told the truth about Yucca Mountain, he would \nnot be President. He would have lost by four electoral votes and would \nhave lost the Presidency of the United States.\n\n  I say to my friend, the ranking member of the committee, Senator \nMurkowski, he and I have had a lot of battles on the Senate floor. I \nhave the greatest respect for him. He has been a gentleman and always \nfair to me, and although we disagree on policy issues, I cannot say \nenough about him being the type of legislator I think we should have.\n  I urge my colleagues one more time to take the road less travelled \nand protect people in the country, their states and Nevada.\n  I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell.) Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 6 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nproceed to S.J. Res. 34. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 60, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 167 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--60\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Helms\n       \n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That motion is not in order.\n  Under the previous order, the Senate will proceed to the \nconsideration of H.J. Res 87, which the clerk will report by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 87) approving the site at \n     Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for the development of a repository \n     for the disposal of high-level radioactive waste and spent \n     nuclear fuel, pursuant to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of \n     1982.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will read \nH.J. Res 87 for the third time.\n  The joint resolution was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the \nthird time, the question occurs on passage of the resolution.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 87) was passed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent S.J. Res. 34 be returned to the \ncalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am concerned that many geological and \ntechnical questions associated with the Yucca Mountain plan have yet to \nbe answered. We must ensure the safe keeping of this waste material for \n10,000 years--a period of time longer than the written history of \nmankind. Therefore, there must be certainty that the Yucca Mountain \nsite ensures protection of the environment and the safety of citizens. \nAt this point, such certainty does not exist.\n  What we do not yet know about Yucca Mountain and its suitability as a \nlong-term repository gives me great concern. For instance, how safe is \nit to house such a great volume of nuclear waste at a site that lies \nalong a natural fault line? Can a facility be built to withstand a \nmajor earthquake? There have not been sufficient answers to these and \nother questions. Many scientific studies have reached the same \nconclusion, namely that more research is needed before moving forward \nwith the Yucca Mountain site. Despite the incomplete scientific study \nof Yucca Mountain and the state of Nevada's steadfast opposition to the \nproject, the nuclear energy industry and other parties are said to have \npressured the Secretary of Energy to recommend that Yucca Mountain is a \nsuitable site for the repository.\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n  If Yucca Mountain is designated the primary repository for high-level \nnuclear waste, transportation of this hazardous material throughout the \ncountry will increase significantly. However, to date, the Department \nof Energy has not decided upon any plan on how to move this material to \nthe repository. It is another in a long line of uncertainty surrounding \nthe Yucca Mountain proposal. How will the material be moved? By train? \nBy barge? By truck? What kind of security will be involved? There is \nnot a single answer to any of these questions. Congress needs those \nanswers before signing off on this plan.\n  We need a long-term solution to the problem of securing nuclear \nwaste, and Yucca Mountain may ultimately prove to be a scientifically \nsound solution. But before we make a final decision on a repository \nwhich must have a 10,000-year life span, we must have absolute \ncertainty of the suitability of Yucca Mountain. The safety of citizens \nfor thousands of years to come depends on our prudence and careful \ndeliberation.\n  With these concerns in mind, I voted against this proposal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me recognize the action by the \nSenate and thank those who participated in the debate, and Senator \nReid, Senator Ensign. I certainly understand and appreciate the \nposition they have taken. I thought the discussion and presentation \nthroughout the debate was certainly evidence of their concern for the \nState of Nevada.\n  On the other hand, this has been with us for a long time, 20 years. I \nthink the Senate has acted responsibly today.\n  Let me thank certain staff members who have done a great deal of \nwork. I will be very brief: Colleen Deegan, Jennifer Owen, Brian \nMalnak, Josh Bowlen, Macy Bell, Jim Beirne, our chart man, Joe \nBrenckle; and on the majority: Sam Fowler, Bob Simon, and of course \nSenator Bingaman.\n  Many others worked so diligently. We want to thank those in the \nindustry who assisted in bringing this matter to the attention of all \nMembers, encouraging that we act in a prudent manner, with dispatch. I \nmost appreciate the two leaders who are recognizing that we can take \nthe time today to dispose of this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. What is the will of the Senate?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Parliamentary inquiry: What is the pending business?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6491-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6491-S6496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING REFORM AND INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT OF 2002--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2673) to improve quality and transparency in \n     financial reporting and independent audits and accounting \n     services for public companies, to create a Public Company \n     Accounting Oversight Board, to enhance the standard setting \n     process for accounting practices, to strengthen the \n     independence of firms that audit public companies, to \n     increase corporate responsibility and the usefulness of \n     corporate financial disclosure, to protect the objectivity \n     and independence of securities analysts, to improve \n     Securities and Exchange Commission resources and oversight, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is now pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Miller amendment, No. 4176.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask for the regular order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. May we have order, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Members will take their conversations off the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is a procedural question following the Miller \namendment. We have been discussing that. We may be able to resolve it, \nbut we need to do that overnight.\n  I call for the regular order which, as I understand it, would take us \nback to the Leahy amendment, with the McConnell amendment pending to \nLeahy?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I call for the regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4175\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield for a question? We are on, am I \ncorrect, the Leahy amendment which was pending to it the McConnell \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, the matter before the Senate now is \nthe McConnell amendment; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this amendment of the Senator from \nKentucky is what we call around here and everywhere a poison pill \namendment intended to prevent serious action on corporate \naccountability. Just as a few Republicans sought to stop campaign \nfinance reform with similar amendments, now they are trying to block \naction to make executives accountable. The lack of corporate \nresponsibility in the United States has undermined the credibility of \nour markets and devastated the retirement savings of millions of \nAmericans.\n  This widespread abuse of corporate power has jeopardized our Nation's \neconomic recovery and hurt the legitimacy of our fundamental \ninstitutions. We must not call for the obstructionism of Senate \nRepublicans. Instead, we must heed the call of the American people and \ninsist on bold action this week to ensure that corporations are made \naccountable and that workers and investors are protected against these \nabuses.\n  The Leahy amendment, which my Republican colleagues seek to block, \nwas unanimously approved by the Judiciary Committee in April. It \nincludes critical measures to strengthen the ability of Federal \nprosecutors to detect, prevent, and prosecute corporate fraud. It makes \nacts of document shredding and corporate fraud punishable by 10 years \nin prison. It lengthens the statute of limitations for victims of \nsecurity fraud.\n  Finally, the bill directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to review \ncriminal penalties for obstruction of justice and corporate fraud.\n  Today, Americans are outraged by the endless corporate scandals, and \nCongress must act to hold corporate crooks fully accountable and to \nrestore confidence in our markets.\n  Defeating the ``poison pill'' amendment offered by Senator McConnell \nis the first step toward that goal. Senator McConnell's amendment would \nput America's workers in double jeopardy. The amendment puts new \nrequirements on workers' representatives, despite the fact that these \nofficials currently face disclosure and reporting requirements which \nsurpass those of public companies.\n  This amendment would subject small local unions with annual receipts \nof only $200,000, which are already subject to labor reporting \nrequirements, to the same SEC reporting requirements as large public \ncompanies which typically have resources in the millions.\n  The reality is that union finances are already more heavily regulated \nthan those of most public companies. The Department of Labor under \ncurrent law can investigate and audit union financial records at any \ntime, including conducting random audits. There is no comparable \nrequirement for public companies today.\n  There are many other examples of current labor laws requiring much \nstricter disclosure by unions than the SEC requires of publicly traded \ncompanies. Unions have to list every employee who receives more than \n$10,000. But the SEC does not require this of companies. Unions have to \nprovide more detailed information regarding their loans than do public \ncompanies under SEC requirements. Unions have to provide more detailed \nlists of their investment today than do public companies under the SEC \nrequirements.\n  The list goes on and on and on.\n  For over 40 years under labor laws, union officials have been \nrequired to certify the annual financial reporting of their unions \nunder penalty of perjury.\n  The McConnell amendment certification requirement ignores the \nsafeguards that already exist under our labor laws. Union officials are \nalready subject to criminal penalties, which include jail time for \nwillfully failing to\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nfile reports, or knowingly making false statements, or willfully \nconcealing documents. Union officials who violate these provisions are \nsubject to jail time as well as substantial fines.\n  It is misguided to apply SEC requirements and penalties which were \ndesigned for publicly traded companies to not-for-profit groups such as \nunions. Even the Department of Labor recognizes this.\n  Don Todd, Deputy Assistant Secretary in charge of the Department's \nUnion Reporting Office, wrote last August regarding SEC requirements \nthat the Department of Labor does not have the expertise to provide \nmore than a very general overview of this complex area of law. Why in \nthe world would we want to force the labor unions to comply with SEC \nfiling requirements when the relevant oversight agency doesn't \nunderstand this area of the law?\n  The bottom line here is that the Republicans fear corporate \nresponsibility. They know the American people are outraged by the \nendless series of corporate scandals that are hurting workers, \nretirees, and our economic recovery. Rather than admit the scope of \ncorporate corruption and the urgency of criminal penalties for corrupt \nexecutives proposed by Senator Leahy, the Republicans are seeking to \npoison the well. If we allow this, the American people will never \nforgive us for passing up this unique opportunity to bring \naccountability to corporate executives. Corporate criminals must be \nmade to pay for their misdeeds.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the McConnell amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, first of all, let me point out something. \nSenator McConnell's amendment changes nothing in the Leahy amendment. \nThe adoption of Senator McConnell's amendment does nothing to change \nthe Leahy amendment. I understand that Senator McConnell tomorrow is \ngoing to come over and speak at great length on his amendment. But I \ndon't want anyone to be deceived as to what the amendment is about.\n  The amendment has nothing to do with the Leahy amendment in terms of \nits adoption in any way delaying or changing the Leahy amendment.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has proposed a simple proposition that I \nbelieve is unassailable logically. That proposition is we are going to \nput penalties on filing false reports by corporations, and we are going \nto in the process send people to prison for it. I support that \nprovision. I think there are probably 100 Members of the Senate who \nsupport that part of Senator Leahy's amendment.\n  The Senator from Kentucky simply asks the question: Why don't we \nrequire that labor unions, when they submit financial statements once a \nyear, have them audited by CPAs? Second, why don't we have them sign \nthose reports and be accountable for their accuracy?\n  I am sure that people who do not want unions subjected to \ntransparency and to accountability are going to say: Well, this is an \neffort to circumvent requirements on corporate America. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth. This amendment does not strike the Leahy \namendment. It simply adds a simple provision to it that applies \nparallel standards to unions.\n  Senator Kennedy says this neglects existing law. The point is that \nthe existing law is not very strong. Many unions don't even submit \nthese reports. You could argue on the corporate side that we already \nhave a body of law; why are we writing new laws? We are writing new \nlaws because we need stronger and better laws. We have a bipartisan \nconsensus that we do it.\n\n  Also, Senator Kennedy says the veracity of these reports should \nfollow under another jurisdiction. We are talking about accounting. We \nare talking about accuracy in reporting. We are talking about \ntransparency. We are talking about accountability. Surely union \nmembers, in reading a report, should have the same confidence that it \nis valid, that a certified public accountant who is subject to high \nethical standards wrote the report, and that the president of the \nunions certifies it, and that the president is going to be held \naccountable if it doesn't meet the standards we are setting.\n  Let me just summarize, since we are going to debate this amendment \ntomorrow, by saying:\n  No. 1, this amendment does not change the Leahy amendment. If you are \nfor the Leahy amendment, that is fine.\n  The question the Senator from Kentucky poses is, should similar \nparallel requirements be imposed on unions that issue a financial \nstatement annually, and should they have to be certified by a certified \npublic accountant? And should the president of the union have to sign \nthe report as the president of a corporation does? Should they be held \nliable if the report is not accurate and if they knowingly file an \ninaccurate report?\n  That is the question.\n  No. 2, it seems to me it is perfectly reasonable. You might be for \nit, and you might be against it, but you can't say it has anything to \ndo with trying to undo the Leahy amendment.\n  It seems to me that if you are against it, you have to explain why \nunions should not be required to meet high standards in filing reports.\n  I haven't spoken on the Leahy amendment. It is my understanding we \nare going to be debating it tomorrow. I would like to simply outline \nwhat is in the amendment that I am for and what is in the amendment \nthat I am against. I can do it very briefly.\n  If people knowingly and willfully violate the law, I support putting \nthem in prison. The President has proposed doubling the sentence. I am \nfor that. I hope at some point the administration will give us \nlegislative language to implement the changes the President proposed \ntoday. I am hopeful that on a bipartisan basis we can adopt it on the \nfloor of the Senate as part of this bill.\n  If we do not have time to do it, I have every reason to believe there \nwill be bipartisan support to make those changes and those additions, \nthose strengthening amendments in conference.\n  There is only one part of the Leahy amendment to which I object. \nUnfortunately, it is a very important part of the amendment that no one \nis focusing on when they are talking about the Leahy amendment. In \nfact, I would move that we simply accept the Leahy amendment except for \nthis small but important provision.\n  I remind my colleagues that in 1995, on a bipartisan basis, we \nadopted the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, legislation that \nbasically amended securities laws to deal with the whole issue of \npredatory strike suits where one law firm was filing 80 percent of the \nlawsuits against corporate America and we had a reform of corporate \nliability. That bill was adopted on a bipartisan vote. It is the only \nbill that we overrode President Clinton's veto on in 8 years in office.\n  One of the reforms was to set statute of limitations requirements \nthat basically paralleled the securities acts from the 1930s. What we \nsaid is, if you want to file a lawsuit, you have to do it within a year \nof when you know there was a violation or within 3 years of when the \nviolation occurred.\n  The whole point of statute of limitations is, that beyond some point \nit is very difficult to maintain records. You do not know what \nhappened. People's memories fade. People die. This was part of this \nimportant reform.\n  The Leahy amendment effectively throws out the 1 year and the 3-year \nstatute of limitations and adopts a 5-year limitation. Now, he claims \nit is a 2-year and 5-year, but the 2 year applies only if you can prove \nthat the person who filed the lawsuit knew that the violation occurred \noutside of the 2 years. I would assert that is virtually impossible to \nprove.\n  It is interesting, in statute of limitations, where you are saying \nyou have to act on a timely basis because people do not have knowledge \nafter periods of time expire, under this, you have to have enough \nknowledge to prove that they knew, which I think is a standard that \ncould not possibly work. No one really believes it could work.\n  So the reality is, we are striking the 1-year and the 3-year statute \nof limitations in the securities litigation reform bill, and we are \nsubstituting a 5-year statute of limitations for it. That is a \nprovision that I oppose. Every other part of the Leahy amendment I \nsupport. I personally would be willing to see it accepted by unanimous \nconsent save that one provision in the bill. I think it is an important \nprovision.\n  But I want people to know, as we go into the debate, that my support \nfor\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nthe McConnell amendment has nothing to do with the Leahy amendment; it \nsimply has to do with having been convinced that there is logic to the \nMcConnell position.\n  If we are trying to get transparency in financial reporting, if we \nare trying to hold people accountable, if we want honest numbers, it \nseems to me the logical place would be to start with Government, which \nwe have not done. But the second point, it seems to me, is to apply the \nsame standard to business and to labor. That is what McConnell has \ndone.\n  Tomorrow we will have the debate on it, but I wanted to outline what \nthe amendment did and did not do and my position on the Leahy \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Madam President, I am prompted to enter this debate by \nthe comments of my colleague from Texas. You cannot evaluate the \nparallelism of the McConnell amendment without evaluating the \nrequirements that are now imposed upon labor unions under the Labor-\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. The argument that this \nis logical is only if you drop out of the picture or the context the \nfact that the unions are now under extensive reporting requirements in \nthe law, requirements that significantly exceed, in many respects, \nanything that is required of corporations.\n  Now, the Department of Labor has the authority to conduct audits of \nlabor unions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. According to the statute, it can conduct those audits \nrandomly, as I understand. Does the Senator agree with me that these \naudits can be done randomly? According to the statute, it says right \nhere, in section 601(a):\n\n       The Secretary shall have power when he believes it \n     necessary in order to determine whether any person has \n     violated . . . any provision of [the legislation] . . . to \n     make an investigation and in connection therewith. . . .\n\n  And they may enter such places to inspect such records and accounts \nin question.\n  Does the current underlying legislation permit the SEC to conduct \nrandom auditing of public entities?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The auditing is done by the independent public \naccountants.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The point I am making is, at the current time, the \nDepartment of Labor can conduct an independent audit at any particular \ntime on any occasion, according to the Labor-Management Reporting Act.\n  Beyond that, it has the provision:\n\n       Every labor organization shall file annually with the \n     Secretary a financial report signed by its president and \n     treasurer or corresponding principal officers containing the \n     following information. . . .\n\n  And it lists all of that information. It already exists.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator from Kentucky says they are not filing \nthese reports. What are the Secretary of Labor and the Department of \nLabor doing, because they have the power to make them file their \nreports. In fact, they can impose penalties, as I understand it, \nincluding not only fines but also imprisonment for the failure of union \nofficials to meet the requirements under the statute.\n  My dear colleague from Texas says, well, look, this thing is on all \nfours. This is what we are doing to the corporations. And all the \nMcConnell amendment does is it does it to the unions. Now, who could be \nagainst that?\n  But let's look at what is already being done to the unions. Let's \nlook at the requirements under which they already have to function. \nLet's look at the powers that the Department of Labor and the Secretary \nof Labor have with respect to this matter.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You can make the same argument the SEC has the power to \naudit any company in America today. Any exchange they are a member of \nhas the power to audit them today. We are saying we need better, \nstronger, more powerful laws. We need better reporting. People need \nbetter information.\n\n  All the Senator from Kentucky is saying is, why don't we apply the \nsame thing to the reports that are filed by labor unions.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes. You have the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Has the Senator examined, with any care, the reporting \nrequirements and the other matters that govern labor union reporting \nunder the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Only to the degree that I can say that all the arguments \nthat are being made, saying we do not need to improve reporting, are \narguments that someone could make with regard to corporate America. \nThey are already subject to random audits by the SEC. They are already \nsubject to random audits by exchanges. I am not making that argument \nbecause I do not believe it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What about the requirement on unions that they list the \nemployees whose total of salaries and other disbursements exceed \n$10,000, including position, gross salary, allowances, and \ndisbursements? What about that requirement that is imposed on the \nunions to make that kind of disclosure? Where is a comparable \ndisclosure in that regard with respect to corporations?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. Certainly.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I say, if the Senator wanted to offer an amendment to \nimpose that, he certainly could. And I will stop asking him to yield, \nbut let me make this point.\n  Mr. SARBANES. To impose it on corporations, you support that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. If you offer that amendment, I would have to read it. I \nprobably wouldn't.\n  Mr. SARBANES. All right.\n  Mr. GRAMM. But the point I am making is, we are talking about two \nthings. One thing that you have to have is a CPA do the audit, and, \ntwo, the president of the union and the president of the company has to \nsign the report. They are liable if they knowingly are misleading \npeople. Those are the only two things the McConnell amendment does.\n\n  I just can't see what is wrong with it and why it doesn't make sense. \nNot that there is anything wrong with that part of the Leahy amendment; \nI support that part of the Leahy amendment. I just don't understand why \nthis does violence to organized labor. It seems to me it makes \nperfectly good sense.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply say that a statutory structure has been worked \nout for labor which is quite extensive and exceeds in many respects \nanything that applies to corporations. You can't make a judgment about \nwhether you should do anything additional to the unions until you \nexamine carefully what is already required from them under the existing \nstatutory scheme. That is not happening here.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield.\n  Mr. DODD. It occurs to me as well, in this bill, we are not requiring \nfor all businesses these requirements. These are for businesses that \nhave to file with the SEC.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is right, which is a limited universe.\n  Mr. DODD. It is a limited universe. My point is, we are not talking \nabout every entity that conducts business for profit. We excluded the \noverwhelming majority of businesses that are private entities, that \nhave no filing requirements with the SEC. Our colleague from Wyoming \nfelt very strongly about this point, that we only deal with public \ncompanies, the 16,000 public companies.\n  Let me ask my colleague this question: Is a labor union a for-profit \nbusiness or are they a different kind of an entity? I have always \nunderstood a labor union was not a business and therefore to require of \nthe labor union that which we require of a for-profit company that is \nrequired to file with the SEC seems to be mixing apples and oranges. \nThere is no parallelism here at all.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely correct. The unions ought to \nhave reporting requirements and they ought to file.\n  Mr. DODD. Correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Those have been put into law. There are extensive \nauthorities in the Secretary of Labor and the\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nDepartment with respect to the unions--quite extensive authorities, I \nmight add.\n  We have established one statutory framework to control the reporting \nrequirements and disclosure on the part of unions, which is a \ncompletely separate universe from what we are trying to address in this \nlegislation.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. It is in a sense apples and oranges. \nYou are dealing with two different universes, and you have established \ntwo different statutory frameworks within which to address that.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Senator from Texas were interested in creating a \nsense of uniformity, I could see him offering an amendment--I wouldn't \nagree with it--which would require that all businesses that are \nconducting their operations for profit be subjected to an accounting \nstandard that was equal. Again, my friend from Wyoming would \nstrenuously object to such an amendment. I would as well because of the \nreasons that smaller companies just could not possibly afford the costs \nassociated with that. But to suggest somehow that a nonprofit \norganization ought to be subjected to the same rules as a for-profit \npublic company where shareholders and so forth are involved is \nstretching logic.\n  I appreciate my colleague yielding.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is obvious that one of the distinctions we sought to \nmake in the underlying bill that is before us is that when a company \nbecomes public, you then have an investor interest that has to be \nprotected. Otherwise, manipulation destroys investor confidence and \naffects the confidence in our capital markets. That is the issue we are \nconfronting now and the impact it is having on the economy.\n  That was the universe we tried to deal with in this legislation. We \nwere very careful that the legislation does not apply to most \nbusinesses in America and doesn't apply to most accountants in America, \nsince most of them don't audit public companies.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I remind my colleagues that in some 40 States in the \nUnion, you can't work unless you are a member of a union. If unions are \nnot public organizations, when you have mandatory requirements, I can't \nwork in Maryland in an area that is unionized without either joining \nthe union or paying union dues. To suggest that unions are somehow \nprivate when you have mandatory membership I think won't hold water.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield, you don't have mandatory \nmembership. You may have a requirement that you pay a union fee, but \nthe union then has an obligation, if you are in a union shop, to \nrepresent you in the collective bargaining efforts and with grievances, \nand so forth and so on. So the union has to, in effect, provide you a \nservice for the fact that you get charged that fee.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am not saying you are not getting anything for it. I am \njust saying that it is mandatory, and I don't see how you cannot say \nthat unions are public institutions.\n  Secondly, why do we require CPAs to do audits of companies? We can't \naudit every company in America. We don't have enough resources. So you \ntry to get a system where the auditor has some degree of responsibility \nfor helping to enforce the standards. I don't see why you wouldn't have \nCPAs required to do the audits of unions.\n  I was handed this by Senator McConnell's staff. I am sorry he had an \nappointment tonight, but the OLMS, which does the compliance audits, \ndid a high of 1,583 audits in 1984. Last year, that was only 238. So I \ndon't know why you wouldn't want a union that has mandatory membership \nto have its reports done by CPAs who we are holding to a high standard \nin this bill. That is all I am saying.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What is the explanation by the Department of Labor for \nthis rather stunning drop in the number of audits? Was it from 1,500 to \n200 in 1 year's time or 2 years' time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is from 1984 to 2001.\n  I would say on that issue, if the Senator will yield, that the \nPresident's 2003 budget asked for an additional $3.4 million for 40 \nfull-time positions. It will be very interesting to see if we provide \nthe money for them to have it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That is the way to go at this problem; otherwise, it \nseems to me that the Department of Labor needs to do the job that it \nhas been charged to do. I think that is what those figures amply \ndemonstrate.\n  I am gratified that the administration's budget is seeking more money \nin order to meet these responsibilities, but that is where it ought to \nbe done.\n  Mr. GRAMM. My final point--and I appreciate the generosity of the \nchairman--it seems to me the most fundamental requirement is if you are \ngoing to make a public report and you have mandatory membership so you \nare a public institution, you ought to have a certified public \naccountant do that report and sign that they have done it.\n  We have decided--I think it is one of the best things in our bill; \nwhatever bill is adopted will have it--to require the heads of \ncompanies to sign these reports. I don't know why you wouldn't want the \nhead of the union to sign these reports.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Would the Senator support a provision that required all \ncompanies with annual receipts of $200,000 or more to meet all of these \nauditing requirements?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would if the companies were companies that people had to \ndo business with. If we had anything equivalent in the marketplace to a \nprovision that said you have to buy things from this company or you \ncan't buy them, which in essence we do in States that don't have right-\nto-work laws; we say that you have to pay the union dues in order to \nwork--you don't have to join, but you have to pay the dues--I think \nwhen you have that mandatory element, having to report publicly is \nlogical.\n  Mr. SARBANES. They do have to report publicly. They are now required \nto report publicly under the legislation that governs reporting and \ndisclosure. The Senator is speaking as though there are no such \nrequirements.\n  The fact of it is that there is an elaborately developed framework. \nNow, the Department of Labor may not be carrying it out fully, as the \nstatute would require. They may be falling short in that regard, but if \nthat is the case, the way to remedy the situation is to provide the \nresources to the Department of Labor and call upon them to do their \njob.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this is Mr. McConnell's amendment, and I \nwill let him debate it. But the whole purpose of having CPAs, the whole \npurpose of having licensing and the taking of oaths is we cannot audit \nevery company by the Government. I am pleased to say that nobody has \nproposed to have the Government take over the auditing function. We \nhave proposed to strengthen the CPA process and impose higher standards \nbecause that is really our fundamental line of defense.\n  I just don't understand. It seems to me this would be a logical \namendment to take. It only says two things: When unions file a report, \nit has to be done by a CPA. You have a mandatory membership of unions \nin some 40 States, and they are public institutions. Secondly, the \npresident of the union, as the president of the company, ought to have \nto verify the veracity of the statement and be liable if he knowingly \nis certifying it when he knows it is not valid. I mean you are not \nholding him accountable if somebody has not told him the truth.\n  Senator McConnell is going to present case and verse of all of the \nproblems. I don't know the problems, but it seems to me that when we \nare trying to improve reporting and improve transparency and improve \naccountability, the simple proposal that when unions file their annual \nreport, as corporations do, a CPA should prepare the report--I just \ncannot imagine not requiring that.\n  Secondly, the president of the union ought to have to sign the report \nand be accountable if he knowingly is saying something that is not \ntrue.\n  Finally, the argument that there are other requirements--well, there \nare more requirements on corporate America. We just concluded there \nwere not enough. So Senator McConnell is simply saying while you are \nimproving one, improve both. If I were a member of a union, I would \nlike having certified by a CPA a report showing how my money was spent. \nI think it would give me more confidence. I would think if the rank-\nand-file union members in my State would vote on this, there would\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nbe an overwhelming vote for it. I don't even know why we are debating \nthis. This is sort of a no-brainer, in my opinion. But my opinion may \nnot be the majority opinion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Texas, this \nis a no-brainer amendment because I cannot quite understand why we \nwould be establishing a standard here for labor unions. It reminds me \nof when I was raising my kids and my wife and I had to give one of our \nchildren medicine that they didn't want. My daughter would say: I would \nfeel a lot better if my brother had to take it, too. That is what we \nare having here--businesses faced with corporate corruption. Frankly, \nwe have people on the Senate floor saying, as painful as it is for us \nto make more disclosures, we would feel better if you could also hurt \nthe labor unions while you are at it. Is that what this is about--to \ntry to find a parity of pain between business and labor? I didn't think \nso.\n  The point made by the Senator from Maryland is that labor unions \nalready face extraordinary reporting requirements in a law that has \nbeen in place for 43 years--requirements not made of many businesses. \nIn the McConnell-Gramm amendment, it suggests that if your labor union \nhas receipts of $200,000 a year, they are going to add a new burden to \nthe labor unions--even beyond this 43-year-old law.\n  I listened closely as the Senator from Maryland explained the bill \nbefore us. He has worked closely with the Senator from Wyoming to make \nsure it just applies to public corporations, where there is public \ninvestment in stockholders and where there is an item of public trust \ninvolved. That is understandable.\n  So if I would stand before the Members here and say, if you really \nbelieve in transparency and disclosure, you ought to apply these \nrequirements to every business in America, many people would say that \nis an onerous and unnecessary burden; it goes beyond the issue of \npublic trust; now you are going after every business, large and small. \nThat is what the McConnell-Gramm amendment does when it comes to labor \nunions. They say if a labor union has receipts of $200,000, they have a \nbrandnew set of requirements. The Senator from Texas says these unions \nare public institutions, they should not be treated as if they are \nprivate. Well, they are not. They are subject to the 1959 Labor-\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure Act.\n  The thing that also concerns me is that many requirements of the \nlabor unions under current law are far stricter than what is required \nunder the SEC for public corporations. I cannot understand why we would \nwant to increase the burden on labor unions when the issue appears to \nbe, at Enron, not a union problem but a business problem. The issue at \nEnron had to do with members of the board of directors being paid--\naccording to the Governmental Affairs recent report--$350,000 a year to \nserve on the board and, frankly, missing it completely, or didn't \nreport it when things were being done that defrauded stockholders, \npensioners, and ultimately cost employees their jobs.\n  That, I thought, was what this debate was about. Instead, we are \ntalking about right-to-work and labor unions. I am sorry, but I don't \nthink people across America believe the problems of Enron and WorldCom \nand Global Crossing had anything to do with labor unions. They didn't. \nThey had to do with corporate greed and corruption.\n  I commend Senators Sarbanes and Enzi for bringing to the floor a bill \nthat addresses this in a straightforward manner. The McConnell-Gramm \namendment wants to get us on another track to discuss other things. I \nfind this interesting. There is no proposal that this new requirement \nbe applied to any other organization than labor unions. I don't hear \nanybody coming before us and suggesting that the Boy Scouts of America \nshould be subject to SEC filing. That is a large organization. They \ncertainly have receipts beyond $200,000. I don't hear the suggestion \nthat associations and organizations like the Boy Scouts of America, or \nthe American Legion--I don't want to go too far with this--or the \nFederalist Society should have more transparency and disclosure and, \ntherefore, should be subject to SEC filings. Nobody brought that up. Is \nthat part of the problem in America, the lack of confidence in our \neconomy? Not at all.\n\n  The problem relates to corporations and businesses that have gone too \nfar and lied to the stockholders and the American people. If we get off \nthe track here and decide we are going to go after other battles to be \nfought, whether labor unions or other organizations, we have missed the \npoint. I think this amendment misses the point.\n  Let me also say that the McConnell amendment holds labor unions to \nstandards to which not even businesses are being held. In 1995, I \nhappened to be a Member of the House when the so-called Newt Gingrich \n``Contract on America'' came through. One of the things we did there, I \nam afraid, turned out to be a precursor to what we are going through \ntoday in what was known then as securities litigation reform. We \nbasically said we think some of these plaintiff lawyers, class action \nlawyers, have gone too far and therefore we are going to protect many \ncorporations from liability when it comes to securities transactions. I \nwas 1 of 99 in the House of Representatives who voted against that bill \nand wanted to sustain President Clinton's veto. We did not prevail. We \nlost in the House and in the Senate.\n  It really, sadly, set the stage for where we are today. Another \nwatchdog was gone. Corporations such as Enron and WorldCom didn't have \nto worry about somebody bringing an action against them for securities \nmisdeeds.\n  One of the things that was included in the 1995 law was to take away \nliability for aiding and abetting, in terms of rights of action, causes \nof action involving corporate fraud. We exempted a whole category of \npeople who, up until that time, had been liable for aiding and abetting \nfraud. We said in the name of securities litigation reform, we would \nexempt this category of individuals.\n  Senator McConnell comes up with this amendment and says: We want to \nreinstate that aiding and abetting liability, not for businesses, but \nwe want to put it on labor unions. What is wrong with this picture? We \nare not imposing it on corporations despite all the scandals we have \nread about; instead, we are going to impose this new obligation on \nlabor unions.\n  I am afraid, frankly, that is not a matter of public policy, it is a \nmatter of retribution. I also think we should take a look at how many \nlabor unions could be liable for this audit that is required. There are \n70 national and international unions, but the McConnell-Gramm amendment \nwould apply to 5,000 different unions, large and small, across America. \nIt goes way too far.\n  The amendment certification requirements are also redundant. For more \nthan 40 years, union officers have been required to sign annual \nfinancial reports, under penalty of perjury, attesting that the \nreport's information accurately describes the union's financial \ncondition and operations. That is a pretty reasonable standard for \nlabor unions under current law.\n  We are trying to impose similar standards on corporations so when \nthey file their accounting audit statements, someone puts their name on \nit and accepts responsibility for the truth and accuracy of the \nstatement.\n  Frankly, I think Senator McConnell and Senator Gramm have this \ntotally upside down. The problems we face--the corporate corruption, \nthe lack of confidence in the economy, which even the President spoke \nabout today--have nothing to do with labor unions. They really have to \ndo with corporations that have an obligation to the public.\n  I believe the vast majority of businesses and corporations in America \nare run by honest people, working hard to make a profit to provide \ngoods, services, and jobs to make America a better place. I do believe \nthat. But there are some who have violated the public trust. The \nunderlying bill addresses that. To bring in an argument now about \nimposing new obligations on labor unions not only misses the point \ncompletely as to why we are here this evening but misses the point \nabout why we are facing this crisis in America.\n  I stand in opposition to the McConnell-Gramm amendment, and I hope \nall\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nof my colleagues will join me in remembering why this debate got \nstarted.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I, too, wish to verbalize my opposition \nto this amendment that tries to draw in a completely extraneous item \nwhich has not been debated in the context of this bill in the 10 \ncommittee hearings we had with regard to putting together the Corporate \nCorruption and Investor Protection Act.\n  It has not been involved in any of the President's discussions about \ncorporate abuse or fraud that we have heard discussed. It is not in any \nway related to the group of organizations with which we are attempting \nto deal, which are large, publicly traded corporations, and really \nignores the fact that there is already a body of law that deals with \nunion organizations and union officers with regard to their \nresponsibility to their memberships and for their reporting \nrequirements.\n  For a whole host of reasons, I do not understand how this even \nrelates to the issue that is the fundamental part of the underlying \nbill, and there certainly is not any evidence in the marketplace of \nideas and activities across America that would justify pulling labor \nunions by their actions into the fish net about which we are talking. \nThis is about corporate corruption. It is about investor protection. It \nis about making sure corporate fraud is properly dealt with in the \nlegal system, one that puts everyone on notice that they have serious \nresponsibilities to certify that what is reported is real, and if it is \nnot real, then people are held accountable.\n  We are off on the wrong track, and if we end up having too many of \nthese diversionary tactics away from the underlying principles of what \nwe are trying to accomplish, which is to have measured, reasonable, and \nthoughtful progress with regard to corporate responsibility, corporate \naccountability, accounting reform, and investor protection, public \nprotection, then I think we are going to miss the opportunity to secure \nour economy, to secure the steps that are necessary for most people to \nrestart this engine of investment that drives our economy. This is \ncompletely off point.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will recognize it for what it is \nand move on, turn this down, and get on with the underlying amendment \nthat Senator Leahy has so appropriately brought to bear in this case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 12, \n2001 in Huntington, NY. A man, who was drunk, tried to run over a \nPakistani woman in the parking lot of a shopping mall, according to \npolice. The man then followed the woman into the mall and threatened to \nkill her for ``destroying my country.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6496-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RESTORATION AND REDEDICATION OF THE GEORGETOWN CIRCLE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I recognize the rededication \nof ``The Circle'' in Georgetown, DE scheduled for July 19. Thanks to \nthe great efforts and hard work of the citizens of Georgetown, this \nhistoric site has been restored to its original splendor.\n  The Circle was established in 1791 by an act of the Delaware General \nAssembly. Subsequently, the town of Georgetown was laid out around the \nCircle. While Delawareans knew of its historic and cultural \nsignificance, it was confirmed nationally in 1973 when The Circle was \nplaced on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  Georgetown has long been famous for Return Day, a celebration that \ntakes place every 2 years, 2 days after the state's general election. \nWith the campaign behind them, voters and candidate's return to the \nCircle to enjoy parades, listen to music, and literally ``bury a \nhatchet.'' We talk a lot in my State about working together, about \nputting aside partisan differences to cross party lines to get things \ndone. This celebration at the Circle embodies that effort and \ncommitment.\n  Over the years, the Circle fell to a state of disrepair. Once a place \nof stately honor, financial assistance was needed to return the Circle \nto its original state. The community of Georgetown joined together and \nformed a committee to oversee the repairs and maintain the historic \nbeauty of the site. The repairs were financed through a Transportation \nEnhancement Grant from the Federal Highway Administration, the Delaware \nDepartment of Transportation, and members of the Delaware General \nAssembly from Sussex County. Together, these groups were able to \nprovide substantial funding for renovations. The residents of \nGeorgetown should be praised for their commitment to restoring the \nCircle. With their initiative and dedication, future generations will \nbe able to enjoy its rich history.\n  The July 19 rededication is a celebration of the community's \ncollective efforts. Delaware's future will be built upon its rich \nhistory. We must work hard to preserve these symbols of our past to \nensure that they are not forgotten. The citizens of Georgetown worked \nhard to ensure that the area's unique history will be preserved long \ninto the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6496-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6496-S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING WALTER JOHNSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, last month as sports fans around \nthe world focused their attention on soccer, the student athletes of \nSouth Carolina reminded this nation why baseball is America's game.\n  Both the University of South Carolina and Clemson University played \nin the final rounds for the national title. While the Senators from \nTexas have the bragging rights to the trophy, I can say this: the South \nCarolina teams had their most successful seasons ever and engaged in a \nrivalry that will long be remembered in my state.\n  This year, my alma mater Gamecocks won a record 57 games, in what was \nsupposed to have been a rebuilding year. In the last three years they \nhave had more wins than any team in the nation. In the tournament, they \nbeat their bitter rival Clemson twice, thus making it to the final game \nfor the first time since Jerry Ford was President. For Clemson it was a \nheartbreaking finish to an incredible run. For two months, the Tigers \nhad been ranked number one in the polls. They won 54 games, the most in \ntheir history, including winning 10 games against top 10 teams.\n  And although baseball is a team sport, this Senator cannot overlook \none player in particular: Clemson shortstop Khalil Greene. He was named \nnational player of the year. Hitting .470, he may have had the greatest \nseason any Clemson player in any sport has ever had. His season reminds \nme of when I was a very young fan, in 1930, and Babe Ruth earned \n$80,000 and was asked why did he make more money than President Hoover, \nand he replied, ``I had a better year than he did.''\n  In his professional life, Mr. Greene will probably have better years \nthan any United States Senator, including our Hall of Famer, Senator \nBunning. I congratulate Mr. Greene, University of South Carolina Coach \nRay Tanner, and Clemson coach Jack Leggett. And I salute all the \nplayers who on the field showed us what great athletes they are, and \nwho made this season the best ever for South Carolina baseball \nfans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6497-2", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6497-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVES MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6497-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2643.

PURPOSES OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       The purposes of assistance authorized by this title are--\n       (1) to help assure the security of the United States and \n     the world by reducing or eliminating the likelihood of \n     violence against United States or allied forces in \n     Afghanistan and to reduce the chance that Afghanistan will \n     again be a source of international terrorism;\n       (2) to support the continued efforts of the United States \n     and the international community to address the humanitarian \n     crisis in Afghanistan and among Afghan refugees in \n     neighboring countries;\n       (3) to fight the production and flow of illicit narcotics, \n     to control the flow of precursor chemicals used in the \n     production of heroin, and to enhance and bolster the \n     capacities of Afghan governmental authorities to control \n     poppy cultivation and related activities;\n       (4) to help achieve a broad-based, multi-ethnic, gender-\n     sensitive, and fully representative government in Afghanistan \n     that is freely chosen by the people of Afghanistan and that \n     respects the human rights of all Afghans, particularly women, \n     including authorizing assistance for the rehabilitation and \n     reconstruction of Afghanistan with a particular emphasis on \n     meeting the educational, health, and sustenance needs of \n     women and children to better enable their full participation \n     in Afghan society;\n       (5) to support the Government of Afghanistan in its \n     development of the capacity to facilitate, organize, develop, \n     and implement projects and activities that meet the needs of \n     the Afghan people;\n       (6) to foster the participation of civil society in the \n     establishment of the new Afghan government in order to \n     achieve a broad-based, multiethnic, gender-sensitive, fully \n     representative government freely chosen by the Afghan people, \n     without prejudice to any decisions which may be freely taken \n     by the Afghan people about the precise form in which their \n     government is to be organized in the future;\n       (7) to support the reconstruction of Afghanistan through, \n     among other things, programs that create jobs, facilitate \n     clearance of landmines, and rebuild the agriculture sector, \n     the health care system, and the educational system of \n     Afghanistan; and\n       (8) to include specific resources to the Ministry for \n     Women's Affairs of Afghanistan to\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\n     carry out its responsibilities for legal advocacy, education, \n     vocational training, and women's health programs.\n\n     SEC. 103. PRINCIPLES OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       The following principles should guide the provision of \n     assistance authorized by this title:\n       (1) Terrorism and narcotics control.--Assistance should be \n     designed to reduce the likelihood of harm to United States \n     and other allied forces in Afghanistan and the region, the \n     likelihood of additional acts of international terrorism \n     emanating from Afghanistan, and the cultivation, production, \n     trafficking, and use of illicit narcotics in Afghanistan.\n       (2) Role of women.--Assistance should increase the \n     participation of women at the national, regional, and local \n     levels in Afghanistan, wherever feasible, by enhancing the \n     role of women in decisionmaking processes, as well as by \n     providing support for programs that aim to expand economic \n     and educational opportunities and health programs for women \n     and educational and health programs for girls.\n       (3) Afghan ownership.--Assistance should build upon Afghan \n     traditions and practices. The strong tradition of community \n     responsibility and self-reliance in Afghanistan should be \n     built upon to increase the capacity of the Afghan people and \n     institutions to participate in the reconstruction of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (4) Stability.--Assistance should encourage the restoration \n     of security in Afghanistan, including, among other things, \n     the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of \n     combatants, and the establishment of the rule of law, \n     including the establishment of a police force and an \n     effective, independent judiciary.\n       (5) Coordination.--Assistance should be part of a larger \n     donor effort for Afghanistan. The magnitude of the \n     devastation--natural and man-made--to institutions and \n     infrastructure make it imperative that there be close \n     coordination and collaboration among donors. The United \n     States should endeavor to assert its leadership to have the \n     efforts of international donors help achieve the purposes \n     established by this title.\n\n     SEC. 104.

PROMOTING SECURE DELIVERY OF HUMANITARIAN AND OTHER \n                   ASSISTANCE IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The President has declared his view that the United \n     States should provide significant assistance to Afghanistan \n     so that it never again becomes a haven for terrorism.\n       (2) The delivery of humanitarian and reconstruction \n     assistance from the international community is necessary for \n     the safe return of refugees and is critical to the future \n     stability of Afghanistan.\n       (3) Enhanced stability in Afghanistan through an improved \n     security environment is critical to the fostering of the \n     Afghan Interim Authority and the traditional Afghan assembly \n     or ``Loya Jirga'' process, which is intended to lead to a \n     permanent national government in Afghanistan, and also is \n     essential for the participation of women in Afghan society.\n       (4) Incidents of violence between armed factions and local \n     and regional commanders, and serious abuses of human rights, \n     including attacks on women and ethnic minorities throughout \n     Afghanistan, create an insecure, volatile, and unsafe \n     environment in parts of Afghanistan, displacing thousands of \n     Afghan civilians from their local communities.\n       (5) The violence and lawlessness may jeopardize the ``Loya \n     Jirga'' process, undermine efforts to build a strong central \n     government, severely impede reconstruction and the delivery \n     of humanitarian assistance, and increase the likelihood that \n     parts of Afghanistan will once again become safe havens for \n     al-Qaida, Taliban forces, and drug traffickers.\n       (6) The lack of security and lawlessness may also \n     perpetuate the need for United States Armed Forces in \n     Afghanistan and threaten the ability of the United States to \n     meet its military objectives.\n       (7) The International Security Assistance Force in \n     Afghanistan, currently led by Turkey, and composed of forces \n     from other willing countries without the participation of \n     United States Armed Forces, is deployed only in Kabul and \n     currently does not have the mandate or the capacity to \n     provide security to other parts of Afghanistan.\n       (8) Due to the ongoing military campaign in Afghanistan, \n     the United States does not contribute troops to the \n     International Security Assistance Force but has provided \n     support to other countries that are doing so.\n       (9) The United States is providing political, financial, \n     training, and other assistance to the Afghan Interim \n     Authority as it begins to build a national army and police \n     force to help provide security throughout Afghanistan, but \n     this effort is not meeting the immediate security needs of \n     Afghanistan.\n       (10) Because of these immediate security needs, the Afghan \n     Interim Authority, its Chairman, Hamid Karzai, and many \n     Afghan regional leaders have called for the International \n     Security Assistance Force, which has successfully brought \n     stability to Kabul, to be expanded and deployed throughout \n     the country, and this request has been strongly supported by \n     a wide range of international humanitarian organizations, \n     including the International Committee of the Red Cross, \n     Catholic Relief Services, and Refugees International.\n       (11)(A) On January 29, 2002, the President stated that \n     ``[w]e will help the new Afghan government provide the \n     security that is the foundation of peace''.\n       (B) On March 25, 2002, the Secretary of Defense stated, \n     with respect to the reconstruction of Afghanistan, that ``the \n     first thing . . . you need for anything else to happen, for \n     hospitals to happen, for roads to happen, for refugees to \n     come back, for people to be fed and humanitarian workers to \n     move on the country . . . [y]ou've got to have security''.\n       (b) Statement of Policy.--It should be the policy of the \n     United States to support measures to help meet the immediate \n     security needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and \n     effective delivery of humanitarian and other assistance \n     throughout Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil \n     order, and support the formation of a functioning, \n     representative Afghan national government.\n       (c) Preparation of Strategy.--Not later than 45 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and every six months \n     thereafter, the President shall transmit to the Committee on \n     International Relations and the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate a \n     strategy for meeting the immediate and long-term security \n     needs of Afghanistan in order to promote safe and effective \n     delivery of humanitarian and other assistance throughout \n     Afghanistan, further the rule of law and civil order, and \n     support the formation of a functioning, representative Afghan \n     national government.\n\n     SEC. 207.

REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and annually thereafter, the President shall \n     transmit to Congress a written report on the progress of the \n     Government of Afghanistan toward the eradication of poppy \n     cultivation, the disruption of heroin production, and the \n     reduction of the overall supply and demand for illicit \n     narcotics in Afghanistan in accordance with the provisions of \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Thompson):\n  S. 2713. A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to make \ncertain modifications in the judicial discipline procedures, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Judicial \nImprovements Act of 2002, a bipartisan bill that will amend judicial \ndiscipline procedures to ensure fair consideration of judicial \nmisconduct complaints. I am pleased to have Senator Thompson as a \ncosponsor of this legislation, and I look forward to moving this bill \nthrough the Senate.\n  While I am introducing legislation addressing judicial misconduct, I \nwant\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nto be clear that the vast majority of judges serve honorably. As \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, I take a special responsibility \nfor evaluating nominees to ensure they are fit to serve. Despite the \nscrutiny judicial nominees undergo, however, we have faced situations \nwhen judges have acted improperly. Some have even been convicted of \ncriminal offenses. In the late 1980s, the Senate convicted three \nFederal judges who were impeached by the House. This bill does not \nalter the Congress' responsibility to impeach and convict judges where \nnecessary, but it does refine the process--originally created by \nCongress in the Judicial Councils Reform and Judicial Conduct and \nDisability Act of 1980, by which aggrieved citizens can bring \ncomplaints that can be evaluated through an impartial review.\n  Under the framework codified by this bill, a person with a complaint \nabout a judge's conduct may file a written complaint with the clerk of \nthe court of appeals for the judge's circuit. The chief judge must \nreview the complaint and either dismiss it, if it meets certain narrow \ncriteria, or refer it to a panel of judges from the circuit. The judge \nwho is the subject of the complaint retains the right to present \nevidence and argue before the panel. The circuit council may certify \nthe judge's misconduct of disability and request that the judge \nvoluntarily retire, but may not order removal from office. A \ncomplainant or judge aggrieved by an action of a judicial council can \npetition the Judicial Conference for review. And if a complaint is \ndismissed, the judge who was its subject may be reimbursed for \nreasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred during the \ninvestigation.\n  If a judicial council determines that an Article III judge has acted \nin a way that might constitute grounds of impeachment, it must certify \nsuch determination to the Judicial Conference, which can in turn refer \nthat determination to the House of Representatives.\n  With very limited exceptions, all matters related to judicial \nmisconduct investigations must be confidential and not disclosed by any \nperson in any proceeding. This provision protects judges who are \naccused falsely of wrongdoing while also ensuring confidentiality for \nthose with legitimate complaints.\n  The bill also forbids judges who have been convicted of a State or \nFederal felony and have exhausted all available means for direct review \nof that conviction from hearing or deciding cases or accruing credit \ntoward retirement benefits, unless the judicial council of the circuit \ndetermines otherwise. This measure, like many of the measures in this \nlegislation, was recommended in 1993 by the nonpartisan National \nCommission on Judicial Discipline and Removal.\n  Some may question whether this bill raises separation of powers \nconcerns. It does not. This bill is narrowly tailored, as was the 1980 \nlaw that this bill amends, to ensure that Congress gives the judiciary \nthe powers it needs to regulate itself while preserving its \nconstitutional role in the impeachment process. The general scheme we \nestablished in 1980 has worked well, and has conformed with our \nconstitutional principles. This bill simply seeks to improve that \nsystem where it has shown to be lacking. To give one example, experts \nin this area have suggested that many litigants and interested parties \nare unaware of the existence of these procedures--to rectify that, we \ncreate a separate chapter within title 28 of the U.S. Code to promote \nknowledge and use of these procedures. It also clarifies the authority \nof the chief judge of a circuit and the standard by which a compliant \ncan be dismissed as frivolous, and makes explicit that complaints can \nbe referred to a five-member panel for examination.\n  Highly similar legislation has already been reported from the House \nJudiciary Committee with strong bipartisan support. I hope that my \ncolleagues in the Senate review and support this bill, and that we can \nmake it law this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 2713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Judicial Improvements Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nencouraging the ongoing peace process in Sri Lanka. It was recently \nannounced that Norway has agreed to mediate a new round of peace talks. \nThe peace process brings hope that a continued commitment to democracy \nand human rights might be realized through lasting peace.\n  The roots of the current crisis began in the early 1800's when Sri \nLanka fell subject to British colonial rule. Indian Tamil laborers were \nbrought to Sri Lanka to develop and maintain numerous plantations. This \npractice doubled the number of Tamils in Sri Lanka and further \ndiversified the population. In 1948, Sri Lanka gained its independence \nfrom Britain and rose above bitter communal and religious issues and \nestablished a democratize government.\n  Regrettably, issues of language and alleged government bias propelled \nthis once peaceful nation into brutal civil war. The Liberation Tigers \nof Tamil Eelam became the leading rebel group in the struggle against \nthe government. Over the last two decades, an estimated sixty-five \nthousand people have been killed and one million have been displaced by \nthe fighting. The nation once referred to as the ``pearl upon the brow \nof India'' has become known as the ``fallen tear.''\n  The situation is not without hope. The people of Sri Lanka demand \npeace and with the assistance of Norway, the sides have once again \nreturned to the negotiating table. Past failures shed some light on the \ndifficult path that lies ahead and the tremendous work that lies before \nNorwegian mediators. Norway's offer to mediate talks was accepted in \n1999. By keeping the negotiations secret, Norway has gained the \ncautious trust and respect of both sides. The fighting has ceased, and \nnegotiations are planned to begin in Thailand in the near future.\n  One of my constituents, the Reverend Paul Jahn, and the Indiana-\nKentucky Conference have placed a critical role in bringing peace to \nSri Land. Reverend Jahn and the conference have dedicated a significant \namount of time and effort to this important effort. They have raised \nsignificant amounts of funding for various relief efforts in Sri Lanka \nand continue to make valuable contributions to the peace process. I \nwant to thank Reverend Jahn, a minister at St. Peter and Trinity United \nChurch of Christ in Lamar, IN, and the Conference for suggesting the \nimportant role this resolution could play in expressing American \nsupport for the peace process.\n  I urge the Congress, through this resolution, to express its support \nfor these efforts and to encourage both sides to resolve their \ndifferences as expeditiously as possible. The United States finds \nitself at a time when our international responsibilities are great, and \nyet it remains essential that we continue to support the realization of \npeace and democracy wherever it exists.

Res. 301\n\n       Whereas Galesburg, Illinois, has been linked to the history \n     of railroading since 1849 when the Peoria and Oquawka \n     Railroad was organized;\n       Whereas the citizens of Galesburg supported a railroad to \n     Chicago which was chartered as the Central Military Tract \n     Railroad in 1851;\n       Whereas upon completion of the Central Military Tract \n     Railroad, the Northern Cross Railroad joined the Central \n     Military Tract Railroad at Galesburg;\n       Whereas in 1886 Galesburg secured the Atchison, Topeka and \n     Santa Fe Railway and became one of the few places in the \n     world served by 2 major railroads;\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc., has been \n     established in Galesburg and chartered under the laws of the \n     State of Illinois as a not-for-profit corporation;\n       Whereas the objectives of the National Railroad Hall of \n     Fame, Inc., include (1) perpetuating the memory of leaders \n     and innovators in the railroad industry, (2) fostering, \n     promoting, and encouraging a better understanding of the \n     origins and growth of railroads, especially in the United \n     States, and (3) establishing and maintaining a library and \n     collection of documents, reports and other items of value to \n     contribute to the education of all persons interested in \n     railroading; and\n       Whereas the National Railroad Hall of Fame, Inc., is \n     planning to erect a monument known as the National Railroad \n     Hall of Fame to honor the men and women who actively \n     participated in the founding and development of the railroad \n     industry in the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the National Railroad \n     Hall of Fame, Inc., of Galesburg, Illinois, in its endeavor \n     to erect a monument known as the National Railroad Hall of \n     Fame.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution with \nmy colleague, Senator Peter Fitzgerald, in support of the establishment \nof the National Railroad Hall of Fame in Galesburg, IL.\n  The State of Illinois has played a pioneering role in the growth of \nthe railroad industry. The history of Illinois railroading dates back \nto 1837 with the creation of the Northern Cross Railroad linking the \nIllinois and Mississippi Rivers. The city of Galesburg joined Chicago \nby rail seventeen years later in 1854. The Carl Sandburg College of \nGalesburg is today the home of the first accredited railroad degree \nprogram.\n  So it is only natural that the National Railroad Hall of Fame would \nbe established in Galesburg. This privately-funded museum will \nhighlight the efforts of men and women whose hard work and \nresourcefulness helped build one of the nation's best modes of \ntransportation. It will also help promote and encourage a better \nunderstanding of the origins and growth of the railroad industry. The \nvision of the National Railroad Hall of Fame will span more than two \ncenturies, from the dawn of the American railroad, through the Golden \nAge of railroading, and up through the modern era, in which railroads \nremain a critical aspect of the transportation industry. The museum \nwill also be a center of learning and debate, as well as a library of \nhistorical materials.\n  Fourteen members of the House of Representatives have brought forward \nan identical measure in that chamber. Approval by the Senate will be an \nimportant step toward the erection of this monument. I urge the Senate \nto\n\n[[Page S6508]]\n\nadopt this resolution in a timely fashion so that we can properly honor \nthe railroad industry and its many pioneers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/09/senate-section/article/S6508-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 302--HONORING TED WILLIAMS AND EXTENDING THE \n                 CONDOLENCES OF THE SENATE ON HIS DEATH\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Kennedy) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
