It cannot be \ndone by 535 Members of Congress. I am hopeful we can get down to the \ncore issue with regard to trade so that the United States can keep up \nwith the rest of the world.\n  Over the past 10 years, since 1994 when this trade authority has not \nbeen in place, countries around the world have moved forward with \nvarious agreements, and the United States has not been able to do that. \nLarge agreements were made by others.\n  The more amendments we have, the more difficult it will be to get \ndown to what we are really seeking to do, and that is to have \nnegotiations which will give the United States fair opportunities for \ntrade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4292-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FEDERAL HIGHWAY TRUST FUND\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wish to speak about a different issue \nthat is very important to all of us, certainly in Wyoming where we have \nlong distances to travel. As we say, we have low population and small \ntowns with very long streets.\n  Transportation and highways are very important to us. Highways, of \ncourse, have generally been funded by a combination of Federal funds \nand State funds, Federal funds being very important and continuing to \nbe even more important as time goes by. What we do with State highways \nand State highway funding becomes one of the principal issues with \nwhich we have to deal.\n  Several years ago, we had the 21st century TEA-21, which was an \nappropriation and a plan for highway funding. Last week, the Finance \nCommittee held a hearing regarding the status of the highway trust \nfund. This highway trust fund, it seems to me, is terribly important \nbecause as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I \nhelped craft this Transportation Equity Act, or TEA-21, as it is \ncalled, which provides more dollars for the States than in the past and \nhas a very good distribution system which basically allocates money to \nthe States and lets them decide how those dollars are going to be \nspent.\n  As we all know, TEA-21 most significantly funded the Federal highway \nneeds. As a result, people across the country had opportunities to \nimprove the surface transportation system to make it safer and more \nefficient and to keep up with the times.\n  More importantly, as I mentioned, TEA-21 provided States and local \ngovernments more flexibility in controlling the use of those Federal \nfunds which, frankly, is one of the issues we should deal with \nconstantly; that is, in the distribution of Federal assistance, how we \nbest do that so there is accountability on one hand and on the other \nhand recognize the difference that exists in various places. I am \ncertain highway moneys are used for different needs in Wyoming than in \nDelaware. We need to have the flexibility to recognize those \ndifferences.\n  The panelists who testified at this hearing on the funding \nmechanisms--that is their job; funding of the highway trust fund is \nwhat we rely upon. This hearing addressed a $4.4 billion shortfall in \nthe highway trust fund which is due to the negative revenue alignment \nbudget. Economies are somewhat lower, and these dollars are lower under \nthe formula. We are in the process of trying to replace the $4.4 \nbillion so we do not have that loss and hopefully at least most of that \ncan be done.\n  In addition, however, the panelists detailed the tax disparity \nbetween gasoline and ethanol blend, gasohol. Currently, gasohol is \ntaxed at 13.1 cents and gasoline is taxed at 18.4 cents. This disparity \nis something that has to be reviewed. That is where the money comes \nfrom for highway funds. When we have less money coming in, obviously we \nare going to have less to spend.\n  The discrepancy between the fuels is causing a great debate not only \nin the context of the highway trust fund but in terms of our national \nenergy policy as well. Pending before the conference committee is the \nenergy bill which has substantial increases and requirements for \nincreases in ethanol, which has merit. On the other hand, if that is \ngoing to reduce the availability of highway funding, then we have to \ntake a look at a system that allows that to happen.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates the tax disparity between \ngasohol and gasoline will cost approximately $21 billion over the next \n11 years, and this is a pretty serious issue in terms, again, of \nfunding our national highway program.\n  As my colleagues know, the Senate passed the energy bill that \nmandates 5 billion gallons of ethanol by 2012.\n  As a result of this, of course, we will have an increased reliance on \ngasohol. So we need to take a look at this. I am not suggesting any \nparticular bias one way or the other, other than the fact that by \nmaking this change in the use of fuel, we have a change in the revenue \nthat will be available if we continue to have the same formula for \ndoing that.\n  Gasohol, which of course is the ethanol, is taxed at 13.1 cents a \ngallon; gas fuel is 18.4 cents. As to the trust fund, under the gas \narrangements we have now, 15 cents of it goes into the highway fund; \nunder the gasohol-ethanol, it is only 7 cents.\n  So we find ourselves with a substantial change, a substantial \ndifferential, in terms of how we will be funding our highways. I hope \nthat in the course of the committee activities we can take a long look \nat it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4292-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4292-S4293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will share some general thoughts I have. \nIt seems to me as we look forward to the remainder of this session, the \ntime is getting pretty short. In a couple of weeks we will begin our \nMemorial Day recess, and then we will be moving on towards our Fourth \nof July recess, of course. So between now and the time we adjourn for \nthis year, we do not have an awful lot of time remaining.\n  We collectively ought to see if we can figure out how we are going to \naccomplish many of the things that have to be done. Obviously, that is \nthe responsibility of leadership, but we have not moved very quickly. \nWe spent a very long time on energy--6 weeks. We have spent more time \nnow on this trade bill, and it looks as if the prospect is we will be \nspending even more time than we had anticipated.\n  We have a lot of things facing us. I hope we can wrap up the trade \nbill. I think it is very important. I think it is part of our future \neconomy.\n  As we do these things, I hope we can have a little vision of where we \nwant to be when we are through. What do we want to happen with trade, \nfor example, in the next 10 years? Do we want to be part of the trade \nprocess, with hopefully having fair trade around the world which will \nincrease our opportunities to export?\n  Thirty to thirty-five percent of our agricultural production has to \ngo into export. As we do this, we think about what it takes to \naccomplish that goal, if that indeed is our vision.\n  We are going to be dealing with permanent removal of the estate tax. \nThat has been promised to be one of the things that comes up on the \nfloor. So we have that to deal with.\n  Immigration and border security is out there. That is very important, \nparticularly important now because of terrorism, and very important in \nterms of the future: Where do we want to be in the future on \nimmigration? How do we want to handle these things? And what are we \ndoing that will cause us to arrive at where we want to be?\n  We get a little inclined to look at the politics of the election and \nlook at the politics in the Senate instead of having a vision of where \nwe want the United States, our States, our families and our communities \nto be in the future, and then testing whether what we are doing now \nleads us there.\n  The bankruptcy issue is out there. We have been talking about that \nfor a very long time. There are some real problems that need to be \nresolved. We have not managed to get it to the floor.\n  We do not have a budget. We were supposed to have a budget prior to \nnow. We have none. The budget is very important. If we are somewhat \nconcerned about spending and having an opportunity to at least limit \nspending and hope we can keep it down to a minimum to get that job \ndone, we do not even have a budget, and, frankly, there is no sign of \none appearing.\n\n[[Page S4293]]\n\n  Whether we like it or not, we are going to have to spend some time on \nthe cloning issue. It has been promised that cloning and research--not \nan easy issue--would be before us.\n  Then there is educational funding. We talk about education all the \ntime. We have not even gotten to that. That is one issue that is going \nto be out there.\n  Certainly, we have the issue of reinsurance for terrorism, an issue \nwe keep talking about, but it is still not here. This is very \ndifficult.\n  Nuclear storage is an issue I am certain we need to handle. \nObviously, again there are some problems pertaining to that issue. One \ncan ignore it if they choose, but the fact is we do have nuclear waste \nstored around the country in a very unsafe way and we need to find a \nplace to put that, particularly if nuclear energy is going to be part \nof our future. I hope it is. If one likes clean air, then nuclear \ngeneration is one of the ways to do that.\n  We spent 6 weeks debating energy. Now we have not even moved into our \nconference committee.\n  Frankly, I am a little disappointed about the fact that we have all \nof these things out there, and we recognize these are issues with which \nwe must deal.\n  Appropriations may be one of the most important things we do, not \nonly in terms of funding the Government but in terms of giving great \ndirection to where we want to be. The appropriations process has a good \ndeal to do with whether we want huge government involved in every issue \nor whether we want to limit government. Appropriations has something to \ndo with that, and they are very important. We are not there by any \nmeans.\n  So we have a great deal to do, and I hope we can find ourselves in a \nposition to move forward to accomplish these things. There are many \nmore issues, I suppose, but these have already been listed as things we \nare going to do, as has been said, before we adjourn.\n  We have some real problems to deal with. I hope we can move quickly \nto address these issues and find some suitable remedies for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I listened carefully to the comments of my \ncolleague from the State of Wyoming and the discussion about the Senate \nagenda. I could not agree more. There are certain issues the Senate \nshould take up and take up as quickly as possible. We face some serious \nchallenges, not the least of which relate to Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  The Social Security trust fund, which many of us made solemn oaths \nand pledges never to touch, is about to be invaded by both political \nparties at this point in time because of the deficit we face.\n  We are in a deficit situation after several years of the good \nexperience of surpluses and reducing our national debt and reducing the \ndebt of the Social Security trust fund because, frankly, we have run \ninto some bad situations and also some bad decisions.\n  We could not have anticipated the recession would go on this long, \nbut it has. We certainly didn't anticipate September 11, which has been \nvery costly to our Government. Last year the President convinced a \nmajority of the Senate and the House to vote for a tax program which, \nin fact, has virtually decimated the surplus which had been predicted. \nThe President said at the time we had $5.2 trillion in surplus so why \nnot give the money back to the people? Cut the taxes. Why does it stay \nin Washington?\n  Some of us who lived through the deficits of the Reagan-Bush era said \ngo slow, be careful, because the deficits could return any day. You \njust can't tell what's around the corner. But the White House insisted \nwe needed tax cuts--primarily for wealthy people. We did that last \nyear. It turns out this year, instead of a projected $5.2 trillion \nsurplus over the next 10 years we are down to $1.2 trillion. We lost $4 \ntrillion in projected surplus in 1 year.\n\n  How did we lose it? For those three reasons: the recession, the war \nagainst terrorism, and the tax policy. So we find ourselves now trying \nto put together a budget and not raid the Social Security trust fund. \nThat is why we are tied up in knots. It was a tax program pushed by the \nPresident which came too fast, without enough thought. It took away our \nsurplus. It took the money out of our hands to deal with the challenges \nfacing America.\n  I did not vote for it. I think that is fairly obvious from my \ncomments. But now, as many other Members of the Senate, I am facing the \nreality we have to try to put the budget together, even with this \ndeficit situation. The President comes to us and says we need \nadditional resources to fight the war against terrorism. He is right. \nHe will get support from Congress for that, both for the Department of \nDefense and for homeland security.\n  Of course that money is going to come out of the Social Security \ntrust fund because we are in a deficit situation again. Many of us are \nconcerned, too, because the President has said: Incidentally, I want \nmore tax cuts. The ones last year were not enough. We should take last \nyear's tax cuts and add on to them. If you look at the President's \nproposal, what it would do is once again threaten the Social Security \ntrust fund.\n  That does not make sense because we are just facing the possibility--\nin fact the reality--of the baby boomers showing up for Social \nSecurity. Should we not be thinking ahead, making certain Social \nSecurity is strong when all of these thousands and millions of \nAmericans who have paid into Social Security their entire lifetime show \nup and say: I am here. I want to retire. Where is my Social Security \ncheck?\n  No, the President says: Think, instead, of additional tax cuts.\n  Take a look at those tax cuts, incidentally. If you happen to be \nmaking over $300,000 a year, those tax cuts for you average about \n$40,000 a year in the President's new tax cut round, but if you are \nmaking, say, $100,000 a year, it is worth $200 or $300 a year. So there \nis a great disparity in who will benefit from this tax cut.\n  But we know who will lose. The American families who have been \ncounting on Social Security are not going to have as strong a Social \nSecurity trust fund as they should have because of the President's last \ntax cut and his proposed tax cut. You cannot keep going to the same \nwell again and again at the expense of senior citizens, at the expense \nof workers today who, dutifully, every paycheck, put their money down \nfor Social Security and now face the real possibility that when they \nneed Social Security, the system will not be as strong as it should be.\n  Let's reflect for a moment also on Medicare. The Medicare situation \nis one that is very troubling. I have traveled across my State of \nIllinois talking to doctors and nurses and hospital administrators. I \nhave talked to people who are on Medicare. They are concerned. They \nneed to be concerned. For reasons I cannot explain, this White House \nwill not take a serious look at the dangerous state of affairs when it \ncomes to Medicare. In fact, the House of Representatives recently \nproposed not only cutbacks in Medicare reimbursement for doctors but \nalso further cutbacks to pay for a prescription drug program.\n  Not surprisingly, hospitals have said if you are going to cut more \ndeeply into Medicare, many of us will be forced to close. So in both \nSocial Security and Medicare we have crisis situations looming and the \nadministration refusing to show leadership. In fact, when it comes to \nSocial Security, the administration is moving in the wrong direction, \ncalling for permanent tax cuts which would additionally threaten Social \nSecurity in the future.\n  I will take just a moment on prescription drugs, if I can. As I \ntravel around my State of Illinois, I find a lot of people, senior \ncitizens in particular, cannot afford prescription drugs. It is \nunderstandable if you have taken a look at some of the costs of the \ndrugs now being prescribed. The average American has a hard time paying \nfor them. Certainly a person who is retired cannot come up with the \nresources to make it work, so many people are making hard choices as to \nwhether they fill prescriptions that the doctors recommend or ignore \nthem or take half of\n\n[[Page S4294]]\n\nwhat they are supposed to take. These are tough calls for a lot of \nsenior citizens.\n  When we take a look at the issue of prescription drugs, it is not \njust a question of whether a senior under Medicare would have \naccessibility to these drugs; it is a question of the price of these \ndrugs. Consider this for a minute. The pharmaceutical companies are \nspending a lot of money--you see it everywhere you turn--advertising \ntheir industry and their product. They advertise their industry by \nsaying: We put good research into new drugs and we find cures.\n  They are right. Thank goodness they do, and we want to encourage \nthat.\n  Then they go on, of course, to advertise specific drugs.\n  Take this drug and you will be able to hop through a field of flowers \nwithout sneezing.\n  Take this drug and you will not be depressed.\n  Take this drug and it will deal with osteoarthritis.\n  Take this drug and it will deal with pulmonary seizures.\n  Take this little purple pill and go to our Web site and you'll feel \nbetter already.\n  Take this Viagra--\n  And so on and so on.\n  How much are these drug companies spending when it comes to \nadvertising? They are spending two to three times as much as they do on \nresearch. They are spending more money on advertising their drugs than \non research on finding new drugs.\n  To put it in comparison, do you remember Claritin, the drug for \nallergies? Schering-Plough spent more money in 1 year advertising for \nClaritin than Pepsi-Cola spent advertising Pepsi the same year; or \nAnheuser-Busch spent advertising Budweiser. Merck did the same thing \nwith Vioxx.\n  So when the drug costs keep going up and up, it is reasonable for us \nto ask the question whether these companies are putting too much money \ninto advertising and not putting enough into research; whether the \ncosts are out of control.\n  I think it is something we have to address. We have to address the \naccessibility of drugs and their affordability as part of a \nprescription drug program. We certainly cannot go the route of the \nHouse Republicans of raiding Medicare in order to pay for a \nprescription drug program. That is what they have suggested.\n  These are challenges we face. They are challenges which we are going \nto have to live up to, to make certain we keep our contract with \nseniors and others who are counting on Social Security and Medicare to \nbe there when they need it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the remaining minutes over which we \nhave control, I wish to respond to a couple of things my friend from \nIllinois indicated.\n  One was his being very critical of tax relief and tax reduction. It \nseems to me in a time when one of the real issues before us is the \neconomy, what could you be doing better to help the economy than to \nreduce taxes? I think that is why the President has pushed that. That \nis why more conservatives have pushed that. But to be critical of that \nwhen we are trying to do something with the economy seems to be a \nlittle out of context.\n  It also is difficult to wonder why the folks who are the big spenders \nhere are worried about the deficit. We passed a bill that was almost \n$85 billion more than the previous in agriculture. We did not have any \nconcern about that. So we have people over here who think Government \nought to be involved in everything and everyone's lives, and dollars \nought to be spent for everything in terms of any program you can think \nof--and then to hear some concern about the deficit?\n  I point out, as we talk about problems, there are two sides to these \nissues and you have to take a little look at what it is you want. If \nyou want a better economy, then you probably need to do something about \nhaving taxes be too high. If you don't want to spend so much, you \nprobably ought to take a look at some of the spending bills that you \nare pushing.\n  There is a conflict here, but to get up on the floor and complain \nabout reducing taxes yet wanting our economy to be stronger, to get up \nhere and talk about a deficit and then be a great supporter of all the \nbig spending bills--there is a certain conflict there and I think we \nought to measure a little bit what we want in terms of what we do in \nthe interim.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 10:30 a.m. shall be under \nthe control of the majority leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Madam President, this morning I rise to speak on perhaps \nthe most important long-term domestic issue facing our Nation--the \nfuture health and security of our Social Security system. Today, I want \nto focus on proposals to privatize Social Security and the special \nthreat privatization poses to women in America.\n  Last December, late on a Friday afternoon, before Christmas, \nPresident Bush's Social Security Commission released its \nrecommendations for changes in the Social Security system. The \nCommission's report did not get much media coverage because of the \ntiming of its release, and I think that was obviously by design, if you \nread the report.\n  The recommendations of the Bush Commission are dramatic and damaging, \nif implemented, for the future of all Social Security beneficiaries but \nparticularly for women. They involve deep cuts in guaranteed Social \nSecurity benefits--cuts of 25 percent or so for those currently working \nand up to 45 percent for future workers. Undoubtedly, these proposals \nwould force millions of Americans to delay their retirement so that \nthey would have the ability to live their senior years with economic \nsecurity.\n  Few members of the public actually have even heard of the Bush \nCommission, and they certainly have not talked or debated the \nrecommendations. And fewer have any idea that the Commission is calling \nfor drastic cuts in guaranteed benefits, the type that I outlined.\n  Americans need to know about these plans, and they need to consider \nthem and debate them in a serious way, making sure they know the \nimplications of taking these recommendations to fruition.\n  Unfortunately, so far, the administration says it wants to put off \nany discussion of these proposals until after the election. That is \nunfortunate and, frankly, it is wrong. We should be debating this issue \nopenly and publicly before the American people, on the Senate floor and \ncertainly before the voters in this November's elections.\n  To that end, I intend to continue to raise this subject and its \nimplications for the American people as much as I can to make sure that \nthe American people understand what the Bush Commission is recommending \nto the American public. This Senator thinks it is too important to be \ndecided among closeted policy wonks and politicians in the dark of the \nnight.\n  Today, I specifically want to raise those aspects of privatization \nthat are damaging to women. I know this is an issue that is near and \ndear to the Presiding Officer.\n  Women have a reason to be especially concerned about privatization \nproposals because they would be among the biggest losers if Social \nSecurity is privatized and benefits are cut.\n  As Joan Bernstein, president of the organization known as OWL, notes \nin\n\n[[Page S4295]]\n\nher introductory letter to OWL's Mother's Day report, ``Social Security \nPrivatization: A False Promise for Women'':\n\n       Social Security is a women's issue. I would go so far as to \n     say that it is the retirement security issue for women today.\n\n  OWL notes that today women represent 58 percent of all Social \nSecurity recipients--slightly more than 50 percent. They represent 71 \npercent of beneficiaries aged 85 and over.\n  Without regular cost-of-living adjusted Social Security benefits, \nmore than half of all older women would be living in poverty. Let me \nrepeat--more than 50 percent. If you look at Hispanic women, it is \nabout 68 percent. If you look at African-American women, it is 61 \npercent.\n  I note that Social Security is important not just to older women but \nalso to children and nonretired adults who constitute one-third of \ncurrent Social Security beneficiaries. These include many women and \nchildren who benefit from benefits resulting from the death or \ndisability of a family member.\n  For a caregiving mother, cutting these benefits is unthinkable.\n  For these reasons, women have a special stake in Social Security, and \ntheir stake in protecting guaranteed benefits should be obvious given \nwomen's historic position--sometimes I think unfortunate historic \nposition--in the economic system.\n  First, women earn less than men. There is a wage gap: on average, 73 \ncents on every dollar a man earns. Also, they are not compensated for \nthe 12 years, on average, they spend on unpaid caregiving, whether for \ntheir children, parents, spouse, or other relatives. And when women \nwork as caregivers, they are often in the economic system as part-time \nworkers, so that their average pay is significantly lower.\n  The way Social Security is calculated, you look at 35 years of \nworking level--the highest average--and women come up short. The \naverage payout of Social Security benefits for women is about $756 per \nyear. For a man, it is just shy of $1,000 a year.\n  All this pulls together as women often save less during their working \nlifetime and are less likely to be eligible for pensions as well. They \nare denied private pensions. If they do have private pensions, it is \noften generally less generous, the same way Social Security is less \ngenerous for women. In fact, average private pension benefits for women \nare only about half of those for men. And for most women, their Social \nSecurity benefits will also be lower because of those averaged lower \nearnings that I talked about. It works doubly--in the pension system \nand also in Social Security.\n  Finally, and most importantly, women tend to live longer than men--6 \nyears longer on average. That makes Social Security especially critical \nfor women, since the program, unlike private savings, protects against \nthe risks of outliving your savings and, certainly, ongoing rising \ninflation.\n  Privatizing Social Security would undercut many of the program's \nbenefits for women, whether it is retirement security or the social \ninsurance about which we spoke.\n  Taking trillions of dollars out of the Social Security trust fund \nwill force a cut in these guaranteed benefits--25 percent or more, as I \nnoted earlier, for current workers and 45 percent for those who enter \nthe workforce later. That is unacceptable.\n  It will also undermine Social Security's role in the social insurance \narea, leaving women less protected against a variety of risks in our \nsociety.\n  I know many people around here are convinced that we need to cut \nSocial Security benefits to make sure that Social Security meets its \nlong-term financial objectives and its long-term financial needs to \ndeal with those pressures. Most Americans do not believe that. I want \nyou to know, I do not believe that. We can save Social Security without \ncutting it. The truth is, the American people are right. It is a matter \nof our priorities.\n  Consider these two figures: First, the long-term Social Security \nshortfall is $3.7 trillion. It is about $74 billion a year if you \nfactor it out over the 75-year actuarial life we are talking about. The \nlong-term cost of last year's tax cut is $8.7 trillion over the same \nperiod. Remember, $3.7 trillion to fix Social Security; $8.7 trillion \nin our tax cuts. In other words, the tax cut will cost more than twice \nas much as the entire Social Security shortfall.\n  I don't get it. Where are our priorities? What is important? I hope \nmy colleagues will remember that the next time someone says we have no \nchoice but to cut benefits, that they will put that into the framework \nof what we need to be thinking about as we deal with fiscal policy in \nthis country.\n  We certainly could, and should, consider--this is a personal view--\npostponing some of the remaining tax cuts to deal with Social \nSecurity's fiscal needs first. That is a priority. Social Security \nshould come first.\n\n  Last week, as I said, I attended a press conference with the leaders \nof OWL, a grassroots membership organization that focuses on the needs \nof midlife and older women. OWL developed an excellent report called \n``Social Security Privatization: A False Promise for Women.'' I sent \ncopies to every Senator's office, and I hope my colleagues will take a \nlook at it. There are individual stories inside this excellent report. \nThere are details about how the financial structure of Social Security \nworks. It is a composite that pulls together an overview.\n  It makes in clear and compelling terms the case that privatizing \nSocial Security would be extraordinarily bad for women. They do that on \na personal level, they do it on an analytical level, and they do it in \nways and terms that I believe the American people can understand.\n  That is the message all women and all Americans must understand and \ndebate before the election. We need to understand what is going on with \nthe Bush recommendations. We need to understand what will happen if we \nfollow and implement those recommendations.\n  I believe we ought to be looking for ways of strengthening Social \nSecurity. We can deal with some of those from a fiscal policy \nstandpoint, but we need to strengthen Social Security, not cut \nbenefits. We need to deal with how we look at women's participation in \nthe workforce and the calculation of their benefits.\n  We ought to be getting on with that debate now, before the elections. \nAfter all, I repeat, the future of Social Security is too important to \nbe decided behind closed doors. This is an issue that affects all \nAmericans--the financial security of all Americans, and particularly \nthe financial security of women. Let's get on with that debate. Let's \nhave that debate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the executive summary of the \nOWL report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n\n                       social security and women\n\n       The Social Security system is an embodiment of the long-\n     standing American principle of social insurance, providing \n     nearly universal coverage for workers and their families \n     through a pooling of resources benefits, and risk.\n       One-third of the program's beneficiaries are not retirees \n     but include children, widows, and people with disabilities. \n     Social Security offers an unmatchable set of insurance \n     protections for workers and their families, providing \n     protection against poverty in the event of death, disability \n     or old age.\n       Women comprise the majority of Social Security \n     beneficiaries, representing 58 percent of all Social Security \n     recipients at age 65 and 71 percent of all recipients by age \n     85.\n       Accounting for more than 70 percent of older adults living \n     in poverty, women are more vulnerable in retirement. During \n     this time they most need the stability of a guaranteed source \n     of income--the Social Security check. Without it, 52 percent \n     of white women, 65 of African American women, and 61 percent \n     of Latinas over the age 65 would be poor.\n\n\n             women's realities and retirement consequences\n\n       For women, poverty in old age is often rooted in the \n     realities that shaped their lives early on: the reality of \n     the wage gap, the reality of caregiving, and the reality of \n     flexible jobs that offer few benefits, especially pensions.\n       Almost 40 years after the Equal Pay Act was passed, women \n     still earn only 73 percent of what men earn. You can't save \n     what you don't earn.\n       Caregiving directly affects women's retirement security, as \n     they often take more flexible, lower-wage jobs with few \n     benefits or stop working altogether in order to provide \n     unpaid caregiving services. In fact, women spend, on average, \n     12 years out of the work force for family caregiving over the \n     course of their lives.\n       Older women are less likely than older men to receive \n     pension income (28 percent of 43\n\n[[Page S4296]]\n\n     percent); when they do, the benefit is only about half the \n     benefit men receive.\n       Women live an average of six years longer than men. Women's \n     longer lifespans make them more vulnerable to the impact of \n     inflation and to the risk that they will outlive their money.\n\n\n                       the great solvency debate\n\n       Social Security is a ``pay-as-you-go'' system. Current \n     workers not only see the societal and family benefits of \n     supporting our nation's vulnerable seniors, but also know \n     that they are covered by the same set of social insurance \n     protections.\n       Changing demographics mean that the system will eventually \n     have to use trust fund dollars to cover out-going benefits. \n     This situation was predicted and addressed by Congress in \n     1983, when it adjusted the system to build up the trust fund \n     for the retirement of the baby boomers.\n       The trust fund consists of U.S. Treasury bonds, considered \n     the safest investment vehicle available to individual or \n     institutional investors worldwide.\n       Experts do have suggestions about how to plan for a \n     potential financing shortfall. There are many proposals that \n     preserve the integrity of the program while shoring it up for \n     the future. These stand in stark contrast to private \n     accounts, which would speed insolvency and destroy the social \n     insurance compact that is Social Security.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I know this is an issue that is near and dear to \nyour heart. It is an issue to which it is absolutely essential we pay \nattention and debate, that we get to a conclusion that supports \nAmerica's women, making sure they have retirement security commensurate \nwith the rest of Americans.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, first, I commend Senator Corzine for the \nleadership role he is taking in trying to protect Social Security for \nall Americans. Today we are particularly focusing on the Social \nSecurity needs and concerns of women, but the effort is a much broader \none. It is to protect Social Security from the recommendations of the \nPresident's Commission on Social Security which would lead to a \nlessening of the security, would make it less of a social instrument, \nand leave it more up to the whims of the stock market, which may or may \nnot go up, which may or may not, therefore, lead to more funds in the \nhands of people who own private accounts but, overall, would make this \nNation and its seniors and people who are about to become seniors, in \ntheir forties and fifties, a lot less secure.\n  A week ago a report was released by the National Older Women's \nLeague, or OWL, to commemorate Mother's Day. It was an appropriate day \nto release this report. The report shows the problems that would be \ncreated if the recommendations of that President's Commission were \nadopted. It is entitled ``Social Security Privatization: A False \nPromise for Women.'' I encourage every Member of this body to read this \nreport. It clearly demonstrates that the recommendations of the \nPresident's Social Security Commission are a bad deal for Americans and \nparticularly bad for women.\n  Currently, women comprise 58 percent of Social Security beneficiaries \nover the age of 65 and 71 percent of those over the age of 85. Women \ndepend on Social Security more than men, despite their increasing \npresence in today's workforce. Women earn less than men: 73 cents on \nevery dollar a man earns.\n  These statistics indicate that changes to the Social Security system \nthat result in reduced benefits will have a negative disparate impact \non women.\n  The President's Commission is based on privatization plans that would \ndivert Social Security payroll taxes into individually owned private \naccounts, shifting the system from shared risk and collective gain \namong workers to private accounts that would leave workers to sink or \nswim on their own.\n  This concept would have a particularly negative effect on women for \nseveral reasons. Private accounts ask women to bear more of a risk \nbecause of their increased dependency. Private accounts would undermine \nthe social insurance nature of Social Security. Private accounts cost \nmore to administer. Private accounts may speed up Social Security \ninsolvency.\n  By most accounts, Social Security is the most dependable source of \nretirement security for a majority of women. Privatization takes that \nreliability and that dependability and gambles the financial future of \nwomen and all seniors on the volatility of the stock market. America's \nseniors, and in particular women, deserve better than that.\n  Women account for more than 70 percent of older Americans living in \npoverty. Without Social Security, 52 percent of white women, 65 percent \nof African-American women, and 61 percent of Hispanic women over the \nage of 65 would be poor. These alarming statistics and the OWL Mother's \nDay report are an eye-opening experience for all of us.\n  The President's Commission takes the fundamental principles of Social \nSecurity and abandons them for a market-driven scheme that is \nunreliable at best and discriminatory at worst. Social Security is an \nentitlement program based on the concept of social insurance. It is not \nsupposed to be a gamble which pays benefits based on how the stock \nmarket did yesterday or last year or tomorrow or next year.\n\n  Women live an average of 6 years longer than men and, as a result, \nwomen are more likely to outlive the benefits of private accounts. In \naddition, older women are three times as likely to lose their spouse.\n  We should protect this program, we should make the changes we need to \nensure its solvency, and we should not overhaul it or undermine its \nbasic principles by eroding the social insurance components, as the \nPresident's Commission would have us do.\n  Yesterday on the Senate floor, Senator Bingaman commented that \nretirement security is a three-legged stool, with one leg representing \nSocial Security, one leg representing pensions, and the final leg \nrepresenting personal savings and investment. I could not agree more. \nWe should not take the President's Commission recommendations and blur \nthe lines between Social Security and private investments.\n  I commend the OWL report because it shows that the detrimental effect \nSocial Security privatization would have on women is severe, it is \nimportant, and it is relevant. I hope every Member of this body will \ntake the time to read this report, to reflect on its findings as we \ncontemplate the recommendations for structural changes to the Social \nSecurity program.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, will the Senator from Michigan \nentertain a question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Did I hear the Senator indicate that roughly 51 percent \nof women would be in poverty if we did not have a Social Security \nsystem?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The figure I used was 52 percent of white women and a \nlarger percentage of African-American and Hispanic women.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If I am not mistaken--maybe the Senator from Michigan \ncan refresh my memory--with Social Security we have something less than \n10 percent of Americans now living out of poverty. That is what the \nwhole design of the program was, to provide a fundamental foundation--\n``social insurance'' I think was the term the Senator used. Is that the \nway the Senator from Michigan understands both the number and the \nreality of how it has worked?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Social Security system, along with Medicare, is \nprobably the reason that only, as I understand the number, 1 out of 20, \nabout 5 percent, of seniors live in poverty. My number may be a little \nlow. But the point is that 20 percent of American children live in \npoverty, and yet approximately 5 percent of seniors live in poverty. It \nis shameful that 20 percent of Americans live in poverty, but one of \nthe main reasons a smaller number of seniors live in poverty than our \nkids is Social Security and Medicare. The Senator from New Jersey is \nexactly right.\n  Mr. CORZINE. We have a lot to do, if at least my analysis and others \nof the Social Security benefit cuts that are implied by the \nprivatization process are implemented, for women, obviously, but \nAmericans broadly and, quite frankly, a number of children because \nSocial Security is a program for disability, spouses, and children \nsurvivors as well.\n  I was interested to hear the Senator talk about transaction costs and \nprivatization. I remember recently we had\n\n[[Page S4297]]\n\na presentation by a Member of Congress at one of our briefings on \nSocial Security. Did I recall hearing that there is a privatization \nscheme in Britain where 40 percent of the dollars that are allocated \nfor savings in this privatized account go to transaction costs?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think that was the number I heard. My memory is very \nsimilar to that. It is an astounding number that the people who \nrecommend privatization don't even factor.\n  There are a lot of other things they don't factor, by the way; some \nof them are even more focused. They don't replace the money. They don't \nsay how they will replace the money which would be lost to the Social \nSecurity system by people not contributing to it and supporting folks \nwho are retired or near retirement. They never talk about that huge \nhole in the general fund that would be created. They don't talk about \nthe uncertainty of private accounts as much as they should, the fact \nthat the market over time may go up depending on what time period you \nlook at, but not for everybody.\n  Even within that long window, there will be some losers. Maybe most \npeople will win, but what about the losers? They don't talk about that \nas much as they should. The thing they never talk about are these \nadministrative costs, these transaction costs which, as the Senator has \npointed out, are apparently a very significant percentage of the money.\n  Mr. CORZINE. If the Senator from Michigan will give me the grace of \nmaking sure my arithmetic is right, if you add a 25-percent cut for \npeople who are now working plus 40 percent in administrative costs, \nthat 65 percent out of the total amount of benefits from Social \nSecurity seems to be a big chunk out of how one would have their \nretirement financed. Certainly it would go a long way to eroding the \nbase of benefits that people have come to expect from Social Security.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It would, indeed. It makes that enticement of private \naccounts, when you analyze it, a lot more superficial. The reality is a \nlot more negative than that superficial glow of riches.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Sure.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Contrary to what most people in this country probably \nbelieve, the Social Security Administration is extremely efficient, \nand, in fact, less than 1 percent of Social Security goes for \nadministrative costs. The Senator cited some of the figures from the \nOWL report, which is an excellent document, about the disparities \nbetween men and women. I have seen the statistic that one-quarter of \nthe retirees in America today don't receive any pension fund \nwhatsoever.\n  My experience in Minnesota would be that probably 80 or 90 percent of \nthose are women, particularly older women who are widowed and often, \nwith the older pensions, lose any benefit payments whatsoever once \ntheir husband dies. I wonder if the Senator from Michigan has had that \nsame experience. Would the Senator say in Michigan that number applies?\n  Mr. LEVIN. It is a very large percentage. I don't have it directly in \nmy mind, but it is a large percentage of people, particularly women, \nwho rely exclusively on Social Security. We encourage people, of \ncourse, to have private savings, and some people have pensions. That \nthree-legged stool Senator Bingaman talked about of Social Security and \nprivate pensions and private savings is a one-leg stool for a large \npercentage of our seniors and a larger percentage of women.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator is absolutely right. That is exactly the \ndilemma, the predicament in which so many elderly women find \nthemselves. There is only one leg to that stool. As the Senator from \nNew Jersey pointed out, with the average Social Security payment for \nwomen being only $750 a month, that is not much money on which to live. \nI think that creates part of the lure of the personal privatization \nwhich the Republican Commission has now come forward with, which, \nobviously, someone receiving that little amount of money would be \ntempted, enticed by something else. As the Senator pointed out very \nwell, there is no reward without risk.\n  I wonder if the Senator--certainly the Senator from New Jersey who \nspent a career in financial pursuits--is aware of anywhere where there \nis that potential for reward in the private sector without commensurate \nrisk.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will be winners and losers. It turns Social Security \ninto a social insecurity system.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I compliment the Senator from New Jersey in bringing this \nimportant report to the Senate. He is to be commended. It is a very \nimportant topic, as we look ahead to the future of Social Security.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One last word: I have met with the women who are active in \nthe OWL commission. They are very keenly aware of the problems with the \nPresident's Commission and the uncertainties it would create for women \nin particular who are seniors. And I think the opposition to the \nPresident's Commission's findings is very strong and is growing.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a moment to \nsay, I am very appreciative of the discussion you have had, the \ncontributions the Senator from Minnesota made with regard to raising \nthis issue so we can have a debate about it. This debate ought to be \nhad before the election, not after the election. People ought to have \nto make a statement about how they feel about these recommendations \nsince it has such an impact on Americans lives, particularly women in \nAmerica. That is what the OWL report was about. I very much appreciate \nthe contributions my colleagues have made to this discussion.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One additional word: I hope we will actually not only \nconsider the recommendations of the President's Commission but actually \nvote on them. We ought to put them to rest. There is a lot of concern \nin the country about those recommendations, that they would totally \nmake the Social Security system much less secure. I think we ought to \ntry to address the concerns by voting on those recommendations. I \nbelieve they will be voted down, as they should be, so that the people \nout there who are not only retired but in their forties and fifties, \nwho rely on Social Security, want it to be there, don't want the \nuncertainty that will be created by the contributions being reduced--\nwhich is what would happen without any idea of where the replacement \nfunds would come from--I think it would be healthy for the country not \njust to debate it but, if possible, before the election to vote up or \ndown on those recommendations. I hope and believe that all of them will \nbe rejected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4297-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 10 \nminutes debate in relation to the pending Baucus amendment. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, is there a time allotted?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 10 minutes debate in relation to \nthe pending Baucus amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding that the Senator from \nMassachusetts will have 5 minutes and the other 5 minutes will be \nallotted to Senator Grassley and myself. I will take 2\\1/2\\ minutes of \nthat.\n  I rise once again to urge my colleagues to support the amendment that \nI laid down yesterday on behalf on myself and Senators Grassley and \nWyden.\n\n[[Page S4298]]\n\n  The amendment is a short but very important clarification to the \ntrade bill's negotiating objective on investment. when we negotiate \ninvestment agreements, our primary objective is to ensure that U.S. \ninvestors abroad have rights and protections comparable to the rights \nand protections they enjoy in the United States. In fulfilling that \nobjective, we generally undertake reciprocal obligations with respect \nto foreign investors.\n  Our amendment makes absolutely clear that the rights we extend to \nforeign investors must not exceed the rights we afford our own \ncitizens.\n  I expect that this is not the end of our debate on investor-state \ndispute settlement. As the debate goes forward, it is important to \nunderstand that we are trying to achieve a balance. In taking steps to \nprotect U.S. investors abroad, we must not sacrifice the sovereignty of \nFederal, State, and local governments here at home. Striking the right \nbalance is precisely what we have done in the trade bill. When it was \nbrought to our attention that we might improve that balance, we did so \nin the amendment laid down yesterday.\n  In the days ahead, it is important that we not upend the balance. We \nhave carefully crafted a foundation for future investment agreements. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support that foundation and to support \nthe Baucus-Grassley-Wyden amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I appreciate enormously the efforts of \nthe chairman and ranking member to move what is always a very difficult \nissue through the Senate. They have done a good job of trying to \nresolve a great many issues. I don't oppose this amendment of theirs, \nbut, in fact, I urge my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  I emphasize to my colleagues that this amendment does not fix the \nchapter 11 problem that still exists with respect to the sovereignty of \nAmerican businesses and the rights of Americans and of our communities \nto be able to be protected. I am very grateful for the chairman's \nwillingness to try to respond, but substantial disagreements still \nexist with respect to how we best protect American businesses and our \ncommunities, according to our rights.\n  As our colleagues know, it is clear that the NAFTA investor-State \ndispute resolution process, which is known as chapter 11, is going to \nbe the model on which future agreements are predicated. And chapter 11, \nin its current form, is a flawed model. It is not a failed model; it is \nsimply flawed. We have the ability to be able to fix it.\n  Last night, Senator Baucus referenced letters written by several \norganizations that urged correction of the no-lesser-rights language, \nwhich is precisely what will happen in this particular amendment. I \nappreciate his response, but let me point out that in those letters he \nreferenced, there are a whole set of other issues that are unaddressed \nin this amendment. Specifically, from the National League of Cities, \nthey say: We are concerned that future trade negotiations, particularly \nfor a hemispheric free trade area of the Americas, could include \nprovisions that expand the definition of a regulatory taking. As \nevidenced by disputes under chapter 11 of NAFTA, vague expropriation \nlanguage has allowed new avenues of recourse for foreign investors to \nchallenge current State and local ordinances.\n  So we are allowing a foreign investor to come in and actually undo \nthe intent of our local and State communities to enforce certain kinds \nof health or other kinds of restraints.\n  From the National Association of Towns and Townships:\n\n       In particular, we are troubled that a claim by a foreign \n     company that a local government's regulation or zoning laws \n     constitutes a taking against the company will make it \n     impossible for the locality to enforce that law or \n     regulation.\n\n  From the National Conference of State Legislators:\n       The bill does not adequately and explicitly guarantee that \n     trade agreements negotiated under this authority will respect \n     State sovereignty, nor incorporate well defined and \n     constitutional Fifth Amendment takings principles.\n\n  Regrettably, the Baucus-Grassley amendment does not, despite what \nthey claim in the no-greater-rights-than language, address the \nshortcomings of the chapter 11 model. Adopting their language without \nother needed changes is still going to allow future chapter 11-like \ntribunals to rule against legitimate U.S. public health and safety laws \nusing a standard of expropriation that goes well beyond the clear \nstandard that the Supreme Court has established in all of its \nexpropriation cases.\n  The amendment before us does not give assurances that the due process \nclaims of the Constitution will be respected, nor does it provide safe \nharbor for legitimate U.S. public health and safety laws.\n  I will propose an amendment, and we will debate this amendment over \nthe course of the next couple of days. I urge my colleagues to adopt a \npolicy that will fully protect the constitutional rights of American \nbusinesses and the constitutional right of our States, the \nexpropriation laws and standards of the Supreme Court. I urge them to \nvote for this amendment recognizing this does not complete the task.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, the amendment that is before us was \nintroduced by Senator Baucus and myself and is designed to make it \ncrystal clear that in pursuing these objectives, foreign investors are \nnot to be granted any greater rights in the United States than our own \nU.S. investors have rights within the United States. This provision \nbuilds upon the already strong improvements to the investment \nobjectives within this bill. These provisions strike a very careful \nbalance between the needs to protect U.S. citizens from arbitrary \ntakings of their property overseas and the need to ensure that the \ninvestor-State dispute settlement process is not abused.\n  Critics of the investment provisions insist that the investor-State \ndispute settlement process has somehow run amok. Not true. The fact is \nthat no U.S. environmental, health, or safety regulations have ever \nbeen overturned by the international investment arbitration. Only 13 \ninvestor-State claims have been filed under NAFTA chapter 11 in the \nentire 8 years of its existence. Meanwhile, U.S. investors continue to \nface discriminatory and arbitrary government action in most of the \ndeveloping world. We need to maintain U.S. investors' ability to get \nredress in impartial tribunals while ensuring that the investor-State \ndispute settlement process continues to protect our own investors \noverseas. This simply is what the Baucus-Grassley amendment does.\n  I urge support for this amendment and support for the Baucus-Grassley \ncompromise.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have sent a second-degree amendment to \nthe desk in place of the Dayton amendment. I am going to debate that in \njust a little while, but I want everybody to know the situation.\n  Also, Senator Baucus and I are going to visit with various people to \nsee if there is a smooth way of handling both the substitute as well as \nthe original amendment. We may not be successful, but that is our \ndesire. We are going to be talking while this debate is ongoing, and I \nwill be back to give the specifics of my amendment in just a short \nperiod of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Craig and I have \nintroduced is one that I think has great importance to this \nlegislation. It is one I am very proud to sponsor with the senior \nSenator from Idaho, someone with whom I have had the good fortune to \nwork on this and other matters relating to trade as they affect our two \nStates.\n\n[[Page S4300]]\n\n  I also am very pleased that this amendment is cosponsored by 26 of \nour colleagues, 13 Republicans and 13 Democrats. They reflect a broad \nspectrum of views on many issues, yet they agree on the need for this \namendment. Is it because all of us are against trade, as our detractors \nhave charged?\n  The answer is an emphatic ``no.'' We support this amendment because \nwe recognize that there is more than one side to the U.S. trade \nequation. There are a great many citizens in our States who have \nbenefited from the liberalization of international trade during the \nlast 20 years. However, there are also a great many Americans who have \nbeen harmed by the results of recent trade agreements.\n  The proponents of more free trade acknowledge only the winners. Their \nreports cite only the businesses, the jobs, and the revenues from \nincreased exports. Those benefits are substantial; however, they form \nonly one side of the trade ledger. On the other side are thousands of \nbankrupt businesses and farms in the United States, many thousands of \nlost American jobs, and the massive shifting of U.S. production to \nother countries.\n  This Dayton-Craig amendment is on behalf of Americans who have been, \nare being, or will be harmed by continuing trade liberalization. They \nare hardworking citizens who nevertheless will lose their livelihoods, \nwhich in turn will cause lost homes, lost health insurance, lost \npensions, lost retirement security, lost hope, and even lost lives. \nThey are not isolated occurrences. They are growing in number across \nAmerica.\n  They are victims of trade policies and trade practices which are out \nof balance. In the year 2000, the United States total trade deficit for \ngoods and services was $376 billion. In goods alone, the deficit was \n$452 billion. In 1990, the total U.S. trade deficit was $81 billion. In \n1980, it was only $19 billion. Our country's trade deficit, that \nimbalance between the value of our exports and the value of our \nimports, was 4\\1/2\\ times greater in 2000 than in 1990, and 20 times \ngreater in 2000 than in 1980.\n  A March 18, 2002, Business Week article began:\n\n       How much longer can the United States rack up giant current \n     account trade deficits?\n\n  The article cited a Goldman Sachs Global Economic's Research report, \nwhich called the current trend ``unsustainable.''\n\n  Another recent report stated:\n\n       America's ballooning trade deficit may be the worst \n     economic problem we face--and no one wants to talk about it.\n\n  What is driving these soaring trade deficits? It isn't that U.S. \nexports are not expanding. In many sectors they are growing at a very \nstrong rate, and the last administration worked hard to open foreign \nmarkets to U.S. goods and services, as did its predecessors. It's the \nexplosion in imports which is far exceeding export gains.\n  From 1990 to 2000, total U.S. exports in goods and services almost \ndoubled to just over $1 trillion. However, during that decade, total \nU.S. imports more than doubled--in fact, increased by 133 percent, to \nalmost $1\\1/2\\ trillion. The increase in imports was $295 billion more \nthan the growth in exports.\n  If you look at key sectors in our economy, you see this pattern. \nExports expand. Imports explode. Trade deficits multiply. This serious \nimbalance has cost the jobs, farms, businesses, and livelihoods of too \nmany Americans.\n  Even in agriculture, the growth in imports has exceeded the growth in \nexports. Farmers and national commodity organizations, including many \ncoming right out of Minnesota, have been among the biggest supporters \nof trade liberalization in their hopes that increased exports would \nlead to higher prices and decent profits in the marketplace. From 1990 \nto 2000, total U.S. agriculture exports did grow by $10.5 billion, a \n26-percent increase. However, agriculture imports increased by over $16 \nbillion during that time. Today, the U.S. balance of trade in all \nagriculture commodities is still positive; however, that margin is \nshrinking.\n  Two major causes of our huge trade deficits have been Mexico and \nCanada. They are the big NAFTA winners. Look at what has happened to \nU.S. trade with our neighbors since NAFTA took effect on January 1, \n1994.\n  In 1993, the last year before NAFTA, all United States exports to \nMexico totaled $41.6 billion. Imports from Mexico totaled $39.9 \nbillion, leaving the United States with a $1.7 billion trade surplus \nwith Mexico.\n  During the next 7 years, United States exports into Mexico grew to \n$111 billion, a 167-percent in crease in 7 years. However, Mexican \nimports into the United States exploded to $136 billion, a 240-percent \nincrease, and the United States balance of trade with Mexico went from \nits 1993 surplus to a $25 billion deficit in the year 2000.\n  Our trade with Canada followed a similar pattern. United States \nexports into Canada increased by $69 billion from 1993 to 2000. \nHowever, our imports from Canada grew by $120 billion, almost double \nthe growth in exports. In 2000, our trade deficit with Canada was $52 \nbillion.\n\n  Looking at one key sector, automobiles, the total automobile imports \nfrom Mexico into the United States more than tripled from 1993 to 2000, \nto almost 1 million per year. Cars imported from Canada into the United \nStates increased by 56 percent during that time to 2.2 million \nautomobiles. Those 3 million autos used to be--or could have been--\nmanufactured in the United States by American auto workers.\n  Agriculture is another big loser under NAFTA, as too many Minnesota \nfarmers have painfully realized. Canadian wheat, Mexican sugar, milk \nprotein concentrate, stuffed molasses via Canada, and other trade \nimbalances have caused domestic commodity prices to plummet. The \naverage price of a bushel of corn in the United States in the year \n2000, was $1.85, well below the price of $3.11 for a bushel of corn in \n1980, 20 years previously. For a bushel of wheat, the price in 2000 was \n$2.65 per bushel; in 1980 it was $3.91. For soybeans, a bushel in 2000 \naveraged $4.75; in 1980, that price was $7.57. Milk averaged $12.40 per \ncwt. in 2000, compared to $13.05 per cwt. in 1980. Turkeys brought 40.7 \ncents per pound in 2000; 41.3 cents per pound in 1980.\n  All of those prices are in current dollars. After adjusting for \ninflation, their drops are even more severe. Last year, the U.S. farm \nprice index, the value of all U.S. agriculture products divided by the \ncost of producing them, dropped to its lowest level since the Great \nDepression. That index has fallen by 20 percent during the last 10 \nyears. So much for the benefits of NAFTA and international trade \nliberalization on American agriculture.\n  Similarly, in the nonfarm private sector, the average hourly wage \npaid U.S. workers in real dollars was less in the year 2000 than in \n1990. It was less in 2000 than it was in 1980, and less than it was in \n1970. Only by more spouses working more hours have average American \nfamilies stayed even or moved slightly ahead in the U.S. economy during \nthe last 10, 20, and 30 years.\n  Thus, U.S. trade policies and practices, in balance, are doing many \nAmericans more harm than good. And the harm is increasing more than the \ngood.\n  The response of free trade proponents to this predicament is more \nfree trade. More opening our doors to the largest marketplace in the \nworld, the U.S. economy, which still produces 23 percent of the world's \nGWP, accounts for 12 percent of world exports, and 18 percent of world \nimports.\n  Who, then, does benefit from this U.S. trade policy? Primarily, it \nhas been, and continues to be, the enormous cost advantages afforded \nU.S. corporations who shift production out of the United States into \nlow-wage low-cost countries. Deregulation of the world's product and \nfinancial markets has enriched a world class of investors, \nentrepreneurs, and professionals. At the very top, the accumulation of \nwealth has been extraordinary.\n  In 1996, the United Nations reported that the assets of the world's \n350 billionaires--that is, 350 individuals in this world who are \nbillionaires--exceeded the combined incomes of 45 percent of the \nworld's population, almost 3 billion people.\n  Let me say that again. The assets of the wealthiest 350 people in the \nworld exceeded the total assets of over 3 billion of our world's \ncitizens. But the larger promise made by the proponents of this \nunregulated world marketplace--particularly to the people of the United \nStates--was that living standards for the rest of Americans would also \nrise. That promise has not been realized. As trade and financial \nmarkets have been flung open, incomes have\n\n[[Page S4301]]\n\nrisen not faster, but more slowly. Income equality among nations has \nnot improved, and within nations, including the United States, income \ninequality has worsened.\n\n  But this seems not to matter to the promoters of this rapid \nderegulation of the global economy, the so-called neo-liberals, and \ntheir solution to whatever problems afflict us is, of course, more \ntrade liberalization. Ironically, many of them spent the last 30 years \nassociating the word ``liberal'' with social failure. In this instance, \nthey may prove themselves correct.\n  Nevertheless, it is the considered judgment of this administration \nand of the House of Representatives, albeit by a single vote, to \ncontinue in that direction. I expect this body will join with them by \npassing this trade promotion authority legislation.\n  Thus, the Dayton-Craig amendment represents one of the last \nopportunities for Congress to assert its priority for the economic \nwell-being of the American people over the capital-serving efficiencies \nof liberalized world markets. This amendment preserves Congress' \nability to look out for the best interests of all Americans, especially \nthe people who are on the losing side of the trade equation. And if we \ndon't look out for them, it is a near certainty that no one else will.\n  The Dayton-Craig amendment applies only to so-called trade remedy \nlaws. They were enacted and put into law by previous Congresses and \nPresidents to protect American business owners, workers, and farmers \nfrom illegal or unfair trade practices, and to assist those Americans \nwhose lives and livelihoods were irrevocably damaged by them. These \ntrade remedy laws include safeguards in section 201, which provide for \ntemporary duties, quotas, or other restrictions on imports that are \ntraded fairly but which threaten serious injury to a domestic industry. \nThey include anti-dumping remedies for the destructive effects of \nimports sold on the U.S. market at unfairly low prices, and \ncountervailing duty relief from the negative impact of imports \nreceiving foreign government subsidies. They also include section 301 \nof the Trade Act which authorizes the United States Trade \nRepresentative to investigate trade agreement violations and illegal \nforeign trade barriers which are harmful to U.S. businesses and \nexports, and to remedy those violations.\n  All of these remedies are already subject to the rules established \nunder the World Trade Organization and under the North American Free \nTrade Agreement. The United States and other WTO members must adhere to \nthe Uruguay Round Stipulations on subsidies and countervailing \nmeasures. This is hugely important. This is the first time the United \nStates has ever agreed to subjugate its sovereignty to an international \norganization. The folks who decried the Trilateral Commission and so-\ncalled one-world government, those who condemn the coordination of U.S. \nmilitary forces with NATO, and those who oppose any U.S. adherence to \ninternational agreements, are strangely silent about U.S. subjugation \nto the economic dictates of the World Trade Organization. Heretofore, \nthe WTO, has operated largely as the creation of the United States that \nit is. However, now that it is fully established and empowered with the \nunanimous consent of the participating countries and whose rules can \nonly be altered by the same, any sovereign powers negotiated away in \nfuture trade agreements that are agreed to by this body will not be \nredeemable, which is all the more reason why Congress should be \nvigilant over them.\n  The Dayton-Craig amendment says that Congress, along with the \nPresident, enacted these trade remedy laws, and only the President and \nCongress may eliminate them. They cannot be negotiated away by an \nunelected trade negotiator, albeit one selected by the President, who \nhas a much narrower perspective than Congress, who has the specific \nobjective to secure further trade agreements, and who may not share \nthis body's perspective and concerns. Since a letter from 62 Senators \nopposing the inclusion of trade remedy laws in future trade \nnegotiations was ignored, there is no reason to expect otherwise when \nthose negotiations finally occur.\n  So, when a new trade agreement comes to Congress, to the Senate, with \nthe trade remedy laws of the United States altered, with their \nprotections weakened, and with Congress' prior enactment of them \noverridden, then, if this trade promotion authority law is in effect--\nas it is written now without the Craig-Dayton amendment--we will be \nfaced with a take it or leave it proposition. We will have no \ndiscretion or latitude. It will be all or nothing.\n  This amendment will permit--not require, but permit--Congress to \nseparate those provisions in a proposed new trade agreement which alter \nexisting trade remedy laws, allow the rest of the agreement to proceed \nalong fast track, and then consider those trade remedy changes under \nregular Senate rules and procedures. Then, Congress can decide, as \nonly Congress should decide, whether they must be given up for some \nlarger gain. Then, we, or our successors, will be able to look our \nconstituents in their eyes and tell them that we have acted in their \ncollective best interests.\n\n  Trade negotiators look at those trade remedy laws and they see words, \nor bargaining chips, or perhaps even nuisances to get rid of. We see \npeople, our constituents, who elected us and who depend upon us to look \nout for their interests. So when words which protect them are going to \nbe removed, those decisions should be reviewed by their elected \nRepresentatives.\n  Last week, the trade ambassador said that you cannot be for this \namendment and be for trade. There is great irony in an unelected \nofficial in the executive branch, which has no constitutional authority \nover trade, telling 535 elected Members of Congress, to whom the \nConstitution assigns the full responsibility for foreign trade, \nessentially to butt out of his domain. He was quoted as saying:\n\n       This goes to the heart, of whether the Congress is going to \n     try to negotiate with 435 Members of the House and 100 \n     Senators, whether they want to go over to Brussels and all \n     sit around together, or whether they are going to have the \n     Executive Branch negotiate.\n\n  My reply, Mr. Ambassador, is: You negotiate and then Congress will \nexercise its responsibilities under the United States Constitution. If \nour trading partners question those procedures, show them a copy of our \nConstitution. We bring government officials from all over the world \nhere to learn about our system of government. This is another teaching \nopportunity. Under our Constitution, we do not permit one person--no \nmatter who he or she is--to bargain away our laws. No one--not even the \nPresident of the United States--has that authority. And no one who \nunderstands our Constitution should seek that authority.\n  While our country's future trade policies are debatable, the right of \nCongress to participate actively in setting those policies is not. For \nanyone to try to usurp that authority is seriously misguided. If it \nsucceeds, Congress has failed, failed its responsibility, failed the \nConstitution, and failed the people of America.\n  By adopting this amendment, the Senate upholds that right and that \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the Dayton-Craig \namendment, I wish to speak for a few moments about the constructs of \nthe amendment itself and applaud my colleague and partner in this \namendment, the Senator from Minnesota, for a very thorough and well-\nthought-out explanation as to the reason for this amendment.\n  I need not repeat the statistics. I need not repeat the facts that \nhave been so eloquently spoken about a problem that exists in our \ncountry today that begs for a remedy and, at the same time, demands \nthat we move forward in the area of expanding trade amongst our trading \npartners around the world.\n  The elements of fairness, the elements of transparency, the elements \nof the right hand knowing what the left hand is doing are absolutely \ncritical in any trade relationship.\n  By the character of a developing economy, by the uniqueness of a \nresource-directed economy, by the uniqueness of a populated economy, \nall of our countries around the world have differences. And those \ndifferences have values. And those countries that sense those values \nwork to protect them or\n\n[[Page S4302]]\n\nin some way assure that they will not be traded down or effectively \ndestroyed by the very governments that are destined to protect them.\n  As a result of that, from the very beginning, and from the beginning \nof the debate over trade, very substantively coming with the Kennedy \nRound of trade years ago, when we first established the fast-track \nconcept, we knew our trade negotiators, once they were at the table of \ninternational negotiations, would have to have flexibility to propose \nand bring back to the Congress a whole package. But that whole package \nhad to be representative of the laws of the country of which they were \ndiplomats.\n  We have struggled with that over the years. Congress has consistently \npassed fast tracks, and we have worked to move progressively and to \nliberalize our trade laws. We, the United States, have been the world's \npromoters of trade. It is quite simple why we would want to be that.\n  In my State of Idaho, nearly a third of every acre planted of \nagricultural produce has to sell in world markets to maintain some \ndegree of value in a domestic market.\n  My State was built on potatoes, potato chips. Now it is being built \non computer chips. And those products have to sell in world markets. \nClearly, the DRAMs that are produced by Micron, a large portion of \nthose move into international markets to be applied to new technologies \nbeing developed in those markets that then again sell in the world \nmarket.\n  Clearly, in my State, trade has expanded dramatically in the last \nseveral decades. But while the hi-tech economy has grown very well with \na substantial amount of profitability, the agricultural economy has \nfloundered. And while trade has been extremely beneficial in some \nareas, I would have to argue, as the Senator from Minnesota has, that \nin other areas it appears to have been less than fair and, in many \ninstances, not fair at all.\n  There is a bit of a classic struggle going on between the United \nStates and Canada in our forest products industries, forest products \nindustries that are in part supply, publicly owned in the sense that \nthe timber comes from public lands. Whether it is the Federal lands of \nthe U.S. Forest Service in the lower 48 and Alaska or whether it is \ncrowned and provincial timber in Canada, the reality of placing values \non those rough products as they move to the market is substantially \ndifferent.\n  Over the years we have fought mightily to create balance. But as a \nresult of some of what we believed to be unfair practices between \nCanada and the United States, we have seen the rights of our policies \ngo out and our men and women walk away with empty lunch pails while \nCanadians were aggressively logging and dumping in our markets. Just \nthis year our President had to use trade remedy laws to stop the very \nprocess I have just defined. He stood up and he spoke out and he placed \na tariff against Canadian lumber until such time as they can come back \nto the table and balance out with us a relationship and an agreement \nthat does not put our men and women out of work and still allows them \nto work and still allows the beneficial reality of Canadian and U.S. \nsticks, 2 by 4s, being at the local lumberyard to build the homes of \nAmericans.\n  That is called balanced trade. That is called fair trade. The 201 \nprocess that brought about the investigation by our government, which \nwas open and transparent, and that led our President to move is known \nas a trade remedy law passed by the U.S. Congress, passed by a majority \nvote out of this body--in other words, reflective of the constitutional \nresponsibility of every Senator and every U.S. Member of Congress \nrepresenting their States but, most importantly, taking an oath right \nthere in that well to uphold the Constitution of the United States.\n  The argument is simple and the argument has been made already today \nby the administration in a letter to all of our colleagues that fast \ntrack is simply a process and we make all of these proposals and we \nmake all of these changes and all of them come back for a vote in this \nChamber and they are correct--one vote, up or down.\n  The problem occurs with the anticipation of the positives that will \nhappen in an overall trade package once negotiated because they are \nnever quite negotiated in a vacuum. The process goes on for years and \nyears, as you have round after round and finally they conclude; there \nis a lot of attention and the world finally says, Oh, here it is, here \nis a trade package, a product of WTO, a product of aggressive \nnegotiations, probably a product of the new round launched last year in \nDoha. The anticipation is so great and the public pressure is so great \nthat when it gets to the well of the Senate and we see that substantive \nlaw has been changed and we would like to fix it, we cannot. We can \nvote against it, but the pressure by business, by industry, by the \neconomy in general is you must pass this trade package. And we do. And \nwe have consistently.\n  As a result, some of us have had to vote no. I voted no against \nNAFTA. Why? Because of some environmental provisions in it and because \nof loopholes that I felt were in it, that an 18-wheeler truckload with \nCanadian grain could get through and into our markets were a reality, \nand they were and I voted against it, and time has proven that to be \nthe case.\n\n  But it has also proven one other thing--that Canadians are very good \nat enforcing laws at the border and we are very bad. But that was then. \nThis is now. This administration is acting differently, and it is \nacting responsibly, and it led with the steel decision and it has now \nfollowed with the softwood lumber decision, and it is saying that it \nwill effectively use a very transparent process to review the fairness \nor the lack of fairness in trade relationships and where it finds \ndumping it will move. And it has. I credit them for that.\n  But what I am also saying, what the Senator from Minnesota is saying \nis that within the process itself, we can avoid some of the problems \nthat have now been recorded over the last several decades if we would \nbe allowed, on laws that we are proposing to be changed that might \nreduce the ability of the executive branch of our Government to enforce \ntrade remedy laws, to say that they would apply to a point of order and \na simple majority vote, the same vote it takes to pass the trade \npackage that would be in the Chamber that they would be a part of. So I \nwould say to any negotiator, if you are negotiating a package that \ncannot get 51 votes in this Chamber, and you are proposing changes in \nsubstantive law that might be required to get 51 votes, wherein lies \nthe problem, especially if we are defending what I believe to be the \nvery thing that the Senator from Minnesota has talked about--our \nconstitutional responsibility and the sovereignty in doing that.\n  Every administration and this administration protects with a \nvengeance its executive prerogatives, its executive authority, and we \nhave seen this administration step up to that on at least two occasions \nin the last couple of years. That is what we are doing today--stepping \nup to what is, in fact, a legislative prerogative of the Constitution \nand why we think it is right that it be allowed to be a part of this \npackage requiring a simple majority vote.\n  What am I saying? The Dayton-Craig amendment is simply a point of \norder that would be part of it. That is, if a package comes to the \nfloor and there are changes in trade remedy law--and in the current \npackage that we are alleging we will know if they are there without \neven having to look because 90 days prior, under the law proposed, the \nnegotiators would have to announce proposals of changes in the law. \nThat is part of what came out of the House. That is part of what the \nFinance Committee, Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley agreed on. And \nthat is appropriate. It is appropriate that the legislative bodies of \nthis constitutional Republic understand that changes in the laws that \nthey have written are being proposed. What we are saying today is that \nthere ought to be the next step and that next step is quite simple--to \nallow a simple majority vote of the constitutional officers of this \nbody--us, U.S. Senators--to say whether those changes are right.\n  Now, here is the next step, though: but to do so without dragging the \nwhole trade package down. Not all trade packages are changes in our \nlaws. They are expansions of authority. They are access to other \nmarkets. They are adjustments in other laws--ours and\n\n[[Page S4303]]\n\ntheirs, our trading partners. And so we are saying you do not bring \ndown the whole package; there is good in trade and we know that. But \nwhat we are saying is that there is an authority and a responsibility \nthat we should not abrogate or that we should not cast in such a way as \nto never be able to get there because the value of the whole appears to \nbe so much greater and so important at that moment in time than the \nlong-term constitutional responsibility of these Senators.\n\n  So the Senators from Minnesota and Idaho, pass go, because the whole \nis so much more important than the parts. We are here today to tell you \nthat the parts are darned important. They are constitutionally \nimportant.\n  And now let me try to set another stage for you about the pressures \ninvolved.\n  Our trade remedy process, countervailing duty, antidumping, 201 is \ntransparent. It is a public process. If you, Mr. President, are a \nmanufacturer in your State and you feel you are being dramatically \nharmed by a product coming in under a trade agreement, you have a \ncourse of action. Now, it takes a couple of years. It is open, it is \npublic, and it will cost you money because you will have to get the \nattorneys and you will have to make the argument. If it is dramatic \ndumping and dramatic competition, you might be out of business before \nyou get a remedy, but the remedy is still there and it is still open \nand it is still public. What we have tried to do and what our \nnegotiators have tried to do since the Kennedy round forward is to \nconvince other countries of the world to make their processes more \ntransparent.\n  Now, over time, there has been a shift. The shift has been away from \ntheir duties and away from their penalties toward antidumping \nprovisions, not unlike ours. They are not transparent. Sometimes they \nare cast or administered in the dark of night. And so what our trading \npartners are telling our trade negotiators, or at least our trade \nnegotiators believe, is that we have to get rid of what we have to \ncause them to get rid of what they are getting or they have got as it \nrelates to trade remedy laws. In other words, we walk the plank first \nand maybe they will follow. In the meantime, what happens to the \nmanufacturers and the workers? What happens to the economies of Idaho \nand Minnesota? Do they have to shift to the new paradigm? Do the old \neconomies have to go away even though under a different day and a \ndifferent scenario they were viable and productive? Well, I guess I am \nfrustrated by it all.\n  Let me talk about what happened in November of 2001 at Doha, Qatar, \nwhen our trade negotiators were involved in a round that we worked very \nhard to get, that was a product of the fallout of the very tragic round \nthat occurred in Seattle, which basically fell apart as a result of \nnational and international dissidents and disruption. In Doha this past \nNovember, our administration agreed to reopen negotiations on \nagreements of implementation of article 5 of the GATT--that is called \non antidumping and countervailing duties--and on subsidies and \ncountervailing pressures. The World Trade Organization had already \nruled a number of times against our domestic trade remedy laws under \nthese agreements and stated: the stated purpose of almost every other \nWTO member in securing these new negotiations is to further weaken U.S. \ntrade law; in other words, further weaken the ability of the U.S. \nGovernment to protect its work force and its producers and its \nindustries from what might be dumping, what might be clearly antitrade \nor unfair trade.\n  The Japanese Government was elated by that action. They said: We are \nsatisfied. This constitutes a major victory for their efforts to gut \nour trade laws. Those are the words of the Japanese economy, trade and \nindustry minister. He said: ``We are 120 percent satisfied that that's \nwhere the Bush administration wants to go.''\n  The USTR sacrificed our antidumping and countervailing duty laws in \norder to get a new round of talks at the table--not yet; they simply \nput them on the table.\n  Now, here is where I think the Senator from Minnesota and I agree and \nwe also agree with our Trade Ambassador. There is nothing wrong with \nputting those issues on the table. When you are sitting at a \nnegotiating table, everything ought to be negotiable, if the goal is to \nmove from here to here and the benefits that will accrue as a result of \nthat proposal are positive for our economies. So, our Trade Ambassador, \nput it on the table.\n  But in putting it on the table, it is important that you recognize \nwho made those laws and how we ultimately ought to address them. And \nwhat we are saying is, put them on the table; talk about them. See if \nthere is a better way to get where we need to go in 2002 than there was \nin 1960. The world has changed dramatically. We understand that. We are \nwilling to listen to it. Put it on the table. The laws we passed in \n1960 may not apply today.\n  But in putting it on the table, we are simply saying: And you bring \nback proposed changes in current law, not new law, in current trade \nremedy laws that are subject to a point of order. Why? Because this \nsovereign body created those laws. And the executive branch of \ngovernment does not have a right to change them. And they don't. They \nonly propose changes, but they do so in an environment that almost \nalways assures that never will that vote occur.\n  It is a rather simple approach. We are being told by the \nadministration and by some in it that this destroys TPA. It has been \neditorialized that this is a bitter pill. Then the other day it was \ncalled a torpedo. Today, in what is a well-meaning but not totally \naccurate letter from the administration, they strongly opposed it.\n  Let me go through the letter in the context of what I have just \ntalked about, about the flexibility of negotiations. Before I do that, \nlet me drop back a moment to something I think is important, and it is \na frustration that our negotiators deal with when they are in the \nbusiness of negotiating.\n  I had the opportunity a couple of years ago to be part of an observer \nteam at The Hague at a climate change conference. The head of the U.S. \nteam of the Clinton administration that was there said at the beginning \nof that conference: We will not propose laws that will damage the \neconomy of the United States. And he said: No agreement is better than \na bad agreement. The conference began and the pressure built.\n  During that time I had the opportunity to have a dialog with some of \nour counterparts from different Parliaments around the world. For the \nfirst time, I began to understand that they don't understand us. They \ndidn't realize that a treaty negotiated by an administration and signed \noff on by an administration was not law until the Senate ratified it. \nWhy? Well, if you are a member of a parliamentary body and you are \nelected and then you, if you are in the majority party, elect the Prime \nMinister out of that, that Prime Minister and the parliamentary body \nare, in essence, one. If that Prime Minister signs off on a treaty, it \nis law, unless the country doesn't like it. Then you hold a special \nelection and get rid of the Prime Minister and the party. You get a new \nparty and a new Prime Minister. That is how it works for a lot of \ncountries in the world.\n  It does not work that way here. Our Founding Fathers created a \ndivision of labor in our Constitution. I think it was quite a clear \ndivision. When I began to say: The Kyoto treaty is not law in our \ncountry, it is a proposed treaty the Senate of the United States has \nrefused to consider, therefore, it is not law, therefore, our \nnegotiators don't have to negotiate to it or for it, the European \nparliamentarians, didn't understand that, or at least they chose not to \nunderstand it.\n  Of course, I was there as part of an observer team. I spent a lot of \ntime encouraging the team not to make bad law, not to craft an \nagreement with which we couldn't live. Ultimately, they could not agree \nwith the parliamentarians of Europe, and they came home.\n\n  That is the reality of where we are at the moment. That is why it is \nimportant to understand the frustrations our trade ambassador has when \nhe goes to the table and they say: Why can't you just negotiate \nsomething? That has been arguable, why we have wanted TPA or fast track \nover the years. It is why we originally gave it.\n  But from the 1960s to 2002, the world and the economies of the world \nand the economies of this country and the economies of Idaho and the \neconomies of Minnesota have changed dramatically in part because of \ntrade, both positive and negative.\n\n[[Page S4304]]\n\n  I believe it is right and proper that we debate this issue today, \nthat we don't sweep it under the rug, that we ask our colleagues to \nchoose whether we ought to have a point of order and whether we ought \nto have a simple majority vote on the need to change the trade remedy \nlaws of our country as proposed by the trade agreement that is on the \nfloor at the time or if we should retain the existing law.\n  In the letter sent this morning by the administration, they say that \n``first and foremost, the amendment derails TPA without \njustification.'' I disagree with that. The Senator from Minnesota said \nit so well: An appointed bureaucrat is not an elected Senator. The oath \nof office we take to adhere to the Constitution is so clear and so \nsimple and so important. We ought to be extremely cautious about \ndelegating that constitutional responsibility to an unelected official.\n  The trade ambassador would say: You don't do that. You ultimately get \nto vote on it. I think I have talked about the vote, the circumstances \nof the vote, the climate in which the vote is cast. That is why we are \nhere today suggesting we make some subtle changes in the law.\n  ``We have been committed not just to preserving U.S. trade laws but, \nmore importantly, to using them.'' This is the administration talking \nin the letter. You are right; they have. And yet we are saying: we want \nto preserve them if it fits for you to use. They are saying, no, no; \nthey can be negotiable or at least we want the right to negotiate.\n  We are not denying that right. I have said it once. The Senator from \nMinnesota has said it. We are not denying the right of negotiation at \nall. If we are bright and clear and articulate in what we do, we will \nnot sour the debate or the environment in which those negotiations \noccur because if I were a negotiator, I would say: You bet, we will \ntalk about it. We will put it on the table. It will require a simple \nmajority to pass. But then the whole agreement will.\n  In all fairness to the administration, they recognize in the letter \n41 Senators are a minority blocking this process. We offered to the \nadministration yesterday that we would make some modification. They did \nnot see fit to accept that. We went ahead. The Senator from Minnesota, \nwhen he offered the amendment this morning, modified it so it is not a \ntwo-thirds. It is a simple majority on the point of order, exactly the \nsame vote it takes to pass the whole package. I believe that is a \nreasonable and right approach and a fair approach toward dealing with \nthis issue.\n  A minority ought not be allowed to block trade law or any law for \nthat matter. We rule by a majority procedurally. We deal with \nsupermajorities on occasion, and we have done it here on occasion, and \nwith cloture and other issues to protect trade laws.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I am happy to respond.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator will recall--I would like the Record to show \nI ask the Senator, I received a call from a colleague on a matter this \nmorning and indicated a desire to change, modify this amendment and \nmake it more acceptable to the administration. I would like to ask if \nthat was the Senator's intent, to make this one that would be more \nacceptable to the administration?\n  Let me say also parenthetically that, as a member of the other \npolitical party, I do not intend this amendment in any respect to be \nsomething that is referenced to this particular administration. I \nrespect the role the administration has taken, that the trade \nambassador has taken with regard to the steel products, as the Senator \nindicated. I thought it was a very strong position the President took \nwith regard to the lumber coming from Canada; that, as the Senator \nsaid, this administration is far more aggressive than its predecessor \nin that regard, and also with regard to Canadian wheat. My concern in \noffering this was not with regard to any particular administration. My \ninterest was in protecting this Congress for many administrations to \ncome on this matter.\n  I ask the Senator, is this attempt on our part one that came out of \nthe Senator's negotiations and discussions with the administration?\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is that. I thought that was a right and reasonable \napproach. We should not ask for a supermajority on issues that can be \npassed or should be passed by a majority of the body.\n  The Senator from Minnesota listened to those arguments, accepted \nthose arguments today. I was pleased that his amendment could be \nmodified for that purpose.\n  In the administration's letter there is another argument. They say:\n\n       Secondly, the amendment would jeopardize our current trade \n     negotiations, especially the new global trade liberalization \n     mandate launched in Doha last November.\n\n  My reaction to that is, it does not.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       This is not a hypothetical observation. The failure to \n     launch a global trade negotiation at Seattle in 1999 was due \n     in significant part to a refusal even to discuss trade laws.\n\n  Well, that was then. This is now. I have just said--the Senator from \nMinnesota has just said--discuss trade laws. Put them on the table. \nLook at the fact that they might need adjustment or change, that laws \nwe have written in the 1960s might need some change.\n  All we are saying is, when the package comes back, it will require, \nif a point of order is brought against a change that you have already \nreported to us, Mr. Ambassador, a 50-percent plus one of those present \nand voting.\n  The conversation in Doha or the next round ought to go like this: \nWhile the Congress of the United States is giving us new expanded trade \nauthority and negotiation authority, it also recognized the strong \ndesire on the part of the citizens of our country to protect some \nprocess of trade remedy and trade remedy laws that are currently on the \nbooks of the United States. So any changes that we would make in them \nor propose to be made--and we are certainly willing to discuss those \nand talk about them, as we also want to talk about you, Spain, or you, \nFrance, or you, Germany, or somewhere else's trade laws--will be \nsubject to the same vote as required for passage of the trade package.\n  Instead of going with alarm, the ambassador ought to go with a very \nclear, matter-of-fact statement, and then roll up his sleeves and get \nat the business of negotiating in a way that I hope will help American \nagriculture and a lot of our industries.\n  Trade remedy laws are not off limits. Those are the words used in the \nadministration's letter today: Not off limits at all; available for \nfull discussion, full debate, negotiation and change subject to a \nmajority vote of the Senate. I think that is right, that is proper, and \nthat is what we ought to be about.\n  Their fourth argument was the WTO negotiations launched in Doha will \nnot impair our ability to enforce U.S. trade laws. I think our \nexplanation stands. If the ambassador brings back a package and in it \nthere is substantive law change proposed and the dynamics of the \npackage are such that the world and the economy of this country is \nsaying pass it, pass it, pass it, there will be no opportunity because \nthe law would not require, unless this amendment is adopted, us to make \nthose adjustments if collectively the Congress of the United States \nfelt the negotiators had gone beyond what we believe to be right and \nproper protection under those laws.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator from Idaho yield for a question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would like to propound a question to \nmy colleague. I believe this is one of the most important amendments we \nwill be dealing with on the trade promotion authority legislation. I am \npleased to be a cosponsor, and I will be pleased to speak in support of \nit at some point.\n  I ask the Senator from Idaho, is it the case that much of the angst \nthat exists with respect to recent trade agreements--U.S.-Canada, \nNAFTA, and others--is that when we see areas of clear trade problems, \nclear manipulation of the markets, clear abuse of trading practices, we \ncannot ever get much of a remedy?\n  We have all these trade agreements, but we cannot get a remedy; we \ncannot get a problem solved. Why? At least one of the reasons, in my \njudgment--and I inquire of the Senator from Idaho if he feels the same \nway--is that we have weakened all these remedies to the point that no \none wants to use\n\n[[Page S4305]]\n\nthem because they believe they are ineffective.\n  For example, section 22 is pretty much gone. In many ways, section \n301 is made much weaker by subsequent negotiations. The result is, it \ndoes not matter whether it is wheat from Canada or high-fructose corn \nsyrup from Mexico or a dozen items I could mention. We just cannot get \nanybody to tackle a remedy to say: Yes, this is unfair, and we will \nstand up on behalf of our producers and deal with it. That is why this \namendment makes so much sense.\n  If the Trade Representative negotiates a new trade agreement and that \nagreement further weakens remedies that now exist, my understanding is \nthe amendment allows that to come back to the Congress for an up-or-\ndown vote. I think that is one of the most important provisions that we \ncould adopt to this underlying bill.\n  I ask the Senator from Idaho, is it the case that the biggest problem \nthese days has been we cannot get a remedy for anything in \ninternational trade?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator from North Dakota has explained it very well, \nand that is the essence of this amendment. Again, a simple majority \nvote of this body will do so. Let me complete my comments. I have \nspoken long enough. There are others who wish to speak on this issue.\n  I close by speaking to the second-degree amendment the Senator from \nIowa has just proposed, and I hope at some time we appropriately will \nmove to table that second-degree amendment. Let me tell my colleagues \nwhy.\n  There is nothing in that amendment with which I disagree as part of \nprocess and procedure. You bet we should have talked about proposed \nsubstitutes and changes removed from, I call it the catchall title to \nthe advanced title, to a higher priority as it relates to the direction \nwe give our negotiators and ambassadors, the principles of negotiation \nand the objective of those principles.\n  The second-degree amendment, though, takes away the point of order. \nIt says, here is how you negotiate, but it does not deny the right of \nthe Senate to speak. I hope at the appropriate time, early afternoon, \nwe will offer a motion to table that amendment. I do believe we need a \ngood straight up-or-down vote on the Dayton-Craig amendment. It is an \nimportant amendment.\n  I yield the floor. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, at this time I am not going to address \neither my amendment or the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota and \nthe Senator from Idaho. I do wish to speak generically about the issue \nbefore us, to which the amendment of the Senators from Minnesota and \nIdaho are very central, and to remind my colleagues what trade \npromotion authority is all about.\n  First, as all my colleagues know, nothing can be done under the \nConstitution about trade unless the Congress of the United States does \nit, because one of our explicit powers in the Constitution is to \nregulate interstate and foreign commerce. It is our authority, and \nCongress rightfully and according to our oath of office ought to \nprotect our constitutional responsibilities, and we ought to perform \nour constitutional responsibilities.\n  For the first 150-year history of our country, when all Congress had \nto do in regard to trade was put on tariffs, up or down, and other \nbusiness of that nature, it was very appropriate for Congress to \ninitiate and finalize action as far as the regulation of interstate and \nforeign commerce was concerned.\n  Since the 1930s, we have been involved in cooperative efforts with \nother countries to reduce tariff and nontariff trade barriers because \nit was seen then and today as mutually beneficial to all nations to do \nso. We have been involved in international agreements and international \nfora to accomplish those goals.\n  One can imagine how impossible it would be then in an international \nforum to have 535 Members of Congress, in a meeting of 142 countries, \nnegotiating trade agreements, with the Congress of the United States \nspeaking for the United States. It is almost impossible for Congress to \nreach an agreement among its Members without, in the process, trying to \nnegotiate with 142 other countries. So for the last 25 years, or some \npeople would say in different ways since 1935, we have given the \nPresident permission to negotiate agreements with other countries.\n  In a sense, the United States, through this legislation and previous \nlegislation, has set up a contract with the President of the United \nStates saying we would like to have him negotiate for the Congress of \nthe United States, where the constitutional power lies, some agreements \nunder strict authority that we would give the President, and with \nCongress having final authority to adopt what was negotiated if we \nagreed to it.\n  We are talking about giving the President the power to negotiate for \nus because it is an impossibility for the Congress to enter such a \nforum.\n  The basic question to our colleagues as they consider Dayton-Craig \nand other amendments is: Do they want the President of the United \nStates to have this authority? This is not blanket authority given to \nthe President of the United States. It is very confined to subject \nmatter. It is very confined to the President reporting to the Congress \nof the United States on a regular basis what has been done and to get \nour feedback so that the President carries out the intent of Congress \nin the negotiations.\n  Finally, the President of the United States has to come to an \nagreement with 142 countries. Remember, that is not done by a majority \nvote of those 142 countries. That is done by consensus. So if the \nPresident of the United States feels the interests of the United States \nare not adequately protected, all the President has to do is walk away, \nand there is no new WTO agreement.\n  Eventually, if the President decides U.S. interests are being \nprotected and he agrees to it and the other 142 countries agree to it, \nthen it comes to us to make a decision whether or not the interests of \nthe United States are adequately protected as the President negotiated \nwith us, and it takes a majority vote in the House and Senate for that \nto become law of the land.\n  The basic question before the Senate in the Dayton-Craig amendment is \nwhether or not they want the President of the United States to be \ncredible at the bargaining table. The issue is whether or not the \nPresident will be credible if, when he reaches an agreement, there is \nopportunity in the Senate to have separate votes on separate parts of \nthe agreement so some can be dropped and others might be adopted.\n  Do my colleagues think the other 142 countries of the WTO are going \nto negotiate with our country on that basis?\n  Do you think there will be a final agreement? No. The Dayton-Craig \namendment undoes the pattern of this contract between the President of \nthe United States and the Congress over the last 25 years.\n  So we all have to ask ourselves: Has the United States prospered by \nour international agreements over the last quarter of a century by the \nprocess that is once again before us to set up a contract with the \nPresident of the United States to negotiate? I have come to the \nconclusion this process has been good, but I am a Republican. Maybe \nDemocrats would question my judgment of whether or not this is a good \nprocess.\n  So I have said before in this debate, and I want to say again, listen \nto what President Clinton said as he correctly bragged about the \nagreements he finalized--that started in previous administrations--\nduring his first year in office. The North American Free Trade \nAgreement and the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement of Tariffs and \nTrades were finalized during his first months in office.\n  He says as a result of those agreements, and I suppose he would say, \ntoo, predecessors to those agreements, that the United States has \nbenefited very well by it. And he used, as I heard him say so many \ntimes, that there were, I think the figure was, 22 million jobs created \nduring his administration, and one-third of those jobs were related to \ntrade.\n  If President Clinton says that, if President Bush believes this is a \ngood process to continue, and you have one Democratic President and one \nRepublican President who think proceeding down the road that we have \ngone for the last 25 years is the right road to go, I think it would \ncarry some weight with people on both sides of the aisle and it would \nbe a no-brainer that this\n\n[[Page S4306]]\n\nprocess ought to be continued. Our colleagues are suggesting that would \nput a kink in this machine, and that might not be the thing to do. I \nraise those questions with my colleagues.\n  I also raise the questions with my colleagues of whether or not the \npresent trade remedies are working, which I heard a few minutes ago. \nWell, what do they think the steel agreement is all about? The \nPresident is looking out for our basic industry, to give it some help \nthrough transition. The President looked at that and decided that other \ncountries dumping steel in the United States was not right, and our \neconomy was being hurt by it. He stepped in, in a very strong way, to \nprotect our interests.\n  I think of the 201 process where the previous President stepped in, \nin the case of lamb coming into the United States from New Zealand and \nAustralia. I suppose there are a lot of others I ought to refer to, but \nour Presidents, Republican and Democrat, have been willing to use the \ntools that are on the table. Other nations are beginning to learn from \nthe United States and are willing to take action to protect their \nindustries in a way that is going to eventually hurt us.\n  We have been the pioneers of trade remedy legislation for a long \nperiod of time, and other nations have somewhat resented our using it, \nand they are beginning to learn from us and use it. Now they are doing \nit in a way that is not as transparent as the United States. They do it \nprobably in a way that is less concerned about their using it on the \nworld economy than what our Presidents have done in regard to our \naction and the world economy.\n  Now, are we going to say we should not be looking out for our \ninterests on trade remedy legislation? I think what they are saying is \nwe ought to let the rest of the world adopt these measures, even if \nthey hurt the United States. Some examples: South Africa imposing \ndumping duties on United States poultry, closing an important $14 \nmillion market; Mexico imposing dumping duties on United States high-\nfructose corn syrup, decreasing our exports by half, $30 million; \nMexico imposing dumping duties on certain United States swine, formerly \na $450 million market; Mexico imposing dumping duties on certain cuts \nof beef affecting companies' abilities to service and grow this $512 \nmillion market. Just this year, Canada imposed dumping duties on United \nStates tomatoes, $115 million. In 1999, Canada imposed dumping duties \non exports of United States corn, a $36 million market resulting in \nlittle United States corn exported to Canada for 4 months until a \nprovisional duty was removed.\n\n  These are examples of the rest of the world learning from the United \nStates. Consequently, don't we in the United States think it would be \nbetter if our country or our President were at the table negotiating to \nsee that these things did not happen? I think those are the issues \nbefore us.\n  I probably have implied very much that Dayton-Craig is a bad \napproach. My point is to simply say I hope my 99 other colleagues will \nlook at the practice of the last 25 years, which has been a credible \napproach for the United States to be at the negotiating table, and say: \nDo you really want to change that? Do you want to change the \ncredibility of the President of the United States at the negotiating \ntable?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, of course the Senator from Iowa is \ncorrect; the Constitution does provide in article I, section 8, that \nthe Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign \nnations--not the President, not the trade ambassador, but the Congress. \nThat is in the Constitution of this country.\n  The Congress has, over some period of time, decided it would like to \nput handcuffs on itself so these handcuffs would prevent it from being \ninvolved in any trade negotiation or trade agreement that came back to \nthe Congress. If it did not like a provision, if it thought a provision \nwas not in accordance with this country's interests, the Congress will \nhave said, by fast track or trade promotion authority, no, we are not \nallowed to offer amendments to that trade agreement. Congress has done \nthat on previous occasions. I do not support that. I do not believe it \nis appropriate.\n  What the Senators from Minnesota and Idaho are saying with respect to \nfast track, or trade promotion authority, which will tie the Congress's \nhands, at least in regard to the issue of providing trade remedies for \ntrade abuses that exist, that our businesses and our employees in this \ncountry have to try to deal with, at least with respect to those trade \nremedies, Congress ought to have a say in that if someone negotiates a \ntrade agreement that weakens those trade remedies.\n  We have had plenty of examples: Section 22 was largely negotiated \naway; section 301 has been diminished in importance. So we have had \nexamples where the trade remedies are not available.\n  My colleague from Iowa cited some of the trade abuses that I could \ncite. On high-fructose corn syrup to Mexico he says: Yes, that is a \nproblem. Do not blame us. Let us not blame America for trade abuses \nthat are imposed by other countries.\n\n  Unfair wheat subsidies or unfair wheat trade flooding into this \ncountry from Canada, that is a problem. That is not our fault; that is \nCanada's fault. The high-fructose corn syrup, that is Mexico's fault.\n  I could go on to give a dozen such examples, but let's not blame our \ncountry for trade abuses that are committed by other countries. Let's \nmake sure businesses in our country and their workers know that when \nanother country does that, when it tries to rig the marketplace with a \ntrade practice that is abusive, then we have a remedy against it.\n  Ralph Waldo Emerson said that common sense is genius dressed in work \nclothes. When we deal with trade issues, I find very little genius \nthese days, especially in Washington, DC. Almost all of the debate that \nought to be thoughtful turns thoughtless in an instant. This morning's \nWashington Post editorial is an example of that, suggesting this \namendment is going to torpedo this trade promotion authority \nlegislation. It will do nothing of the sort. It strengthens it.\n  Let me give some examples of what is going on in trade. Canada pushes \nan avalanche of grain into our country, unfairly subsidized, unfairly \ntraded in our country by a Canadian wheat board that is a sanctioned \nmonopoly in Canada which would be illegal in this country. So our \nfarmers are confronted with this massive amount of unfair trade, and it \ntakes money right out of the pockets of our family farmers, and nothing \ncan be done about it. It has been going on for 10 years. It was given \nthe green light, incidentally, in the United States-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement, which I voted against; nonetheless, this has been going on \nrelentlessly, and nobody does anything about it.\n  We had an investigation by the ITC, and they said: Yes, Canada is \nguilty of unfair trade. There was a 301 action filed by wheat growers \nin my State, and the trade ambassador said: No, despite the fact that \nthere is a conclusion that Canada is guilty of unfair trade, we will \nnot impose fair trade quotas that United States law would allow because \nit might be inconsistent with NAFTA and the WTO. But Ambassador \nZoellick says to farmers: Don't lose hope. Under U.S. laws you can \nalways consider filing antidumping or countervailing duty cases.\n\n  Let me show my colleagues a Congress Daily Report, November 26, \n2001--November 9 through 14: The WTO ministerial at Doha, Qatar, Trade \nRepresentative Zoellick agreed that U.S. antidumping laws could be \ndiscussed as the new round gets underway.\n  In other words, in the next round the antidumping laws will be up for \ndiscussion because many countries don't want us to have antidumping \nlaws. They want to dump their products into the American marketplace, \nand if our producers are concerned about that--saying we cannot \ncompete, we will have to close our plant, we can't compete against \nproducts coming from China or Japan or Europe or Canada or Mexico or \nKorea, we can't possibly compete against them because they are dumping \nat below the cost of acquisition, what are we going to do--we are going \nto put this on the table to talk about. Maybe we can get rid of \ncountervailing duty or antidumping laws. Maybe the next negotiation in \na room, behind a closed door, in which we are not present, the American \npeople are\n\n[[Page S4307]]\n\nnot present, trade negotiators from all around the world will decide \nthat the United States will agree to get rid of its antidumping laws. \nMaybe that is what will happen.\n  If that happens, I sure want the Congress to be able to vote on that \nseparately on behalf of farmers, factory workers, steelworkers. I want \nCongress to have a shot at saying yes or no, and my vote is going to be \na resounding no.\n  One final point, if I might. I have just had a bellyful of people \nsaying it is wrong to worry about protecting America's interests. The \nword ``protect'' has become a vulgarism in trade speech, and I find \nthat Byzantine.\n  Who in this Chamber does not want to stand up and protect our \ncountry's interests? Who do you not want to protect? Do you not want to \nprotect a steel industry that is under siege from unfairly subsidized \nshipments into this country? Do you not want to protect farmers and \nfactory workers? Who is it you do not want to protect? Isn't it our job \nto decide that we will protect our industries to the extent of \ndemanding fair trade?\n  I don't mean, by ``protection,'' saying we are going to put walls \naround our country. I don't mean that at all. I don't believe we should \ndo that. I believe we ought to be required and able to compete at any \ntime, at any place in the world. That competition does not mean, \nhowever, that our companies and our workers ought to compete with 12-\nyear-olds who work 12 hours a day and are paid 12 cents an hour in some \nplant 8,000 miles away, and some company takes the product of that \nplant and moves it to a store shelf in Pittsburgh or Fargo or Los \nAngeles or Pocatello. It is not fair trade and it is not what our \nbusinesses and workers ought to have to put up with.\n  When we talk about protecting our country's economic interests, it is \nnot about diminishing trade or putting walls around our country. It is \nabout saying we have a right in this country to protect the economic \ninterests of businesses and workers who want to play by the rules when \nthey confront others in this world who decide they will not play by the \nrules.\n  One final point. I have made this point over and over because it is \nso dramatic. I want to mention automobile trade with Korea to \ndemonstrate what is happening on a range of things throughout the world \nin a way that hurts our workers and hurts our companies. Last year, \nKorea sent us 630,000 cars, Daewoos, Hyundais, and others. Madam \nPresident, 630,000 Korean cars came into the U.S. marketplace. Good for \nthem.\n\n  Last year, we were only able to sell 2,800 cars in Korea. Let me say \nthat again: 630,000 Korean cars coming to the United States, and we \nwere only able to get 2,800 U.S. cars sold in Korea. Do you know why? \nBecause the Korean Government doesn't want American cars sold in Korea. \nIt is very simple. And that is not fair. We ought to say to Korea and \nother countries, if your market is open to American products, then our \nmarket is open to you. But if we make the American marketplace open to \nyour products, then you had better open your marketplace or you find a \nway to sell your cars in Kishasa, Zaire, next year and see how you like \nthat marketplace.\n  I want to speak a little later, but let me say Senator Dayton and \nSenator Craig have propounded an amendment that is very important. All \nit says is we need to preserve the opportunity to vote if someone \nbehind a closed door in some room half a world away is going to \nnegotiate away the remedies for unfair trade, our remedies to get after \nand take after the unfair trade that exists.\n  That is not antitrade; that is protrade. That is not undercutting the \nbill that is on the floor of the Senate; that in fact will strengthen \nand improve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Senator from South Carolina has asked \nto speak.\n  Under the previous order, we are to go out in 1 minute. I ask \nunanimous consent the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Hollings, be \nrecognized for up to 15 minutes, and this will be for debate only. At \nthat time, we would go out for the party caucuses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I thank the distinguished leader and \nthe two distinguished sponsors of this particular amendment, the \nSenator from Minnesota and the Senator from Idaho. There is nothing \nbetter than a clear-cut, clean-cut little amendment, this particular \nprovision. It simply says: Wait a minute, we don't want just an up-or-\ndown vote on an overall patchwork of all kinds of trade measures, and \nall kinds of articles, and everything else of that kind.\n  Somebody might not like what they got on prunes. Somebody might not \nlike what they have on textiles and everything else.\n  We are not disturbing whatever the negotiations are of our special \nTrade Representative, or the President. They tried to label it as \neither you are for the President or against the President. That is \nbaloney.\n  What it says is: Wait a minute, before you have to vote up or down to \njust bring a whole trade bill down, let's make certain the basic laws \nare right. Here is how it reads:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law [it] . . . shall \n     not apply to any provisions in an implementing bill being \n     considered by the Senate that modifies or amends, or requires \n     a modification of, or an amendment to, any law of the United \n     States that provides safeguards from unfair foreign trade \n     practices to United States businesses or workers, including--\n     imposition of countervailing and antidumping duties . . . \n     national security import restrictions--\n\n  It goes down and lists those things that they are trying to safeguard \nfrom unfair trade practices.\n  Even then, only on a point of order will the majority vote up or \ndown. So you do not have to argue the entire trade measure that they \nhave spent months and months, sometimes years and years on. You can \njust bring it to a majority vote.\n  If I were the President or anybody else were the President, they \nwould say please put that in there. We are not trying to superimpose \nthis kind of authority over the Congress. Article I, section 8, of the \nConstitution says that the Congress has that responsibility. It is not \nthe responsibility of the Special Trade Representative, not the Supreme \nCourt, not the President--we have the responsibility. What I am trying \nto do is protect that responsibility. The administration should want me \nprotecting the Constitution.\n  What really is happening is that people do not understand the fix. \nLet me explain what I call the fix.\n  If you go back to the early '90s to the enactment of NAFTA, the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, the trade treaty with Mexico, it was a \nvery interesting thing.\n  The New York Times published an article, after the vote was cast, \nabout the 26 freebies that President Clinton did, to put on the fix in \norder to pass that particular measure. He gave two golf rounds, one in \nCalifornia, and another one somewhere in Arkansas for votes; he gave \ntwo C-17s to another Congressman; he gave a cultural center to \nCongressman Pickle, down in Texas, for a vote.\n  At least those freebies, in order to fix the vote, got some people \nsome jobs. Look the golf matches at least got somebody a job to cut the \ngrass.\n  Let's clear the air and understand what is going on right now. Under \nMr. Bush's plan, we would not be allowed to debate and consider these \ntrade measures--except in a limited way. The Senators from Minnesota \nand Idaho, said: Heavens above, let us have at least the national \nsecurity laws, countervailing duties, and antidumping laws--where a \npoint of order will give you an up-or-down vote and you do not have to \nvote up or down the entire trade measure.\n  There is a very interesting article here--the unmitigated gall of the \nproponents of fast track.\n  Let me read it:\n\n       The Bush Administration indicated that the President might \n     veto trade legislation if the Senate adds a provision that \n     would allow Congress to amend foreign trade agreements the \n     President negotiates. This week, the Senate is considering \n     granting Bush fast track trade powers. Under fast track, \n     Congress could approve or reject trade pacts but could not \n     amend them. However, Senators Mark Dayton, Democrat of \n     Minnesota, and Larry Craig, Republican of Idaho, are pushing \n     an amendment that would allow Congress to change trade pacts. \n     They say Congress must have the power to make changes\n\n[[Page S4308]]\n\n     to protect U.S. workers. Commerce Department officials said \n     that would defeat the purpose of fast track and they would \n     recommend that Bush veto the legislation.\n\n  In short, yes, the President does not have the authority under the \nConstitution. The Congress, under article I, section 8, has the \nauthority and the responsibility. The President, and his little minion, \nRobert Zoellick, the Trade Representative--he runs around and smiles \nand grins in all of these places, and he can amend anything. He can \namend the laws. But, oh, they bring and amend the laws with respect to \nour national security, with respect to countervailing duties and \nantidumping provisions. He can amend it. But the Congress can't even \nconsider it on an up-or-down vote.\n  Can you imagine the polls in such a situation as this. That Grassley \namendment ought to be tabled immediately and we should not wait for \n2:15. There isn't any question in my mind that this thing has gotten \ntotally out of hand. The trade laws are not successes. The \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa points out that everything has been \ncoming up roses. But the fact is, we have been going out of business. \nBecause of NAFTA we lost 53,900 textile jobs alone in the little State \nof South Carolina, 700,000 around the country--not just 20,000 \nsteelworkers. So we lost all of those jobs. And we are going out of \nbusiness. And the Congress of the United States tells them: Retrain, \nreeducate, high-tech, global competition. The President says you don't \nunderstand it.\n  We understand it. We retrain. I told the story--I will repeat it \nright quickly--of the Oneida mill in Andrews that made the little T-\nshirts. At the time of the closing, they had 487 workers there. The \naverage age was 47. The next morning they did it the President's way. \nThey retrained the employees. They are re-skilled. They are now 487 \nskilled computer operators.\n  Are you going to hire a 47-year-old computer operator or a 21-year-\nold computer operator? You are not taking on the retirement costs, you \nare not taking on the health costs of the 47-year-old. So it is a real \nproblem.\n  Here we have the responsibility, and this crowd will not even let us \ndo our job. The arrogance of this K Street crowd who writes these trade \nmeasures is unbelievable. And the President of the United States went \nover on the House side, and by one vote he promised--what?--he would do \na fundraiser. So he has been down to Greenville to show up at a \nfundraiser.\n  It is money that talks, that controls here. You do not argue the \ntrade measure, whether it is in the best interests of our country or \nnot. This thing has gotten totally out of hand. And to come here and \nsay whether this President likes it or that President likes it, well, \nthis Senator does not like it at all.\n  We have many other measures, too. I noticed that Nick Calio, and his \nminion at the White House, said we have to get on, we can get rid of \nthis bill this week and we can get it to conference, and everything \nelse like that. We have barely been able to get on this particular \namendment to discuss it. And then they say, well, we will put in a \nlittle maneuver here. And we will fix that vote. And we will not even \nhave it, even when they have changed it from a 60-vote point of order \ndown to just a majority vote up or down. They will not even let you \nhave a majority up-or-down vote on the security of the United States \nunder the responsibilities of the Senate.\n\n  They say that past Presidents like it. Past Presidents don't go back \ndown to Arkansas--they move to New York. They don't sell this trade \nbill as being good for farmers in Arkansas, I can tell you that. They \nwon't run for election down there. And they won't do it in my State of \nSouth Carolina, either.\n  It is a hearty development to find the distinguished Senator from \nIdaho, and the Senator from North Dakota--they know that agricultural \nbusiness extremely well. They are now joining in because they are \nlosing all the agriculture. The 3\\1/2\\ million farmers that we have in \nAmerica cannot outproduce 700 million farmers in China. That is why we \nhave a deficit in the balance of trade with respect to corn.\n  They tell me that now China is shipping to Japan and Korea some of \ntheir wheat so they can continue to appear as if they are taking our \nwheat. But we are going out of business there. And we will not have the \nwonderful export of America's most productive production; namely, \nAmerica's agriculture.\n  So I hope we will slow down, stop, look, and listen, and understand \nthat all we are trying to do is our job. And our job is to regulate \nforeign commerce. Please let us have a vote up or down. Do not come in \nand say, you cannot even have an up-or-down vote on the antidumping \nsubstantive law, that you can repeal it. Because once they repeal it in \nDoha, or any other foreign land, we're in trouble. When the trade reps \nmeet to discuss agreements they don't go to places like Seattle any \nmore, where people can go to and demonstrate and tell about our trade \nexperiences here in the United States. No, they pick a place that no \none ever heard of. You can't find it on the map.\n  The next meeting will be down in the Antarctic. I have been down \nthere. It is hard to get there. That is where they will have the next \ntrade negotiation, where nobody can be heard. And they will get the \nfix, and then they will come back and do exactly what is happening on \nthis bill.\n  There is a fix. In this particular case it is not golf games and not \nC-17s, it is not cultural centers like it was on NAFTA, but it is \nwelfare. It does not employ anybody. It says: Well, we give you a \nlittle welfare to keep your mouth shut, so you can go back home and run \nfor reelection. It is not about trade, not about jobs.\n  We have the job of creating jobs. They are exporting them faster than \nwe can possibly manage it. And now they are not only exporting their \nmanufacturing, they are exporting the executive office to Bermuda.\n  So here, in a time of war, when you should hear the word \n``sacrifice,'' they put the President on TV, who says: Don't worry. \nTake a trip. Go to Disney World. Take your family. And what we ought to \ndo is cut some more taxes to run the debt up.\n  You are going to hear about that because by this time next month we \nwill be in desperate circumstances. We have to increase the debt limit, \nbut they will not say they will increase the debt limit. They will try \nto say it is the war, as to why we need to borrow money. Oh, no, it is \nnot the war. It is the trillions of dollars they have lost. And now \nthey want to lose another $4 trillion.\n\n  Larry Lindsey--he doesn't like me referring to him--but he is the one \nwho opposed what we had going with President Clinton and Secretary \nSummers to stop all of these offshore locations from avoiding taxes. \nThey even had a bill, reported out of the committee over on the House \nside, that did that.\n  You would think, by gosh, we would be raising taxes to pay for the \nwar, certainly not escaping our civic duty in a time of war. But that \nis the hands that we are dealt. The wonderful Business Roundtable, the \nConference Board, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce--oh, they will all tell you what is good for \nthe country. What they are saying is wrecking the economy. They don't \nwant to pay for anything. All they want to do is just help everybody \nbuy the different elections.\n  I see my time is up. I hope that at 2:15, when they move to table, \nMadam President, that the people will sober up and come to the floor \nand give us a chance on that vote to table the Grassley amendment so we \ncan do our job. We don't say one way or the other; we just say, give us \nan up-or-down vote to consider the security, consider the antidumping \nprovisions, as the Dayton-Craig amendment calls for.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4308-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have had \na good debate. The debate was very constructive all morning. It is time \nto test the strength of the second-degree amendment and find out what \nwe are going to do.\n  As we proceed through this trade legislation, we should have more \ndebates such as we had this morning. We should vote as soon as we have \nhad debate. Of course, a motion to table can be offered at any time. It \nis high time we did this on this amendment.\n  I was talking to some Democratic Senators this morning. Between the \ntwo Senators they have six or seven amendments. So there is a lot that \nneeds to be done on this legislation. If someone does not have an \nopportunity to speak on one amendment, they can certainly do it on the \nother.\n  I hope we can continue to move this legislation. I know Senator \nDayton and Senator Craig have waited for days on offering their \namendment.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, I appreciate very much his \npatience in waiting to get to a point to test the strength of what is \nhappening.\n  I have been told that the Dayton-Craig amendment has at least 60 \nvotes in favor of it. I certainly think we should find out if that is \nthe case. There have been some who have been trying to prevent Senators \nDayton and Craig from having a vote on their amendment. I suggest that \nis not the way we should do things. Something this complex and this \nimportant we should move as quickly as possible.\n  I therefore move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to discuss U.S. trade \nremedy laws--antidumping, anti-subsidy, and safeguard laws.\n  Senators Dayton and Craig have offered an amendment on this important \nissue. I want to say a few words about our trade laws. While much of \nthis year's debate over fast track has centered around labor and \nenvironment, there has been less talk about the equally important issue \nof U.S. trade laws--specifically, how we will ensure that these laws \nare not weakened in future trade negotiations. This is not an academic \nissue. In Doha last November, our trade negotiators put U.S. trade laws \non the negotiating table. I believe that was a mistake. And I want to \nmake it clear now: This Senate and this Congress will not tolerate \nweakening changes to our trade laws.\n  It is a grave mistake to suggest that the United States must weaken \nits trade laws to be a participant in future trade negotiations. There \nis virtually no political support for such a position. The last tabling \nmotion showed that. There were 61 Senators who voted not to table the \nunderlying amendment. This point was made clear in the letter sent to \nthe President last year by nearly two-thirds of the Senate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 7, 2001.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to state our strong \n     opposition to any international trade agreement that would \n     weaken U.S. trade laws.\n       Key U.S. trade laws, including antidumping law, \n     countervailing duty law, Section 201, and Section 301, are a \n     critical element of U.S. trade policy. A wide range of \n     agricultural and industrial sectors has successfully employed \n     these statutes to address trade problems. Unfortunately, \n     experience suggests that many other industries are likely to \n     have occasion to rely upon them in future years.\n       Each of these laws is fully consistent with U.S. \n     obligations under the World Trade Organization (WTO) and \n     other trade agreements. Moreover, these laws actually promote \n     free trade by countering practices that both distort trade \n     and are condemned by international trading rules.\n       U.S. trade laws provide American workers and industries the \n     guarantee that, if the United States pursues trade \n     liberalization, it will also protect them against unfair \n     foreign trade practices and allow time for them to address \n     serious import surges. They are part of a political bargain \n     struck with Congress and the American people under which the \n     United States has pursued market opening trade agreements in \n     the past.\n       Congress has made clear its position on this matter. In \n     draft fast track legislation considered in 1997, both Houses \n     of Congress have included strong provisions directing trade \n     negotiators not to weaken U.S. trade laws. Congress has \n     restated this position in resolutions, letters, and through \n     other means.\n       Unfortunately, some of our trading partners, many of whom \n     maintain serious unfair trade practices, continue to seek to \n     weaken these laws. This may simply be posturing by those who \n     oppose further market opening, but--whatever the motive--the \n     United States should no longer use its trade laws as \n     bargaining chips in trade negotiations nor\n\n[[Page S4310]]\n\n     agree to any provision that weaken or undermine U.S. trade \n     laws.\n       We look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n         Baucus, DeWine, Specter, Rockefeller, Kerry, Byrd, \n           Hollings, Conrad, Voinovich, Snowe, Bingaman, Collins, \n           Santorum, Graham, Thomas, Durbin, Torricelli, Enzi, \n           Murray, Dorgan, Akaka, Inouye, Landrieu, Boxer, Breaux, \n           Craig, Helms, Edwards, Sarbanes, Lincoln, Johnson, \n           Dayton, Mikulski, Lott, Daschle, Bayh, Dodd, Wellstone, \n           McConnell, Sessions, Kennedy, Clinton, Thurmond, \n           Schumer, Bunning, Carnahan, Cleland, Wyden, Levin, \n           Crapo, Feinstein, Cantwell, Burns, Stabenow, Carper, \n           Miller, Smith of New Hampshire, Smith of Oregon, Reid, \n           Harkin, Shelby, Lieberman.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Our trading partners should also understand this point. \nThere are many countries that want to weaken U.S. trade laws. Why? \nBecause they want to be able, if you will, to dump subsidized \nproducts--ship products that violate the basic principles of WTO--\nwithin the United States.\n  It is very difficult for us to protect ourselves if we don't have our \nantidumping and countervailing duty and section 201 trade laws.\n  I must say almost every country in the world, and certainly many in \nSouth America, are eager to negotiate free trade agreements with the \nUnited States. There are many South American countries that want to do \nso. Unfortunately, a thorn in our side and a thorn in the side of the \ncountries in our joint effort to try to reach agreement on FTAA, for \nexample, I say very respectfully, is the country of Brazil.\n  I think it is important to step back and ask why countries such as \nBrazil want us to weaken our trade laws. The answer, of course is \npretty simple: their companies and their workers will benefit--at the \nexpense of ours.\n  In the last couple of years, there has been considerable debate \nregarding the use of trade laws in the context of the steel import \ncrisis. Last year, the administration and the Senate Finance Committee \nworked together to initiate a ``section 201'' investigation, which \nallows relief where an industry has been seriously injured by imports. \nThe case of steel is well known--international overcapacity and unfair \ntrade practices have been the norm for decades. But unfair trade \npractices are not limited to the steel industry. Foreign governments \nhave sought to undercut other strategic U.S. industries--including \nsemiconductors, consumer electronics, and supercomputers.\n  That last point is important--so I want to emphasize it again. \nForeign governments have sought to harm American companies and workers. \nOpponents of dumping laws often suggest that if a foreign company wants \nto sell us a product cheaply we, should take advantage of that. After \nall isn't that what, competition is all about? But that view is far too \nsimplistic. Companies can succeed in dumping over an extended period of \ntime only if supported by government policies--trade barriers, \nsubsidies, lax enforcement of their own antitrust laws.\n  Profits gained in protected foreign markets allow foreign companies \nto splash prices in the United States in order to gain market share. \nIndeed, efficient American mills must compete with foreign mills that \nproduce steel regardless of need. Foreign steel mills often act as \nlittle more than subsidized work programs.\n  I might digress slightly. The same is true with subsidized lumber in \nCanada. They are tantamount to subsidized work programs and subsidized \ntimber production in the lumber industry to such a great degree.\n  In 1999, for example, foreign overcapacity was more than two times as \ngreat as the total annual steel consumption in the United States.\n  With other export markets largely closed, there is an overwhelming \nincentive to send underpriced steel to the open U.S. market. Let me \nrepeat that point. Other countries tend to close their markets to \ncompanies and countries that dump steel or subsidize steel production. \nSo what happens? That steel tends to be diverted to the United States \nbecause we, by comparison, have such an open market compared with other \ncountries that otherwise import steel.\n  So without fair trade laws, investment dollars would simply not flow \nto American companies. For example, why would anybody invest in a U.S. \ncompany, even a highly efficient one, that could so easily be undercut \nby unfair foreign competition?\n  So it is not only a matter of workers, employees getting jobs in the \nUnited States, but it is also foreign investment and domestic \ninvestment in American companies in the United States.\n  A smart investor would invest in a company where its government \nprotected its market share.\n  Still, the point is argued, why not just allow consumers to take \nadvantage of cheap products? It certainly is true there may be a short-\nterm advantage for consumers and consuming industries. But over the \nlong term, we risk gutting our manufacturing base and gutting the \ntechnological edge of American companies.\n  Just think about it a second. If other countries dump, how can we \ninvest in the United States to gain and maintain a technological edge?\n  For any consuming industry complaining about the use of our trade \nlaws in the steel industry, just ask yourself what their reaction would \nbe to foreign governments targeting their industry.\n  But beyond economic rationale, we risk losing the political support \nfor trade. Trade laws are part of the political bargain. If free trade \nis not perceived as fair, Americans will not support it. Why would \nAmericans support free trade if the perception is that it exposes them \nto foreign governments' unfair trade practices?\n  Consider also the consequences if we do not have effective trade \nlaws. Trade laws ensure uniform treatment. In bad economic times, there \nwill always be calls to take action against imports. Without consistent \nand transparent trade laws, those calls will come for general trade \nbarriers against imports. The internationally negotiated trade laws we \ncurrently follow seek to provide an objective set of criteria. I might \nadd, our trade laws are totally WTO consistent, a point some critics \nforget to mention.\n  Some have also asked whether we really need to worry about our laws \nbeing weakened in international negotiations. Recent history \ndemonstrates why we should be concerned.\n  I might say, NAFTA's dispute resolution procedures under chapter 19 \nhave significantly undermined our enforcement of U.S. trade laws. Both \nthe GATT Tokyo Round and the Uruguay Round weakened our antidumping and \nsafeguard rules; that is, it happens, it is not just theory. It is \nhappening. And our laws continue to be attacked and weakened by dispute \npanels exceeding their authority.\n  Some have suggested we use negotiations as an opportunity to address \ndue process and transparency concerns in the application of other \ncountries' trade laws. But remember that fast track is only used to \nchange U.S. laws. If we are only looking at the laws of foreign \ngovernments, we can resolve those differences outside of the U.S. \nimplementing legislation.\n\n  As for difficulties encountered by U.S. exporters facing foreign \ncountries' trade remedy actions, those are problems of compliance with \nthe existing WTO rules, not problems requiring us to revisit the rules \nthemselves.\n  Let me now turn to the Senate bill. I want to make sure my colleagues \nappreciate the strong provisions protecting U.S. trade laws.\n  First, as was the case in the House legislation, our bill provides \nthat the President must not undercut U.S. trade laws and should also \nseek to put an end to the foreign practices that make trade laws \nnecessary in the first place. Section 2102(c)(9) of the bill states, \nfirst, that the President shall:\n\n       (A) preserve the ability of the United States to enforce \n     rigorously its trade laws, including the antidumping, \n     countervailing duty, and safeguard laws, and avoid agreements \n     that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and international \n     disciplines on unfair trade, especially dumping and \n     subsidies, or that lessen the effectiveness of domestic and \n     international safeguard provisions. . . .\n\n  Pretty strong stuff.\n  Second, the bill states the President shall--I underline the word \n``shall'':\n\n       (B) address and remedy market distortions that lead to \n     dumping and subsidization including overcapacity, \n     cartelization, and market access barriers.\n\n  In addition, the Senate bill makes important additions to the House \nbill.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary of Commerce must form a \nstrategy to\n\n[[Page S4311]]\n\nseek improved adherence to WTO dispute settlement panels to the \nstandards of review contained in the WTO agreements or lose fast-track \nprocedures.\n  In findings, the legislation identifies particular concerns regarding \nrecent WTO decisions affecting U.S. trade laws.\n  The Senate bill also requires that the chairmen and the ranking \nmembers of the Finance and Ways and Means Committees to separately \ndetermine whether any changes to U.S. trade laws are consistent with \nthe negotiated objective of not weakening U.S. trade laws.\n  Another protection: The President must notify the Finance and Ways \nand Means Committees of any proposed changes to U.S. trade laws; and, \nfollowing a report by the chairmen and ranking members, the President \nmust separately explain how proposed changes are consistent with the \nnegotiating objectives established in the fast-track legislation.\n  When it comes to protecting U.S. trade laws, I believe the Senate \nbill is a strong bill. But let me end by emphasizing the importance of \nthese laws.\n  Why do our trade agreements basically work? They work only because \nthere is respect for the agreements themselves, and for the enforcement \nof those agreements. But how long will Americans support new \nnegotiations or existing agreements if they see foreign governments \ntaking advantage of us?\n  I believe the language in this fast-track bill makes it very clear \nthat Congress will not tolerate weakening changes to U.S. trade laws. \nAnd I--and the great majority of my colleagues--will continue to pursue \nthis issue as we move forward in future trade negotiations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to talk about trade promotion \nauthority. I want to talk a little bit about the history of how we came \nto be here. I want to talk about why this issue is so critically \nimportant. I want to talk about the Craig amendment. And I want to talk \nabout how we are reaching a point where we are beginning to endanger \ntrade promotion authority altogether.\n  This is a lot to talk about, and I know there are a lot of other \npeople who want to speak, so let me begin. And let me start at a \nlogical point: 1934.\n  Imagine that it is 1934 in America. One out of every three Americans \nis out of work. The gross domestic product of the country has declined \nby almost a third. We have adopted a series of protective tariffs \nincluding the onerous Smoot-Hawley tariffs initiated by Republicans and \nsupported by Democrats. And in the process, we not only have a \ndepression in our own country, but we, by starting a trade war \nworldwide, have turned the global recession of 1929 and 1930 into a \nglobal depression.\n  And in that humbling moment of 1934, where everything we did related \nto trade and the economy was wrong, there was a rare bipartisan \nconsensus. It occurred because the country was in so much trouble, and \nbecause there was a recognition that we had created our own problem. At \nthat moment in 1934, Republicans and Democrats got together and passed \nwhat was called the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act. That Act allowed \nthe President to negotiate 29 trade agreements between 1934 and 1945. \nWe literally were the leader in starting up world trade again.\n  As world trade was reignited, as our economy started to grow, and as \nwe fought and won World War II, the bipartisan consensus on trade grew. \nWe saw that trade is a good thing that promotes jobs, growth, \nopportunity, prosperity, and freedom. The bipartisan consensus expanded \nto the point where in 1948 we adopted the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade, known as GATT, and initiated a worldwide effort to try to \nopen up global trade.\n  Subsequently, from 1947 to 1963, we completed five successful \nnegotiating rounds under GATT. But then, in 1962, something happened \nthat is highly relevant to the debate we are having today over the \nDayton amendment. By 1962, the principal impediment to trade in the \nworld was not protective tariffs. Instead, the key impediment was non-\ntariff measures anti-trade laws adopted by countries that limited the \nability of trade to flow freely. For example, countries began to adopt \nlaws allowing producers within a country to get special protection if \nthey were harmed by trade, and allowing countries to subsidize their \nexports if they felt they were losing out in trade.\n  By 1962, therefore, President Kennedy recognized it was no longer \nenough to negotiate tariff reductions. We needed to negotiate away all \nthe barriers that we and other countries had put up that consisted not \nof tariffs, but of non-tariff trade protections. Therefore, the Kennedy \nRound focused on issues such as countries' use of export subsidies, and \nof anti-dumping laws. When the Kennedy Round of negotiations was \ncompleted, it addressed not only tariffs, but sought to establish some \nworldwide rules related to countries' use of anti-trade laws.\n  But at that point, when presented with the Kennedy Round by the \nJohnson Administration, Congress approved legislation undoing the \nprovisions of the Kennedy Round Agreement that related to anti-trade \nitems such as export subsidies--the very provisions we are debating \ntoday in the Dayton amendment. Congress effectively amended the deal. \nThe Kennedy Round of negotiations was agreed to by other GATT members \nand became the new foundation for world trade. But because Congress \nbasically changed the deal, the United States did not participate in or \nget the full benefits of the Kennedy Round. We had negotiated this \nentire set of agreements with our trading partners. But when we changed \none critical ingredient, our trading partners said: We are not willing \nto negotiate with the United States and then let Congress strike the \nparts in which the United States made concessions and yet leave the \nparts where we, the United States' trading partners, made our \nconcessions.\n  When the Kennedy Round went ahead without the United States in 1967, \nso shocked was Congress that in 1974 we created a new process that \ntoday is known as fast track. And every succeeding President since \nPresident Ford has had fast-track trade authority. That trade authority \nhas allowed the President to go out and negotiate agreements with our \ntrading partners. In those agreements we give up some things we don't \nwant to give up, and our partners give up some things they don't want \nto give up, but the United States and the group of countries involved \ndecide that overall, the trade agreement is in their interest. And that \nwas the procedure that we had in place until 1994, when the fast-track \nprovisions expired.\n  Since then, we have found that few countries in the world are willing \nto negotiate with us, because any trade agreement negotiated could be \namended in Congress. Obviously, countries are not willing to make \nconcessions that bind them when our concessions would not bind us \nshould Congress decide to change them.\n  As a result, there are some 130 trade agreements worldwide that we in \nthe United States are not part of. For example, Europe has negotiated \nan expanded trade agreement with South American nations. We have no \nsimilar agreement. Mexico has negotiated and successfully completed \nfree trade agreements with Central and South American nations. We have \nno such agreements. Canada has negotiated free trade agreements with \nSouth American nations. We have been unable to have such agreements. \nSo today, appliances that could be produced cheaper and better in the \nUnited States are being sold in Chile today by Canadian manufacturers \nbecause their manufacturers have an advantage over ours: they have a \nfree trade agreement that means lower tariffs. Chilean consumers could \nbuy better American appliances cheaper, but without a trade agreement, \nthey can't buy them without having to pay a tariff. Canada benefits \nfrom that trade, and we do not.\n\n  We have come here today to try to set this situation straight. We \nhave come here today to try to give the President the authority to \npromote American exports and to engage in trade liberalization around \nthe world.\n  Without getting into a long harangue about it, let me say that \nRepublicans have been asked to pay a tremendous level of tribute to get \nto this point. The President asked the Senate for an up-or-down vote on \ntrade promotion authority. That request was denied. Instead, the \nmajority has said that to get\n\n[[Page S4312]]\n\na vote on trade promotion authority, we must add a trade adjustment \nassistance bill to it, and that bill must contain a new provision \nrequiring the government to pay 70 percent of the health care costs of \npeople who lose their jobs because of trade, even though many Americans \nhave no health care benefit when they are working.\n  Moreover, we have been asked to agree--and to this point we \nreluctantly have agreed--that if you are a worker whose company is \naffected by trade and is not competitive, you get not only 2 years of \nunemployment and 70 percent of your health care benefit, but you get \npart of your wages paid for by the government. Let's say you lose your \njob in the steel mill but you have always wanted to be a batboy for the \nPittsburgh Pirates. If you take the lower-paying job as a batboy, we \nwill supplement your wages to make up half the difference of what you \nlost in salary from the steel mill wages as compared to the Pittsburgh \nPirates bat boy wages. Meanwhile, if you lose your job because a \nterrorist destroys the factory you work in, you get 6 months \nunemployment and you get no health care.\n  It is fair to say that there are 45 Republican Members of the Senate \nwho are adamantly opposed--adamantly opposed--to those provisions. We \nhave created two new entitlements that are unfunded and that nobody \nknows what they cost. We are creating the incredible anomaly where we \nwill be taxing people who are working and who don't have health \ninsurance in order to subsidize 70 percent of the health care costs of \ncertain people who are unemployed but had health insurance when they \nworked. They now will be getting a taxpayer subsidy, even though the \npeople paying the subsidy don't have health care themselves. And we are \nbeing asked to sign on to a system where the American Government for \nthe first time is going to get into wage guarantees. There is no sense \nbeating this old dead horse, but let me say that these are the same \nkinds of deals that Europe is desperately trying to get out of. They \ncan't create jobs because they can't cut old jobs because they have to \npay all these benefits. Yet in this tribute we are having to pay to get \nthe trade bill, we are going in the direction that the Europeans are \nactively trying to get out of. We are going in the direction of \nimposing heavy socialistic programs that are going to have a stifling \neffect on the budget.\n\n  And now, in the midst of a bill that already has all these provisions \nthat 45 Republicans hate, that will drive up the deficit, that will \nmake the economy less competitive, and that create a terrible injustice \nin the system, we now are presented with an amendment before us that \nwill literally undo fast-track authority by allowing Congress to change \nthe deal.\n  Can you imagine if in buying and selling a house, or any other \ncommonplace negotiation, you suddenly are told you must pay more than \nyou negotiated to pay? Can you imagine how commerce would break down \nwhen deals can be renegotiated after the negotiations are done?\n  The whole purpose of paying this heavy tribute, and adopting all this \nterrible, harmful public policy is to get the positive effect of fast \ntrack whereby there is an up-or-down vote on accepting the negotiated \ndeal. But now in comes the Dayton-Craig amendment that says to the \nPresident, OK, you can negotiate, you can give, you can take, but when \nthe trade bill comes back, if you have negotiated in areas where \nCongress has written laws to hinder trade, then we get to vote on those \nprovisions separately. And if you cannot get 51 votes, then those \nprovisions are taken out.\n  What country in the world is going to be foolish enough to negotiate \nwith us when they know there is going to be a separate vote on the \nparts of the agreement that we in the United States like the least? We \nwould never negotiate with another country under circumstances where \ntheir legislative body could take out the parts of the negotiation they \ndid not like but leave in the parts we did not like.\n  This amendment kills trade promotion authority because it is counter \nto the very thesis that underlies it. What is trade promotion authority \nabout if it is not about an up-or-down vote on a trade agreement, \nwithout amendment? How can a provision which allows part of an \nagreement--the part that is likely to be least popular in the United \nStates--to be voted on separately? How can anybody be confused that \nthis amendment absolutely kills trade promotion authority?\n  As the Dayton-Craig amendment has been debated, people have gotten \nthe idea that this amendment has to do only with unfair trade \npractices. But most of this amendment has nothing whatsoever to do with \nunfair trade practices. And even where it does, it is obvious on its \nface that if we could negotiate agreements to fix those practices both \nhere and in our trading partners' countries, we would want to do it.\n  Let me now go through the provisions of law that would be affected by \nthe Dayton-Craig amendment.\n  First, the Dayton-Craig amendment says that Congress would have the \nright to strike, by majority vote, any provision that would limit \nactions against foreign subsidies such as income or price supports. The \nfirst law the amendment talks about title VII of the Tariff Act of \n1930, which includes our countervailing duty law. What is that law \nabout? That law is about American taxpayers subsidizing American \nproducers to compensate for the subsidies that foreign governments are \ngiving to their manufacturers and their agricultural producers.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, when we cannot sell our agricultural products in \nEurope because of their subsidies, when we have spent 25 years trying \nto get them to reduce those subsidies, why in the world would we want \nto set forth a rule saying that American negotiators can negotiate \nanything except agricultural subsidies. Why in the world would we ever \nwant to ban negotiations in which the Europeans agree to cut their \nsubsidies and we agree to cut ours? Yet by taking subsidy disciplines \noff the table, that effectively is what we'd be doing.\n  What this amendment really would like to do is allow negotiations \nreducing European and American agricultural subsidies to go forward, \nbut once that agreement gets over here, allow Congress to strike the \nprovisions reducing American agricultural subsidies. Why in the world \nwould the Europeans ever enter into such an agreement? They would never \nenter into such an agreement.\n  When 60 cents out of every dollar of farm income in America now is \ncoming directly from the Government, when we are paying farmers \nliterally millions of dollars to produce products that we end up having \nto dump on the world market, and when we claim we do this because our \nforeign competitors are doing the same thing, why in the world should \nwe prevent the President from getting together the major agriculture-\nproducing countries and saying let's stop cheating, let's get rid of \nthese income and price support subsidy programs so we can have freer \ntrade in agriculture?\n  My point is that this amendment would ban for all practical purposes \nall agreements that have to do with export subsidies. It would ban any \nagreement that has to do with eliminating the unfair trade practice of \nsubsidies by us or by our competitors. I want my colleagues to \nunderstand that when the proponents of this amendment stand up and say \nthey simply do not want agreements that undermine our laws protecting \nAmericans and American producers, what they are really talking about is \nour ability to negotiate away harmful subsidies. Why in the world \nshould we not be negotiating with the Europeans, the Koreans, or the \nJapanese to suggest that we all reduce the amount of subsidies that we \nare paying to dump steel on the world market? Why don't we all agree to \nreduce the subsidies that are resulting in overproduction of \nagricultural products?\n  The net result of this provision will not be to protect American \nmanufacturers and farmers from losing their subsidies. The result of \nthis amendment, if adopted, will be that there will never be another \ntrade agreement that has anything to do with reducing export subsidies. \nAnd of all the nations on Earth, we would be the biggest beneficiary of \nsuch an agreement. What country in the world can outproduce Iowa in \nagriculture? We could sell billions of dollars of agricultural products \nin Europe if we could negotiate an end to export subsidies. Why should \nwe prohibit the President from negotiating them? We ought to be \nencouraging him to negotiate them. But this amendment, despite all the \nrhetoric about\n\n[[Page S4313]]\n\neliminating our ability to protect our producers from unfair trade, \nprotects us right out of being able to eliminate unfair trade.\n  The second provision of the Dayton-Craig amendment refers to our \nanti-dumping laws. Now, on its surface, the amendment sounds good. The \nPresident would not be able to negotiate anything that would prevent \nAmerica from protecting its producers from dumping. In other words, we \nwill not be dumped upon. But what does dumping mean?\n  First of all, dumping means all these low-price quality items \nAmericans can buy for their families at department stores. But forget \nfor a moment that American families enjoy a better quality of life from \nlow-price imports. Why shouldn't we negotiate an agreement that says \nwhy should we subsidize products to dump on your market and why should \nyou subsidize products to dump on our market when we could get together \nand negotiate an armistice where we both stop dumping?\n  When one listens to the rhetoric of supporters of the Dayton-Craig \namendment, gosh, it sounds appealing. They say, do not eliminate our \nprotections against dumping. But when we protect our right to dump and \nour right to protect ourselves against dumping, we effectively \neliminate our ability to negotiate for a world where we stop dumping by \neverybody. That just does not make sense to me.\n  Third, another law covered by the Dayton-Craig amendment is Section \n337, which relates to U.S. patents and copyrights. From listening to \nthe rhetoric, you might think the amendment says that anything the \nPresident might do that weakens American patents and copyrights will \nrequire a separate vote.\n  But who owns all the patents and copyrights in the world? What nation \nin the world has tried to write language protecting patents and \ncopyrights into every trade agreement since 1948? The United States of \nAmerica. We are the only country in the world that wants to talk about \ncopyrights and patents. Why? Because we own copyrights, and we own \npatents. Why in the world would we want to bar the President from \nholding negotiations in the very areas where the United States will \nbenefit the most? If we, who hold the vast majority of the copyrights \nand patents in the world, could negotiate an international agreement on \nrespecting copyrights and patents, would we not be the principal \nbeneficiary of it?\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield, but let me finish this one \npoint.\n  How can we get other countries to submit to negotiate on their patent \nand copyright laws if we say that we want you to change your laws but \nwe are totally unwilling or unable to negotiate on our laws?\n  I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator raises an excellent point. There are \nnegotiations that occur that are in the best interest of the United \nStates. Of course, we want to encourage those negotiations to proceed. \nIs the Senator aware there is nothing in the Dayton-Craig amendment \nthat would require the Senate to step in on these matters? It simply \npermits the Senate, by a majority of the Members, to do so if, in the \nview of the majority of the Members, what has been negotiated is not in \nthe best interest of the United States.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me respond. The Senator asks whether I am aware that \nthe Senate could decide not to strip out this provision. Yes, I am \naware of that point. But every country with whom we wanted to negotiate \nwould realize that Congress nonetheless had the ability to strip \nprovisions out. And what country would negotiate changes to its patent \nand copyright laws knowing that whatever change to we agreed to could \nbe stripped out?\n  Let me use a contracts example. I have only a limited number of \ncontracts examples because I am an old schoolteacher and have been a \npolitician for a long time, and most of the examples I have are \nconsumer examples. But what if we had negotiated a contract that I \nwould buy your house, but we wrote into the contract that I had the \nability to change one part of the contract to suit me but that you did \nnot have a right to change a part of the contract to suit you? No party \nto a contract would agree to that.\n\n  I am not talking about changing copyrights and patents unilaterally. \nI am talking about reciprocal commitments. Congress has passed \nresolutions again and again demanding that trade agreements require our \ntrading partners to change their copyright and patent laws. It has been \nsomething we have trumpeted, it is in our interest, and we should be \npromoting it everywhere. But how are we going to get countries to \nchange their laws when any changes we agree to can be voted on \nseparately? As much as I might want your house, and even if I offer a \nvery good price, if I can come back after the contract is signed and \nchange the price, you are not going to negotiate with me.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I agree with the Senator that certainly under the terms \nthe Senator describes, my understanding of the way this would work, if \nthere were an agreement and the United States, by an act of this body, \nchanged the terms of that agreement, the agreement would not be valid; \nthe agreement would not apply.\n  I certainly agree with the Senator there would be no country that \nwould want to sign and agree to something that can be changed \nunilaterally and still apply. My understanding is the entire agreement \nwould have to go back to the World Trade Organization, or wherever, to \nbe renegotiated.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me make up an example. Let's say we are negotiating \nwith the Chinese on a trade agreement, and one of the provisions we \nwant is for them to recognize and respect our patents and copyrights on \neverything from books to CDs to DVDs. If you go to China, you will see \nthat while you cannot bring them back with you because our Customs will \nnot let you, and for good reason, everywhere in China you can buy \npirated CDs, DVDs, books, and the like. Let's say we could work out an \nagreement with them that required enforcement against patent \ninfringement in return for our reducing a patent term on an AIDS \nmedicine or on some broad spectrum antibiotic that is important to \ntheir population's general health. Even if we had to compensate the \nUnited States patent holder because of the takings provision, there \nmight very well be a good deal in the making there. Yet, we could not \nmake that deal if a separate vote were allowed.\n  My example may be somewhat unrealistic, and I am sure if Ambassador \nZoellick were here he would have 100 good examples, but I think it \nmakes the point.\n  Let me go to the next provision of law that would be covered by the \nDayton-Craig amendment. The third area has to do with section 201. The \nproponents of this amendment say over and over that we cannot negotiate \naway our protections against unfair trade. Yet Section 201 has nothing \nto do with unfair trade. It makes no pretense at unfair trade. Section \n201 simply is a remedy whereby American producers can get relief if \nforeign competition is successful and if the injured American producers \ncan show they are losing jobs because of imports.\n  It has nothing to do with unfair trade. In a sense, it has to do with \nsuccessful trade. Granted, we are concerned about Americans losing \ntheir jobs, and we have assistance programs to give them some cushion. \nBut is there anybody here who cannot imagine that we might be willing \nto eliminate those protective barriers in return for the elimination of \nsimilar barriers in Europe, Japan, Korea, or China? Or that we might \nfind a better way to compensate and protect injured companies, perhaps \nthrough trade adjustment assistance?\n  This whole debate, the whole title of the amendment, the whole \npreamble to the amendment, is about unfair trade. Yet probably the most \nimportant laws covered by this amendment has nothing to do with unfair \ntrade.\n  Am I in favor of unilaterally waiving every 201 right in America? The \nanswer is ``No.'' But my point is that if we could eliminate similar \nbarriers against American exports, can no one imagine the possibility \nthere might be an agreement that would be advantageous to everybody? \nYet no such agreement could ever be consummated under the Dayton-Craig \namendment because nobody would negotiate the elimination of their \nprotective safeguard against American exports unless\n\n[[Page S4314]]\n\nwe eliminate or modify our Section 201 provision. Negotiation in this \narea would be a nonstarter.\n  As I said when I started my remarks, our need for fast track arose in \nthe Kennedy Round, when President Kennedy recognized that the greatest \nimpediment to trade was no longer tariffs but domestic laws that \nlimited trade. It was when he tried to change those laws that Congress \ncame in and changed the deal. The Kennedy Round went into effect \nwithout our being a party to it, all because of the issues that are \nraised by the amendment before the Senate. The Round died for exactly \nthe issue that are listed here in the Dayton-Craig amendment. The \nrecognition that you cannot change a negotiated deal after the fact is \nwhat led to enactment of fast track. Senator Baucus and I were involved \nin negotiations the other day. There are a lot of things in that final \ndeal I really do not like. But I do not have the right to go back after \nthe fact and say Senator Baucus gave up on items A, B, C, D, and E, \nwhich is great, but I want to renegotiate and change our deal. I do not \nhave a right to do that. A deal is a deal. That is the very issue the \nSenate is dealing with here.\n  The next provisions of law covered by the Dayton-Craig amendment are \nchapters 2, 3, and 5 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974. This is the \nfourth so-called unfair trade protection provision. Yet as one reads \nthose chapters, they have nothing to do with unfair trade. They simply \nhave to do with the assistance provided to companies and workers \nnegatively affected by imports or by a company's shift in production. \nSome may not favor shifts in production, but when did it turn into an \nunfair trade practice? Every day, Americans are moving investments from \none country to another. We are the world's largest investor. In fact \none of the things we are trying to do in the underlying bill is to get \nother countries to allow investment in America and allow greater \nfreedom for American investments in their country.\n  Even if a shift in production were an unfair trade practice, how \ncould we say to countries that we want to negotiate away prohibitions \nyou have against producing in the United States, but we aren't willing \nto do the same? Remember when we had the big battle with Japan over \nautos? We wanted them to produce some of their automobiles in America, \nand we negotiated over it, and in fact they did increase production \nhere. But why would they ever negotiate if we have said in advance that \nwe are not willing to eliminate prohibitions against plant relocation \nin our own country? Why should the Japanese allow companies to move out \nof Japan or set up programs that impede the process if we are not \nwilling to do it?\n  I could go on at length about the other laws covered by this \namendment. The amendment is written very broadly. It may list 5 bills \nin particular, but it is written so broadly that in my opinion it \ncovers at least 18 other laws that are part of current trade law: for \nexample, section 1317 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitive Act of 1988; \nthe Antidumping Act of 1916; the Continued Dumping and Subsidy Offset \nAct of 2000; section 516A of the Tariff Act of 1930; section 129 of the \nUruguay Round Agreements Act; and the list goes on. The plain truth is, \ngiven the way it is written, not even the authors of this amendment \ntruly know what it does.\n\n  I will conclude by making some final points. I understand the need \nfor consensus. We do not get to write these bills by ourselves. It \nrequires give and take. My belief, and the belief of the vast majority \nof members of the Republican Conference in the Senate, is that we have \ngiven. We gave on health benefits that are not paid for, that we think \nrepresent bad public policy, that take away from poor working people to \ngive to relatively high income, nonworking people. We gave on 2 years \nof wage guarantee benefits for people affected by trade. Meanwhile, \nsomebody who lost their job because of a terrorist attack gets 6 months \nof unemployment, no health benefits, and no wage insurance benefits. We \nare getting to the point where we have already paid for the trade bill, \nand if this amendment passes on top of those payments, we will not be \ngetting a bill at all.\n  The principal ingredient of trade promotion authority--in fact the \nheart of it, in its purest form--is very simply the right of the \nPresident, within the parameters we set out in law, to go out and \nnegotiate a trade agreement and bring it back and subject it to a yes-\nor-no vote in Congress. We do not have the right to amend a trade \nagreement; we simply have to take the whole thing or reject the whole \nthing. That is what trade promotion authority, or fast track, is. Yet \nthe pending amendment says the President does not get an up-or-down \nvote because in some 23 different areas of law, many of which have \nabsolutely nothing to do with unfair trade, we can have a separate vote \nand if a majority votes to make a change, then the trade agreement is \nmodified. Under those circumstances, nobody will negotiate with us and \nthe President effectively does not have fast-track authority.\n  So what we have is a bill that claims to be about fast-track \nauthority, which is a single take-it-or-leave-it vote on a deal. And \nyet we have an amendment before us that eliminates that provision and \nrequires a separate vote on things in the agreement that we do not \nlike.\n  I do not see how the two can be reconciled. It seems to me that when \nyou are voting for this amendment, you are voting against trade \npromotion authority. I do not think you can have it both ways. You \ncannot say on the one hand that we will give the President the right to \nget his agreements voted on up or down, take it or leave it, yes or no; \nand then on the other hand say we can adopt an amendment that says but \nof course on some 23 different provisions of law we don't have to take \nit or leave it, we can change it.\n  Today, through a letter from the Secretary of Agriculture, the \nSecretary of Commerce, and the Trade Representative, the President \nrightfully has indicated that he will veto the bill if the Dayton-Craig \namendment is included in it.\n  To conclude, we paid a very heavy price to get fast track, and this \namendment takes fast track away. Rather than pay all these new \ntributes--the expanded trade adjustment assistance, these new health \nbenefits that are not paid for, the new entitlements that are not paid \nfor, this wage insurance that smells very much like the programs that \nare killing some European countries that have not created a net new job \nin countries in 20 years--we are quickly reaching the point where even \nthe strongest proponents of free trade have to say this amendment \nbreaks the axle of the wagon. Even the strongest proponents are saying \nthat with all else we paid to get a vote on the trade promotion \nauthority bill, if this amendment is in the bill it means we don't have \ntrade promotion authority, so why pay for all the other things?\n  I urge my colleagues as we try to find a solution to this problem. \nThat solution might be a compromise in which we set up an oversight \ncommittee to allow those concerned about these laws to monitor \nnegotiations, and provide 90 days' notice of any potential trade \nagreement that changed any of these laws. There are many ways we can \nenhance the ability of Members to be involved and get advance notice to \nallow them build political opposition. I hope those who want to pass \nthis bill will find a way to get around this dilemma.\n  We are already at the point that given what we are already paying for \nthis bill, it almost is not worth it. I believe that at this point, \nmany Republican Members of the Senate are holding their nose and \nsaying: OK, we have to do a bunch of bad things, but we will get trade \npromotion authority and maybe some of the bad things will be addressed \nin conference. But over and over bills have gotten worse, not better, \nin conference. If you are for trade promotion authority, if you want \nthe deal we put together to work, I believe we need help in finding a \nway to respond to the concerns raised without providing for a separate \nvote, because a separate vote destroys trade promotion authority.\n  If the two Senators who offered the amendment wanted to be on the \noversight committee for the Senate, I would be willing to write the \nbill to make sure they were put on it. I don't have any objection to \noversight and I am for notice. Then, if people were getting ready to \nvote against a fast-tracked trade agreement, they could tell the \nPresident that if he makes these changes, he is jeopardizing my vote. \nAnd they would have 90 days to build up an alliance to lobby against \nit.\n\n[[Page S4315]]\n\nWhen ``lobbying'' is mentioned people say oh gosh, that's terrible, \nterrible. But making your voice heard is a good thing guaranteed under \nthe Constitution.\n  But what we cannot agree to without killing the underlying bill is \nCongress' ability to change the trade agreement once it has been \nnegotiated. The President must be able to say to our trading partner \nthat a deal is a deal; not that wait, it was a deal, but the part we \nagreed to that we did not like is not a deal because 51 Members of the \nSenate decided to amend it.\n  I accept and am for the process whereby 51 Members of the Senate can \ndefeat the implementing bill for a trade agreement. I have never voted \nagainst an implementing bill, although I can imagine a trade agreement \nthat I would think was so bad that it was not worth it. I believe I \nought to have the right to vote no. And I have that right under fast \ntrack or trade promotion authority. But I do not have the right to \nchange the deal.\n  This amendment would allow Congress to change the deal, which is why \nit is a killer amendment. It is the antithesis to what trade promotion \nauthority is about. You cannot be for trade promotion authority, which \nis a single vote on the deal, and then be for an amendment that allows \nvotes to amend the deal. I don't see why the people who are for this \namendment don't simply vote against the bill, and let those who are for \nit have a chance to vote for it. The Dayton-Craig amendment would gut \nthat process. It would leave the Senate in the unhappy position of \nhaving a fast track bill that includes an amendment that undoes fast \ntrack.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have listened intently to my colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Texas. The reason I do that and I have done \nthat for a good many years, I always learn a great deal. I am always \nextremely cautious to get on the floor and debate in opposition to a \nposition held by my colleague from Texas, with his skill but, most \nimportantly, his knowledge in this area. It is very important. I hope \nall listen.\n  I was taking notes as if I were a student at Texas A and he were \nthe economics professor. In fact, that is what we heard today, a rather \nprofessorial statement about the ideals of trade in an ideal \nenvironment. I disagree not with that statement.\n  I also agree with the historical perspective that he offered from the \n1960s through the 1970s and the Kennedy Round and the circumstances the \nworld found itself in and the need for us to change from being the \nexclusive holder in a constitutional Republic of the right to determine \ninternational commerce flows to one where we delegated that thought by \nlaw to the executive, in a great more detail. That, of course, is what \nwe did with fast track. That was the 1960s and the 1970s.\n  Through that period of the 1970s and the 1980s and the 1990s, the \nworld changed a great deal--really all for our betterment in the broad \nsense. As economies changed and we invested in world economies, there \nis no question that the economic engine of the United States drove the \nworld and took a lot of poor countries and made them more prosperous. \nPart of it was because we allowed access to our markets while at the \nsame time we promoted their markets and invested in their countries. \nAll of that is true, and it will be every bit as true tomorrow and a \ndecade or two from now as it was then. I don't disagree with that.\n  What I am suggesting is in the year 2002, as we once again search for \na way to promote trade, we take a nearly 40-year-old model and say it \nworks, it fits, it is the right thing to do again. Is it the right \nthing for us to--almost in an exclusive way--delegate full authority to \nthe executive branch in an area that is constitutionally ours? I \nbelieve it is. I believe it is with certain conditions that are very \nlimited and very direct. I don't believe they change the dynamics of a \nrelationship and ultimately a negotiation.\n  It is very difficult to blend a parliamentary government's \nnegotiators and what they understand their role is with that of a \nconstitutional Republic. I know; I have been there. I have seen the \nfrustration of the European parliamentarian who cannot understand why \nthe President's men or women cannot speak for the United States and cut \na deal and confirm it and that is the way it will be if the President \nsigns off on it.\n  The reason they can't is because of us and because of a little item \nwe call the Constitution. While we have delegated that authority by \nlaw, we have also said it has to come back here on an up-or-down vote.\n  What Senator Dayton and I do is go a slight step further and say that \nin those areas that are fixed by law, law that we created, you have to \ncome back to us. And not under this sweeping environment and nostalgia \nand euphoria of a trade package that is going to spin the world into \ngreater economies are we going to pick apart an agreement. What we are \nsaying is simply this. We are saying that you, Mr. President, and your \nteam must come back as advocates and sales men and women. As you sell \nthe whole package, you have to sell a few of the parts.\n  I hope, ultimately, when we see a conference report, it has a 90-day \nnotification in it that sets the Congress to task in the sense that it \nnotifies it that they will be making some change in current law and we \nare preparing ourselves, we are looking at it, we are making decisions, \nand the President's men and women are here on the Hill advocating and \nsaying: It is a quid pro quo: For a reduction here, we get this here; \nfor a reduction in our subsidies in agriculture, the Europeans are \ngoing to reduce their subsidies, they are going to take away some of \ntheir hidden barriers, and we are going to have greater access to \nmarkets.\n  I think that would sell here in the Senate. I think it would work. I \nthink you could find 50 plus 1 who would support that.\n  But you have to sell it. We have delegated the authority of \nnegotiation, but we have not delegated the authority and the conditions \nof final passage. That alone is ours under the Constitution. That is \nwhy this is an important debate and, while it may change the character \nfrom the historic perspective of fast track, I do not believe it \nneuters, I do not believe it nullifies, I do not believe it causes our \nnegotiators more encumbrance as they sit down at the table.\n  That is because right upfront the terms are understood. It does not \ndeny them the right to negotiate anything. Everything is on the table. \nWhat it does say to the executive branch of Government is: Come home \nand sell your product. Come home and convince Congress you have done \nthe right thing and here are all the tradeoffs and the alternatives. \nBecause on the whole Congress agrees with the Senator from Texas: Trade \nfor the whole of our economy and for job creation is very important.\n  Earlier in the day when I was debating the initial Dayton-Craig \namendment as offered, I talked about Idaho's economy. We have to have \ntrade. I know we have to have trade. I am going to work to get trade. \nBut I want to tell the Senator from Texas that a good number of years \nago a young man from Texas came to Idaho. He had been from Idaho \noriginally but was working in Texas at a company called Texas \nInstruments, a little old high-tech company that became a big old \npowerful, important, and valuable high-tech company. He came home to \nIdaho, and he convinced a group of investors to go with him and his \nbrother because they had a better idea about how to build memory chips.\n  They got a group of investors together, and they built a fab, and \nthey started producing memory chips--late 1980s, early 1990s. They were \ndoing a great job building a DRAM memory chip, selling it to the world, \nand then all of a sudden came the Japanese aggressively into the \nmarket, deciding they wanted the market, they were going to control the \nmarket. They had built great fab--or fabrication capacity--and they \nwere dumping in our markets. And down went that little company in \nIdaho.\n  They came to me and others from Idaho. We went to a President--George \nBush--and said: President Bush, if you do not help us, this little \ncompany is going to be destroyed and we are going to lose all of our \nmemory chip capacity in this country. There were futurists saying this \nwas the loss of the new intelligentsia, of the U.S. economy, and\n\n[[Page S4316]]\n\nif we lost this and gave it away to the Japanese, we would never have \nthis new economy.\n\n  The then-President Bush stepped in and said: You are right, and he \nstuck an antidumping clause against the Japanese--backed them off. At \nthat little fledgling company in Idaho, the lights went back on, they \nbegan to produce chips again. Now they are an organization known as \nMicron. They employ 30,000-plus people. They produce 40 percent of the \nmemory chips of the world. They are Idaho's major employer. And they \nare in other States. They just bought a fab in Virginia.\n  But for a moment in time, the President of the United States used \nantidumping provisions and stopped the Japanese and, in part, shifted \nthe world. From that moment through the decade of the 1990s, until \ntoday, this country has led in the area of new technologies. It truly \nwas the economy of the 1990s, in part--a small part but an important \npart--because we helped shape a marketplace and we disallowed \ngovernment-sponsored, government-supported manufacturers in other \ncountries from dumping in the world market and, most importantly, in \nour market.\n  That is why these tools are important. If they are negotiated away, \nthen it is phenomenally important for this Congress to speak to it. \nNowhere do we say they cannot be brought to the table. Nowhere does the \nDayton-Craig amendment say they cannot be negotiated. It simply says to \nthe negotiators, our negotiators: You have a job to do. You have a very \nimportant job to do, and that is to sell it. And the same logic that \nsells the whole trade package, 50-plus-1 votes here in this body, \nblocks a point of order on any changes in trade law. That seems to be \nreasonable. That seems to be common sense.\n  We can go through all the provisions, and the Senator from Texas did \nthat and expanded on them and talked about intellectual property and \ncopyrights.\n  People come to the United States for the purpose of inventing so they \ncan own a piece of their invention and profit by it. That is why we \nhave had copyright law. That is why we have led the world and why we \nlead the world today in inventions, in new technologies, largely \nbecause those who create--those who create through thinking, and that \nmaterializes in the form of a useable object in the market, in the \nlaboratory, in the manufacturing unit--can profit by that for a period \nof time. We protect them.\n  Yes, we will negotiate those items. But what we will not do is \nnegotiate ours away. We are going to try to make the world a \ntransparent place.\n  I am amazed that as the world shifted from tariff to antidumping, \ncountervailing kinds of trade remedy laws, as is being argued here \ntoday, we would want to back ours off. I understand trading. I \nunderstand quid pro quo: You do this and we will do this. But what you \ndo must be transparent, what you do must be enforceable, because what \nwe do as a representative republic, by the very character of our \ncountry and the character of our laws, is open. It is done in the \npublic eye. It is done in the arena of the international trade debates.\n  At the Commission downtown--I have been there to testify; so has the \nPresiding Officer--we have talked about trade issues. We have talked \nabout agricultural policy. We have argued before the Commissioners to \nmake sure that the findings are correct and they are right. We have \nbeen there on Canadian-related issues.\n\n  The only reason we are allowed to go is that we have the law so that \nultimately, if wrongdoing is found, if dumping is found, there is a \nremedy. That remedy usually allows us to cause the other country to \ncomply, to come into balance with us. That is what is important here, \nisn't it? That is what helps our farmers. It doesn't protect them, it \nhelps them. It allows competition in a fair market. It doesn't protect \nand isolate our manufacturing jobs. It balances it. We hope it makes \nthem competitive.\n  We had a vote just a few moments ago, and 60 Senators at least \ndisagreed with the motion to table the Dayton-Craig amendment. Here is \nprobably the reason. Let me read this for the record, and then I will \nstep down because others are here to debate.\n  During the Doha Round of the WTO in Qatar last year, we know our \ntrade ambassador largely believed he was forced to put on the table, as \na negotiable item, our trade remedy provisions. We in the Senate were \nconcerned about that. On May 7 of last year, here is what we said:\n\n       Dear Mr. President:\n       We are writing to state our strong opposition to any \n     international trade agreement that would weaken U.S. trade \n     laws.\n       Key U.S. trade laws, including antidumping law, \n     countervailing duty law, Section 201, and Section 301, are a \n     critical element of U.S. trade policy. A wide range of \n     agricultural and industrial sectors has successfully employed \n     these statutes to address trade problems. Unfortunately, \n     experience suggests that many other industries are likely to \n     have occasion to rely upon them in future years.\n\n  Why? Because of a changing, growing, maturing world economy there \nwill be competitors out there. Let's make sure they are fair.\n\n       Each of these laws is fully consistent with U.S. \n     obligations under the World Trade Organization and other \n     trade agreements.\n\n  Let me repeat: Each of these laws is consistent with U.S. obligations \nunder the World Trade Organization and other trade agreements.\n\n       Moreover, these laws actually promote free trade by \n     countering practices that both distort trade and are \n     condemned by international trading rules.\n       U.S. trade laws provide American workers and industries the \n     guarantee that, if the United States pursues trade \n     liberalization, it will also protect them against unfair \n     foreign trade practices and allow time for them to address \n     serious import surges. They are part of a political bargain \n     struck with Congress and the American people under which the \n     United States has pursued market opening trade agreements in \n     the past.\n       Congress has made clear its position on this matter. In \n     draft fast track legislation considered in 1997, both Houses \n     of Congress have included strong provisions directing trade \n     negotiators not to weaken U.S. trade laws.\n\n  Some of those provisions are in the current document here on the \nfloor to which we are offering an amendment.\n\n       Congress has restated this position in resolutions, \n     letters, and through other means.\n       Unfortunately, some of our trading partners, many of whom \n     maintain serious unfair trade practices, continue to seek to \n     weaken these laws. This may simply be posturing by those who \n     oppose future market opening, but--whatever the motive--the \n     United States should no longer use its trade laws as \n     bargaining chips in trade negotiations nor agree to any \n     provisions that weaken or undermines U.S. trade laws.\n       We look forward to your response.\n       Sincerely--\n\n  And it is signed by 62 Members of the Congress, Democrat and \nRepublican alike.\n  What we are offering today in the Dayton-Craig amendment is fully \nconsistent with the letter we sent to the President last May 7. The \nvote we had an hour or so ago to table the Dayton-Craig amendment is \nalmost to the vote similar to this letter. In other words, I do not \nbelieve the Senate has changed its mind. I think the President has a \nvery clear message.\n  But what is most important is not our President. We want him to \nnegotiate. We want him to put the items on the table. We want him to \nengage the world. We want to trade. We want our producers to produce \nfor a world market. What we do not want is an agreement struck that is \nimpossible to take. What we do want is for the rest of the world to \nknow that we will, in some ways, protect and provide for the American, \nthe U.S. economy in a way that allows us to prosper while allowing \nother countries entry into our economy, and we hope they will allow us \ninto theirs, and in fair, balanced, and equitable processes.\n  That is what is at issue. I believe that is the essence of the \ndebate. Idealism has its place. Academic arguments are critically \nimportant. But today we talk about the practical application of the law \nand our constitutional responsibility, and the impact it has on my \nfarmers and my ranchers and my working men and women, who, like me, \nbelieve they have to trade in a world market to stay economically \nalive.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator raised an excellent point which I had not \nthought of until the Senator made the point: 62 Senators signed that \nletter. Sixty-one Senators voted today in support of the Craig-Dayton \namendment.\n\n[[Page S4317]]\n\nAnd the one Senator who was necessarily absent was a cosponsor of that \namendment.\n  So does the Senator believe, then, this sends a message when 62 \nSenators sign a letter that they mean what they say?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. The point is well \ntaken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend from North Dakota to yield \nto me without losing his right to the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nevada without \nlosing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I very much appreciate my friend for \nyielding.\n  What I want to say is that we have an amendment now before the \nSenate. I believe we should act on this matter. I have told my friend, \nthe Senator from Iowa, we are not going to do anything as long as he is \non the floor. But I would say, through him to my friend from Texas, my \ndear friend, Senator Gramm, that if he wants to filibuster this \namendment, he is going to have to have a real filibuster. He is not \ngoing to be able to come and go from the floor because we have to move \non.\n  I know his heart is in the right place, ``his heart'' meaning Senator \nGramm's heart is in the right place. But we have had a vote this \nmorning that shows 61 Senators are in favor of this amendment. It would \nseem to me we should move on this amendment and go on to something \nelse.\n  I spoke to the Senator from North Dakota earlier today. He has at \nleast four or five very substantive amendments. I think we should get \non to those. I have spoken to other Senators who have amendments. I \nknow there are approximately 10 amendments from the other side. And it \nis being held up.\n  I repeat, if the Senator from Texas wants to conduct a filibuster, he \nis going to have to conduct a real, honest filibuster, not just tell us \nhe is going to talk a lot on this. If I did not have the relationship I \nhave with my friend from Iowa--and I hope we can work something out--we \nwould have moved the question when the Senator--not this Senator was \noff the floor but when the Senator from Texas was off the floor.\n  So I hope we can move forward. There are a number of people who are \nnot real anxious to move this legislation at all. And my friend from \nTexas, who claims he is in favor of it, is working into the hands of \nthose who do not want to move the legislation. It is kind of a unique \ntwist of logic, as far as I am concerned. I know my friend from Texas \nis very logical. He has the mind of an academic. And I understand that. \nBut being very base about all this, there are certain parliamentary \nrules in the Senate, and we are going to stick to them. We are not \ngoing to have a gentleman's filibuster. It is going to be a real \nfilibuster or no filibuster.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Nevada makes an \ninteresting point about the difficulty of getting a vote even on \namendments that have wide support.\n  Nearly a week and a half ago I offered my amendment dealing with \nchapter 11 of NAFTA, to deal with the issue of secret multinational \ntribunals that consider trade bases behind closed doors. This was an \namendment that was bipartisan, and had wide support. I offered my \namendment, and there was a tabling motion. We had 67 Members of the \nSenate vote against tabling, and then we could not get the amendment \nadopted. A number of days elapsed where we just could not get the \namendment adopted.\n  It appears the same thing is happening here. The same Member of the \nSenate is doing it. He certainly has a right to do that, but as the \nSenator from Nevada says, if somebody wants to filibuster this, then \nlet him come to the floor and bring a pitcher of water, get some \ncomfortable shoes on, and stand here for a few hours.\n  But what I hope we will do is adopt the Dayton-Craig amendment. It is \nquite clear, from the evidence of the vote on tabling a while ago, that \nthis amendment will pass by a very significant margin. And the sooner \nthe better.\n  I tell you, I listened, at great length, to my friend from Texas. I \nmust say that I actually taught economics in college for a couple \nyears, but I was able to overcome that experience and go on to lead a \ndifferent life.\n  The issue that is before us is not about economic theory. It is about \nthe reality of trade relationships we have with other countries--and \nwhat real remedies we have to address that unfair trade.\n  I am sure there are people listening to this debate or watching this \ndebate, and they think this all sounds like a foreign language: CVD, \nantidumping, 301, 201, chapter 11.\n\n  But trade issues can and should be discussed in terms of how they \nimpact real people. This debate is about real people in our country \nthat decide to form a company, to produce a product and market it, and \nthen have to contend with foreign competition. I have no problem with \nfair competition--I welcome it. But when our producers' competitors \noverseas are exploiting the labor of a 12-year-old for 12 cents an hour \nlocked in a garage 12 hours a day, is that fair competition?\n  Take a person who works in a manufacturing plant and has worked there \n22 years, is an honest employee, has committed his or her life to that \nemployer, only to discover that next month the identical product is \ncoming in from Bangladesh or Sri Lanka or Indonesia, produced by \nchildren working 12 hours a day or 14 hours a day, getting just cents \nper hour. Fair competition?\n  American workers are told that they cannot compete. You, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica, can't compete because working in this factory we have 12-year-\nolds who will work for less money than you will. They live in countries \nwhere it is all right to work them 12 hours a day and pay them $2 at \nthe end of a day. That is not fair competition.\n  The issue is, what are the remedies? What can we do about that? \nShould we be able to do something about it? Should our trade laws allow \nour companies and our workers to do something about trade that they \nthink is fundamentally unfair?\n  The answer clearly ought to be yes. If the answer is not yes, then \njust forget about the past 100 years of history dealing with labor and \nother issues.\n  There are people who died on the streets in America some three-\nquarters of a century ago, during the struggle of American labor to get \nthe right to organize and form labor unions. There are people who \nrisked their lives in this country because they demanded that we have a \nsafe workplace. There are people who risked their jobs and their lives \nfighting for the issue of child labor laws so we could take kids out of \nthe coal mines.\n  The fact is, we worked on all of these issues for a long time. Over a \ncentury this country had to digest these issues. Should we have a \nrequirement for a safe workplace? Should we have child labor laws so \npeople aren't putting 8 and 10 and 12-year-olds down in the mines? \nShould we have a requirement of a minimum wage? Should we have the \nright to organize as workers? The answer to all of those issues has \nbeen yes. But it was never an easy yes. It took this country decades to \nget through those discussions and debates. As I said, there were some \npeople who died on the streets during the violence that ensued over \nthose debates.\n  A century later we have some who say, let's just get a big old pole \nand pole vault over all those issues and act as if they don't exist. \nBecause you can start a company and you don't have to worry about that. \nYou don't have to worry about whether you hire kids. Just go to another \ncountry and hire kids. You don't have to worry about paying a decent \nwage. You can go somewhere else and pay them 24 cents an hour to put \ntogether canvas bags so they can be shipped to Fargo or Los Angeles or \nPittsburgh. You don't have to worry about dumping chemicals and \npollutants into the streams and the air. Just move your factory \nsomewhere else where they don't have environmental laws, laws that \nprotect the drinking water and the air. You can\n\n[[Page S4318]]\n\njust pole vault over all of that and decide to move all these jobs \nsomewhere.\n  The person who is working in that factory and has been there 22 years \nsays: Wait a second. What has happened to my job?\n  That person is told: Your job is gone, my friend. Your job is \nsomewhere else because you were too expensive. There are kids who will \nwork for less money in another country. They will work all the overtime \nhours they are told to work, and they have no recourse.\n  I happen to believe that expanded trade and fair trade is good for \nthis country. I think it enhances this country. It increases the \nopportunity for a better economy. But I don't think we can talk about \nfair trade without addressing the issues I am describing.\n  We have a lot of people in our country who work hard all day, every \nday. To be told that somehow they can't compete because someone else \ncan produce that product at a fraction of the price because they don't \nhave to follow any rules, anyplace, anytime, that is not fair trade.\n  What we have is a situation where globalization is here. No one is \nattempting to turn back globalization. It is a fact of life today in \nthe world. This is a globalized economy. The question isn't whether \nglobalization. The question is what are the rules for globalization. \nWhat are the rules for the global economy?\n  There is an admission price to this marketplace, and that is fair \ntrade. That is part of what we are trying to define with respect to the \nrules of the global economy.\n  My colleagues, Senators Dayton and Craig, have offered an amendment. \nIt is a fairly straightforward amendment. It says that if and when the \nnext trade agreement is negotiated under fast track rules and brought \nback to the Congress, we ought to have the right to have a separate \nvote on any provision that diminishes the protections we now have to \ntake action against those who engage in unfair trade practices against \nour businesses and against our workers.\n  If they do anything behind a closed door in some foreign land where \nthey negotiate a trade agreement to diminish our protection to take \naction against unfair trade, we reserve the right to have a separate \nvote on it.\n  Let me show you what Mr. Zoellick said in Doha, Qatar. I wonder how \nmany of the Members of the Senate could point to Doha on a world map. I \nwill tell you why this ministerial meeting was held in Doha: Because \nthey couldn't hold it anyplace else. You have to find a place that is \nvery hard to find and has very few hotel rooms in order to avoid the \npeople who will demonstrate against these trade agreements these days. \nSo they picked Doha, Qatar.\n  Last November at the ministerial meeting, Trade Representative \nZoellick agreed that U.S. antidumping laws could be discussed as a new \ntrade round gets underway.\n  Why is this important? Well, we have laws that say to other countries \nand other producers, you can't dump your products into this country. \nYou can't, for example, produce a product that costs you $100 to \nproduce and dump it in the American marketplace for $50 apiece to \nundercut the American producer.\n  My colleague from Texas said: Gee, that is a good thing, isn't it, \nthat they are going to send a $100 product over here and sell it for \n$50.\n  Well, I guess it is a good thing if you don't lose your job as a \nresult of it. I don't know of one Senator or one Member of the House \nwho has ever lost a job because of a bad trade agreement. Just name \none, just one man or woman serving in the Senate or House who has ever \nlost their job because of a bad trade agreement. It is just folks out \nthere who work all day in factories being closed because of bad trade \nagreements who lose their jobs.\n  That is not theory. Those are broken dreams. Somebody coming home \nfrom work having to say: Honey, they told me I have lost my job today \nbecause I can't compete. I can't compete with 50 cents an hour wages, \nworking 12-hour days in a factory where they don't have to worry about \npollution. That is what antidumping laws try to remedy.\n\n  What Senators Dayton and Craig say with this amendment is very \nsimple: If you want to negotiate an agreement, Mr. Trade Ambassador, \nthat negotiates away our antidumping laws, then Congress has a right to \nhave a separate vote on that provision pertaining to our trade laws. \nBecause this Congress is not any longer going to allow you to dilute or \ndelete the protections and remedies which we have to deal with unfair \ntrade.\n  I have spoken at length in this Chamber about my concern about our \ntrade policy. We have a trade deficit that is growing and growing and \nno one cares a whit about it: Over $400 billion a year. Every single \nday we add over $1 billion to our trade deficit and our current \naccounts balance.\n  We used to have debates about deficits in this Chamber, about fiscal \npolicy deficits when the budget deficit was $290 billion and going in \nthe wrong direction. We would have debates, we would have people doing \nhandstands and cartwheels about how awful it was. Not a word about the \ntrade deficit.\n  One can make the case in theory that the budget deficit is a deficit \nwe owe to ourselves. One cannot make that case about the trade deficit. \nThe trade deficit is going to be paid for by a lower standard of living \nin America's future, and over $1 billion a day every single day we are \nadding to the merchandise trade deficit.\n  This trade policy of ours is not working. We cannot load ourselves up \nwith debt and choke on this trade debt and say: Boy, this is a good \nthing; this is really working well.\n  I have been very critical of our trade ambassadors, Republicans and \nDemocrats, for not having the backbone to take action when we see \nunfair trade. We now have remedies that are not used. Even when they \nuse remedies, I always scratch my head and think: What a strange \napproach.\n  We have a little dispute with Europe. The dispute is with respect to \nbeef produced with hormones that are banned in Europe. We went to the \nWTO, and the WTO ruled in our favor. But Europe said: Fly a kite. \nEurope would not comply with the WTO requirement, and so we took action \nagainst Europe.\n  Mr. President, do you know what we did to Europe? Our negotiators \nsaid: We are imposing sanctions on imports of truffles, Roquefort \ncheese, and goose liver. That will sure strike fear in the hearts of \ncompetitors. Those engaged in unfair trade ought to know from here on \nforward, America takes tough action to deal with goose liver imports.\n  My point is, our country does not stand up for its economic interest \nin international trade very often, and to weaken the remedies that \nalready exist--they did that under the United States-Canada agreement \nand under NAFTA. Section 22 used to be helpful to us. Not anymore. \nSection 301 is weakened and diminished as an area of trade protection.\n  It is interesting, I pointed out the antidumping laws we now have are \non the trading block. Our allies who want to get rid of these \nantidumping laws in our country will negotiate them away, if they can. \nAnd by the way, they will do that in secret because the American public \nand Congress will not be there when it is done. It will be done, in \nmost cases, in a foreign land behind a closed door. They will bring it \nback here and say: you have one vote on it, yes or no, and it deals \nwith a broad range of issues and you cannot get at the antidumping \nprovision we traded away because you just get a yes or no on the entire \nproduct. That is why Senators Dayton and Craig say this is not the \nright thing to do.\n  I was interested to hear, this morning, one of my colleagues talk \nabout all of the trade problems we have, as if to suggest we should \nblame ourselves for the problems. We have trouble getting high-fructose \ncorn syrup into Mexico. So that is our problem? I do not think so. That \nis Mexico's fault. Grain coming in from Canada by the Canadian Wheat \nBoard unfairly subsidized, that is our problem? Not where I sit it is \nnot. That is Canada's unfair trading practice. I could go on and list a \ndozen more. Seventy percent tariff on wheat flour into Europe, is that \nfair? I do not think so.\n\n  I cannot even begin to talk about our trade problems with China. And \nit's not just unfair trade, it's also about badly negotiated trade \nagreements.\n  A year and a half ago, we negotiated a bilateral agreement with \nChina. The United States agreed that after a long phase-in with respect \nto automobiles, any Chinese cars that are sent to the United States \nwill be subject to a 2.5-\n\n[[Page S4319]]\n\npercent tariff on them. Any U.S. cars that are sent to China will be \nsubject to a 25-percent tariff.\n  So we have a 2.5-percent tariff on the Chinese cars coming into our \nmarket, but the Chinese can impose a tariff that is 10 times higher on \nU.S. cars into China. You ask: How did that happen? Because our \nnegotiators negotiated away the store. It is the same squishy-headed \nnonsense our negotiators do every time they negotiate.\n  Will Rogers once said--I have told my colleagues this many times--the \nUnited States of America has never lost a war and never won a \nconference. He surely must have been thinking of our trade negotiators. \nThey seem to manage to lose within a week or two of leaving our shores.\n  Whenever I talk about trade, someone will call my office and say: you \nare a protectionist. I am not. If protectionism means standing up for \nAmerica's economic interest, then count me in, sign me up, that is what \nI want to do but I am not asking for anything special for anybody. I \nwant all our people to have to compete--farmers, businesses, and \nothers. But I want the competition to be fair, and if the competition \nis not fair, then I want the remedies available to address that \nunfairness. Those remedies have been weakened dramatically, and they \nwill be weakened further, mark my words, in the next set of \nnegotiations.\n  This amendment is not in any way, as some have said, a killer \namendment. That is not what this amendment is about. If my colleagues \nwant to stand up for American jobs and demand fair trade and demand the \nremedies that will get you to fair trade, then it seems to me they have \nan obligation to support this amendment.\n  I was pleased with the last tabling vote because it showed an \noverwhelming number of Members of the Senate understand this issue and \nare no longer going to sit quietly by and say: You go ahead and \nnegotiate. Get on an airplane, go someplace, roll up your shirt \nsleeves, and negotiate. Whatever you come back with, that is fine, we \nwill handcuff ourselves. You can negotiate away our antidumping laws; \nyou can trade away our remedies; and we will agree to handcuff \nourselves and not have a vote on it.\n  I believe the Senate is finally saying to those who will listen: We \nare not willing to do that.\n  I did not support providing fast-track trade authority to President \nClinton, and I do not support giving it to President Bush. I say to \nthis administration, as I said to the past administration: Negotiate \nagreements and you will do so with my best wishes. And I hope you will \nnegotiate good agreements for our country, agreements that stand up for \nour economic interest, and agreements that demand that the rules for \nthat competition be fair. Then come back, and when you see unfair \ntrade, be willing to stand up, have the guts to stand up for this \ncountry's interest.\n\n  The reason there is so much anger about trade these days--we see it \nin the streets during these ministerials, and we hear it in the \ndebates--is because we are so anxious to negotiate the next agreement \nand so unwilling to enforce the last agreement.\n  We have done so many agreements with Japan that nobody can even find \nthe agreements. USTR cannot find all the agreements the United States \nhas with Japan, let alone enforce them. We have something like eight to \nnine people in the Department of Commerce enforcing our trade \nagreements with respect to China. The same is true with respect to \nJapan, eight or nine people. Why? Because this country is not serious \nabout enforcing trade laws. This country is serious only about \nnegotiating the next agreement and not caring how many people lose \ntheir jobs because of unfair trade that results from that agreement.\n  My beef with trade is that, A, we negotiate bad agreements and, B, we \nconsistently fail and in most cases refuse to enforce the agreements we \ndo negotiate.\n  I will conclude by saying this: We have, for the 50 or so years \nfollowing the Second World War, largely dealt with trade as a matter of \nforeign policy. For the first 25 years after the Second World War, it \nwas not a problem dealing with trade as foreign policy. This country \ncould tie one hand behind its back and beat anybody at any time in \nalmost anything in international trade. So our concessions in trade to \nalmost every country were concessions that reflected the struggle that \neconomy was having and our ability to help them in that struggle.\n  The second 25 years after the Second World War, our competitors \nbecame shrewd, tough international negotiators. Our trade policy must \nchange to be a trade policy that demands the rules of fair competition, \nand is no longer about foreign policy.\n  There is one issue in recent days that demonstrates that trade is \nstill, in many cases, foreign policy, and that is with Cuba. Cuba is a \ncommunist country, no question about that. So is China. So is Vietnam. \nWe have people traveling back and forth to China and Vietnam. We trade \nwith China and Vietnam, but we have a 40-year failed embargo with Cuba. \nUntil I and a couple of others from this Chamber fought to get food \nshipped to Cuba, we could not even ship food to Cuba. Cuba could not \nbuy food from us. That did not hurt Castro. He never missed a meal. It \nhurt poor, sick, and hungry people. That has finally changed, except we \nhave some people in the State Department who still do not want to ship \nfood to Cuba, and they are trying to impede in every possible way \nAmerican food from being sold in the country of Cuba. So once again, \ntrade policy is not trade policy, it is foreign policy.\n  I think it would be smart if we could get some of the folks in the \nState Department to stop meddling in trade policy. They should start \nworrying a little more about terrorists with bombs and a little less \nabout Cubans who want to buy beans in this country.\n  I have taken a long, meandering road to get to the point, but it is \ntherapeutic to talk about these trade issues from time to time. The \nDayton-Craig amendment is a very simple, straightforward amendment that \nthis Senate ought to enact and ought to do so soon. We have now been on \nthis amendment a good many hours. These are people who apparently \nsupport fast track but do not support the Senate imposing its will with \na popular vote, as was the case on a motion to table the Dayton-Craig \namendment. I hope that we can get past this and put our trade \nambassador and our trading partners on notice, that we will not trade \nour remedies that exist against unfair trade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3411 to Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the greatest public health \nchallenges we are facing in the world today is the pandemic of AIDS in \nAfrica, increasingly in India and the subcontinent, spreading as well \ninto China, and also the Soviet Union. It is most dramatically \nexpressed in the neediest and the poorest countries of the world.\n  I think Africa has been on the minds of many of us in the Senate \nabout how we were going to respond and how we were really going to \nprovide international leadership. The United States has been a country \nthat has developed a variety of different medications over the period \nof recent years, as well as treatment for a wide variety of different \nkinds of AIDS cases, particularly in the area of pediatric AIDS and \nother types of challenges that have affected those with HIV. We are now \ninvolved in responding to the real challenge of Kofi Annan and the \nworld community in providing world leadership, in providing funding, \nand being replicated by other countries. We still have a long way to \ngo, but I think many of us who have watched this develop in terms of \nthe breadth of the support from our Members have been impressed that we \nare finally beginning to measure up, although I think we do have a long \nway to go.\n  Having said that, one of the great challenges that these countries \nhave is acquiring the various kinds of prescription drugs they need. \nOne of the issues that will be presented, should this legislation be \npassed and signed into law, still will be what is the availability of \nsome of these generic drugs, which might provide a lifesaving \ncircumstance to millions of people around the world if they are able to \nbe produced, in these countries that do not have the resources to buy \nthe brand name drugs.\n  The question has been whether these countries that are facing this \nkind of extraordinary crisis would be able to issue what is called a \ncompulsory license that would permit them to buy\n\n[[Page S4320]]\n\ngeneric drugs that are being either produced or can be produced in \ntheir own country or in another country, and that has been very much an \nissue. This amendment, which I would offer myself with a number of our \ncolleagues, would make it very clear that if the country itself issued \nwhat is called a compulsory license, based upon the critical need and \npublic health disaster they are facing, it could not be considered to \nbe in violation of the trade laws, and they would be able to either \ndevelop that capability within the country or, for example, if we were \ntalking about Botswana, which has a high incidence of HIV and AIDS, be \nable to make contracts with other countries and purchase a generic, \nwhich they would be interested in doing, as I understand, with Brazil \nor other nations.\n  It is perhaps, in many respects, one of the most important \nclarifications in terms of the health care crisis of HIV and of AIDS. \nThis provision will make a very substantial difference. The cloudiness \nthat currently surrounds this issue will be eliminated with this \namendment. The amendment is very simple. It ensures those countries hit \nhardest by the AIDS crisis and other public health emergencies will \nhave access to the affordable medicines to address these crises. It \ndoes this by expressing support for the Doha declaration on TRIPS and \nthe public health as adopted by the World Trade Organization last \nNovember.\n  The Doha declaration was supported by Ambassador Zoellick, the \npharmaceutical industry, and thousands of public health advocates and \nreligious leaders. It is one of the most important global health issues \nwe face today, and I am pleased we could address it in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n\n  I will submit a more complete statement for the Record, but I \nacknowledge and thank the chairman, Senator Baucus, and Senator \nGrassley and their staffs for their willingness to consider this \namendment.\n  I am not going to ask that the current amendment be temporarily set \naside, but I had the opportunity to talk with the chairman earlier--the \nranking member was not present--with his staff, and so at an \nappropriate time--and I will leave it up to the managers to work out \nwhat is the appropriate time--I hope this amendment might be considered \nfavorably.\n  As I say, this is a matter of enormous importance and incredible \nconsequence. It really will result in the savings of hundreds of \nthousands of lives. It needs to be clarified in an important way. I \nwelcome the strong bipartisan support of my colleagues who are \nsupportive of this proposal on both sides of the aisle. It will be \nenormously welcomed by the neediest countries in the world.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3408\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to support this important \namendment. This amendment will help preserve our trade laws by allowing \nCongress to exclude trade remedy provisions from any agreement \nreceiving fast track consideration. This is extremely important at a \ntime when our trade laws are under attack at the WTO.\n  Here's how it would work: Should Congress receive a trade agreement \ncontaining a provision changing current U.S. trade remedy law, the \nprovision would be subject to a point of order. After hearing the \nadministration's concerns about minority obstructionism, Senators \nDayton and Craig changed this amendment so that the point of order is \nnow subject to a simple majority vote. Yet, still the administration \nopposes this amendment. It opposes the legislature of the United States \nhaving a simple up or down vote on a provision of a trade agreement \nthat changes existing law that this body made. In fact, the Secretary \nof Commerce, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the USTR have said they \nwould strongly recommend to the President that he veto this bill if the \nDayton-Craig amendment passes.\n  This amendment is entirely appropriate. Given many of the trade \nagreements we have seen, at a minimum, this body should ensure we \nretain our authority and obligation to fully deliberate and debate and \nproposed changes to U.S. trade remedy law. The amendment would provide \na critical channel through which Senators could act to prevent such \nundesirable agreements as the one made--in spite of our strong and \nvocal opposition--at the latest WTO negotiations in Doha: In May 2001, \n62 Senators sent a letter to the President specifically opposing any \nweakening of trade remedy laws in international negotiations; in a \nsubsequent Hill appearance USTR Zoellick made a public commitment to \nSenator Rockefeller that the administration would not permit this to \nhappen.\n  At Doha however, other WTO member countries demanded U.S. trade \nremedy laws be put on the table as a condition of beginning the new \nround. So, despite the word of the Administration that this would \nhappen--it did. The administration broke its word to us and our trade \nremedy laws are on the table. With this amendment, we will send a \nstrong message directly to other WTO countries and the administration \nthat the U.S. Senate will not tolerate any weakening of these critical \nlaws.\n  Oddly enough, while the administration continues to allow our trading \npartners to rewriter U.S. trade remedy laws, China refuses to even \ndiscuss theirs. Accordingly to last Friday's Inside U.S. Trade:\n\n       China over the past week continued to resist efforts aimed \n     at reaching agreement on timelines and procedures for \n     information it must provide to the World Trade Organization \n     committees in charge of reviews of its trade remedy laws that \n     were set up as a condition of China's entry to the WTO. China \n     charged this week that these proposed procedures go beyond \n     the obligations of its accession commitments . . . \n     Specifically, China, argues it is not obligated to discuss \n     specific procedures for the reviews of its antidumping, \n     subsidies and safeguards mechanisms.\n\n  There is absolutely no reason for us to allow the safeguards provided \nby our trade laws to be undermined by the concerted efforts other \ncountries in multilateral negotiations. All of our trade remedy laws--\nfrom the anti-dumping and countervailing duties to the Trade Act's \nsection 201 and 301--are entirely consistent with WTO principles and \nhelp protect U.S. workers and producers from unfair trade practices.\n  At a press conference last week, USTR Zoellick said this amendment \nwould prevent the U.S. from negotiating on trade remedies, and because \nthis issue is a priority for U.S. trading partners, the amendment would \nlead these countries to refuse to negotiate at all. This statement \nshould make it clear to all that not only does this administration \nbelieve certain countries are willing to trade with us only if they are \nable to weaken or undermine our trade remedy laws; but that it intends \nto accommodate them. By permitting a point of order against any trade \nagreement provisions that change our trade laws, this amendment \nprovides an extra level of protection for these vitally important \nsafeguards. These laws have been effectively employed in a variety of \nsectors to address numerous trade imbalances or to give domestic \nproducers vital time to address major import surges.\n  Our spring wheat farmers in Minnesota have been struggling for years \nto win effective relief against cheap imports from Canada. And its not \nthat Minnesota wheat producers cannot compete with their Canadian \ncounterparts--it is that the Canadian system is run so very differently \nfrom ours that direct competition simply does not occur. The Canadian \nWheat Board enjoys monopoly control over their domestic wheat markets. \nIts ability to set prices months in advance effectively insulates \nCanadian wheat farmers from the commercial risks that Minnesota growers \nare routinely exposed to, and gives their product a built-in advantage \nright here in our own American market. Unfortunately our softwood \nlumber producers have faced many of the same obstacles in competing \nwith their Canadian counterparts. Of course we are disappointed that we \nwere unable to informally resolve our differences with our close friend \nand ally. But at least we have meaningful trade remedy laws we can fall \nback on. The International Trade Commission and the Department of \nCommerce found earlier this month that our lumber industry is \nthreatened with material injury from subsidized Canadian imports. As a \nresult, countervailing duty and antidumping duties will be issued on \nthese products.\n\n  Another Minnesota industry that has been immeasurably helped by these \ntrade remedy laws is that of sugar beet\n\n[[Page S4321]]\n\nproduction. Together with our hard working neighbors in North Dakota, \nour beet sugar industry is the largest in the country--an estimated $1 \nbillion in economic benefits flows from it each year. Yet without the \nprotection of our trade remedy laws, this industry could be in serious \njeopardy. Our trading partners in the EU are one of the largest \nexporters of beet sugar in the world yet it is well-known that they \nhave been heavily subsidizing their production. Our industry cannot and \nshould not be expected to compete with such heavily subsidized imports. \nThis is why there are antidumping and countervailing duty orders \ncurrently in effect on imported European beet sugar. As Minnesota beet \nsugar producers know all too well, these orders are entirely \nappropriate and very necessary countermeasures to the considerable \nsubsidies that EU producers enjoy.\n  We cannot expect our producers to be able to compete with the \nunreasonably low prices that subsidies or closed, monopolistic systems \nproduce. We look forward to the day when there is a more level playing \nfield. But until that day comes, it is vitally important that we \nprotect and maintain these trade remedy laws that all too often \nrepresent their only hope for much-needed relief.\n  As we have learned over the past decade, trade liberalization has \nincreased the opportunities for unscrupulous countries or industries to \nmanipulate markets through unfair trade practices. With major new \nagreements like the FTAA on the horizon, it is imperative that we \nmaintain these important laws so that they can continue to be used to \nprotect our workers and companies from the risks posed by those who \nseek to distort and manipulate the very markets we are seeking to open \nto free and fair competition.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Dayton-Craig \namendment.\n  I have no doubt that the sponsors of the Dayton-Craig amendment have \nnothing but the best intentions. They believe that they are protecting \nthe interests of the American public by walling off our Nation's trade \nremedy laws.\n  Senators Dayton and Craig believe that the Congress should take a \nspecial look to determine whether a particular trade agreement \nundermines our trade remedy laws. These important protections include \nthe anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws.\n  I understand what my friends, Senators Dayton and Craig, are \nattempting to do with their amendment. But the trade promotion \nauthority bill before us today already addresses their major concern--\nthe weakening of our domestic trade laws.\n  The bill before us already gives clear direction to our U.S. \nnegotiators to ``avoid agreements that lessen the effectiveness of \ndomestic and international disciplines on unfair trade.'' This includes \ndumping, subsidies, and safeguards.\n  Under the provisions of the Dayton-Craig amendment, a minority of \nthis body could work to defeat future trade agreements. By raising a \npoint of order objection, any one Senator could slow the chance for any \nfuture trade agreement and 41 Senators could effectively kill a global \ntrade agreement signed by the President, passed by the House and \nsupported by a majority in the Senate, for any reason--even one totally \nunrelated to trade laws--as long as the implementing bill contained any \nchange, no matter how minor, to a U.S. trade law.\n  If this amendment were to pass and become law, the United States' \nnegotiating position would be severely weakened in any future trade \ntalks. Our trading partners will view this amendment as a \nvulnerability--in essence, by passing this amendment we are outlining \nto our potential trading partners our greatest negotiating weakness.\n  If we declare U.S. trade laws off limits, I must ask if this is \nreally the best way to encourage other countries to bring their trade \nlaws up to U.S. standards which, most would agree are the gold standard \nthat all countries strive to meet? But sometimes you can't get here \nfrom there immediately, and you have to take intermediate steps along \nthe way.\n  While I believe that the United States has enacted and plays by a \nfair set of rule with respect to trade remedy laws, we should never \nsend a signal to our neighbors that our laws cannot be improved and \nshould not be the subject for discussion.\n  I have absolute faith that the President, Secretary Evans, and \nAmbassador Zoellick would never do anything to fundamentally undercut \nour trade remedy laws.\n  And what if I am wrong, and the administration gave away the store in \na negotiation on our antidumping laws?\n  The remedy would be simple--the Congress would not adopt the trade \ntreaty. The President would quickly get the message and would learn how \nfar is too far.\n  While this would be harsh medicine, it would be what the doctor \nordered. The Constitution gives the Congress an active role in the \ndevelopment of international trade policy. We are not to be a potted \nplant or a rubber stamp.\n  There is good reason to believe that we will not go down this path \nabsent the Dayton-Craig amendment.\n  Let me be clear, as part of granting fast track authority to the \nPresident, Congress naturally will expect extensive consultation and \nnotification procedures.\n  Success in passing TPA will require a close partnership between the \nexecutive and legislative branches of our Government. The Constitution \ngrants Congress the authority to promote international commerce.\n  However, the Constitution also gives the President the responsibility \nto conduct foreign policy. Thus, the very nature of our Constitution \nrequires a partnership between the executive and legislative branches \nof government in matters of international trade negotiations. That is \nwhat the trade promotion authority bill is all about--a partnership \nbetween the executive and legislative branches of government to enable \nU.S. consumers, workers and firms to be effectively represented at the \nnegotiating table.\n  The current TPA bill already establishes extraordinary procedures for \ncongressional consultations and review of negotiations involving U.S. \ntrade remedy laws. Under the procedures outlined in this bill, the \nPresident must give an advance report to the Senate Finance and House \nWays and Means Committees at least 90 days before the United States \nenters into a trade agreement. This report must outline any amendments \nto U.S. laws on antidumping, countervailing duties and safeguards that \nthe President proposes to include in a trade implementing bill.\n  After the President notifies Congress of his trade negotiation \nintentions, the chairs and ranking members of the relevant committees \nthen report to their respective chambers on their own assessments as to \nthe integrity of the proposed changes to the TPA's objectives.\n\n  The effect of these provisions would be to assure that the President \nand the Congress are on the same page regarding proposals in trade \nnegotiations on subsidies, dumping, and safeguards.\n  I might add that one need not look back very far to prove the resolve \nof President Bush's administration in upholding our trade laws. Just \nthis year the President took action to save the U.S. steel industry and \nmade a bold move to slow the unfair import of soft-wood lumber.\n  This is not an administration, in my opinion, that is looking to \nweaken our trade laws.\n  Here is what the administration has said about the Dayton-Craig \namendment:\n\n       . . . the amendment derails TPA without justification. The \n     Bush administration has demonstrated its commitment to U.S. \n     trade laws not through talk but through action. We have been \n     committed not just to preserving U.S. trade laws, but more \n     importantly, to using them. The administration initiated an \n     historic Section 201 investigation that led to the imposition \n     of wide-ranging safeguards for the steel industry. The \n     administration's willingness to enforce vigorously our trade \n     laws, in Canadian lumber and other cases, sends the clearest \n     signal of our interest in defending these laws in the WTO.\n\n  This administration takes the trade protection laws very seriously.\n  The administration has also warned us about what may very likely \nhappen if we adopt this seemingly good-government amendment.\n  Here is what Secretary Evans, Secretary Veneman, and Ambassador \nZoellick are worried about, if we adopt this misguided amendment: ``the \nrest of the world will determine that the U.S. Congress has ruled out \neven discussion of a major topic. Other countries will refuse to \ndiscuss their own\n\n[[Page S4322]]\n\nsensitive subjects, unraveling the entire trade negotiation to the \ndetriment of U.S. workers, farmers, and consumers.''\n  It seems to me that this is a dynamic that we ought to worry about.\n  And I think this could very well extend to places where it can \nmaterially injure American leadership in high technology. As Ranking \nRepublican Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am particularly \nconcerned that some nations might remain derelict, or become derelict, \nin their responsibilities of implementing the TRIPS provisions of GATT. \nThese are the intellectual property provisions relating to \ninternational trade.\n  It is the TRIPS provisions that govern such valuable intellectual \nproperty as patents and copyrights. We know that a great deal of \nAmerican inventive capacity is tied to the software, information \ntechnology, entertainment, and biotechnology industries. We are the \nworld's leaders in these vital areas. We should not encourage or allow \nother nations to unilaterally enact their own Dayton-Craig-type \nprovisions that act to allow them to delay TRIPS implementation.\n  All you have to do is to read the latest USTR report on special 301 \nwith respect to intellectual property to see the potential scope of the \nproblem. This lays out which countries need to do better in meeting \ntheir obligations under TRIPS with respect to intellectual property.\n  Just so everybody knows, the priority watch list countries are: \nArgentina; Brazil; Columbia; the Dominican Republic; the EU; Egypt; \nHungary; India; Indonesia; Israel; Lebanon; the Philippines; Russia; \nTaiwan; and Uruguay. In addition to these countries, Ukraine continues \nto be listed as a priority foreign country because it has been \ndetermined by USTR that it has a particularly poor record in this area.\n  Dayton-Craig can only send a signal to these priority watch list \ncountries that they can try to avoid their intellectual property \nresponsibilities by saying that they want to take aspects of their IP \nlaws off the table just like the United States may do with our trade \nremedy laws.\n  So it is not only the traditional sectors like farming that have a \nstake in this but also the most cutting edge industries that rely on \npatents and copyrights.\n  Let me say that I am a strong supporter of our trade remedy laws. In \nfact, I think I may have irritated a number of my colleagues on the \nFinance Committee and in the full Senate by helping to lead the charge \non the steel issue this Congress.\n  It seems like my friend Senator Rockefeller and I kept bumping into \none another as we testified before the International Trade Commission \nin both the injury and remedy phases of the steel case.\n  I am a proponent of trade but I am against dumping of products into \nthe United States. I know what the dumping of steel has done to 1,400 \nlaid-off steel workers and their families in Utah.\n  Frankly, many of my colleagues might think my actions amounted to \nprotectionism, but I think that the facts compelled the ITC and \nPresident Bush to conclude otherwise.\n  I commend the strong action that President Bush took in response to \nthe crisis in the steel industry. The steel 201 case was an example \nthat our trade remedy laws can work.\n  I part company with those who take the well-intentioned, but I think \nultimately counter-productive, position that Congress should \nessentially get a second bite of the apple when it comes to the trade \nremedy laws.\n  I have no doubt of the good intentions behind this amendment. But \nseems to me that you either believe, or disbelieve, in the wisdom and \nintegrity of the fast track process. Either we have an up or down vote \non the whole package or we don't. We should not be picking and choosing \nin a way that invites interminable debate and innumerable amendments.\n  If you don't like an agreement--for any reason, not just the trade \nremedy laws but for the old-fashioned reason that it is just not a good \nthing for your state and your constituents, then by all means, vote \nagainst it.\n  The Dayton-Craig amendment, if adopted, will invite similar responses \nfrom our trading partners. If we try to take these matters off the \ntable, we can only guess what matters they will deem as inviolate.\n  Let the trade negotiators negotiate. I have faith that no USTR--in \neither a Republican or Democratic administration--will ever give away \nthe store on trade remedy laws. And, in the unlikely event that this \noccurs--the Constitution gives the Congress the final word.\n  TPA is an essential tool for sound trade expansion policy, a tool we \nhave been without since its expiration in 1994. For over a decade, the \nUnited States has too often sat on the sidelines while other nations \naround the world continued to form trade partnerships and lucrative \nmarket alliances. The lack of fast track has put the United States at a \ndisadvantage during trade negotiations.\n  I submit that this amendment does nothing less than hand trade \nopponents a tool to block future agreements that are overwhelmingly in \nAmerica's interests.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Dayton-Craig provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Further debate on amendment No. 3408.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3408.\n  The amendment (No. 3408) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3411 to Amendment No. 3401\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is it appropriate to send my amendment to the desk?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3411 to amendment No. 3401.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To include the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public \n   Health as a principal negotiating objective of the United States)\n\n       Section 2102(b)(4) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new subparagraph:\n       (C) to respect the Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and \n     Public Health, adopted by the World Trade Organization at the \n     Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha, Qatar on November 14, \n     2001.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, sometimes Democrats and Republicans can \nstand shoulder to shoulder with health advocates and industry \nrepresentatives, find common ground, and develop constructive ideas to \naddress some of the world's most pressing problems.\n  We can do this today by supporting the World Trade Organization's \nDeclaration on TRIPS and Public Health, adopted at its Fourth \nMinisterial Conference last November in Doha. ``TRIPS'' stands for \nTrade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property. The TRIPS Agreement is \none of the agreements maintained by the World Trade Organization. TRIPS \nis the final word when it comes to international patent issues.\n  In recent years, there has been some confusion over the TRIPS \nAgreement and the ability of poorer countries to gain access to \naffordable medicines to fight some of the worst plagues of our age--\nincluding malaria, tuberculosis, and AIDS. Many health advocacy groups, \nincluding Doctors Without Borders and the World Health Organization, as \nwell as faith-based and secular groups like Oxfam, expressed concern \nthat dying people in impoverished nations could not receive medicines \nbecause their countries were not being afforded the flexibility in the \nTRIPS Agreement to acquire them cheaply.\n  Developing nations facing health emergencies reported political \npressure when they tried to employ compulsory licensing--that is, the \ntemporary suspension of a drug's patent and an order to a manufacturer \nto produce that drug\n\n[[Page S4323]]\n\nat a lower cost--or parallel importing, looking for the lowest price of \na branded drug on the global market. The nations encountered threats of \nlitigation through the WTO for trying to save the lives of their \ncitizens. The poorest countries felt that our international trade \nagreements, written with the intent of lifting people out of poverty, \nwere now being used against the poorest and most vulnerable when they \nneeded them most.\n  After the anthrax scare here in Washington and the East Coast the \nUnited States raised the possibility of issuing a compulsory license \nfor Cipro--the drug proven to kill anthrax, to ensure that an adequate \nsupply of the drug was available at a reasonable cost. HHS Secretary \nThompson discussed publicly the steps that would be taken, pursuant to \nthe TRIPS, to issue and implement such a license. Few people in the \nUnited States would question such a move to protect our nation's public \nhealth.\n  Four people died from the recent anthrax outbreak in the United \nStates. If an outbreak that results in four fatalities and another \ndozen infections is an emergency, what do we call a situation in which \nnearly 14,000 people will die every day from AIDS, tuberculosis, or \nmalaria? If the TRIPS has the flexibility to accommodate the richest \ncountry in the world, it must be able to accommodate the poorest as \nwell.\n  The global health crisis we face today is unprecedented. The World \nHealth Organization reports infectious diseases are the leading killer \nof young people in developing countries. These deaths occur primarily \namong the poorest people because they do not have access to the drugs \nand commodities necessary for prevention and cure. Approximately half \nof infectious disease mortality can be attributed to just three \ndiseases--HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. These diseases cause over 300 \nmillion illnesses and more than 5 million deaths each year.\n  The WHO also reports that the economic burden is enormous. Africa's \ngross domestic product would be 32 percent greater if malaria had been \neliminated 35 years ago. A nation can expect a decline in GDP of 1 \npercent annually when more than 20 percent of the adult population is \ninfected with HIV. Of the nearly 40 million people infected with HIV \nworldwide, roughly 28 million of them live in Africa. If we are serious \nabout promoting wealth across the globe, global health must be at the \nforefront.\n  Many poorer countries have shown that effective disease fighting \nstrategies can reduce tuberculosis deaths five-fold. HIV infection \nrates can be reduced by 80 percent. Malaria death rates can be halved. \nBut when a country has a health care budget of less than $50 per \ncapita, the costs of the tools--and the drugs--to fight these diseases \nis often beyond reach. As a result, many studies estimate that 90 to 95 \npercent of people infected with HIV in the developing world do not have \naccess to the medicines they need for treatment or prevention.\n  Recognizing the staggering global health crisis the world is now \nfacing, the trade ministers of 142 countries decided to provide the \nclarity in the TRIPS Agreement that was so desperately needed. To \nensure that all nations have access to lifesaving medicines, the WTO \nissued the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. Among other things, \nit said,\n\n  ``We agree that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should not prevent \nMembers from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, \nwhile reiterating our commitment to the TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that \nthe Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner \nsupportive of all WTO Members' right to protect health, and in \nparticular, to promote access to medicines for all.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Declaration on TRIPS and \nPublic Health be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The declaration was immediately heralded across the \nglobe as a tremendous achievement. It struck an honest balance between \nthe legitimate interests of intellectual property protection and the \npreservation of public health. US Trade Representative Robert Zoellick \nsaid immediately after Doha, ``The adoption of the landmark political \ndeclaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health is a good example \nof developed and developing nations advancing common goals by working \nthrough issues together.'' He later added, ``We were pleased with this \nprocess . . . and we believe this declaration affirms that TRIPS and \nthe global trading system can help countries address pressing public \nhealth concerns.''\n  Alan Holmer, the president of the Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America also welcomed the declaration, saying, ``The \nDeclaration recognizes that TRIPS and patents are part of the solution \nto better public health, not a barrier to access. Without altering the \nexisting rights and obligations under TRIPS, the declaration provides \nassurances that countries may take all measures consistent with the \nagreement to protect the health of their citizens.''\n  I was very pleased with the adoption of this landmark declaration. \nNever before had the World Trade Organization taken such a bold stance \nthat the protection of public health, particularly among the poorest in \nthe world, was paramount. I want to commend U.S. Trade Representative \nRobert Zoellick for the leadership he displayed in ensuring this \ndeclaration's adoption, and WTO Director General Michael Moore for his \ntireless efforts in communicating the message of the declaration across \nthe globe.\n  In order to ensure that the U.S. trade negotiators fully support the \nimplementation of the Doha Declaration in future negotiations, this \namendment adds a single sentence to the section on negotiating \nobjectives for intellectual property issues--``respect the Declaration \non TRIPS and Public Health, as adopted by the World Trade Organization \nat the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha, Qatar on November 14, \n2001.'' This amendment directs our trade negotiations to support the \ndeclaration without reservation.\n  This amendment, as critical as it is to the health of millions around \nthe globe, is merely a small step in addressing this overwhelming \nissue. The United States must play a more active role in fighting these \ndiseases in the developing world. We must contribute significantly more \nto the global AIDS fund at the United Nations. We must do more to help \ndevelop the health service infrastructure in poor countries so they can \ndeliver and administer treatment and prevention programs. We must \nprovide more resources to USAID and private organizations to enhance \nmicro-enterprise efforts, build local economies, and empower \nindividuals so they can take care of themselves.\n  I'm pleased that this amendment can be accepted unanimously, because \nsome issues are too important to be partisan. I want to extend special \nthanks to Senators Baucus and Grassley and their wonderful staffs for \ntheir leadership, and for their willingness to work so closely with me \non this issue. They know we don't always see eye-to-eye on trade \nissues, but they recognize the importance of this issue and I know they \nshare my concerns. I look forward to working closely with them in the \nfuture on this critical issue.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nWorld Trade Organization Ministerial Conference, Fourth Session, Doha, \n                           9-14 November 2001\n\n\n  DECLARATION ON THE TRIPS AGREEMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH--Adopted on 14 \n                             November 2001\n\n       1. We recognize the gravity of the public health problems \n     afflicting many developing and least-developed countries, \n     especially those resulting from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \n     malaria and other epidemics.\n       2. We stress the need for the WTO Agreement on Trade-\n     Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS \n     Agreement) to be part of the wider national and international \n     action to address these problems.\n       3. We recognize that intellectual property protection is \n     important for the development of new medicines. We also \n     recognize the concerns about its effects on prices.\n       4. We agree that the TRIPS Agreement does not and should \n     not prevent Members from taking measures to protect public \n     health. Accordingly, while reiterating our commitment to the \n     TRIPS Agreement, we affirm that the Agreement can and should \n     be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of WTO \n     Members' right to protect public health and, in particular, \n     to promote access to medicines for all.\n       In this connection, we reaffirm the right of WTO Members to \n     use, to the full, the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement, \n     which provide flexibility for this purpose.\n\n[[Page S4324]]\n\n       5. Accordingly and in the light of paragraph 4 above, while \n     maintaining our commitments in the TRIPS Agreement, we \n     recognize that these flexibilities include:\n       (a) In applying the customary rules of interpretation of \n     public international law, each provision of the TRIPS \n     Agreement shall be read in the light of the object and \n     purpose of the Agreement as expressed, in particular, in its \n     objectives and principles.\n       (b) Each Member has the right to grant compulsory licenses \n     and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such \n     licenses are granted.\n       (c) Each Member has the right to determine what constitutes \n     a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme \n     urgency, it being understood that public health crises, \n     including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria \n     and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or \n     other circumstances of extreme urgency.\n       (d) The effect of the provisions in the TRIPS Agreement \n     that are relevant to the exhaustion of intellectual property \n     rights is to leave each Member free to establish its own \n     regime for such exhaustion without challenge, subject to the \n     MFN and national treatment provisions of Articles 3 and 4.\n       6. We recognize that WTO Members with insufficient or no \n     manufacturing capacities in the pharmaceutical sector could \n     face difficulties in making effective use of compulsory \n     licensing under the TRIPS Agreement. We instruct the Council \n     for TRIPS to find an expeditious solution to this problem and \n     to report to the General Council before the end of 2002.\n       7. We reaffirm the commitment of developed-country Members \n     to provide incentives to their enterprises and institutions \n     to promote and encourage technology transfer to least-\n     developed country Members pursuant to Article 66.2. We also \n     agree that the least-developed country Members will not be \n     obliged, with respect to pharmaceutical products, to \n     implement or apply Sections 5 and 7 of Part II of the TRIPS \n     Agreement or to enforce rights provided for under these \n     Sections until 1 January 2016, without prejudice to the right \n     of least-developed country Members to seek other extensions \n     of the transition periods as provided for in Article 66.1 of \n     the TRIPS Agreement. We instruct the Council for TRIPS to \n     take the necessary action to give effect to this pursuant to \n     Article 66.1 of the TRIPS Agreement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is my intention to back the \namendment. This amendment makes an important contribution to the \nunderlying trade promotion authority bill.\n  Before addressing the substance of the amendment, I put it in \ncontext. The Doha ministerial held in Qatar last year was a profound \nbreakthrough for the United States and the World Trade Organization. \nFor the first time in many years, over 130 nations came together to \nlaunch a new round of international trade negotiations. This is no \nsmall achievement, as virtually every action taken during the Doha \nministerial had to be done by consensus. These nations strongly \nbelieved a new round of international trade negotiations was in their \nbest interests. I agree it is in their best interests, and it is in the \nbest interests of the United States. I also think it is in our best \ninterests to get these negotiations underway and give the President the \nauthority he needs to negotiate the best deals for our workers and \nsmall and large businesses.\n  During the WTO ministerial at Doha, the members of the organization \nadopted a political declaration that highlights the provisions in the \nTRIPS agreement that provide members with the flexibility to address \npublic emergencies, such as the epidemics of HIV, tuberculosis, and \nmalaria. The objectives on intellectual property, which are part of \nthis bill, were drafted before completion of the Doha ministerial. \nSenator Kennedy's amendment updates these objectives to take into \naccount the important declaration on public health made at the Doha \nmeeting. It is a good addition to the bill. I am pleased to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I highly compliment the Senator from \nMassachusetts. This is an extremely important statement. Millions of \npeople in the world are suffering from HIV/AIDS, and the current patent \nthe companies have, as important it is, is a measure that should be \nrelaxed so people in many parts of the world get assistance.\n  The amendment recognizes the special declaration concerning public \nhealth that was adopted last November in Doha. The special declaration \nprovided assurance to poor countries facing the immense challenges of \ndealing with public health emergencies caused by pandemics of \ninfectious diseases like HIV/AIDS, that measures necessary to address \nsuch crises in these countries can be accommodated by the WTO TRIPS \nAgreement, the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \nProperty Rights.\n  This assurance complements the numerous commitments that the United \nStates Government, and its public and private sectors have made to help \nthese countries cope with the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  WTO members also used the declaration to reaffirm their commitment to \neffective intellectual property standards such as those in the TRIPS \nAgreement. The declaration recognizes that effective intellectual \nproperty standards serve an important public health objective of \nstimulating development of new drugs.\n  I highly recommend this amendment to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, numbered 3411.\n  The amendment (No. 3411) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader asked me to announce there will be no \nmore rollcall votes today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Allen are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the past several days, we have been \ndebating the merits of granting fast-track trade negotiating authority \nto the President. Today, I would like to illustrate the importance of \nthis measure and that of its companion, Trade adjustment assistance, to \nmy home State of Montana.\n  Montana's role in the global economy is directly linked to our \nsuccess in passing this important trade package. More importantly, if \nmy State is to grow economically, we must secure opportunities beyond \nour borders.\n  Those opportunities represent risk, growth, change, and challenge for \na State that is highly reliant on export markets and highly sensitive \nto imports.\n  Just as the founders of Montana--fur trappers, gold prospectors, \ncattle ranchers, hardrock miners--were driven west in pursuit of trade \nopportunities, so, too, must the citizens of modern Montana seek new \nmarkets. In fact, some would say that our viability in the 21st century \nis contingent upon our ability to expand and compete in the global \nmarketplace.\n  To further this endeavor, we must negotiate responsible trade \nagreements that help Montana workers, business, farmers, ranchers and \nentrepreneurs.\n  At the same time we must recognize some of the problems associated \nwith trade, which include worker dislocation or intensified \ncompetition, must also be addressed.\n  I believe that fast track and trade adjustment assistance are \ncritical to economic growth and strength of Montana. Let me tell you \nwhy.\n  First, Montana exports nearly a half billion dollars in products a \nyear. This includes $260 million in agricultural commodities, $100 \nmillion in industrial machinery, $24 million in chemical products, and \n$37 million in wood and paper products.\n  Second, as a key State in the Rocky Mountain Trade Corridor we are \nexpanding more to Canada and Mexico--our first and second largest \ntrading partners. Respectively, these countries\n\n[[Page S4325]]\n\nimport more than $300 million and $34 million of Montana products with \nChina, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom next in line.\n  With new trade agreements that open markets to Montana products and \nre-adjust some of the current trade inequities, my State's economy \nstands to grow and prosper.\n  Within this same context, the principle trade negotiating objective \nof the fast-track legislation calls on our negotiators to remove \nbarriers that decrease market opportunities for Montana exports or \ndistort imports that put producers at an unfair advantage. These \nbarriers include governmental regulatory measures such as price \ncontrols and reference pricing which deny full market access for United \nStates products.\n  Take, for example, the Canadian Wheat Board. The Government of Canada \ngrants the Canadian Wheat Board special monopoly rights and privileges \nwhich disadvantage U.S. wheat farmers and undermine the integrity of \nthe trading system.\n  These rights insulate producers from commercial risk because the \nCanadian Government guarantees its financial operations, including its \nborrowing, credit sales to foreign buyers, and initial payments to \nfarmers. As a result, the Canadian Wheat Board takes sales from U.S. \nfarmers and prices drop.\n  The negotiating authority granted the President that fast track is \naimed at stopping these unjust trade practices.\n  Some folks say they don't want any new trade agreements until the old \nones are fixed, I like the ring of that, but sometimes it is not \nterribly practical. I say, you can't fix something from the sidelines, \nyou must be at the table. Fast track is a means to that end. If you \nwant to fix an old agreement, clearly the other side is going to want \nto fix the old agreement from its perspective, too. It is never a free \nlunch.\n  The bill also strives to ensure that trade agreements afford small \nbusinesses equal access to international markets, equitable trade \nbenefits, expanded export market opportunities, and provide for the \nreduction or elimination of trade barriers that disproportionately \nimpact small business.\n  Let me illustrate what effective negotiations at the WTO mean for \nMain Street Montana.\n  A company in Bozeman could be able to ship more trailers for mining \nequipment to Latin America.\n  Discussion on pharmaceuticals could help companies like All American \nPharmaceutical in Billings and Technical Sourcing International in \nMissoula.\n  Montana's tech corridor in Bozeman could seek clarification on \nEuropean manufacturing standards for electronics, increasing market \nopportunity for small technology businesses.\n  Aviation firms such as Blue Sky Aviation in Lewistown, Garlick \nHelicopters and Tamarak Helicopters in the Bitteroot Valley could see a \nnormalization in requirements for aviation products.\n  Medical standards could be addressed helping Glacier Cross of \nKalispell enter new markets.\n  And Lawyer Nursery could spend less time fighting phytosanitary \nbarriers and focus more on providing seeds and seedling trees to \ndeveloping nations.\n  The bottom line is that good jobs will be created in Montana if we \nare willing to give our negotiators the strong hand needed to secure \nsound trade agreements.\n  In addition to small business owners, Montana's agricultural industry \nstands to benefit from sound trade agreements. For agriculture, the \ngoal is to obtain competitive opportunities for U.S. exports of \nagricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially equivalent to \nthe competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in U.S. markets.\n  The fast-track bill includes a concrete set of trade objectives for \nagriculture that targets my five key concerns.\n  First, we must reduce tariffs to levels that are the same as or lower \nthan those in the United States. These are the same tariffs that block \nMontana beef exports to Korea and Japan.\n  Second, we must eliminate all export subsidies on agricultural \ncommodities while maintaining bona fide food aid and export credit \nprograms that allow the U.S. to compete with other foreign export \npromotion efforts. As you well know, the EU maintains the lion's share \nof export subsidies--60 times more than the United States. How can we \never expect a level playing field if we are undersold time and again by \ngovernment-backed competitors?\n  Third, we must allow the preservation of programs that support family \nfarms and rural communities but do not distort trade.\n  Currently we are engaged in passing a new farm bill. This bill seeks \nto reflect and respond to the counter-cyclical nature of our farm \neconomy. It strives to limit production through sound conservation \nprograms and maintains trade provisions, including the Export \nEnhancement Program and Market Access Program, which help our products \noverseas.\n  The U.S. exported over $53 billion last year. However, our trade \npolicy will only be effective if the commodity support and conservation \nprograms of the farm bill are balanced. We cannot afford for one leg of \nthe stool to be weaker than the others. Without family farmers, \nincreased trading opportunities are irrelevant.\n  Fourth, we must eliminate state trade enterprises wherever possible. \nMontanans know far too well the effects of competing with the Canadian \nWheat Board. As I mentioned above, we must bring price transparency and \ncompetition to the marketplace. The Canadian Wheat Board is nothing \nclose to that. Anything short of this flies in the face of fair trade.\n  And fifth, we must develop rules to prevent unjustified sanitary or \nphytosanitary restrictions not based on sound science. For three \ndecades we fought to pry open the Chinese market to Pacific Northwest \nwheat due to TCK. That was a real struggle. I spent a lot of time on \nthat. It was difficult to get the Chinese to listen to us. They finally \ncracked open a little bit. Now we are struggling with markets in Chile \nand Russia that place arbitrary sanitary barriers on U.S. exports of \nbeef, pork, and poultry.\n  I will closely monitor any upcoming trade negotiations to ensure that \nthese goals are met. Further, I will not hesitate to call for the \nrepeal of fast-track trading authority or pursuing a resolution to \nlimit fast track, at any time during the process if these objectives \nare not met.\n  Let me share a few more points that make the case for fast track in \nmy State. In order to address and maintain Montana's competitiveness in \nthe global economy, the bill directs the President to preserve the \nability of the U.S. to enforce rigorously its trade laws, including \nantidumping, countervailing duty, and safeguard laws.\n  Montana has benefited from these laws. These laws have been used \nagainst unfair, or a surge in, imports of softwood lumber from Canada \nand lamb from Australia and New Zealand. In addition, our wheat \nindustry is considering launching a case against the Canadian Wheat \nBoard.\n  These laws are not protectionist. Far from it. They simply ensure \nthat Montana workers, agricultural producers, and firms, can compete \nfully on fair terms and enjoy the benefits of reciprocal trade \nconcessions.\n  These laws are designed to help other countries play fair. If all \ncountries played fair, our trade laws would not be necessary. They are \nthere only to help make sure that when other countries are not playing \nby the rules of the road we have ways to protect ourselves against \nunfair foreign trade barriers. All our trade remedy laws, as you know, \nMr. President, are totally WTO legal. They are totally consistent with \nWTO.\n  On a related note, I am often approached about the problem of a \nstrong dollar for commodities and manufacturing. The overvalued dollar \nis certainly a problem, and I do not have the perfect solution today \nthat balances these concerns with Treasury's intent to maintain a \nstrong economy and control inflation.\n  However, within this bill, the administration is directed to work \nwith our trading partners to draw up a blueprint to deal with the trade \nconsequences of significant and unanticipated currency movements and to \nscrutinize whether a foreign government is engaged in a pattern of \nmanipulating its currency to promote a competitive advantage in \ninternational trade.\n\n[[Page S4326]]\n\n  Rest assured, I recognize these concerns, and I believe this is a \nstep toward finding a solution and not an easy one to resolve but \ncertainly a major step forward.\n  In Montana we know the value of preserving our environment while \noptimizing the use of our natural resources. At the same time, we \ncannot afford to compete with shoddy worker and environmental rights.\n  This measure brings that message to the world recognizing that trade \nand environmental policies are mutually supportive: That we should seek \nto protect and preserve the environment and enhance the international \noptions of doing so, while optimizing the use of the world's resources. \nAnd, it promotes respect for worker rights and supports efforts to \ncrack down on the exploitative child labor.\n  This bill is different from past fast-track legislation because it is \nthe first to ever seek provisions that aim to ensure that parties to \nthe agreements not weaken or reduce the protections afforded in their \ndomestic environmental and labor laws as an encouragement for trade. It \nis a first, and major development. It also works to establish rules to \nprevent frivolous investor claims that contravene the public good.\n  I have a few words about part two of this package, the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance program or TAA. This is a program with a simple \nbut admirable objective: to assist workers injured by imports to adjust \nand find new jobs. many Montana workers are now employed and many firms \nstill in business thanks to TAA.\n  Take for example the 221 employees who lost their jobs as a result of \nthe suspension of operations at the ASARCO lead bullion facility in \nEast Helena. It was a bitter blow to that community when that \nannouncement was made. Due to the decline in the mining and mineral \nprocessing industries in the Western U.S., these workers faced few \nprospects for re-employment in a similar sector.\n  Thanks to income support provided by trade adjustment assistance, and \nNAFTA-TAA, 50 percent of these workers are involved in or did seek \ntraining--many at the Helena College of Technology and a few at heavy \nequipment operating school.\n  They are learning everything from trucking to computer technology. \nNow nearly 42 percent have found full-time employment. Workers at Plum \nCreek Timber in Seeley Lake are similarly taking advantage of this \nprogram.\n  TAA is often seen as the last resort, but it also provides a chance \nfor companies to retool. This is especially true of TAA for firms, a \nrelated program that provides assistance to over 10 small companies in \nMontana to help them readjust and effectively compete with imports.\n  With TAA for firms, Montola Growers is researching new markets for \nits safflower oil, Tele-Tech Corporation is designing new products and \nprint ads for its sophisticated electronic devises, Thirteen Mile Lamb \nand Wool Company is designing new garments for manufacture by contract \nknitters, and Pyramid Lumber is improving its milling efficiency.\n  Without TAA for firms, we would see closed signs on many business \ndoors. Unfortunately, more worthy projects exist than funding to \nsupport them. For that reason, I support significantly increased \nfunding in order for this program to continue and expand its good work.\n  Additionally, this trade adjustment assistance bill includes a new \nprovision that will offer up to $10,000 in cash assistance to Montana \nfarmers and ranchers injured by imports. Let me be clear, this is a \nreal opportunity to retool and reform a family farming operation, to \nmake it competitive and sound, for generations to come. Like trade \nadjustment assistance for firms, this program is a means to keep an \noperation in business and keep our Montana families on their land.\n  One final item tucked neatly away in the TAA title is a provision to \nprotect Montana sugarbeet growers from unfair trade practices. We all \nrecall the black eye that stuffed molasses gave the industry, and we \ncan not afford to suffer from such blatant circumvention again. This \nprovision allows the Secretary of Agriculture to monitor imports of \nsugar to ensure that they do not circumvent the existing quota.\n  If they do, the Secretary will report to the President who can then \n``snap-back'' the offending commodity into the appropriate tariff line. \nThis should send a clear message that America will no longer tolerate \nefforts to manipulate the trading system to the disadvantage of our \nsugar producers.\n  The trade package before us today will help Montana move toward a \ngreater role in the global economy. I hope my colleagues will feel the \nsame about their own constituencies and lend their support to this \nimportant matter.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for listening. I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of us have anticipated the trip of \nformer President Carter to Cuba with a mixed sense of hope and concern. \nWe had hoped that he would use this unique opportunity to help bring \nideas of freedom and democracy to the repressed people of Cuba, just 90 \nmiles off our shores.\n  However, it was amazing and disappointing for many of us to learn of \nMr. Carter's visit to a Cuban biotechnology facility and his \nacceptance, at face value, of the assurances of communist Cuban \nofficials there that the facility is engaged solely in medical and \nhumanitarian pursuits.\n  More distressing is that former President Jimmy Carter was accorded \nthe same privilege and courtesy extended to former Presidents who have \nrequested top-secret intelligence briefings and situation reports on \nglobal areas of interest of the United States.\n  In the post-9/11 world, it is important that we as a united country \nprotect the safety and security of our people.\n  Instead, what we have in Mr. Carter's visit to this biotech facility \nis a former President--who himself was once responsible for our foreign \npolicy and the safety of the American people--dismissing the concerns \nof his own government, revealing information to which he was privy in \ntop-secret briefings, and buying wholesale the assertions of the \ndictator Fidel Castro and his minions.\n  The words and actions of Mr. Carter at this facility are a breach of \ntrust, and it is made even worse, in that the individual involved in \nthat breach is one in whom the American people once placed the ultimate \ntrust and responsibility of the Presidency.\n  Rather than spending his time with Fidel Castro and his henceman, I \nwould suggest the name of at least one person Mr. Carter would be \nbetter advised to get to know.\n  Just a few short days ago I joined the Congressional Cuba Political \nPrisoner Initiative. As part of this initiative, I have decided to \nsponsor or ``adopt,'' if you will, a Cuban political prisoner named \nFrancisco Chaviano Gonzales, and to advocate on his behalf, and on \nbehalf of the thousands of others being held in Cuba in clear abuses of \ntheir basic human rights.\n  Francisco Chaviano is president of the National Council for Civil \nRights, an organization dedicated to promoting democratic practices, \nracial equality and human rights. He was arrested after government \nagents broke into his home and confiscated documents revealing human \nrights abuses in Cuba--specifically, information about the Castro \ngovernment's sinking of a tugboat that claimed the lives of 41 men, \nwomen, and children who were attempting to escape to freedom.\n  Chaviano was arrested and detained in prison for 1 year, and although \na civilian, he was tried by military tribunal and sentenced to 15 years \nin prison.\n\n[[Page S4327]]\n\n  He has been confined in isolation and deprived of basic medical care \nfor long periods of time. After being allowed to visit him for the \nfirst time in eight years, his wife reported that he is in very poor \nhealth. Other members of the civil rights organization have followed in \nChaviano's footsteps and continued to press the Cuban government for \ndemocratic reforms, at great peril to themselves.\n  Jimmy Carter is a man who is often praised in the media as a ``model \nex-President'' or a ``statesman'' for his work with Habitat for \nHumanity. I do believe there is still time for him to make a more \npositive contribution to the plight of the Cuban people and to American \nforeign policy regarding Fidel Castro.\n  Mr. Carter is scheduled to deliver a speech to the Cuban people \ntonight. His remarks have the potential to do enormous good or to cause \nfurther harm. Rather than legitimizing a tyrant and a man who doesn't \ncare for the well-being of his own people; he could advocate positive \nchange for the beleaguered Cuban people.\n  If Mr. Carter in his speech tonight is looking for a road map to \nfreedom and prosperity for the Cuban people, he need look no further \nthan the words and principles of freedom written by George Mason in the \nVirginia Declaration of Rights. This document, adopted on June 12, \n1776, helped form the basis of our Declaration of Independence and 15 \nyears later in our Bill of Rights as the first amendments to our \nConstitution.\n  I would read a few excerpts from George Mason's historic words from \nvarious articles of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, which I think \nare instructive.\n\n       Article 1: That all men are by nature equally free and \n     independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when \n     they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any \n     compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the \n     enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring \n     and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness \n     and safety.\n       Article 2: That all power is vested in, and consequently \n     derived from, the people; that magistrates are their trustees \n     and servants and at all times amenable to them.\n       Article 3: That government is, our ought to be, instituted \n     for the common benefit, protection, and security of the \n     people, nation, or community; of all the various modes and \n     forms of government, that is best which is capable of \n     producing the greatest degree of happiness and safety and is \n     most effectually secured against the danger of \n     maladministration. And that, when any government shall be \n     found inadequate or contrary to these purposes, a majority of \n     the community has an indubitable, inalienable, and \n     indefeasible right to reform, alter, or abolish it, in such \n     manner as shall be judged most conductive to the public weal.\n       Article 12: That the freedom of the press is one of the \n     great bulwalks of liberty, and can never be restrained but by \n     despotic governments.\n       Article 16: That religion, or the duty which we owe to our \n     Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed \n     only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence; and \n     therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise \n     of religion, according to the dictates of conscience . . .\n\n  Those are the words of freedom, and of the inherent rights to which \nall people are entitled, even if only temporarily subjugated.\n  Therefore, I call on former President Carter to embrace these truths \nand to use this unique opportunity to advance these enduring principles \nof liberty in Cuba.\n  I urge him to support the Varela Project, which is a petition drive \nthat has collected the 10,000 signatures needed under Castro's so-\ncalled ``constitution'' to force a referendum on whether his government \nshould be allowed to continue.\n  I call on Fidel Castro to heed the concepts first enunciated by \nGeorge Mason 226 years ago in the Western Hemisphere, and I also call \nupon him to schedule free and fair democratic elections on the island \nof Cuba within the next year.\n  Mr. President, I will close with more words from George Mason, who \nsaid:\n\n       There is a passion to the mind of man, especially a free \n     man, which renders him impatient of a restraint.''\n\n  Mr. Carter has the power to either to fan the flames of those \npassions and aspirations of the Cuban people, or to throw cold water on \nthem. The choice he needs to make is clear. Do not flinch. Stand strong \nfor freedom!\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4327-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred April 3, 1991 \nin Boston, MA. A Northeastern University student was arrested for \nmaking anti-Semitic and anti-homosexual death threats. The student, \nGarrett McAdams, was accused of threatening to kill a Jewish Realtor \nand bomb the offices of a gay student organization.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4327-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, each day our Nation's law enforcement \nofficers step onto the street, putting their lives on the line to \nprotect our communities. These honorable men and women risk so much so \nthat others can feel safe.\n  New Yorkers owe our State and local law enforcement officers an \nenormous debt of gratitude. The historic drop in crime that we have \nseen in the last few years is truly a reflection of their fine work and \ntireless dedication. The low-crime rate that New York City enjoys today \nwould never have been possible without the extraordinary work of the \nNew York City Police Department.\n  One small step we can take to begin to repay that debt is ensuring \nthat our men and women in blue are equipped with the tools they need to \nprotect themselves from the constant dangers they face; and that police \ndepartments around the country have the additional resources they need \nmeet new demands placed on them.\n  In the past several months, their responsibility have only grown \nlarger. From the first moments our country saw NYPD officers at the \nbase of the World Trade Center towers, the role of police officers \naround the country was changed forever. The September 11 terrorist \nattacks put communities around America on the frontlines in our war \nagainst terrorism at home, and our local public safety officers must \nnow be prepared for the unimaginable: biological and terrorist attacks.\n  We pay tribute to the hard work and sacrifice of our police officers \nnot just this week but every day of our lives as we move freely about \nour communities, largely uninhibited by fear and danger. We should take \na moment to recognize the peace of mind that our local law enforcement \nofficers provides us, and life's precious gifts that come with that \nassurance.\n  Public service is one of our country's most noble callings and law \nenforcement captures that spirit of sacrifice and devotion to \ncommunity. We thank the families of police officers for their ever \npresent courage and selflessness. To the police officers who uphold our \nlaws and protect our communities from crime, we give our appreciation, \nadmiration and immeasurable pride for the jobs you do every day.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4328-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4328]]\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HARRISON WILLIAMS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, last November when our former \ncolleague Harrison Williams passed away, I don't believe his \nlegislative accomplishments were recognized by this body, and I wanted \nto remember my friend, the enormously popular Senator from New Jersey.\n  I had the privilege to serve with him for 15 of his 23 years, and he \nachieved more than most people will ever realize because he worked the \nold-fashioned way: making headway, not headlines. He sponsored \nprogressive legislation that with 30 or 40 years hindsight, we now see \nhas made an incredible difference in millions of people's lives.\n  The good mass transit systems we have in our Nation today we have \nbecause Pete was mass transit's champion. Americans have the best \nsafety and environmental working conditions in the world because he \ncreated the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. We have \npension protections because of him. We have greater accessibility for \nthe handicapped because of him. Anything related to worker's rights, or \nworking conditions, he had his hand in.\n  Like all of us he was not perfect, and he paid a price. But this \nSenator will remember my friend for his legislative accomplishments, \nand believes the words he said himself when he left this Chamber: That \ntime, history and Almighty God would vindicate him for the principles \nfor which he fought.\n  My wife, Peatsy, and I know how much his wife, Jeanette, and his four \nchildren, miss him, and we hope the best for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4328-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MORRISTOWN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\n\n Mr. CORZINE.

This prestigious award recognizes outstanding commitment to \nimproving community-based health care.\n  The NOVA award honors Morristown's TeenHealthFX.com program, a free \ninteractive Web site, providing teenagers with confidential and \nanonymous answers for difficult-to-ask health questions. This \ninnovative program has succeeded at breaking down many of the barriers \nthat so often prevent teens from obtaining critical health care \ninformation. Created in 1999, through the collaborative efforts of \ncommunity leaders, teen, and health care professionals, this site has \nserved as a gateway to area health care providers and a source of \nhealth care information for more than 100,000 young visitors.\n  I want to thank Morristown Hospital for supporting such an important \nand effective program. It is not enough to simply make health \ninformation available to our young people. That information needs to be \nmade available in a setting that is comfortable for teenagers to \naccess. This is exactly the environment that TeenHealthFX.com has \ncreated in New Jersey. TeenHealthFX.com represents the type of creative \nthinking and collaboration that our communities must undertake if we \nare going to improve the health and health habits of teenagers and \nyoung adults. Again, congratulations to Morristown Hospital and thank \nyou for your continued commitment to improving health care for all New \nJerseyans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4328-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrent of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4546.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to accept \nthe donation of certain lands previously disposed of from the public \ndomain, together with certain mineral rights on federal land, in the \nMineral Hill-Crevice Mountain Mining District in the State of Montana, \nto be returned to the United States for management as part of the \nnational public lands and forests, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the introduction \nof the Mineral Hill Historic Mining District Preservation Act of 2002. \nThe purpose of this act is for the Forest Service to accept a donation \nfrom TVX Mineral Hill, Inc., an inholding of approximately 570 acres of \nprivate land in the Gallatin National Forest. This inholding overlooks \nthe northern entrance of Yellowstone National Park and is within well-\nknown elk habitat. The donation also includes 194 acres of mineral \nrights underlying Federal lands.\n  This bill provides a win-win situation with benefits for the \ncommunity, for wildlife, for the company, and for the environment. \nAfter a rich and storied history, the Mineral Hill Mine is played out \nand the opportunity to extract minerals has passed. The property is in \nvery good condition and is being reclaimed in accordance with a \nreclamation plan approved by the Montana Department of Environmental \nQuality. The Forest Service has been closely involved during the \nreclamation planning and implementation processes to make certain that \nthe property will remain in the excellent environmental state it is in \ntoday. As an added guarantee, the United States will also be the \nbeneficiary of a $10 million insurance policy provided by TVX to clean \nup the site in the unlikely event that hazardous materials are \ndiscovered in the future.\n  The Mineral Hill Mine is located in the historic Jardine Mining \nDistrict which was established during the 1860s. Many of the buildings \nat the site go back to that time period. Some of the buildings will be \npreserved for interpretation purposes and will be available to the \npublic. In addition, the site will be used in cooperation with Montana \nTech of the University of Montana for mining and geologic education. \nThe Mineral Hill property is being donated by TVX to the Government \nwithout the necessity of a payment. There will be ongoing permits \nissued by the State of Montana and by EPA for monitoring of water \ndischarge. This bill allows for those permits to be upheld and for the \nwater processes to be maintained. In a letter to my office dated June \n25, 2001, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition observed that ``we believe \nthat there would be no adverse impact to the agency and indeed would be \na benefit to the public that this donated land is conveyed with the \nobligation to maintain the NPDES permit already in force.'' This is \nexactly what the bill provides in section 11.\n  I am pleased to say that this is a bill with the support of all key \nparties. The Forest Service has agreed to the transfer and management \nof the land and has been actively involved in this process. The \nGardiner Chamber of Commerce supports the project, as do the \nCommissioners of Park County. The Greater Yellowstone Coalition also \nsupports the donation. Simply put, this legislation is in the public \ninterest. On behalf of the people of Montana, I look forward to its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mrs. Clinton)\n  S. 2513. A bill to assess the extent of the backlog in DNA analysis \nof rape kit samples, and to improve investigation and prosecution of \nsexual assault cases with DNA evidence; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the DNA Sexual \nAssault Justice Act of 2002, a bill that guarantees prompt justice to \nvictims of sexual assault crimes through DNA technology. 99.9 percent, \nthat is how accurate DNA evidence is. 1 in 30 billion, those are the \nodds someone else committed a crime if a suspect's DNA matches evidence \nat the crime scene. 20 or 30 years, that is how long DNA evidence from \na crime scene lasts.\n\n[[Page S4332]]\n\n  Just 10 years ago DNA analysis of evidence could have cost thousands \nof dollars and taken months, now testing one sample costs $40 and can \ntake days. Ten years ago forensic scientists needed blood the size of a \nbottle cap, now DNA testing can be done on a sample the size of a \npinhead. The changes in DNA technology are remarkable, and mark a sea \nchange in how we can fight crime, particularly sexual assault crimes. \nThe FBI tells us that since 1998 the national DNA database has helped \nput away violent criminals in 4,179 investigations in 32 states. How? \nBy matching the DNA crime evidence to the DNA profiles of offenders. \nIndividual success stories of DNA ``cold hits'' in sexual assault cases \nmakes these numbers all too real.\n  For instance, in Florida, Kellie Green was brutally attached and \nraped in the laundry room of her apartment complex. Because of lack of \nfunds, her rape kit sat on the shelf for three years until a persistent \ndetective had it analyzed. The evidence matched the profile of a man \nalready incarcerated for beating and raping a women 6 weeks before \nKellie. Or take for example a 1996 case in St. Louis where two young \ngirls were abducted from bus stops and raped at opposite ends of the \ncity. The police were unable to identify a suspect. In 1999, the police \ndecided to re-run the DNA testing to develop new leads. In January \n2000, the DNA database matched the 1996 case to a 1999 rape case, and \npolice where able to identify the perpetrator.\n  Just days ago, the New York Police Department arrested a man linked \nto the rape of a woman four years ago. In 1997, a woman was horribly \nbeaten, robbed and raped, there were no suspects. Several months \nago,the perpetrator submitted a DNA sample as a condition of probation \nafter serving time for burglary. That DNA sample matched the DNA from \nthe 1997 rape. Crime solved, streets safer.\n  Undoubtedly, DNA matching by comparing evidence gathered at the crime \nscene with offender samples entered on the national DNA database has \nproven to be the deciding factor in solving stranger sexual assault \ncases, it has revolutionized the criminal justice system, and brought \nclosure and justice for victims.\n  In light of the past successes and the future potential of DNA \nevidence, the reports about the backlog of untested rape kits and other \ncrime scene waiting in police warehouses are simply shocking.\n  Today I am introducing legislation, ``The DNA Sexual Assault Justice \nAct of 2002'', to strengthen the existing Federal DNA regime as an \neffective crime fighting tool. My bill addresses five, pressing issues.\n  First, exactly how bad is the backlog of untested rape kits \nnationwide? A 1999 government report found over 180,000 rape kits were \nsitting, untested, on the storage shelves of police department and \nlaboratories all across the country. While recent press reports \nestimate that the number today is approaching 500,000 untested rape \nkits, I am told that there is no current, accurate numbers of the \nbacklog. Behind every single one of those rape kits is a victim who \ndeserves recognition and justice. Accordingly, my legislation would \nrequire the Attorney General to survey every single law enforcement \nagency in the country to assess the extent of the backlog of rape kits \nwaiting to undergo DNA testing. To combat the problem of rape kit \nbacklogs, it is imperative to know the real numbers, and how best to \nutilize federal resources.\n  Second, how can existing Federal law be strengthened to make sure \nthat State crime labs have the funds for the critical DNA analysis \nneeded to solve sex assault cases? To fight crime most effectively, we \nmust both test rape kits and enter convicted offender DNA samples into \nthe DNA database. There has been explosive growth in the use of \nforensic sciences by law enforcement. A government survey found that in \n2000 alone, crime labs received 31,000 cases, a 47 percent increase \nfrom almost 21,000 cases in 1999. In addition, the labs received \n177,000 convicted offender DNA samples, an almost 77 percent increase \nfrom 100,242 samples in 1999.\n  All across the country, laboratories report personnel shortages in \nthe face of this overwhelming work. According to this same government \nsurvey, on average,there are 6 employees in a state crime lab--a lab \nthat must not only do test DNA for hundreds of cases, but also run \nforensic tests on blood, footprints or ballistic evidence. The bill I'm \nintroducing would: 1. increase current funding levels to both test rape \nkits and to process and upload offender samples; and 2. allow local \ngovernments to apply directly to the Justice Department for these \ngrants. I thank my colleagues, Senators Kohl and DeWine, who began this \neffort with the DNA Backlog Elimination At of 2000.\n  Third, what assistance does the FBI need to keep up with the crushing \nnumber of DNA samples which need to be tested or stored in the national \ndatabase? I am told that the current national DNA database, known as \nthe Combined DNA Index, or ``CODIS'', is nearing capacity of convicted \noffender DNA samples. My bill would provide funds to the FBI to 1. \nUpgrade the national DNA computer database to handle the huge \nprojections of samples; and 2. process and upload Federal convicted \noffender DNA samples into the database. Efforts to include more Federal \nand State convicted offenders in our database just makes plain sense to \nfight crime. We know that sexual assault is a crime with one of the \nhighest rates of recidivism, and that many sexual assault crimes are \ncommitted by those with past convictions for other kinds of crime. \nTheir DNA samples from prior convictions help law enforcement efforts \nenormously.\n  Fourth, what additional tools are needed to help treat victims of \nsexual assault? One group that understands the importance of gathering \ncredible DNA evidence are forensic sexual assault nurse examiners, who \nare sensitive to the trauma of this horrible crime and make sure that \npatients are not revictimized in the aftermath. These programs should \nbe in each and every emergency room and play an integral role in police \ndepartments, bridging the gap between the law and the medicine.\n  Likewise, tapping the power of DNA requires well-trained law \nenforcement who know how to collect and preserve DNA evidence from the \ncrime scene. Training should be a matter of course for all law \nenforcement. No rape kit evidence will lead to the perpetrator if the \nDNA evidence is collected improperly. The DNA Sexual Assault Justice \nAct would create a new grant program to carry out sexual assault \nexaminer programs and training. And it would train law enforcement \npersonnel in the handling of sexual assault cases, including drug-\nfacilitated assaults, and the collection and use of DNA samples for use \nas forensic evidence.\n  Fifth, what can be done to ensure that sexual assault offenders who \ncannot be identified by their victim are nevertheless brought to \njustice? Profound injustice is done to rape victims when delayed DNA \ntesting leads to a ``cold hit'' after the statute of limitations has \nexpired. For example, Jeri Elster was brutally raped in her California \nhome, and for years the police were unable to solve the crime. Seven \nyears later, DNA from the rape matched a man in jail for an unrelated \ncrime. Yet the rapist was never charged, convicted, or sentenced \nbecause California's statute of limitations had expired the previous \nyear.\n  The DNA Sexual Assault Justice Act of 2000 would change current law \nto authorize Federal ``John Doe/DNA indictments'' that will permit \nFederal prosecutors to issue an indictment identifying an unknown \ndefendant by his DNA profile within the 5-year statute of limitations. \nOnce outstanding, the DNA indictment would permit prosecution at \nanytime once there was a DNA ``cold hit'' through the national DNA \ndatabase system.\n  John De/DNA indictments strike the right balance between encouraging \nswift and efficient investigations, recognizing the durability and \ncredibility of DNA evidence and preventing an injustice if a cold hit \nhappens years after the crime. The law must catch up with the \ntechnology. I started looking at this issue almost two decades ago when \nI began drafting the Violence Against Women Act. In fact, it is the \nViolence Against Women Act that provided the first funding to sexual \nassault nurse examiner programs. The DNA Sexual\n\n[[Page S4333]]\n\nJustice Act of 2000 is the next step, a way to connect the dots between \nthe extraordinary strides in DNA technology and my commitment to ending \nviolence against women. We must ensure that justice delayed is not \njustice denied.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S.J. Res. 37. A joint resolution providing for congressional \ndisapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule \nsubmitted by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services relating to modification of the \nmedicaid upper payment limit for non-State government owned or operated \nhospitals published in the Federal Register on January 18, 2002, and \nsubmitted to the Senate on March 15, 2002; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Resolution of \nDisapproval to reverse a rule submitted by the Center for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS. The rule, which takes effect today, lowers the \nMedicaid Upper Payment Limit for non-State government owned or operated \nhospitals. It reduces the Federal Medicaid match, or Medicaid Upper \nPayment Limit, from 150 percent of the Medicare rate to 100 percent. \nAccording to the administration's budget, the rule will cut $9 billion \nover 5 years, money currently targeted to public hospitals and other \n``safety net'' health programs, the most vulnerable sector of our \nhealth care system. At a time when Medicaid programs in the States are \nstruggling, we simply can't afford to take this amount from our health \ncare safety net. Too many people will be hurt.\n  The regulation will mean a loss of about $30 million for Minnesota's \npublic health care system this year, potentially more in future years. \nHennepin County Medical Center alone stands to lose about $10 million \nthis year. This is a hospital that provides essential health care for \nthousands of Minnesotans. For many, it is the only place they can go. \nOther hospitals and clinics around Minnesota will also be deprived of \nneeded funding. At a time when our health care system, and particularly \nour public hospitals are struggling just to survive, we ought not to be \ntaking resources away from them like this.\n  CMS Director Scully has attempted to justify this damaging reduction \nby pointing to instances in the past when States did not use the \nprogram's money for health care purposes. Director Scully is certainly \ncorrect. The program should be used for health care, not for anything \nelse. But slashing the Upper Payment Limit means that none of this \nmoney goes to health care. That doesn't make any sense. The loopholes \nthat existed in the program have already been closed. The rule is a $9 \nbillion transfer away from those who desperately need health care, \npurportedly in order to solve a problem, but the problem has already \nbeen fixed. The rule is not needed and will cause great harm. I urge \ncolleagues to support this resolution of disapproval.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4333-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4333-S4334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 267--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n     POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE 54TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE \n                    INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \nFitzgerald, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 267\n\n       Whereas whales have very low reproductive rates, making \n     whale populations extremely vulnerable to pressure from \n     commercial whaling;\n       Whereas whales migrate throughout the world's oceans and \n     international cooperation is required to successfully \n     conserve and protect whale stocks;\n       Whereas in 1946 the nations of the world adopted the \n     International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which \n     established the International Whaling Commission to provide \n     for the proper conservation of whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission adopted a moratorium on commercial \n     whaling in 1982 in order to conserve and promote the recovery \n     of whale stocks;\n       Whereas the Commission has designated the Indian Ocean and \n     the ocean waters around Antarctica as whale sanctuaries to \n     further enhance the recovery of whale stocks;\n       Whereas many nations of the world have designated waters \n     under their jurisdiction as whale sanctuaries where \n     commercial whaling is prohibited, and additional regional \n     whale sanctuaries have been proposed by nations that are \n     members of the Commission;\n       Whereas two member nations currently have reservations to \n     the Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling and 1 \n     member nation is currently conducting commercial whaling \n     operations in spite of the moratorium and the protests of \n     other nations;\n       Whereas a nonmember nation that opposes the moratorium \n     against commercial whaling is seeking to joint the \n     Convention, on the condition that it be exempt from the \n     moratorium;\n       Whereas the Commission has adopted several resolutions at \n     recent meetings asking member nations to halt commercial \n     whaling activities conducted under reservation to the \n     moratorium and to refrain from issuing special permits for \n     research involving the killing of whales and other cetaceans;\n       Whereas 1 member nation of the Commission has taken a \n     reservation to the Commission's Southern Ocean Sanctuary and \n     also continues to conduct unnecessary lethal Scientific \n     whaling in the Southern Ocean and in the North Pacific \n     Ocean;\n       Whereas the Commission's Scientific Committee has \n     repeatedly expressed serious concerns about the scientific \n     need for such lethal research;\n       Whereas one member nation in the past unsuccessfully sought \n     an exemption allowing commercial whaling of up to 50 minke \n     whales, in order to provide economic assistance to specific \n     vessels, now seeks a scientific permit for these same vessels \n     to take 50 minke whales;\n       Whereas the lethal take of whales under scientific permits \n     has increased both in quantity and species, with species now \n     including minke, Bryde's, and sperm whales, and new proposals \n     have been offered to include sei whales for the first time;\n       Whereas there continue to be indications that whale meat is \n     being traded on the international market despite a ban on \n     such trade under the Convention on International Trade in \n     Endangered Species, and that meat may be originating in one \n     of the member nations of the Commission; and\n       Whereas engaging in commercial whaling under reservation \n     and lethal scientific whaling undermines the conservation \n     program of the Commission. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) at the 54th Annual Meeting of the International Whaling \n     Commission the United States should--\n       (A) remain firmly opposed to commercial whaling;\n       (B) initiate and support efforts to ensure that all \n     activities conducted under reservations to the Commission's \n     moratorium or sanctuaries are ceased;\n       (C) oppose the proposal to allow a non-member country to \n     join the convention with a reservation that exempts it from \n     the moratorium against commercial whaling:\n       (D) oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \n     purposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized \n     by the Scientific Committee of the Commission;\n       (E) seek the Commission's support for specific efforts by \n     member nations to end illegal trade in whale meat; and\n       (F) support the permanent protection of whale populations \n     through the establishment of whale sanctuaries in which \n     commercial whaling is prohibited;\n       (2) at the 12th Conference of the Parties to the Convention \n     on International Trade in Endangered Species, the United \n     States should oppose all efforts to reopen international \n     trade in whale meat or downlist any whale population;\n       (3) the United States should make full use of all \n     appropriate diplomatic mechanisms, relevant international \n     laws and agreements, and other appropriate mechanisms to \n     implement the goals set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2); and\n       (4) if the Secretary of Commerce certifies to the \n     President, under section 8(a)(2) of the Fishermen's \n     Protective Act of 1967 (22 U.S.C. 1978(a)(2)), that nationals \n     of a foreign country are engaging in trade or a taking which \n     diminishes the effectiveness of the Convention, then the \n     United States should take appropriate steps at its disposal \n     pursuant to Federal law to convince such foreign country to \n     cease such trade or taking.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Oceans, Atmosphere and \nFisheries Subcommittee, I rise today to submit a resolution regarding \nthe policy of the United States at the upcoming 54th Annual Meeting of \nthe International Whaling Commission, IWC. I wish to thank the Ranking\n\n[[Page S4334]]\n\nMember of the Subcommittee, Ms. Snowe, for co-sponsoring this \nresolution. I wish to also thank my colleagues Mr. Hollings, Mr. \nMcCain, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, \nMr. Torricelli, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Boxer and Mr. Kennedy for \nco-sponsoring as well.\n  The IWC will meet in Japan from May 20 to 24, 2002. Despite an IWC \nmoratorium on commercial whaling since 1985, Japan and Norway have \nharvested over 1000 minke whales since the moratorium was put in place. \nWhales are already under enormous pressure world-wide from collisions \nwith ships, entanglement in fishing gear, coastal pollution, noise \nemanating from surface vessels and other sources. The need to conserve \nand protect these magnificent mammals is clear.\n  The IWC was formed in 1946 under the International Convention for the \nRegulation of Whaling, Convention, in recognition of the fact that \nwhales are highly migratory and that they do not belong to any one \nNation. In 1982, the IWC agreed on an indefinite moratorium on all \ncommercial whaling beginning in 1985. Unfortunately, Japan has been \nusing a loophole that allows countries to issue themselves special \npermits for whaling under scientific purposes. The IWC Scientific \nCommittee has not requested any of the information obtained by killing \nthese whales and has stated that Japan's scientific whaling data is not \nrequired for management. At this meeting, Japan intends to propose to \nadd an additional 100 whales to the whales it kills for scientific \npurposes. Japan's claim that it needs these whales for scientific \npurposes is ever more tenuous: last year, Japan unsuccessfully sought \nto obtain an exemption allowing 50 whales to be commercially hunted to \nprovide economic assistance to specific vessels. This year, Japan is \nseeking to use these same vessels to kill the same number of whales, in \nthe name of ``science.'' The additional 50 whales include new species, \nsei whales. Norway, on the other hand, objects to the moratorium on \nwhaling and openly pursues a commercial fishery for whales. Iceland, \ncurrently a nonparty, is proposing to join the Convention, but only if \nit is granted a reservation that exempts it from the ban on commercial \nwhaling.\n  This resolution calls for the U.S. delegation to the IWC to remain \nfirmly opposed to commercial whaling. In addition, this resolution \ncalls for the U.S. to oppose the lethal taking of whales for scientific \npurposes unless such lethal taking is specifically authorized by the \nScientific Committee of the Commission.

The resolution calls for the U.S. delegation to support an end \nto the illegal trade of whale meat and to support the permanent \nprotection of whale populations through the establishment of whale \nsanctuaries in which commercial whaling is prohibited.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4334-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 269--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR LEGISLATION TO STRENGTHEN \n  AND IMPROVE MEDICARE IN ORDER TO ENSURE COMPREHENSIVE BENEFITS FOR \n      CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES, INCLUDING ACCESS TO A MEDICARE \n                       PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                              S. Res. 269\n\n       Whereas our nation's senior citizens and the disabled need \n     and deserve the highest quality health care available;\n       Whereas the Medicare program has not fundamentally changed \n     since its creation over 35 years ago and has not kept pace \n     with recent improvements in health care delivery;\n       Whereas the Medicare Trustees report that the current \n     system is not sustainable;\n       Whereas Medicare only provides limited access to many \n     lifesaving and health enhancing pharmaceutical and biological \n     medicines;\n       Whereas America's seniors need a comprehensive, voluntary \n     outpatient prescription drug program under Medicare; and\n       Whereas Medicare prescription drug coverage can best be \n     provided through comprehensive steps to modernize and \n     strengthen the Medicare program: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) by September 30, 2002, the Senate should consider \n     legislation to comprehensively modernize the Medicare program \n     under which beneficiaries will be offered more choices, \n     including outpatient prescription drug coverage;\n       (2) this legislation should ensure that the Medicare \n     program's financial solvency is preserved and protected;\n       (3) this legislation should permit beneficiaries to choose \n     from a variety of coverage options, including an option to \n     continue benefits under the current plan as well as an option \n     to choose from benefits offered by multiple competing, \n     private insurance plans that rely on competition to control \n     costs and improve quality; and\n       (4) this legislation should provide at least one option \n     providing comprehensive outpatient prescription drug coverage \n     to Medicare beneficiaries, including those having high \n     prescription drug costs.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution expressing support for Medicare Reform and the \naddition of a prescription drug benefit. I am pleased that Senator Thad \nCochran and Senator James Inhofe are joining with me in this effort \ntoday.\n  The Medicare program is of vital importance to our Nation's seniors \nand has been providing them dependable, affordable and high quality \nhealth care for over 35 years. Despite this, I think we would all agree \nthat the system has not kept pace with modern medicine or coverage \navailable to those covered by private insurance. The practice of \nmedicine has changed dramatically since the inception of the Medicare \nprogram. The many new technologies and drugs that are available to our \nseniors today weren't even an option 35 years ago.\n  No senior should have to worry about whether he or she can afford the \nmedicine they need to stay healthy. I am well aware that the rising \ncost of prescription medicine and prescription drug coverage is a great \nconcern for today's seniors and tomorrow's retires. Indeed, in some \ncases, prescription drugs are as important as a doctor's care. It is \nthis reality that makes it so critical we focus our efforts on finding \na solution.\n  As discussion continues, it is crucial we develop effective options \nfor simultaneously modernizing and securing Medicare. We can not afford \nto add an expensive new comprehensive benefit without real reform to \nthe program and we need to focus our attention on the necessary steps \nto ensure Medicare remains dependable and up to date.\n  This is why I am choosing to submit this Sense of the Senate \nResolution expressing support for a prescription drug benefit and \nMedicare modernization. I am calling on the Senate to work to pass \nlegislation on this issue before September 30, 2002 and to give current \nand future seniors the benefits they deserve. Included in this \nresolution are principles that I believe should be included in any \nMedicare or prescription drug legislation that passes this year. I hope \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting these principles and working \ntowards the goal of passing substantial Medicare reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4334-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3408.

Mr. President, we worked hard today. There were some good \ndebates. There are Senators who have a lot of amendments they say they \nwant to offer, and we need to move on those as quickly as we can. We \nask Senators to be aware of what is going on in the\n\n[[Page S4337]]\n\nChamber and to be ready at any given time to come and offer their \namendments. The majority leader has indicated he wants this debate to \nproceed on this bill in the form of amendments being offered, but I \nthink there will come a time when we are going to have to move on. I do \nnot know if that means he would have to file a motion to invoke \ncloture, but I would assume so. So I hope Senators will realize they \nhave a finite amount of time to offer amendments and we should move \nforward on these as quickly as possible because for people who wait for \na day that may be more convenient to them, that day may be too late.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/14/senate-section/article/S4337-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
