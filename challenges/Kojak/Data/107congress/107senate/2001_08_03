Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 disaster funding for the klamath basin\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, for \nthis opportunity to speak on the drought funding and legislative needs \nfor the Klamath Basin in southern Oregon.\n  I understand that the bill currently being considered, the Emergency \nAgriculture Assistance Act of 2001, is primarily a bill to provide \nmoney for farmers suffering market loss this year. A market loss, as I \nunderstand it, happens when a farmer receives less money for his crop \nthan he spent to produce it. But, due to drought, my constituents were \nunable to plant their crops.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate your understanding that there is a \ndifference between the economic-based problems we are trying to address \nin the current bill and natural disaster related relief in an emergency \nor supplemental funding bill later this year, once we know the full \nextent of nature's toll on agriculture this season. However, the \nSupplemental Appropriations Act of 2001 provided $20,000,000 for farmer \nfamilies in the Klamath. How much additional money will the farmers in \nthe basin be needing?\n  Mr. WYDEN. In the Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2001 Congress \nprovided $20,000,000 in emergency money for farmer families in the \nKlamath. This amount was designed only to keep these farms afloat until \nfurther monetary assistance could be found or until the drought ended.\n  According to the Klamath Basin Water Users Association, this drought \nwill cost the Klamath Basin agricultural community at least $200 \nmillion above the $20 million provided already. In 2000, the revenue \nfor agriculture in the Klamath Basin, according to the USDA Farm \nService Agency, was $132 million. The projected income for 2001 is only \n$28 million. There is a difference of $104 million in lost revenues \nalone. That figure does not include the increased costs my constituents \nincurred to get through the drought with their farms intact, such as \nwell augmentation and cover crop planting to protect topsoil from \nerosion.\n  May I count on the consideration of the Senator from Iowa, the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee and a member of the Agriculture \nAppropriation Subcommittee, as I pursue additional funding for the \nKlamath Basin farmers at the first possible opportunity?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate my friend's pursuit of relief for his \nconstituents. I can promise to work closely with you concerning fair \ndrought relief funding for the farm families in the Klamath Basin.\n  Mr. WYDEN. In addition, there are other solutions for the Klamath \nBasin, such as, but not limited to, water conservation, wetlands \nrestoration and irrigation system updates that will have to be \nconsidered. These may require legislative action. May I count on you to \nhelp me craft appropriate language that will be acceptable in the \nupcoming Farm Bill that will begin to address the long term solutions \nneeded in the Klamath Basin?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with you that an ounce of prevention is worth a \npound of cure. Certainly, I will work with you to address possible long \nterm solutions for the Klamath in the Farm bill.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this week the Senate has been trying to \npass S. 1246, the Emergency Agriculture Assistance Act, legislation to \nprovide emergency relief to U.S. farmers and ranchers suffering at this \ntime. Unfortunately, certain members of the Senate have tried to \npoliticize, delay, and complicate this very necessary legislation. \nMoreover, now that the House of Representatives has adjourned for the \nAugust recess, we may very well be forced to adopt a reduced level of \nassistance in order to match the House's lower funding level in a \nfashion that meets the President's needs, without a conference \ncommittee. If this must be the case, then I am sure the will of the \nSenate will be to adopt less funding for farmers, but I shall vote \nagainst reduced funding for our farmers and ranchers this year because \nI know it is not enough to adequately assist crop producers and \nlivestock ranchers through the 2001 crop year, indeed a fourth year in \na row of near-recession in agriculture.\n  I have made a quick calculation or two regarding the level of \nassistance expected if we indeed enact the House passed assistance \nlevel of just $5.5 billion today. First, the funding for program crops \nnationwide will be reduced by around 16 percent. More importantly, \nSouth Dakota's farmers and ranchers stand to lose between $30 and $50 \nmillion. The reduced market loss AMTA payment in the House plan is 85 \npercent of the level in Senator Harkin's plan, indicating to me that \nSouth Dakota farmers would lose around $23 million in these market loss \npayments if we adopt the House plan. Moreover, the oilseed payment is \nreduced by about $4.5 million under the House plan. Finally, if you \ncount the assistance we provide to peas, lentils, wool, honey, flooded \nlands and conservation programs and total everything up, South Dakota \nmay realize a loss of between $30 and $50 million under the House plan.\n  Under the leadership of Senator Harkin, the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee completed action on the fiscal year 2001 short-term economic \nassistance package for farmers and ranchers, providing $7.494 billion, \n$5.5 B in fiscal year 2001\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\nfunds plus $1.994 B in fiscal year 2002 funds. The United States \nDepartment of Agriculture, USDA, said they must distribute the fiscal \nnyar 2001 funds, $5.5 B in AMTA, by the end of the fiscal year, \nSeptember 30, 2001. USDA has indicated the only way they can guarantee \ntimely delivery of aid is to provide it through the bonus AMTA payment \nmechanism. Moreover, my colleague from South Dakota, the Majority \nLeader, Senator Daschle has received an assertion from the \nCongressional Budget Office, CBO, that Congress has to resolve this \nissue before the August recess in order to protect the $5.5 billion set \naside, for fiscal year 2001, for these emergency payments. Nonetheless, \nwe have had trouble getting a final vote on this assistance package \nbecause some of my colleagues, whom I respect a great deal, are slowing \nthe bill down because they are upset at the level of funding, $7.4 \nbillion.\n  In South Dakota, farmers and ranchers continue to struggle from \nterribly low commodity prices. While certain prices have improved in \nrecent months, this short-term recovery in price, really just in the \nlivestock sector, cannot compensate for nearly 4 years of recession in \nfarm country. Most crop prices remain at 15-25 year all-time lows. \nMoreover, input costs such as fuel and fertilizer have increased \ndramatically, wiping out chances for producers to enjoy profits to keep \noperations afloat. Corn prices remain around $1.55 per bushel, far \nbelow the $4.50 range when the 1996 farm bill was enacted. Soybean \nprices are stagnant at $4.50 per bushel, nearly $4.00 less than soybean \nprice levels in 1996. While wheat prices have made a very modest price \nrecovery, they still remain less than $3.00 per bushel, far below the \n$5.55 level in 1996. Moreover, due to disease, drought, and winter \nkill, many South Dakota farmers had most or all of their winter wheat \ncrop wiped out completely, so this modest increase in price won't help \nthem because they may not have a crop to put in the bin.\n  All this at a time when aggregate production costs, the prices \nfarmers pay for their inputs such as fuel and fertilizer, are 20 \npercent higher right now than the prices farmers receive for their \ncommodities. This price-cost squeeze makes it very difficult to turn a \nprofit in agriculture today. So, this assistance is badly needed. And \nwhile it is unfortunate that this assistance is necessary, I believe \nthis aid is critical until Congress can write the next farm bill in a \nway that promotes and supports fair marketplace competition and good \nstewardship of our land.\n  Unfortunately, the administration and some Senators want to reduce \nthe size of this emergency package, suggesting it provides too much \nassistance to our Nation's family farmers, or, alleging that it creates \nbudget problems. Even more ridiculous is the assertion by some that no \nfunding is necessary in fiscal year 2002 to help farmers. I believe we \nneed to look at this from the farmers' perspective, a little tractor-\nseat common sense if you will, because farmers deal with crop years, \nnot fiscal years. It all boils down to some in the administration \nwanting to implement this assistance based upon how the Government does \nbusiness, by fiscal years, instead of how farmers and ranchers do \nbusiness, by crop years. We need this assistance to span the current \ncrop year, and therefore, it must allow for investments over both \nfiscal year 2001 and fiscal year 2002.\n  Further, our budget resolution, which was adopted by Congress and \nsigned by the President, allows for this funding. The budget resolution \nenacted by Congress and signed by the President provided the \nAgriculture Committees authority to spend up to $5.5 B in fiscal year \n2001, with additional authority to spend up to $7.35 B in fiscal year \n2002, for a total of $12.85 B in fiscal year 2001-2002 spending \nauthority for agriculture. The committees were given total discretion \nto spend this money on emergency and/or farm bill programs. However, \nfor the third time now, Office of Management and Budget, OMB, Director \nMitch Daniels has signaled a possible veto threat if the Senate aid \npackage totals more than $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2001. A similar \nOMB threat was made as the House contemplated $6.5 billion, and despite \nefforts to increase the aid in the House, the level ended up at $5.5 \nbillion. It cannot be argued that we are busting any budget caps, or \nendangering the Medicare or Social Security Trust funds, because this \nmoney has already been provided by the budget resolution, and it is not \npart of the $73.5 billion (fiscal year 2003-2001) ag reserve fund. A \nveto is not warranted because the aid total for fiscal year 2001 is \n$5.5 billion, precisely the level permitted under the budget \nresolution. The fact that an additional $1.9 billion is provided in the \ngrand total does not matter because it is actually fiscal year 2002 \nmoney, which we are permitted to spend under the budget \nresolution passed by Congress and signed by the President. The Senate \nAgriculture Committee voted to spend $7.4 billion of both fiscal year \n2001 and 2002 money because the current, 2001 crop year spans both \nfiscal years. It is a subtle, yet, critically important difference \nbetween a crop year and a fiscal year that must be understood in order \nto meet the needs of farmers. The 2001 crop year mirrors the 2001 \ncalendar year, while the fiscal year 2001 fiscal year ``expires'' \nSeptember 30, 2001. Several major commodities must be marketed after \nthe fiscal year 2001 fiscal year ends, and prices for these commodities \nare not expected to magically improve after September 30. Clearly, \nthere is a necessity to provide economic aid into fiscal year 2002 as \nwell. In order to provide modest aid in fiscal year 2002, we have \nchosen to take a modest $1.9 billion, out of $7.35 billion available in \nfiscal year 2002, to help producers through the entire 2001 crop year. \nUnfortunately, the administration doesn't seem to understand the \ndifference between a fiscal year and a crop year. Additionally, we left \naround $5.4 B for additional fiscal year 2002 spending if needed.\n\n  Last year, as part of the crop insurance reform legislation, Congress \nprovided a total of $7.14 billion in emergency aid for both fiscal year \n2000 and fiscal year 2001, almost exactly the same amount of assistance \nwe aim to provide this time around. Specifically, $5.5 billion last \nyear was allocated for bonus AMTA in fiscal year 2000, and, $1.64 \nbillion for other needs in fiscal year 2001. Coincidentally, Congress \nand the President understood the need to provide assistance in fiscal \nyear 2000 and fiscal year 2001 for the 2000 crop year , thus, a \nprecedent has been set to do it once again. Furthermore, let us not \nforget that every major farm organization actually requested at least \n$9-10 billion in emergency ag support this year. Our legislation \ndoesn't provide that total, but it does cover a majority of the \nimmediate economic distress in agriculture today. I find it ironic that \nsome in the Senate would rely upon the OMB Director, Mitch Daniels, on \nhow much farm aid is necessary when what we are trying to pass in the \nSenate, $7.4 billion, is supported by farmers, including the following \nfarm groups; Farm Bureau, Farmers Union, the National Corn Growers, and \nthe National Assn. of Wheat Growers.\n  Yet some are still suggesting that spending $5.5 billion, most of it \nin fiscal year 2001, will be enough to help U.S. family farmers and \nranchers. However, 19 Republicans in the House Agriculture Committee, \nincluding the Chairman Larry Combest, voted against an amendment to \nreduce the size of the House package to $5.5 billion because they \nbelieve that $5.5 billion does not go far enough to assist farmers and \nranchers at this time. The vote to reduce the size of this assistance \nfor farmers to $5.5 billion in the House Ag Committee passed by just \none vote. The House passed emergency package falls short, by 16 \npercent, on the level of support Congress provided to program crops \nlast year. Moreover, the Lugar or House plan does not include any \nfunding for critical conservation programs such as CRP and WRP. \nFinally, Chairman Combest and other House Republicans were so concerned \nwith the inadequacy of the House passed $5.5 billion that they wrote \ntheir ``viewpoints'' or ``concerns'' into the House passed legislation. \nTheir concerns, accompanying the House farm aid state, and I am quoting \nfrom what House Republicans wrote about their own ag emergency bill \nnow:\n\n       . . .H.R. 2213, as reported by the House Agriculture \n     Committee is inadequate. . . . .the assistance level ($5.5 \n     billion) is not sufficient to address the needs of farmers \n     and ranchers in the 2001 crop year. . .At a time when real \n     net cash income on the farm is at its lowest level since the \n     Great Depression and the cost of production is expected to \n     set a record high, H.R. 2213 as reported by the Committee\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\n     cuts supplemental help to farmers by $1 billion from last \n     year to this year. Hardest hit will be wheat, corn, grain \n     sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, rice, soybean, and \n     other oilseed farmers since the cuts will be at their \n     expense.\n\n  This is very concerning to me. Many of the farmers that will suffer \nif we go with $5.5 billion--the wheat, corn, grain sorghum, and soybean \nfarmers, are trying to make a living in my State of South Dakota. So, \nas you can see, these very poignant words prove that the House passed \n$5.5 billion level of assistance is woefully inadequate. I will stay \nand fight on the Senate floor for increased funding this week to ensure \nSouth Dakota's farmers are assisted with the construction of a more \nsturdy bridge over this year's financial problems.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let met first commend the efforts of my \ncolleagues who are working very hard to deliver some form of Federal \nrelief to prevent the demise of more of America's family farms.\n  While this bill provides much needed emergency assistance to certain \nsectors of the agricultural community, I am concerned about this bill \nfor several reasons.\n  It guarantees very generous Federal subsidies at higher levels than \nin previous years even though these same subsidies were eliminated or \nintended to be phased out by the 1996 farm bill. It disproportionately \nfavors large farming operations over smaller ones. It adds $5 billion \nto the already $27 billion delivered in supplemental and emergency \nspending for farmers since 1999. This is funding in addition to Federal \npayments or loans authorized through the 1996 farm bill. While the 1996 \nfarm bill was intended to reduce reliance on the Federal Government, \npayments to farmers have increased by 400 percent, from $7 billion in \n1996 to $32 billion in 2001.\n  Again, I recognize that many Americans in the agriculture industry \nare facing economic ruin. However, already this year, the Senate has \nincluded $4.7 billion in wasteful, unnecessary, or unreviewed spending \nin five appropriations bills. Surely, among these billions of dollars, \nthere are at least a few programs that we could all agree are lower \npriority than desperately needed aid for America's farmers.\n  I appreciate the agreement of my colleagues to put before the Senate \nthe House bill that conforms with the agreed-upon budget resolution. \nThrough this bill, billions of dollars are provided in supplemental \npayments to oilseed producers, peanut producers, wool and mohair \nproducers, tobacco producers and cottonseed producers.\n  Fortunately, this bill does not include additional egregious \nprovisions proposed in the Senate version of the bill, such as \ncontinuing subsidies for honey producers, extension of the dairy price \nsupport program, perks for the sugar industry, and various other new or \npilot programs.\n  Recent indications are that these continuing supplemental payments \nthat Congress obligates from taxpayer dollars are now paying at least \nforty percent, if not more of total farm income. How are we helping the \nfarming sector to become more self-sufficient? Our actions are only \nserving as a crutch to small farmers while fattening the incomes of \nlarge farming conglomerates and agribusinesses. We should learn from \npast failures and take responsible action to focus Federal assistance \non a fair, needs-based approach.\n  This bill passed by unanimous consent today, despite the disagreement \nof some of my colleagues who advocated for a much higher level of \nsupplemental spending. I hope that my colleagues will exercise greater \nprudence and fiscal responsibility when we return from the August \nrecess to consider the agricultural appropriations bill and \nreauthorization of the 1996 Farm bill to ensure that such ad-hoc \nspending is brought under control.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Agriculture \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2213, the \nAgriculture supplemental bill, that the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration, that the bill be read the third time and passed, and \nthat the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. I further ask \nunanimous consent that S. 1246 be placed on the calendar and that the \npreviously entered motion to reconsider the failed cloture vote on S. \n1246 be in order.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection to the several \nrequests.\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2213) was read the third time and passed.\n  (The bill will appear in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. This corrects the fact that the motion to \nreconsider was not properly entered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed that our \nRepublican colleagues chose to work against us instead of with us to \nprovide critical financial relief to help farmers and ranchers deal \nwith the fourth year in a row of low prices. My colleagues' choice to \nfilibuster the committee bill, which a majority of Senators supported, \nwas a decision we could not afford.\n  Unfortunately, it will cost farmers and ranchers across the country. \nFor my State of South Dakota, that decision to filibuster will cost \nproducers over $50 million in decreased assistance. But, South Dakota \nis not alone. Producers in each and every one of our states are being \ndeprived of critical assistance because of the actions of my Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Why? Because the President and Senate Republicans drew an arbitrary \nand partisan $5.5 billion line in the sand.\n  Even though the budget resolution authorizes the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee to use $5.5 billion in fiscal year 2001 and $7.35 billion in \nfiscal year 2002 to provide economic assistance to producers, and even \nthough it specifically allows the use of fiscal year 2002 funds to \nsupport the 2001 crop, the President insisted that we spend only $5.5 \nbillion. His rationale ``The farm economy is improving, so farmers \ndon't need any additional help.''\n  That is certainly not what I am hearing in South Dakota, and I know \nit is not what my colleagues on this side of aisle have heard in their \nstates. Across the country, poor prices have hobbled producers for 4 \nyears now.\n  Major crop prices, despite showing slight improvement over last \nyear's significantly depressed prices, remain at 10 to 25-year lows. \nNet farm income minus government payments for 1999 thru 2001 is the \nlowest since 1984. Input costs are at record levels, making it more \nexpensive for producers to do their job than ever before.\n  Despite all this, my Republican colleagues insisted on a bill that \nprovides far less. Less for feed grain, wheat, and oilseed producers in \nmy part of the country. Less for rice and cotton producers in the \nSouth. Less for specialty crop producers in the Northeast and \nNorthwest.\n  And when I say less, I not only mean less than what is in the \nCommittee's package, but less than what is absolutely needed.\n  Chairman Harkin worked hard to improve on the House-passed $5.5 \nbillion package. His package provided the full level of last year's \nmarket loss assistance for producers of major crops. It provided \nsignificant funding for specialty crops. It provided a substantial \ncommitment to agricultural conservation.\n  Yet, my Republican colleagues filibustered. Why? Are they planning to \ngo home and tell producers they fought long and hard to provide you \nwith less?\n  Now that we are forced to pass the House legislation, we have lost \nfor too much of what is critically needed for program crops, specialty \ncrops, and conservation. This is reckless, and it's wrong. America's \nfarmers and ranchers deserve better, much better.\n  So, I can't help but feel this country's farmers and ranchers got \nshortchanged. But what also troubles me is what the actions of my \nRepublican colleagues over the past few days mean for the farm bill. \nCongress must come together quickly to write new farm policy this year \nso we don't have to keep coming back for more ad hoc emergency \nassistance, year after year.\n  Congress must get passed its stubborn refusal to acknowledge the \nfailures of current farm policy and work together to change it. We need \npolicies that better address the interests of family farmers and \nranchers. Farmers and ranchers must have an income safety net that can \noffset severe price fluctuations, and that can help manage \nuncertainties in the marketplace. Such\n\n[[Page S8853]]\n\npolicies are critical to long-term survival in an industry in which the \nmajority of producers operate on margins of less than 5 percent.\n  I believe there is a lot we can agree on. And by working together, I \nam certain there is a lot we can accomplish. I stand ready to work with \nmy Republican colleagues. But, my colleagues must first choose to stand \nup for America's family farmers and ranchers.\n  I am hopeful they will.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am very disappointed by the Emergency \nAgricultural Supplemental that this body has just passed because of the \nPresident's opposition to the much better legislation reported by the \nSenate Agriculture Committee and the fact the House of Representatives \nalready left for the August recess. The Senate has passed a bill that \nfails to provide adequate aid to America's farmers and rural \ncommunities. Some on the other side of the aisle claimed that the bill \npassed by Senate Agricultural Committee spends too much money in \nsupport of America's farmers and that the farm economy is improving. I \nwish that were the case, but the facts in rural America do not support \nthat assertion. The major farm groups do not agree with that \nconclusion, that is why they supported the stronger alternative, the \nbill proposed by the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee Senator \nHarkin.\n  As we all know, our Nation's farmers have not shared in the \nprosperity which many Americans have experienced over the past decade. \nIn the past three years, Congress has assisted America's farmers by \nproviding substantial assistance to agricultural producers. No one, not \nleast of all America's farmers, likes the fact that annual emergency \nagriculture supplementals have seemingly become routine.\n  Senator Harkin, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, crafted \nan impressive bill that addressed the needs of specialty crop farmers, \nin a more comprehensive fashion, than does the bill that just passed \nthe Senate.\n  The bill that just passed provides nearly a billion dollars less in \nAMTA payments for traditional row crops than did the committee version. \nIn addition, the passed bill makes no real effort to address the \nproblems faced by farmers in States that do not rely on AMTA payments. \nIt is difficult for a Senator with a large base of specialty crops to \nsupport it. This bill provides no more than a pittance for specialty \ncrops. None of this pittance even goes directly to farmers of specialty \ncrops. We have told farmers that they need to diversify if they are to \nsucceed, yet the States that have diversified and specialized receive \nnext to nothing in the House bill.\n  I am concerned about some of the arguments made to support the \nexclusion of funds for specialty crops. In particular, I am troubled by \nthose who claim that payments should not be made to specialty crops \nbecause aid to producers of these crops cannot be dispensed by the end \nof the fiscal year. It was argued that payments should only be made to \ncrops that can easily receive funds before the end of this fiscal year. \nI understand the need to get money to farmers as soon as possible. \nHowever, this money must also not only be distributed promptly it must \nbe distributed fairly. Providing assistance chiefly to program crops \nmay be prompt, but it ignores the needs facing many farmers throughout \nthe Nation. Senator Harkin, and the Senate Agriculture Committee, \ndrafted a bill that, just like the last three emergency supplementals, \ndispensed money credited to two fiscal years. This bill would have \nallocated the $5.5 billion in FY01 funds to AMTA payments which can be \ndispensed this year, while specialty crops and conservation will be \naddressed in fiscal year 2002 monies that are already provided for in \nthe budget resolution. This bill provides less assistance for row crops \nthan does the committee, passed bill, and it is unfair to farmers who \ndo not grow specialty crops.\n  The passage of this bill will lead to the loss of the following \nprograms:\n  $150 million in market loss assistance for apple growers. It is \nestimated that apple growers have lost $500 million last year due to \nunfair trade and weather related disasters. Furthermore, some estimate \nthat the industry may lose as much as 30 percent of its farmers this \nyear without some form of aid.\n  $270 million in commodity purchases of specialty crops. These \npurchases provide food for shelters, food banks and schools, yet that \nmoney, $50 million of which will be used for the school lunch program, \nis not in the House version.\n  The $44 million sugar assessment, which has been suspended the past \ntwo years due to our budget surplus is not waived this year.\n  $542 million needed to fund conservation programs is excluded from \nthe House version. As a result many important programs will lie \ndormant.\n  The number of farmers in our nation has been declining for well over \na century. Now, farmers comprise only 1 percent of our population. The \ndeclining number of farmers and the increasing scarcity of Federal \ndollars makes it harder and harder to sustain the level of assistance \nwe provide our farmers. Part of the success of current farm policy is \nthat programs such as Women Infants Children program, WIC, balance \nrural and urban interests and attempt to meet the needs of each \ncommunity. Assistance to the agricultural sector must address the \nconcerns of all Americans if it is to continue at the needed level. The \nbill passed by the Senate fails to do that. This trend of narrowly \nfocused farm programs cannot be sustained. The next farm bill that this \nbody undertakes must help all Americans while helping farmers. The \ncommittee-passed bill addressed issues important to all of us: hunger, \nconservation and energy independence. This bill does not. Gone is the \n$270 million allocated for commodity purchases that would have helped \nspecialty crop farmers, like cherry, bean and asparagus farmers in \nMichigan, while providing foodstuffs to school lunch programs, food \nbanks and soup kitchens that guarantee a healthy diet is available to \nall Americans.\n  The conservation programs included in S. 1246 but not in the bill we \njust passed would have prevented erosion, preserved green space, \nincreased wildlife habitat and ensured a clean water supply. Currently, \nin the State of Michigan there are three farmers who apply for every \nopen slot in Federal conservation programs. These farmers will now have \nto wait even longer to participate in these programs.\n  I commend the chairman and the Senate Agriculture Committee for the \nhard work they put into the Agriculture Supplemental Bill which they \nreported to the Senate. The bill passed by this body, because the \nPresident's opposition to the better alternative left us no choice, \nignores the needs of specialty crop producers and fails to fund farm \nprograms that have the broader effect of helping all Americans.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to express my extreme \ndisappointment with the agriculture supplemental assistance package the \nSenate passed today.\n  This week, the Bush administration did a great disservice to our \nnation's farmers, to rural communities, and to agricultural \nconservation programs around this nation. The administration's veto \nthreats forced the Senate to pass a bill that does not meet the needs \nof farmers in my State.\n  In fact, this bill is completely inadequate to meet the needs of our \nfarmers and rural America. The bill abandons our apple producers. It \nabandons our pea and lentil producers. And it rejects a fair emergency \npayment to our wheat producers.\n  It didn't have to be this way. Senator Harkin worked with many of our \ncolleagues to draft a balanced $7.4 billion emergency economic package. \nI fought hard to include $150 million in emergency payments for apple \nproducers. I worked to include $20 million in assistance for dry pea \nand lentil producers. And many Senators worked together to ensure that \nwheat and other program crop producers received an emergency payment \nequal to what they received last year.\n  The Harkin bill was balanced, fair, and fiscally responsible. It \ndeserved to become law. Yet, throughout this debate, the Bush \nadministration steadfastly threatened to veto any bill larger than $5.5 \nbillion. Today, President Bush won, and our farmers lost.\n  Instead of the Harkin bill, the Senate passed the House agriculture \nsupplemental bill. We passed it because the President will sign it. We \npassed it because further delay threatened the\n\n[[Page S8854]]\n\navailability of $5.5 billion in emergency relief. We did not pass it \nbecause it's the best bill possible.\n  The President's veto threats have cost Washington state producers \n$103 million. Let me repeat that: According to the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee, President Bush's veto threats will cost Washington State \nproducers an estimated $103 million in assistance. That includes the \n$50.3 million in assistance our apple growers would have received under \nthe apple aid package.\n  I would like to thank Senator Harkin for his support for specialty \ncrop producers. Senator Harkin worked tirelessly to help all regions \nand all producers. In my opinion, he could not have put together a more \nbalanced and fair package.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Daschle. Senator Daschle is \ncommitted to working with us to address the shortfalls in the House \nbill. I look forward to working with him to complete the unfinished \nbusiness we began this week.\n  This fight is not over. I would urge my colleagues to return from the \nAugust recess ready to pass an agriculture aid package that is balanced \nand fair to America's farmers.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise regarding the Senate's passage of \nH.R. 2213, the House-passed Emergency Agriculture Assistance Act.\n  There is a great need for economic assistance in farm country. There \nis no disagreement about that fact.\n  There has been no disagreement that we will spend the $12.85 billion \nprovided in the budget for agriculture in fiscal years 2001 and 2002. \nThe question has been on when and how we will spend it.\n  I wanted to pass an emergency bill with more emergency money than was \nin the House-passed bill. I was willing to work toward a compromise \nthat met the current needs of our farmers--even if that meant spending \na small portion of the fiscal year 2002 funding.\n  I had asked for Senate action on this supplemental since before the \nHouse passed its emergency assistance package on June 26th--more than a \nmonth ago. But, time ran out.\n  The House bill does not fund all the needs of Idaho's farmers and \nranchers. It is not a perfect solution, but it is a necessary one. We \nnow have a good start in providing short-term assistance to our \nproducers. I hope we can build on that when we return in September.\n  We should move quickly to a farm bill. A fair and effective national \nfood policy that recognizes the importance of a safe, abundant, \ndomestic supply of food.\n  Farmers and ranchers across the country are looking to us to pass \nlegislation that will: provide a safety net to producers, increase the \ncommitment to conservation, bolster our export promotion programs, \ncontinue our commitment to agricultural research, and, find innovative \nways to address rural development needs.\n  These are pressing needs. These are important needs, and the chairman \nof the Senate Agriculture Committee tried to address many of these \nneeds in the economic assistance package. Now that we have allocated \nthe $5.5 billion for fiscal year 2001, I hope that we can now focus our \nefforts on the farm bill.\n  I look forward to working in cooperation with the chairman and \nranking member of the Agriculture Committee to craft a fair and \neffective bill as expeditiously as possible.\n  But, as those of us who worked on the 1996 Farm Bill know, the farm \nbill alone will not solve all our problems. We must continue to pursue \ntax reforms, address unfair regulatory burdens, and move toward free \nand fair trade. Our producers are being handcuffed by unfair foreign \ncompetition and barriers to exports, it is time this stopped.\n  I hope the recent debate on the emergency supplemental has raised \nawareness of the needs in agriculture. I hope this has prodded us to \naction on the farm bill. And, I hope we can work together for the needs \nof not just agricultural producers, but the consumers that benefit from \nefficient, safe, domestic food production.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my disappointment \nthat funding in the Committee-passed bill that is important to Maine is \nno longer a reality. While the emergency agriculture assistance bill \nthe Senate passed today provides $2 million for Maine, including \n$850,000 for a State grant for specialty crops, gone is the possibility \nof conferees making any decision to reauthorize or extend the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact.\n  Gone is the $5 million for Maine for incentive-based voluntary \nagriculture conservation programs. Gone is the $270 million for CCC \ncommodity purchases for Northeast specialty crops for the federal \nnutrition programs, such as wild blueberries, cranberries, and \npotatoes. Gone is $150 million in Apple Market Loss Assistance, of \nwhich $1.6 million would have gone to apple growers in Maine. Gone is \nthe $25 million for disaster payments for the recent devastation from \narmyworms, some of which would have gone to Maine hay farmers.\n  Gone is the $20 million for fiscal year 2002 for the Senior Nutrition \nProgram, called Senior Farm Share in Maine. This is a program for low \nincome elderly that allows them to obtain shares with which to purchase \nlocally produced produce throughout the growing season.\n  Out of a $5.5 billion package passed by the Senate today, the State \nof Maine will receive approximately $2 million. I am deeply troubled by \nthe unbalanced and unfair emergency agriculture bills Congress \ncontinues to pass that almost totally ignore the farmers in my State of \nMaine and throughout the Northeast. My votes on this emergency \nagriculture funding bill reflect my true disappointment that once, \nagain, funding for farmers and rural communities in Maine and the \nNortheast was left out. As we begin to work on the 2002 farm bill, I \nhope my colleagues are willing to work with the Northeast Senators to \nrectify this unbalance and this unfairness.\n  I am also disappointed that the legislation does not include the \nDairy Consumers and Producers Protection amendment, which as a free-\nstanding bill is sponsored by 37 of my colleagues from New England and \nthroughout the Mid-Atlantic states and the Southeast.\n  This legislation reauthorizes the very successful Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact. As my colleagues are, by now, no doubt aware, \nthe Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will expire on September 30 of \nthis year if it is not reauthorized by Congress.\n  The compact has unquestionably been of great benefit to preserving \nour dairy farms, while also assuring consumers a continuous, adequate \nsupply of quality local milk at a stable price . . . saving consumers \nmoney overall by helping to stabilize milk prices . . . and generally \nhelping regional economies. In my home State of Maine alone, our 463 \ndairy farms produce products valued at $100 million, and provide \nemployment for approximately 2,100 Mainers.\n  The compact grew out of the need to address a fundamental problem in \nthe New England dairy farming community--the loss of family dairy \nfarms, which was largely the result of increased production costs, \ncoupled with price volatility in the milk market. Farm milk prices have \nfallen more than five percent in real dollars since 1985, and New \nEngland dairy farmers have struggled with this decline.\n  However, 5 years ago, New England dairy farmers were able to \nstabilize the effects of this decline when Congress passed the Compact \nas part of the Freedom to Farm Act, and it was implemented by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. Since then, the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact has provided a reliable safety net for small family farmers \nthroughout New England by helping to maintain a stable price for fresh \nfluid milk on supermarket shelves.\n  Now, I know that one of the chief arguments made by detractors is \nthat the compact is harmful to consumers. The facts, however, tell a \ndifferent story.\n  For consumers, the compact translates to the addition of a small \nincrement in the price of milk--a recent University of Connecticut \nstudy put the cost at 2.5 cents per gallon. Indeed, rather than \novercharging New England milk drinkers, the compact has instead \nresulted in milk prices ranking among the lowest and most stable in the \ncountry. And it's no small point that Federal nutrition programs, such \nas the Women, Infants, and Children Program, or WIC, are held entirely \nharmless under the Compact. In fact, the advocates of these federal \nnutrition programs support the compact and serve on its commission.\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\n  In return, the compact has paid off with lower, more stable dairy \nprices in New England that more fairly reflect farmers' costs. As \ntestimony proved at the July 25 Judiciary Committee hearing held by \nSenator Leahy of Vermont, the existence of the Northeast Dairy Compact \nhas had a tremendous, positive impact--without threatening or otherwise \nfinancially harming any other dairy farmer in the country.\n  In response to my recent request, the Departments of Agriculture \nthroughout New England sent me data that clearly shows that the compact \nhas slowed the rate of dairy farm reductions in the New England Dairy \nCompact area. These letters show that in the 3 years prior to the \ncompact's establishment, New England lost 572 dairy farms, compared to \n408 farms in the 3 years since its implementation. Even during this \nperiod of historic lows in milk prices, 164 fewer farms left the \nbusiness.\n  How has this worked? Under the compact, whenever the Federal \nGovernment's minimum price falls below that of the Northeast Dairy \nCommission, which administers the compact, dairy processors are \nrequired to pay the difference to farmers. Moreover, the compact has \ngiven dairy farmers a measure of confidence in the near term for the \nprice of their milk so they have been willing to reinvest in their \noperations by upgrading and modernizing facilities, acquiring more \nefficient equipment, purchasing additional cropland and improving the \ngenetic base of their herds. Without the compact, farmers would have \nbeen far more hesitant to do these things--if at all--and their lenders \nwould have been much less willing to meet their capital needs.\n  And the compact has protected future generations of dairy farmers by \nhelping local milk remain in the region and preventing dependence on a \nsingle source of milk--from outside the region--that can lead to higher \nmilk prices through increased transportation costs, as well as \nincreased vulnerability to natural catastrophes.\n  All this has been accomplished without threatening or otherwise \nfinancially harming any other dairy farmer in the country. In fact, \nmore than 97 percent of the fluid milk market in New England is self-\ncontained within the area with strong markets for local milk because of \nthe demand for freshness and high transportation costs to ship milk in \nfrom other areas.\n  In short, the compact provides a fairer value for dairy farmers, and \nprotects a way of life important to New England--a win-win situation \nfor everyone involved, at no cost to the Federal Government. Let me \nrepeat--the costs of operating the compact are borne entirely by the \nfarmers and processors of the compact region, at absolutely no expense \nto the federal government.\n  Moreover, the compact provides environmental benefits \nthrough preservation of dwindling agricultural land and open spaces \nthat help to combat the growing problem of urban sprawl, particularly \nnear large cities. As a July 29, 2001 Boston Globe editorial pointed \nout, ``A wide range of environmental organizations back the compact, \nseeing it as a defense against the sprawl that often occurs when \nbeleaguered farmers sell out to developers.''\n\n  The amendment offered by Senator Specter of Pennsylvania would have \npermanently authorized the Northeast Compact, as well as giving \napproval for states contiguous to the participating New England states \nto join, in this case, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, \nand Maryland. It would also have granted Congressional approval for a \nnew Southern Dairy Compact, comprised of 14 states--Alabama, Arkansas, \nGeorgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West \nVirginia.\n  Why did the amendment include all of these States--half the country? \nThe answer is that dairy compacting is really a States rights issue \nmore than anything else, as the only action the Senate needs to take is \nto give its congressional consent under the Compact Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution, Article I, section 10, clause 3, to allow the 25 states \nto proceed with their two independent compacts.\n  Consider 24 other States with Maine's and you have a reflection of \nall of the Northeast and Southern Compact legislators--and all of their \nGovernors--who have requested nothing more than congressional approval \nto ``compact''.\n  All of the legislatures in these 25 States, including Maine, have \nratified legislation that allows their individual States to join a \nCompact, and the governor of every State has signed a compact bill into \nlaw. Half of the States in this country await our congressional \napproval to address farm insecurity by stabilizing the price of fresh \nfluid milk on grocery shelves and to protect consumers against volatile \nprice swings.\n  Altogether, these 25 States make up about 28 percent of the Nation's \nfluid milk market--New England production is only about three and a \nhalf percent of this. This is somewhat comparable to two States of \nMinnesota and Wisconsin which together make up to 24 percent of the \nfluid milk market. California makes up another 20 percent.\n  Detractors have also claimed that compacts encourage the over-\nproduction of milk, but again, the facts say otherwise. In the nearly \nfour years that the compact has been in effect, milk production in the \nCompact region has risen by just 2.2 percent or 100 million pounds of \nmilk. In Wisconsin alone, milk production increased by almost 900 \nmillion pounds, or 4 percent. Nationally during this identical period, \nmilk production rose 7.4 percent.\n  And finally, those who oppose this compact assert that it discourages \ntrade between compact and non-compact states. To the contrary, dairy \ncompacts require farmers from inside and outside the compact region to \nreceive the compact price. An OMB study found that trade in milk in the \ncompact region actually increased by 8 percent 1 year after the compact \nwas implemented--further, 30 percent of milk sold in the compact region \nwas produced outside the compact region in the State of New York.\n  As we work on the fiscal year 2002 Agriculture appropriations, and \nthe 2002 farm bill, I hope that my colleagues realize that should the \nCompact Commission be shut down even temporarily while Congress \ngrapples with its extension, it cannot magically be brought back to \nlife again. It would take many months if not a year to restore the \nsuccessful process that is now in place. I do not want to gamble with \nthis process in such as manner that endangers the livelihoods of the \ndairy farmers of Maine.\n  During debate on this bill, according to the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, Mr. Harkin, the compact amendment offered was \nnot germaine to this particular bill. According to the Senator from \nWisconsin, Mr. Kohl, an extensive debate is needed on the compact \nreauthorization. Since the farm bill is an appropriate vehicle for this \ndebate, I would hope these Senators will work with me to extend the \nNortheast Compact until such time as the 2002 Farm bill is completed.\n  The bottom line is, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has \nprovided the very safety net that we had hoped for when the compact \npassed as part of the omnibus farm bill of 1996. Mr. President, the \nDairy Compact has helped farmers maintain a stable price for fluid milk \nduring times of volatile swings in farm milk prices . . . the consumers \nin the Northeast Compact area, and now in the Mid-Atlantic area and the \nSoutheast area, have shown their willingness to pay a few pennies more \nfor their milk, none of it at government expense, if the additional \nmoney is going directly to the dairy farmer and environmental \norganizations have supported dairy compacting as a means to help to \npreserve dwindling agricultural land and open spaces.\n  I urge my colleague not to look success in the face and turn the \nother way, but to support us for a vote on the compacts that half of \nour states support.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the following material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         State of Maine, Department of Agriculture, Food & Rural \n           Resources,\n                                     Augusta, Maine, July 3, 2001.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: We have worked closely on the \n     reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I am grateful \n     for your\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\n     efforts and I know Maine's dairy farmers are as well. I \n     understand that the issue of reauthorization is coming to the \n     top of the Congressional agenda. I want to reiterate how \n     critical the Compact is to dairy farmers in Maine and the \n     region, and to provide you with the latest facts.\n       There are 463 dairy farms comprising 220,000 acres in \n     Maine. These herds, which total about 42,000 animals, produce \n     milk valued at more than $100 million annually. Those farms \n     directly employ 1,389 people. There are 1,486 indirect jobs \n     attributable to the dairy industry.\n       Maintaining the number of dairy farms, not just the number \n     of cows, is important to Maine. Dairy farms are an important \n     and in some cases, the only contributor to small town \n     economies. The contribution is vital to maintaining an \n     economically viable rural environment.\n       The Compact was designed to assure the continued viability \n     of dairy farming in the Northeast and to assure an adequate, \n     local supply of milk. The Compact has met both goals.\n       More than $139.4 million has been distributed through \n     December 31, 2000, to dairy farmers in the region since the \n     Compact's inception, of that $13.7 million has gone to Maine \n     dairy farmers. In the five years leading up to the Compact \n     the number of dairy farms in Maine dropped to 514 from 614, a \n     16 percent decrease. In the five years since the Compact the \n     loss was only 9 percent, from 514 to 463.\n       At the same time, WIC programs in the region have received \n     $4 million and the school lunch programs across the Northeast \n     have received $700,000. These payments are made under the \n     Compact to hold harmless those who need milk most.\n       The Compact creates milk-price stability and farmers \n     receive a fair price. By maintaining the viability of dairy \n     farming, it creates economic stability in rural New England. \n     The money from milk checks is spent at local feed stores, \n     equipment dealers and deposited at local banks. By helping to \n     keep families on working farms, the Compact preserves \n     farmland. The people of Maine when asked about public policy \n     have consistently ranked the conservation of open space as a \n     high priority.\n       The benefits of the Compact, and the balances it creates, \n     are all provided with no tax dollars. I proudly support the \n     reauthorization of the Northeast Dairy Compact and strongly \n     encourage your continued support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert W. Spear,\n     Commissioner, Department of Agriculture.\n                                  ____\n\n         New Hampshire, Department of Agriculture, Markets & Food,\n                                                    June 27, 2001.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC 20510.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: You have asked for comment on the \n     impact of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact on the \n     stability of the dairy industry in New Hampshire.\n       Since the Compact's inception in July 1997, the number of \n     farms producing milk for the commercial market in this state \n     has declined from 187 to 176. Several of these farms have \n     exited because of death of the operator; the land of these \n     farms in most cases is being operated by a neighboring \n     farmer.\n       But focusing solely on change in the numbers of farms may \n     be a mistake, for we have seen a period of stability in \n     production come during the time the Compact has been in \n     effect. With a measure of confidence in the near term price \n     of milk our farmers have been willing to reinvest in their \n     operations by upgrading and modernizing facilities, acquiring \n     more efficient equipment, purchasing additional cropland and \n     improving the genetic base of their herds.\n       Without the Compact's role in milk pricing during periods \n     when Federal Order prices were at rock-bottom lows our \n     farmers would not have had the courage to modernize and \n     improve their operations and their lenders would not have had \n     the willingness to meet their capital needs. If there had \n     been no Compact, I would expect that by now we would be down \n     to 130 or even fewer farms.\n       The investments made in our dairy enterprises as a \n     consequence of the stability brought by the Compact serve our \n     New England consumers by helping to assure reliable sources \n     of fresh milk at reasonable cost.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Stephen H. Taylor,\n     Commissioner.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Rhode Island Department of\n\n\n                                     Environmental Management,\n\n                                     Providence, RI, July 2, 2001.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: I am responding to your recent letter \n     requesting information regarding the positive effects of the \n     Northeast Dairy Compact on protecting and maintaining dairy \n     farms.\n       Rhode Island has a healthy, though limited dairy industry, \n     and is considered a consumer state. While the number of dairy \n     farms in Rhode Island is small in comparison to other Compact \n     states, their viability is important to our agricultural \n     economy, and they additionally have important benefits for \n     open space protection, wildlife habitat etc.\n       In terms of pure numbers, there are currently 23 active \n     dairy farms in Rhode Island, down from 32 at the initiation \n     of the Compact in 1997. In 1983 there were 123 dairy farms, \n     which reveals that 6.5 farms were lost per year on average \n     prior to the Compact, and that rate has declined to 2.3 farms \n     lost per year since inception of the Compact.\n       It was not anticipated or expected that the Dairy Compact \n     would end the loss of dairy farms. Significant other factors \n     contribute to farm losses (in general) which put pressure on \n     the viability of the farm (ie. death of the operator, tax and \n     estate issues, development pressure, loss of tillable land \n     etc).\n       What the Dairy Compact has clearly done, from our \n     perspective and the specific testimony of Rhode Island dairy \n     farmers, is to improve the business climate of the farm, \n     enabling farmers to better withstand pressures which before \n     often brought about the downfall of the farm. This is \n     evidenced by the decline in farm losses after initiation of \n     the Compact. It is our observation that the dairy farms which \n     remain are more viable, more stable, and a better business \n     risk for lenders, which has allowed operations to modernize \n     and other improvements to occur which improve the farm's \n     chances for survival in coming years.\n       I hope this information and perspective is useful. Please \n     contact me if I can further assist.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth D. Ayars,\n     Chief, RIDEM/Division of Agriculture.\n                                  ____\n\n         Connecticut Department of Agriculture, Office of the \n           Commissioner,\n                                                    June 22, 2001.\n     Senator Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russel Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: The people of Connecticut have been \n     consistently supportive of the Northeast Dairy Compact.\n       Connecticut is a state of 3,000,000 persons and about \n     3,000,000 acres. It is a state with a great deal of \n     diversity, with an economy that has evolved from one that was \n     agriculture based to an industrial society and today is on \n     the way to becoming a high tech Mecca. Yet dairy farms remain \n     an integral part of the state's quality of life.\n       Why do Connecticut citizens support the Compact?\n       Because 70% of the working landscape in the state is \n     utilized by dairy farmers;\n       Because of the state's 225 dairy farms, 60% open their \n     farms to the public to tour the farm, visit a pumpkin patch, \n     milk a cow, pet a calf, enjoy a hayride, go through a corn \n     maze, or just take a quiet walk in a meadow to observe \n     wildlife;\n       Because dairy farms have become important school systems \n     that use in class and on farm visits to bring real-life, \n     hands-on experience to the science and math curriculum;\n       Because of the $60 million farmers received from the \n     Compact three percent went to support WIC programs and one \n     percent to reimburse school lunch programs;\n       Because during the five years since the Compact has been in \n     place, the attrition of dairy farms dropped (64 in the five \n     years prior, 47 in the five years after); and\n       Because in the Dairy Compact area, consumers have enjoyed \n     some of the lowest retail milk prices in the country.\n       I support the Northeast Dairy Compact because a stable milk \n     price is as beneficial to our state's consumers as it is to \n     our processors, retailers and farmers.\n       Thank for your support of this important, groundbreaking \n     legislation!\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Shirley Ferris.\n\n  State of Maine--Joint Resolution Memorializing the Congress of the \n  United States To Reauthorize the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact\n\n       Whereas, Maine has nearly 500 dairy farms annually \n     producing milk valued at over $100,000,000; and\n       Whereas, maintaining a sufficient supply of Maine-produced \n     milk and milk products is in the best interest of Maine \n     consumers and businesses; and\n       Whereas, a University of Connecticut study, done while the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has been in existence, \n     concluded that from July 1997 to July 2000, the price of milk \n     to the consumer increased 29c of which 4 1/2c went to the \n     farmer; and\n       Whereas, Maine is a member of the Northeast Interstate \n     Dairy Compact; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will \n     terminate at the end of September 2001 unless action is taken \n     by the Congress to reauthorize it; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact's mission \n     is to ensure the continued viability of dairy farming in the \n     Northeast and to assure consumers of an adequate, local \n     supply of pure and wholesome milk and also helps support the \n     Women, Infants and Children program, commonly known as \n     ``WIC''; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has \n     established a minimum price to be paid to dairy farmers for \n     their milk, which has helped to stabilize their incomes; and\n       Whereas, in certain months the compact's minimum price has \n     resulted in dairy farmers receiving nearly 10% more for their \n     milk than the farmers would have otherwise received; and\n       Whereas, actions taken by the compact have directly \n     benefited Maine dairy farmers by not diminishing the farmer's \n     share; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the United States Congress reauthorize the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and be it further\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this Memorial, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W.

Mr. President, here is the situation, just for the \nbenefit of all who are watching and wondering what happened. Basically \nwhat has happened is that the Senate just took up the House-passed \nAgriculture emergency bill and passed it, and therefore it will be sent \nto the President for his signature. I also point out we still have \npending in the Senate the bill that was passed by our committee and \nthere has been entered a motion to reconsider that has been placed by \nour leader, by Senator Daschle of South Dakota. So at some point when \nwe come back it is entirely within the realm of feasibility or \npossibility that this Senate might want to revisit that Senate bill \nbecause it is clear that the House bill is totally inadequate to meet \nthe needs of our farmers across the country.\n  I am proud of our committee and the work it did. Keep in mind that \nour committee was not reconstituted or able to do business until June \n29, because the Senate organizing resolution was held up until then. \nAnd we did not have our full membership until July 10. But our \ncommittee worked diligently to look at the entire spectrum of farm \nfamilies across America to try to determine what was needed to keep \nthese farm families in business, keep their heads above water for yet \nanother year until we can get a farm bill passed. The bill we reported \nout met the needs of farmers across America. Yet the White House said \nno.\n  I again point out that our committee voted the Senate bill out on a \nbipartisan vote. The Senate voted, again on a bipartisan vote, in favor \nof our bill and the provisions we had in our bill. But the White House \nsaid no.\n  Now we are at the point, because the House has left, they went home, \nand because we need to get this money out, that a gun is held at our \nheads by the White House and by OMB. They are saying if we do not pass \nthe House bill, or if we pass something more adequate to the need in \nrural America we may lose even the $5.5 billion the House provided. So \nthe gun was held at our heads and the White House refused to \ncompromise.\n  Yesterday I spoke several times with the head of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Mr. Daniels, I spoke with the President's chief \nof staff, and I spoke with the Secretary of Agriculture to see if they \nwould at least meet with us to see if there could be some compromise \nworked out. I said to the President's chief of staff last night: I \nrespectfully request a meeting with the President at least to lay out \nour case on why the House bill was inadequate. That meeting was denied. \nSo the President decided he would accept only $5.5 billion, which is \nonly about three-fourths of what Congress passed in a similar bill last \nyear.\n  I had a long visit with the head of OMB on the phone last night to \ntry to determine why they picked that number. He said: Well, it looked \nas if farm income was a little bit better this year.\n  I said: Compared to what? We have had extremely low commodity prices, \nin some cases at about 30-year lows. Now, because livestock receipts \nwere up a little bit the ag picture looks a little bit better than it \ndid last year, but we are still in the basement. However, the money in \nthis bill mainly goes to crop farmers, and they are the ones who are \nhurting the most. They are not only as bad off as last year, but they \nare probably worse off than last year because the prices are still low \nand all of their production costs have gone up--fertilizer, fuel, \neverything. Yet somehow the bean counters down at OMB have said no, the \nHouse bill is sufficient.\n  I will resubmit for the Record at this time letters or statements \nfrom just about all of the main farm organizations: The American Farm \nBureau, National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Corn \nGrowers Association, the American Soybean Association, the National \nBarley Growers Association and others--all saying that the House bill \nis inadequate. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n\n         [From the Voice of Agriculture, Monday July 30, 2001]\n\n         Farm Bureau Disappointed in House Funding for Farmers\n\n       Washington, DC., June 21, 2001--The House Agriculture \n     Committee's decision to provide only $5.5 billion in a farm \n     relief package ``is disheartening and will not provide \n     sufficient assistance needed by many farm and ranch \n     families,'' said American Farm Bureau Federation President \n     Bob Stallman.\n       ``We believe needs exceed $7 billion,'' Stallman said. \n     ``The fact is agricultural commodity prices have not \n     strengthened since last year when Congress saw fit to provide \n     significantly more aid.''\n       Stallman said securing additional funding will be a high \n     priority for Farm Bureau. He said the organization will now \n     turn its attention to the Senate and then the House-Senate \n     conference committee that will decide the fate of much-needed \n     farm relief.\n       ``Four years of low prices has put a lot of pressure on \n     farmers. We need assistance to keep this sector viable,'' the \n     farm leader said.\n       ``We've been told net farm income is rising but a closer \n     examination shows that is largely due to higher livestock \n     prices, not most of American agriculture,'' Stallman said.\n       ``And, costs are rising for all farmers and ranchers due to \n     problems in the energy industry that are reflected in \n     increased costs\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\n     for fuel and fertilizer. Farmers and ranchers who produce \n     grain, oilseeds, cotton, fruits and vegetables need help and \n     that assistance is needed soon.''\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                                Wheat Growers,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Agriculture Committee, Russell Senate \n         Officer Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: As President of the National \n     Association of Wheat (NAWG), and on behalf of wheat producers \n     across the nation, I urge the Committee to draft a 2001 \n     agriculture economic assistance package that provides wheat \n     producers with a market loss payment equal to the 1999 \n     Production Flexibility Contract (AMTA) payment rate.\n       NAWG understands Congress is facing difficult budget \n     decisions. We too are experiencing tight budgets in wheat \n     country. While wheat prices hover around the loan rate, PFC \n     payments this year have declined from $0.59 to $0.47. At the \n     same time, input costs have escalated. Fuel and oil expenses \n     are up 53 percent from 1999, and fertilizer costs have risen \n     33 percent this year alone.\n       Given these circumstances, NAWG's first priorty for the \n     2001 crop year is securing a market loss payment at the 1999 \n     PFC rate. We believe a supplemental payment at $0.64 for \n     wheat--the same level provided in both 1999 and 2000--is \n     warranted and necessary to provide sufficient income support \n     to the wheat industry.\n       NAWG has a history of supporting fiscal discipline and \n     respects efforts to preserve the integrity of the $73.5 \n     billion in FY02-FY11 farm program dollars. However, given \n     current financial conditions, growers cannot afford the \n     reduced level of support provided by the House in H.R. 2213. \n     Wheat farmers across the nation are counting on a market loss \n     payment at the 1999 PFC rate.\n       Thank you for your leadership and support.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Dusty Tallman,\n\n                                   President, National Association\n     of Wheat Growers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            National Corn Growers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Harkin: We write to urge you to take \n     immediate action on the $5.5 billion in funding for \n     agricultural economic assistance authorized in the FY01 \n     budget resolution.\n       The fiscal year 2001 budget resolution authorized $5.5 \n     billion in economic assistance for those suffering through \n     low commodity prices in agriculture. However, these funds \n     must be dispersed by the US Department of Agriculture by \n     September 30, 2001. We are very concerned that any further \n     delay by Congress concerning these funds will severely hamper \n     USDA's efforts to release funds and will, in turn, be \n     detrimental to producers anxiously awaiting this relief.\n       We feel strongly that the Committee should disperse these \n     limited funds in a similar manner to the FY00 economic \n     assistance package--addressing the needs of the eight major \n     crops--corn, wheat, barley, oats, oilseeds, sorghum, rice and \n     cotton. It is these growers who have suffered greatly from \n     the last two years of escalating fuel and other input costs. \n     The expectation of these program crop farmers is certainly \n     for a continuation of the supplemental, AMTA at the 1999 \n     level.\n       Again, we urge the Committee to allocate the market loss \n     assistance payments at the FY99 production flexibility \n     contract payment level for program crops. We feel strongly \n     that Congress should support the growers getting hit hardest \n     by increasing input costs.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Lee Klein,\n\n                                          President, National Corn\n     Growers Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       National Farmers Union,\n\n                                        Aurora, CO, July 25, 2001.\n\n     Farmers Union Commends Senate on Emergency Assistance Package\n\n       Washington, D.C. (July 25, 2001).--The National Farmers \n     Union (NFU) today applauded the Senate Agriculture Committee \n     on its approval of $7.4 billion in emergency assistance for \n     U.S. agriculture producers. The bill provides supplemental \n     income assistance to feed grains, wheat, rice and cotton \n     producers as well as specialty crop producers. The Senate \n     measure provides the needed assistance at the same levels as \n     last year and is $2 billion more than what is provided in a \n     House version of the measure. NFU urges expeditious passage \n     by the full Senate and resolution in the House/Senate \n     conference committee that adopts the much needed funding at \n     the Senate level.\n       ``We commend Chairman Tom Harkin for his leadership in \n     crafting this assistance package,'' said Leland Swenson, \n     president of NFU. ``We are pleased that members of the \n     committee have chosen to provide funding that is comparable \n     to what many farmers requested at the start of this process. \n     This level of funding recognizes the needs that exist in \n     rural America at a time when farmers face continued low \n     commodity prices for row and specialty crops while input \n     costs for fuel, fertilizer and energy have risen rapidly over \n     the past year.''\n       The Senate Agriculture Committee approved the Emergency \n     Agriculture Assistance Act of 2001 that provides $7.4 billion \n     in emergency assistance to a broad range of agriculture \n     producers and funds conservation programs. It also provides \n     loans and grants to encourage value-added products, \n     compensation for damage to flooded lands and support for bio-\n     energy-based initiatives. The funding level is the same as \n     what was provided last year and is comparable to what NFU had \n     requested in order to meet today's needs for farmers and \n     ranchers. The House proposal provides $5.5 billion.\n       ``We now urge the full Senate to quickly pass this much-\n     needed assistance package,'' Swenson added. ``It is vital \n     that the House/Senate conference committee fund this measure \n     at the Senate level. As we meet the challenge of crafting a \n     new agriculture policy for the future, today's needs for \n     assistance are still great. We hope for swift action to help \n     America's farmers and ranchers.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n     National Barley Growers Association (NBGA)--Position Statement\n\n\n          income and market loss assistance for the 2001 crop\n\n       The Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 budget resolution provides $5.5 \n     billion in additional agricultural assistance for crop year \n     2001 and an increase of $73.5 billion in the agriculture \n     budget baseline through 2011. The budget resolution also \n     provided flexibility in the use of a total of $79 billion. \n     Because agricultural prices are not improving and production \n     costs continue to escalate, NBGA believes it will be \n     difficult to fully address the chronically ailing agriculture \n     economy if Congress provides no more than $5.5 billion in \n     assistance.\n       Although projections show a rise in farm income, this is \n     largely due to the fact that analysis project livestock cash \n     receipts to rise from $98.8 billion in 2000 to $106.6 billion \n     in 2001. At the same time, cash receipts from crop sales are \n     up less than $1 billion.\n       Further, producers continue to face historic low prices and \n     income as well as increased input costs. In 2000, farm \n     expenditures for fuel and oil, electricity, fertilizer and \n     crop protection chemicals are estimated to increase farmers' \n     cost $2.9 billion. This year, USDA estimates those expenses \n     will rise an additional $2 billion to $3 billion while farm \n     income continues to decrease. These issues affect every \n     sector of agriculture.\n       We urge Congress to mandate that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture make emergency economic assistance for the 2001 \n     crops in the form of a market loss assistance payment at the \n     1999 Production Flexibility Contract (PFC, or AMTA) payment \n     rate as soon as practicable prior to the end of FY01.\n       We beleive this additional assistance will help address the \n     serious economic conditions in the farm sector and does not \n     jeopardize the House and Senate Agriculture Committees' \n     ability to develop effective new long-term farm policy in the \n     near future.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     American Farm\n\n\n                                            Bureau Federation,\n\n                                    Park Ridge, IL, July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     supports at least $5.5 billion in supplemental Agricultural \n     Market Transition Act payments and $500 million in market \n     loss assistance payments for oilseeds as part of the \n     emergency spending package for crop year 2001. We also \n     believe it is imperative to offer assistance to peanut, fruit \n     and vegetable producers. In addition, it is crucial to extend \n     the dairy price support in this bill since the current \n     program will expire in less than two months.\n       All over this country agriculture has been facing historic \n     low prices and increasing production costs. These challenges \n     have had a singificant effect on the incomes of U.S. \n     producers. At the same time, projections of improvement for \n     the near future are not very optimistic. We appreciate your \n     leadership in providing assistance to address the low-income \n     situation that U.S. producers are currently facing.\n       We thank you for your leadership and look forward to \n     working with you to provide assistance for agricultural \n     producers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned oilseed producer \n     organizations strongly support the Committee's efforts to \n     complete consideration of legislation to provide Economic \n     Loss Assistance to producers of 2001 crops prior to the \n     August Congressional work period. As you know, funds \n     available for this purpose in FY-2001 must be expended before \n     the end of the Fiscal Year on September 30, 2001. This \n     deadline requires that Congress complete action this week, so \n     that the Farm Service Agency can process payments after \n     enactment.\n       As part of the Economic Loss Assistance package, we support \n     continuing the level of support for oilseeds provided in last \n     year's plan of $500 million. Prices for oilseeds are at or \n     below levels experienced for the 2000 crop. Farmers and their \n     lenders expect Congress to maintain oilseed payments at last \n     year's levels.\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\n       For this reason, we support making funds available for \n     oilseed payments from the $7.35 billion provided in the \n     Budget Resolution for FY-2002. This is the same approach used \n     for 2000 crop oilseeds, when $500 million in FY-2001 funds \n     were made available. We only ask that oilseed producers \n     receive the same support, and in the same manner, provided \n     last year.\n       Thank you very much for your efforts to provide fair and \n     equitable treatment for oilseed producers in this time of \n     severe economic hardship.\n           Sincerely yours.\n     Bart Ruth,\n       President, American Soybean Assn.\n     Lloyd Klein,\n       President, National Sunflower Assn.\n     Steve Dahl,\n       President, U.S. Canola Assn.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 National Wildlife Federation,\n\n                                        Reston, VA, July 27, 2001.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate, Chairman, Senate Agriculture Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: On behalf of the National Wildlife \n     Federation (NWF) and its more than 4 million members and \n     supporters nationwide, I would like to thank for your strong \n     leadership in providing significant funding for conservation \n     programs within the Emergency Agricultural Aid Package passed \n     by the Senate Agriculture Committee earlier this week.\n       For too many years, conservation programs have been \n     overlooked as viable and sustainable solutions to the \n     emergency needs of agricultural producers suffering from the \n     results of flooding and drought. As you are aware, programs \n     such as the Wetlands Reserve Program and Floodplain Easement \n     Program put needed funds into the hands of farmers at the \n     same time that they take disaster-prone land out of \n     production, reducing the need for future disaster assistance. \n     Thanks to your efforts, such programs will be considered as \n     components of agricultural disaster assistance this year. We \n     look forward to working with you to ensure that this funding \n     is retained during floor consideration of the bill and in \n     conference with the House.\n       Once again, we thank you for your work in support of \n     conservation programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Mark Van Putten,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            The American Dietetic Association,\n\n                                           Chicago, July 31, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, U.S. \n         Senate, Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Attn: Karil Bialostosky.\n\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: ADA is writing to go on record in \n     support of several nutrition provisions proposed in the \n     Emergency Agricultural Assistance Act of 2001 (S. 1246). \n     These provisions move programs in the right direction by \n     increasing consumer access to healthful foods. The American \n     Dietetic Association promotes optimal nutrition and well \n     being for all people by advocating for its members--70,000 \n     nutrition professionals who are the leading providers of food \n     and nutrition services in the United States.\n       All consumers in the United States should have access to a \n     wide variety of safe, affordable and nutritious foods. ADA \n     urges Congress to support agriculture policy and fund \n     programs that help Americans follow a diet consistent with \n     the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans. The Commodity \n     Purchases provision (Title I, Section 108) and Sections 301, \n     302, 303 and 304 of the Nutrition Title (Title III) move \n     toward that goal.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Katherine J.

I ask again, Mr. President, who knows better what the \nfarmers of America need, OMB and the bean counters or the National Corn \nGrowers Association? Who knows better what our farmers need, the people \ndown at the White House running around those corridors down there or \nthe American Soybean Association and our soybean farmers? Who knows \nbetter about what our farmers need, the people down at OMB who say we \nonly need three-fourths of what we had last year or the farmers of \nAmerica, through their representatives here, who have said time and \ntime again the House bill is inadequate?\n  To show you how bad it really is, here is a letter dated today to me \nfrom the American Soybean Association, the National Corn Growers \nAssociation, the National Association of Wheat Growers, and the \nNational Cotton Council, sent to me in my capacity as chairman of the \nSenate Agriculture Committee.\n  It says:\n\n       The undersigned organizations are concerned that despite \n     your best efforts to develop an emergency assistance package, \n     the Senate's efforts to respond to the severe economic crisis \n     facing agriculture will be unsuccessful unless emergency \n     agricultural legislation is enacted prior to the August \n     recess. With the House of Representatives already in recess, \n     the only course available to the Senate to ensure that \n     farmers receive $5.5 billion of funds earmarked for 2001 is \n     to pass H.R. 2213 as passed by the House.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                   August 3, 2001.\n     Re Emergency Assistance for Agriculture.\n\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The undersigned organizations are \n     concerned that despite your best efforts to develop an \n     emergency assistance package, the Senate's efforts to respond \n     to the severe economic crisis facing agriculture will be \n     unsuccessful unless emergency agricultural legislation is \n     enacted prior to the August recess. With the House of \n     Representatives already in recess, the only course available \n     to the Senate to ensure that farmers receive $5.5 billion of \n     funds earmarked for 2001 is to pass H.R. 2213 as passed by \n     the House.\n       In order to avoid the very real possibility these budgeted \n     funds will be lost, we urge the Senate to take the necessary \n     action and pass H.R. 2213 without amendment and send the bill \n     to the President. Without timely action, we face the prospect \n     of missing the budget-imposed September 30 deadline and \n     forfeiting this crucial financial aid.\n       With prices of many commodities even lower than 2000, with \n     increased costs for fuel and other inputs, and with severe \n     weather in some regions, U.S. farmers need this assistance \n     package more than ever. It is imperative that Congress \n     complete its work right away.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our request.\n           Sincerely,\n       American Soybean Association.\n       National Corn Growers Association.\n       National Association of Wheat Growers.\n       National Cotton Council.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, again, I want you to know how proud I am \nto have stood side by side with the American Soybean Association, the \nNational Corn Growers Association, the National Association Of Wheat \nGrowers, and the National Cotton Council. We have fought side by side \nto respond to the dire needs of our farmers in America.\n  But, as this letter shows, we have a gun held to our heads. If we \ndon't pass that House bill today, we risk losing even that amount of \nmoney.\n  We have this confrontation. I had hoped that the President would be \nwilling to meet with us to seek some reasonable compromise. After all, \nthis President came to town saying he wanted to be a conciliator. He \nwanted to work together in a bipartisan fashion to seek compromise. We \nwant to seek compromise. The House passed $5.5 billion. We passed $7.5 \nbillion. We were willing to meet and discuss and work out some \ncompromise. The White House was unwilling to meet and unwilling to \ncompromise.\n  I have heard time after time speeches on the other side of the \nSenate. I have heard from my Republican friends saying how bad it is in \nagriculture and how much we need this assistance. But, obviously, the \nPresident has said no.\n  In my conversations with the head of OMB last night, I kept saying: \nWhy? For what reason is it $5.5 billion or nothing? He said that is our \nnumber--5.5. It was almost like a mantra. He said: It is 5.5, and we \nare not going to budge from it.\n  It is one thing to have a strong position, but it is another thing to \nhave a position in which you have taken a strong stand that does not \ncorrelate with the facts. The facts are that farmers and rural America \nneed a lot more help than what this House bill provides.\n  Again, I point out what the difference between the House-passed bill \nand the Senate bill means for our farmers around America. These are the \npayments that would go out to farmers in a number of States in this \ncountry.\n  In this column, we see what the Senate bill would provide. We see in \nthis column the House bill. The comparisons are just on the commodity \ntitle, but do not include the specialty crop purchases or House bill \nspecialty crop payments to states. This is how much each State will \nlose because the President refused to compromise.\n  Washington State will lose $103 million for their farmers. That is \nthe difference between what the Senate bill had and what the House bill \nhad. Washington State farmers will get $75 million from the House bill. \nWe had $178\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\nmillion in our bill for Washington State farmers. Washington farmers \nare going to be hurt and hurt badly. So will their community banks; so \nwill the auto dealers; so will the hardware stores; the feed stores; \nand, everyone else in those small towns all over the State of \nWashington.\n  In Iowa, in my home State, farmers will lose $91.47 million because \nthe President said no, again just on the commodity title and not \ncounting conservation, for example.\n  In Minnesota, they will lose $82.7 million; Texas, $82.4 million. In \nthe President's home State, farmers are going to lose $82.42 million.\n  In Illinois, they will lose $81.6 million. In Nebraska, they will \nlose $65.2 million; Kansas will lose $61.7 million for their farmers; \nNorth Dakota, $60.7 million; California, $52.5 million; Arkansas will \nlose $43.9 million for their farmers; Indiana will lose $40.12 million; \nLouisiana, $32 million; South Dakota, $32 million; Missouri, $31 \nmillion; Michigan, $31 million; Ohio, $29 million; Montana, $24 \nmillion; Wisconsin, $24 million; Idaho, $23.9 million; Oklahoma, $22.8 \nmillion; Mississippi, $22 million.\n  That is what the House bill is going to cost the farmers in those \nStates because the President said no. The President is determined that \nthe House bill was sufficient to take care of the farmers in those \nStates.\n  Time and time again I see the President visiting farms. How many \nfarms is he going to have to visit before he gets the picture and \nbefore he understands what is happening in rural America?\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter of \nMarch 13 sent to the Honorable Pete Domenici, chairman --at that time--\nof the Budget Committee. It was signed by 21 Members of the Senate \nasking that the 2001 Agriculture Market Transition Act payment be the \nsame as it was last year. The letter went on to say how bad things are \nin rural America with high production costs, fuel, fertilizer, and \ninterest rates with projections that farm income will not improve in \nthe near future. It says:\n\n       We believe it is vitally important to provide at least as \n     much total economic assistance for 2001 and 2002 as was \n     provided for the 2000 crop.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter and the accompanying \nsignatures be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   March 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Pete: We are writing to request your assistance in \n     including appropriate language in the FY02 budget resolution \n     so that emergency economic loss assistance can be made \n     available for 2001 and 2002 or until a replacement for the \n     1996 Farm Bill can be enacted. Specifically, since conditions \n     are not appreciably improved for 2001, we support making \n     market loss assistance available so that the total amount of \n     assistance available through the 2001 Agricultural Market \n     Transition Act payment and the Market Loss Assistance \n     payments will be the same as was available for the 2000 crop. \n     We understand it is unusual to ask that funds to be made \n     available in the current fiscal year be provided in a budget \n     resolution covering the next fiscal year, but the financial \n     stress in U.S. agriculture is extraordinary.\n       According to USDA and other prominent agriculture \n     economists, the U.S. agricultural economy continues to face \n     persistent low prices and depressed farm income. According to \n     testimony presented by USDA on February 14, 2001, ``a strong \n     rebound in farm prices and income from the market place for \n     major crops appears unlikely . . . assuming no supplemental \n     assistance, net cash farm income in 2001 is projected to be \n     the lowest level since 1994 and about $4 billion below the \n     average of the 1990's.'' The USDA statement also said . . . \n     ``(a) national farm financial crisis has not occurred in \n     large part due to record government payments and greater off-\n     farm income.''\n       In addition to sluggish demand and chronically low prices, \n     U.S. farmers and ranchers are experiencing rapidly increasing \n     input costs including fuel, fertilizer and interest rates. \n     According to USDA, ``increases in petroleum prices and \n     interest rates along with higher prices for other inputs, \n     including hired labor increased farmers' production expenses \n     by 4 percent or $7.6 billion in 2000, and for 2001 cash \n     production expenses are forecast to increase further. At the \n     same time, major crop prices for the 2000-01 season are \n     expected to register only modest improvement from last year's \n     15-25 year lows, reflecting another year of large global \n     production of major crops and ample stocks.''\n       During the last 3 years, Congress has provided significant \n     levels of emergency economic assistance through so-called \n     Market Loss Assistance payments and disaster assistance for \n     weather related losses. During the last three years, the \n     Commodity Credit Corporation has provided about $72 billion \n     in economic and weather related loss assistance and \n     conservation payments. The Congressional Budget Office and \n     USDA project that expenditures for 2001 will be $14-17 \n     billion without additional market or weather loss assistance. \n     With projections that farm income will not improve in the \n     near future, we believe it is vitally important to provide at \n     least as much total economic assistance for 2001 and 2002 as \n     was provided for the 2000 crop.\n       Congress has begun to evaluate replacement farm policy. In \n     order to provide effective, predictable financial support \n     which also allows farmers and ranchers to be competitive, \n     sufficient funding will be needed to allow the Agriculture \n     Committee to ultimately develop a comprehensive package \n     covering major commodities in addition to livestock and \n     specialty crops, rural development, trade, and conservation \n     initiatives. Until new legislation can be enacted, it is \n     essential that Congress provide emergency economic assistance \n     necessary to alleviate the current financial crisis.\n       We realize these recommendations add significantly to \n     projected outlays for farm programs. Our farmers and ranchers \n     clearly prefer receiving their income from the market. \n     However, while they strive to further reduce costs and expand \n     markets, federal assistance will be necessary until \n     conditions improve.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n         Thad Conchran, John Breaux, Tim Hutchinson, Mary \n           Landrieu, Kit Bond, Blanche Lincoln, Jim Bunning, Mitch \n           McConnell, Max Cleland, Jeff Sessions, Richard Shelby, \n           Jesse Helms, Larry Craig, James Inhofe, Strom Thurmond, \n           Zell Miller, Craig Thomas, Chuck Hagel, Peter \n           Fitzgerald, Bill Frist, Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, nothing has changed. I can only assume my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle would like to have had more \nmoney for our farmers. They would like to have had the Senate-passed \nbill to provide 100 percent of AMTA because this is what they asked \nfor. That is what we put in the Senate bill. But, obviously, the \nPresident said no. The President said no; farmers had enough.\n  I also point out what else was in our bill in terms of conservation. \nOur bill provided funding for a number of USDA conservation programs. \nThe Wetlands Reserve Program, the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, \nand Farmland Protection Program are all in jeopardy because the House \nbill has zero dollars for conservation.\n  Let me show you what it is in terms of all of the funding for these \nprograms.\n  Here is the Wetlands Reserve Program. Right now the total backlog is \nabout $568 million. In our bill, we had $200 million for the Wetlands \nReserve Program to cut that in half. Here are the top 10 States that \nneed funding for the Wetlands Reserve Program.\n  I see my friend and colleague from Arkansas, a distinguished member \nof our committee, here in the Chamber. Arkansas has $89 million in \nbacklog for the Wetlands Reserve Program. These are all eligible \nenrollments. But we don't have the money for it. At least our bill \nwould have cut that almost in half.\n  Iowa, my State, $81.9 million; California, $78.9 million; Louisiana, \n$69 million; Mississippi, $18 million. All of these States have \nbacklogs for the Wetlands Reserve Program. The House provides zero \ndollars. That puts the Wetlands Reserve Program in jeopardy.\n  We have the Farmland Protection Program to help buy easements to keep \nour farmland in farmland rather than in urban sprawl. The total U.S. \nbacklog is $255 million. We had $40 million in our bill, which coupled \nwith money from the States, local governments and non-profit \norganizations would have helped a lot to save farmland. The House bill \nhad zero dollars for that.\n  Under the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program, the backlog is $14 \nmillion. We had $7 million in our bill, again to cut that backlog in \nhalf.\n  Here are all the States with all of the backlogs that we could have \nhelped in the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program.\n  Lastly, Environmental Quality Incentives Program, with a backlog of \n$1.3 billion. We had $250 million in our bill to reduce that down.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfour charts showing the backlogs in USDA conservation programs for a \nnumber of States.\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                        Wetlands Reserve Program\n\n                  [Total U.S. Backlog = $568,772,170]\n\n\n                             top 10 states\n\nArkansas....................................................$89,102,486\nIowa.........................................................81,965,541\nCalifornia...................................................78,988,416\nLouisiana....................................................69,656,427\nMissouri.....................................................41,111,255\nFlorida......................................................27,539,000\nMinnesota....................................................25,017,968\nIllinois.....................................................24,986,434\nMichigan.....................................................20,500,000\nMississippi..................................................18,173,136\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation \nService.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                      Farmland Protection Program\n\n                  [Total U.S. Backlog = $255,677,581]\n\n\n                             top 10 states\n\nCalifornia..................................................$47,692,183\nNew York.....................................................33,760,639\nMaryland.....................................................29,531,511\nFlorida......................................................18,799,852\nPennsylvania.................................................15,908,572\nDelaware.....................................................12,926,040\nKentucky.....................................................12,290,000\nMichigan.....................................................11,579,235\nNew Jersey...................................................10,692,132\nMassachusetts................................................10,465,820\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation \nService.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                  Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program\n\n                   [Total U.S. Backlog = $14,447,989]\n\n\n                             top 10 states\n\nOregon.......................................................$1,129,115\nTexas.........................................................1,100,000\nFlorida.......................................................1,040,000\nWest Virginia.................................................1,030,472\nArkansas........................................................920,000\nColorado........................................................770,000\nMaine...........................................................650,000\nMichigan........................................................613,434\nAlabama.........................................................548,000\nSouth Dakota....................................................529,395\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation \nService.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                Environmental Quality Incentives Program\n\n                 [Total U.S. Backlog = $1,378,348,711]\n\n\n                             top 10 states\n\nTexas......................................................$175,615,986\nOklahoma.....................................................60,684,644\nGeorgia......................................................55,908,744\nArkansas.....................................................53,263,407\nKansas.......................................................49,142,061\nMontana......................................................46,421,056\nKentucky.....................................................44,107,218\nNebraska.....................................................42,912,850\nTennessee....................................................40,772,836\nVirginia.....................................................39,795,591\n\nSource: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation \nService.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. These States have tremendous backlogs and needs in the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program to help clean up the water and \nconserve resources in these States. We had about $\\1/2\\ billion in our \nbill to help all of the States meet the environmental standards and \nneeds in States.\n  Many of the farmers in these States have to meet environmental \nstandards, and even without requirements, farmers and ranchers strive \nto take care of the land. They want to do their best to be good \nstewards. In many cases farmers are doing this out of their own pockets \nwith their own machinery and their own time.\n  I believe we need to help them. We need to help these farmers meet \nthese environmental standards. Yet the House bill provides nothing.\n  It is too bad that the President would not even meet with us and \nwould not try to work out some decent compromise. We were willing. The \nPresident said, no. They made their point they were only going to have \n$5.5 billion for our farmers; they were not going to have any \nconservation.\n  We also wanted to broaden this bill out to address the needs of our \nspecialty crop producers in America, the people who raise peas and \nlentils and apples and all the other fruits and vegetables that are \npart of our great bounty that we have in this country. These farmers \nare hurting, too. We tried to help them. The House bill does a little \nbit, but hardly anything at all, to help these beleaguered farmers.\n  Lastly, I want to say--and I want to make this point one more time, \nas I made it to OMB and to the White House--the $7.5 billion that we \nhad in our bill fully complied with the budget. No budget point of \norder would lay against our bill. We had $5.5 billion in fiscal year \n2001. We used $2 billion of the $7.35 billion that was allowed us in \n2002. We did not bust any budgets. We stayed within the budget. We met \nour obligations, and we met our obligations both to fiscal \nresponsibility and also our responsibility to the farmers of this \ncountry.\n  So I will close by saying that the fight goes on. This Senator, and I \nam sure many other Senators in this body, are not going to give up. The \nPresident got his way because he has the veto.\n  I am hopeful that we can work with the White House in August and in \nSeptember, and going into this fall, on two things. One is to shape and \nfashion a new farm bill that will get us off the failed policies of the \npast. There is no doubt in anyone's mind that the Freedom to Farm bill \nhas failed, and failed miserably. We need a new farm bill. We need a \nnew vision of agriculture in America. We need a farm bill that will \nmove us into the 21st century.\n  I look forward to working with the administration and with the \nSecretary of Agriculture, for whom I have the highest regard and \nrespect, to fashion that new farm bill.\n  I also hope that as we go into the fall, we should come back and see \nwhat we might need to fill the gap between the end of September and \nwhenever the farm bill is passed. The House bill we passed shorted \nfarmers in Iowa and across the nation. The market loss and oilseed \npayments were cut back. The specialty crops were left out. Conservation \nwas left out. Some assistance to our dairy farmers was left out. I hope \nwe can come back in September--maybe early October--and revisit this \nand, hopefully, have the help and the support of the White House at \nthat time to at least fill in that gap. That is what we tried to do in \nthis bill, to fill in the gap from the end of September until such time \nas the farm bill is passed and enacted to make sure that our programs \nfor conservation were not interrupted, and to make sure that farmers \nwere taken care of.\n  The fiscal year may end on September 30, but the crop-year does not. \nFarmers need help in October and November.\n  So hope springs eternal. The fight goes on. We will never give up the \nfight to provide the kind of assistance and support that our farmers \nand our farm families need--and not just those in the Midwest, but \nthose in Michigan and New York and Washington State and all over this \ncountry, to make sure that those farm families are able to continue and \nto provide the agricultural products that we need for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8861-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow).

Madam President, I join the distinguished chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee in saying the fight always goes on for American \nfarmers. In the Agriculture Committee we have that commitment. And it \nis one we take with a great deal of pride and, likewise, with a high \nenergy level. But today, Madam President, let me just say American \nfarmers rejoice because a remarkable thing has occurred in this Senate \nChamber this morning. We have come together with our colleagues in the \nHouse to pass a bill, which now, through some effort, will go to the \nHouse, to the President for signature, and to American farmers.\n  Let me just say the benefits to American farmers are very \nsubstantial. We began this quest because American farmers, according to \nthe best estimate of the USDA, would receive--without our action--$3 \nbillion less in aggregate cash income this year. We have, by our \nactions this morning, sent to American farmers $5.5 billion. We have, \nin fact, exceeded the gap and, as a matter of fact, made certain that \nagricultural income in America for this year will be $2.5 billion more \nthan last year.\n  That has not escaped the attention of a good number of agricultural \norganizations that have beneficiaries. The\n\n[[Page S8862]]\n\nAmerican Soybean Association, the National Corn Growers Association, \nthe National Association of Wheat Growers, the National Cotton Council, \nand the U.S. Rice Producers Group have all written this morning to the \nchairman, with a copy of their letter to me, simply urging the Senate \n``to take the necessary action and pass H.R. 2213''--the House bill--\n``without amendment and send the bill to the President.''\n  Each of these groups wrote to the chairman: ``Without timely action, \nwe face the prospect of missing the budget-imposed September 30 \ndeadline and forfeiting this crucial financial aid.'' I mention that \nbecause I appreciate their commendation of our work and their \nencouragement that we do precisely what we have done this morning.\n  I want to mention that it is important that all Members understand \nwhat we have done; namely, that through the so-called AMTA payments, \n$4.622 billion in supplemental payments will be sent to producers in \nthe next few days; $424 million in market loss payments to soybean \nproducers and other oilseed producers, who received this assistance \nlast year, will be distributed in the next few days; $159 million in \nassistance to producers of specialty crops, such as fruits and \nvegetables, will receive their money through our block grants to the \nStates.\n  I make that point because the only way in which money could \nconceivably have gotten to any specialty group would have been through \nthese block grants to States and a distribution after finding the \nrecipients in each of those States. I make that point because there \nalways was an illusion that somehow money to specialty crops could come \nin some other way, but there are not good lists, the criteria, and the \nother aspects that have surrounded the so-called program crops. \nTherefore, this was an essential point, if the specialty crop \nrecipients were to get their money before September 30. And $129 \nmillion in market loss assistance will go to tobacco farmers, whose \nnames and addresses are well known to USDA; $54 million, likewise, to \npeanut growers; $85 million for cotton seed; $17 million for wool and \nmohair producers; and $10 million of emergency food assistance support.\n  I make these points because each one of us may have a wish list of \nthose that we would like to receive money. The purpose of this action, \nthe reason that both Houses have taken action--and we have done so \nunanimously this morning--is that we saw a gap for American agriculture \nin total. We have tried to fill the gap. In committing compromises and \nbicameral compromises, we have tried to make certain that assistance \ncame to the normal program recipients since the time of the 1930s, the \nspecialty crops, and to many others who were identified in previous \nsupplemental bills of the last 2 years.\n  I regret there is difficulty with regard to the stance of the \nPresident. I simply want to support the President very strongly in the \naction he took.\n  First of all, he supported the $5.5 billion of payments. He pointed \nout, as I have this morning, that if these are to make a difference for \nfarmers, they need to be received now. They need to make their \nappointments with the country bankers as required and make certain that \nthey stay in business. It is easy enough for us to speculate that if we \ndid not take action now or if we took action in the by and by, somehow \nmore might be obtained.\n  The fact is, more was not going to be obtained for farmers now. The \nonly way in which money could be obtained was, first of all, following \nthe budget resolution so a point of order was not entered; secondly, \nrecognizing that the money destined for next year in the Senate \nAgriculture Committee's original bill was very likely to be taken off \nthe table before it was distributed.\n  I want to make the point again that we suggested earlier in the \ndebate: While we are in recess, OMB and CBO are going to come forward \nwith estimates of our national budget picture. Almost every prediction \nis that these estimates will downsize the amount of money that is \nanticipated to be coming into the Federal Government, the amount of the \nsurplus, the amount of money, in fact, for the appropriations bills, \neight of which are still to be considered by the Senate.\n  Already the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, the distinguished ranking member, Senators Byrd and Stevens, \nare cautioning the subcommittees in appropriations not to exceed the \nallocations of money they have received. They are cautioning them \nbecause they are pointing out the money simply may not be there.\n  We were in a position that if we did not take action now, it is very \nconceivable that the money that was destined for American farmers might \nnot have been there either. The number of claimants, whether in \ndefense, in health, in education, in all the various aspects of \nAmerican life, are very considerable. We have pinned down for American \nfarmers today money that we want to go to American farmers. We have \ndone so in a responsible way. We have done so with the support of the \nPresident of the United States and both Houses of the Congress. That is \nno minor achievement in an agricultural piece of legislation.\n  Let me point out one further thing about the President of the United \nStates; that is, he is determined, as I hope most of us are, to be \nresponsible with regard to money. We have had years in this body in \nwhich Members were more or less responsible--sometimes less. As a \nconsequence, large deficits were the result.\n  In a bipartisan way, we have determined those days ought to be over. \nIt does require that, finally, we do our very best to conform to the \nbudget, that we respect the rights at least of all the other claimants \nto Federal funds, including taxpayers. The President is simply saying: \nI am going to do my duty. If I see things exceeding the budget, I am \ngoing to veto those bills.\n\n  He has said that with regard to our Agriculture Committee bill. If it \nexceeds $5.5 billion, I am going to veto it. The President said that to \nme personally at 3:40 yesterday afternoon, face to face. So there was \nno doubt. He did not hide behind a letter from OMB, did not suggest \nthat unnamed advisers necessarily were speaking for him. He came to the \nCapitol twice during this week and talked about the trust he has in \nbehalf of the American people, all of the American people, for the \nintegrity of our financial system and the integrity of Social Security \nand Medicare and all of the educational plans he has worked with the \nCongress to forward and all the plans for health care for the elderly \nthat he is working with the Congress to forward.\n  All of these are also our objectives. They fit together only if there \nis a certain degree of discipline and order.\n  The President has said: I am going to provide that. You can count on \nme.\n  His credibility is at stake when he says that. Sometimes Presidents \nsay, perhaps if this doesn't work out, this and that will occur. This \nPresident said: If this exceeds $5.5 billion, I am going to veto it.\n  I believed that. This morning, the Senate has believed that. The \nHouse believed that. We have a result in conformity with the budget. \nThat is a victory for the American people likewise, as well as for \nagricultural America.\n  Now it has, in fact, more money than the year before but some \nassurance that we are not going to have fiscal irresponsibility again, \nrampant inflation, the difficulties that come when there is not solid \nleadership at the top and in this body.\n  Finally, let me say that it has been a pleasure for me to work on \nthis bill with members of the Agriculture Committee, our chairman, \nSenator Harkin, with the present occupant of the chair, Ms. Stabenow, \nwith many Members who had diverse views.\n  One of the aspects of our committee I have found--my service is now \nin its 25th year--is that we do have diverse views because we come from \nconstituents who believe very strongly about these issues and who want \nour advocacy and our support. We try to do that. I think we listen to \neach other, and we understand that there is not simply one crop in \nAmerica that is dominant, that we are a very diverse group in terms of \nour interests. It is amazing how we are able to come together for good \nresults.\n  I believe we have come together for a good result on this day. I \nappreciate, even as I say that--I see the faces and hear the words of \nthe Members--that not every aspect of this result is in conformity with \nwhat we might have wished would have occurred. I made the admission, as \nI was offering an\n\n[[Page S8863]]\n\namendment the other day--which failed narrowly by 52-48--that this is \nnot exactly the amendment I would have started with or the one maybe I \nwould have finished with. Nevertheless, it was an amendment that \nreflected the views of Members of the House and many members of our \ncommittee and, in my judgment, was in the realm of the possible. That \nis the final criteria for agricultural bills. It takes very little \nskill to paint a picture of all of the money that might go to various \nStates or people or crops or groups in America. Simply to add them up \nand say, here is the total, believe me, all of these are good folks and \nall need the money. That is true. They are all good, and they all need \nthe money. Agriculture does not pay well.\n  The facts of life are that money that goes into agriculture is very \nimportant, not only for the recipients but for our country, for the \ncontinuity of all of our States and small towns in the rural areas that \nwe try to support.\n  At the same time, most farmers I know understand that funds are not \navailable for everything. They want people of common sense to make \ncertain that there is something at the end of the rainbow as opposed to \nblue-sky thinking and more grandiose schemes.\n  In due course, we are going to have an opportunity, under the \nleadership of our chairman, the distinguished Senator from Iowa, to \nconsider a farm bill this year or next, or whatever the context may be \nin the scheduling of the distinguished chairman. I will join him \nenthusiastically, as I suspect the occupant of the chair will, as we \ntake a look at conservation programs that are very important for \nAmerica, for rural development programs that are important, not just \nfor farmers but often for the second income for farmers and their \nfamilies and those who are important to agricultural production in \nAmerica.\n  We are going to take a look, I hope, at nutrition programs that make \na very sizable difference for many Americans beyond production in \nagriculture. This scope of our committee's activities is broad, as \nbroad as food, nutrition, and forestry might imply, and that is \nexciting.\n  I think we are going to have a superb farm bill, and I hope we will \nbe able to work closely with our friends in the House, with the White \nHouse, with everybody, so we move along together without \nmisunderstandings and have the best sort of result at the end of the \nroad with the greatest amount of agreement.\n  I trust in the course of brokering all of these different ideas there \nwill be some disagreement, and ultimately we will have to make hard \nchoices. I am prepared to work on that project with that thought firmly \nin mind, and I look forward to it. For the moment, I believe we have \ngreat news this morning for farmers in America but likewise for the \ncitizens of our country because we have acted in a responsible way. We \nwill have even better news as we proceed into a new farm bill and take \na comprehensive look at all the ways we might affect the lives of \nAmericans in a very constructive way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I know the Senator from New York is next \nup to speak, and I ask unanimous consent that I speak for about 3 \nminutes without jeopardizing her right to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Washington, Ms. Cantwell, be added to the list of speakers and be \nallowed to speak for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I take this time to express my deep \ngratitude to my ranking member, my good friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana, to thank him for the graciousness he has given to \nme, first when he was chairman and I was ranking member and now when I \nam chairman and he is ranking member. I could not ask for a better \npartner on the Senate Agriculture Committee than Senator Lugar. We have \nworked very closely together.\n  This legislative disagreement we had here this week again reminds me \nof why this is called the crucible of democracy. We grind these issues \nout in time and we move ahead, which is what I have always loved about \nthe legislative process. Friends can differ. We can fight these things \nout and work them out, and we move ahead.\n  I am quite taken by what the distinguished ranking member said about \nlooking ahead on the farm bill. We have discussed this personally, in \nprivate, many times.\n  Everything the distinguished ranking member just mentioned is \nsomething I feel strongly about and feel deeply about. I believe we are \ngoing to have many, many opportunities to work together this fall to \nfashion a new farm bill, as the distinguished ranking member said, that \nlooks at the broad spectrum of agriculture beyond just production but \nall of the aspects of agriculture.\n  I am quite heartened by his words and, again, I want the Senator from \nIndiana to know how much I really appreciate the many kindnesses he and \nhis staff have shown to me and my staff through all of the processes of \nthe changes that have come about this summer, and working on this bill, \nand I really look forward to working with him on the development of the \nnew farm bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I also thank the chairman and ranking \nmember for not only the work they have done on this bill but the work \nthey will do on the farm bill this fall. I know this is a difficult \nmatter.\n  Both the chairman and the ranking member have outlined the challenges \nahead of us, but I know everyone in this Chamber is ready and willing \nto work together to get a result that will be not only fair to our \nfarmers but will recognize the full extent of both agricultural and \nconservation needs that go hand in hand with agriculture throughout our \ncountry.\n  I rise today to say a few words about agriculture in New York because \nI have noticed many of my colleagues are surprised there is agriculture \nin New York. Many people, perhaps some in the gallery today, think of \nNew York and think of New York City. They may fly into LaGuardia or out \nof JFK. They do not get a chance to travel throughout the State to see \nthe beauty of the scenery and to know how important agriculture is to \nthe livelihood, the economy, and the future of New York.\n  In every section of New York, even surprisingly in some of the \nboroughs of New York City, there are still some agricultural interests. \nMuch of the State, from St. Lawrence to Orleans, to the entire southern \ntier out into Long Island, agriculture remains a critical part of the \nfabric of life in New York and is a crucial livelihood for countless \nNew Yorkers.\n  In fact, agriculture still is the No. 1 economic sector in New York, \nwhich would come, I suppose, as a surprise to many people from the \nMidwest or the South. I have been fortunate, having grown up in the \nMidwest--actually in Illinois, right between the chairman and the \nranking member of the Agriculture Committee--to know a little bit about \nMidwest agriculture. Then I have been honored to have lived in \nArkansas, for which good friend Senator Lincoln, having come from a \nfarming family, is a champion, so I know full well how critical \nagriculture is in the Midwest, in the South, in the West, but I do not \nwant anyone in this Chamber or anyone in our country to overlook or \nforget how important agriculture is in the Northeast and particularly \nin the State of New York.\n\n  I received a letter from a farmer in Kent, NY. What he has written \ncould be written from the chairman's State or the ranking member's \nState. I want to read what he said:\n\n       I am writing this letter with great concern on behalf of \n     our family farm. Our family farm was started in early 1900 by \n     my grandfather and grandmother when they came to America from \n     England. I started working on the farm as a young man at the \n     age of 7 by riding with my father and watching how to work \n     and how to make a living, by providing food for the world in \n     which we live. Now at age 46, I sit back and try to evaluate \n     what is wrong with our agriculture picture.\n       Our cost of production has gone through the roof as fuel, \n     labor and growing mandates are taking our profit out of the \n     picture. Our fresh fruit apples, after being packed out of \n     storage, have a slim chance to exceed the cost of production.\n       Our vegetable operation, along with our grain crops, are in \n     the same position, due to\n\n[[Page S8864]]\n\n     commodity prices that are lower than 25 years ago, but yet \n     fuel prices alone have more than doubled in 15 months.\n\n  He goes on to write:\n\n       Usually, there is always one commodity that excels each \n     year to offset the poorer priced ones, but that has not \n     happened in the past year. Your first response is to get your \n     cost of production down and to establish a higher yield, but \n     we have exhausted all of these options. Every time we have a \n     potential for a commodity price increase, one of our \n     competitors ship across the borders, keep prices low and here \n     we sit in New York just trying to survive.\n       I have a great deal of pride and want to do my part to keep \n     agriculture the number one industry in our County of Orleans, \n     State of New York. Let us get agriculture out of this \n     situation and back on track immediately.\n\n  I could not agree with this gentleman more. What I hope we are going \nto be able to do, as the chairman, the ranking member, and the \ncommittee members craft their farming bill for this fall, is to make \nsure those of us who may not be on the committee but who represent \nfarmers and a farming State, no matter how difficult that may be for \nsome to believe, will also be at that table because we have to be heard \non behalf of our farmers.\n  I want to point to this chart. In 1964, there were 66,510 family \nfarms. In 1997, we are down to 31,757. Certainly, some of those farms \nwere lost because New York grew. The county I live in became pricey, \nchoice real estate for people who wanted to live near New York City. We \nare fighting to preserve the farmland we still have left in Westchester \nCounty.\n  We know there were inevitable changes. No one is arguing against the \ninevitability of change that is going to take farmland out of \nproduction, but in many parts of our State we lost population. There \nwas not population pressure forcing people into the country, therefore \ndoing away with available farmland. We lost farmland because our \nfarmers were not given a fair shake, were not given the tools with \nwhich to compete.\n  As we look at the farm bill, I hope we are going to also look at the \nimportant essential role farmers play in conservation, preserving our \nrural countryside, making it possible to have high water quality and \nwildlife habitat. I know if it were not for farmers all up and down the \nMidwest and the South, there would not be as many ducks to hunt every \nyear. I know farmers have played a critical role in preserving wildlife \nhabitat for hunters and for the enjoyment of so many other people.\n  Farmers have a role not only in producing quality, affordable food, \nbut also improving water quality and wildlife habitat, restoring \nwetlands, and protecting farmland from further development. I hope we \nare going to get some of that conservation assistance in the farm bill \ncoming this fall. I would have preferred by far the bill that came out \nof the committee in the Senate. That was not possible because of the \nPresident's veto threat. That is what the ranking member just \nexplained. I deeply regret that.\n  As the chairman, Senator Harkin, pointed out, this would not have \nbusted the budget. This was forward funding that would have gone into \nnext year. The dollars then could have been distributed not only to \nhelp our farmers but also to do the conservation work that they do for \nall of us.\n  I want to mention also that we have some crops in New York that do \nnot produce a lot of money, less than $10,000, but we are proud of \nthem. We have a lot of orchards in New York, going from 6,931 in 1964 \nto 2,436 in 1997. We still are proud of our apple growers. We are proud \nof our speciality crops.\n  In May, there was an article in the Washington Post about the plight \nof apple growers in Albany, NY. It told how this past March Susan and \nGary Davis auctioned off the machinery they used to tend orchards and \nvegetables on a farm that had been in their family for a century. They \nsaid: You feel like you are letting them down, both past generations \nand your own children. But they just could not keep up with the costs, \nand their farm manager finally said he could not do it anymore. The \ngrower gave up and moved to find a livelihood somewhere else.\n  We know we have to do more to make farming a viable alternative for \nthose who are willing to put in the long hours, are willing to do the \nwork that gives us a safe food supply. I consider food security part of \nnational security. Certainly that is true when it comes to the \nspeciality crops and also when it comes to dairy in New York.\n  Our dairy farmers are down to 8,732 farms. I bet a lot of people did \nnot know there were 8,700 dairy farms in New York. We are the third \nlargest dairy producing State in America, and we are proud of that \nfact. But we have to have some help. We have to be able to compete with \nour neighbors to the north, with our neighbors to the south, and with \nour neighbors to the west.\n  Milk is New York's leading agricultural product, creating almost $2 \nbillion in receipts. We rank third behind California and Wisconsin. Our \ndairy farmers are probably the hardest working farmers, maybe the \nhardest working small businesspeople, one will find anywhere. It is a \n24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week job. I was visiting with some of our dairy \nfarmers on the shores of Lake Champlain. They have been there for \nseven, eight, and nine generations. This is a difficult, tough job. We \nshould not make it any harder. We should be proud of those who are \nwilling to do this work, and we should find ways to support them \nbecause it helps all of us.\n  Finally, I hope my colleague, Senator Schumer, and I are able to \nconvey as clearly and, hopefully, persuasively as possible that when \nagriculture is discussed, New York should be at the table. I thank \neveryone in this Chamber for giving us the opportunity to have our \nfarmers receive the same help that all of our farmers in America need.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Madam President, there is a sigh of relief all \nthroughout farm country in regard to passage of this emergency \nassistance. We avoided a partisan train wreck, losing the money, taking \nthe money from next year's farm bill, and or next year's emergency \nassistance. I regret that it came to this. This is a trail we really \ndid not have to take.\n  When you serve on the Agriculture Committee--and I have done that in \nthe House and Senate--you have the opportunity to serve on one of the \nmost nonpartisan committees in the Congress.\n  With the events of the past week, I deeply regret what some have \nreferred to as partisan milk that got a little sour and curdled a \nlittle bit. But, we have cleaned it up and we have made some progress. \nWe have an old expression in my hometown of Dodge City, KS: If you are \nriding ahead of the herd, it's a good thing to take a look back now and \nthen to make sure it is still there.\n  I say to my colleagues, the reverse is also true. We have done that \ntoday. It is a good idea for both sides to take a look and tell your \nleadership when you are about to be driven off an emergency assistance \ncliff along with our farmers and ranchers. We avoided that today, and \nthat is a positive step.\n  We had the possibility of endangering emergency funding for our \nfarmers and ranchers. I was worried some would have preferred an issue \nas opposed to a bill. We were about to saw off the branch that supports \nour farmers and hang all of us in the process.\n  Here is the deal. If the majority had prevailed, the bill would have \nhad to be conferenced with the House. If we simply check the lights in \nthe House, they are out of town; they are gone. I went over to the \nHouse last night during the debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I \nmet with both the Agriculture Committee chairman, Larry Combest, and \nthe ranking member, Charlie Stenholm, both good friends, not to mention \nthe members of the House Agriculture Committee. They were adamant, and \nI mean adamant--put that in bold letters--in support of the statement \nthey released a day or two ago. Their statement--not mine--said:\n\n       For the sake of our farmers, the U.S. Senate must put \n     politics aside and realize the critical importance of passing \n     the 2001 crop assistance bill immediately, so that the \n     process can continue and a bill can be sent to the President \n     for signature.\n\n  The House statement went on:\n\n       The House Ag Committee, anticipating this need, acted early \n     and responsibly, passing a bill out 6 weeks ago.\n\n  That is now 7 weeks.\n\n       This bill was passed by the House on June 26--\n\n  Unanimously on a voice vote--\n\n     and was immediately sent to the Senate where it languished. \n     If payments are not\n\n[[Page S8865]]\n\n     made before September 30 of this year then $5.5 billion that \n     was fought for and budgeted for farmers will disappear. At \n     this critical time, we must all put our agendas aside and \n     concentrate our efforts on providing the needed assistance \n     for farmers. It is unwise to encumber the bill with \n     unnecessary, nonemergency items like increased conservation \n     spending when our farmers' livelihoods hang in the balance. \n     The process must move on.\n\n  My friends, those were the words of the Chairman and Ranking Member \nin the House. We have done that. I think it is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I point out that one of the reasons the House was so adamant, why \nthey were so upset, is that the House Agriculture Committee passed a \nnew farm bill out of committee last week, and it uses the $2 billion \nextra that was in the Senator from Iowa's approach for their farm bill. \nI do not know how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \nhave proposed, or we would have proposed, to reconcile the difference.\n  I am not sure what the farm bill will look like in the Senate, but I \ndo not think we want to propose the House cut their own farm bill in \nterms of target price, AMTA payments, loan levels. Obviously the \nfarmers of wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and soybean in North Dakota, \nSouth Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Arkansas, and Kansas would not have \nsupported that move.\n  I say it again: We were about to borrow from the future. We did not \ndo that.\n  I will sum up what I think happened in this situation. I think it \ncould be a good lesson learned.\n\n  June 5, my colleagues on the other side take over control of the \nSenate and the Senate Agriculture Committee. June 20, the House \nAgriculture Committee passed its bill. This is the emergency assistance \nbill. June 26, the full House passed the bill on a voice vote. June 28 \nto July 24, 6 hearings were held in the Senate Agriculture Committee on \nthe farm bill and other issues no hearings or meetings on the \nassistance package were held during this time. July 25 we went to \nmarkup. Late July 27, the bill is brought up for debate; July 30 \nthrough today, this moment, debate on the legislation. July 31, the CBO \nsends a letter to the Senate stating 2001 funds will be scored in 2002 \nif the bill is not passed before the August recess. July 31, the House \nAgriculture Committee Chairman Combest and Ranking Member Stenholm \nasked the Senate to please approve the House-passed bill and get the \nmoney to farmers and ranchers. August 1, Mr. Combest and Mr. Stenholm \nmake strong statements that I don't have to go into, again asking the \nSenate to pass the House bill. August 2, CBO verbally confirmed to me \nwhat they stated in their previous letter of July 31: The bill must be \npassed before the August recess or they will score the money going out \nin fiscal year 2002. Again this morning, CBO staff again confirm to my \nstaff that the Senate bill, as written, must be passed before the \nAugust recess in order for the money to be scored in fiscal year 2001.\n  I think that lays out the facts.\n  Again, the point was, delay. In August, there is going to be a new \nbudget estimate. I think we all know about the rhetoric and the \nlegislation that will be flying around in September and October with \nany emergency or additional spending bumping against the trust funds.\n  Do we really want to be considering a package like this with \namendments, saying we cannot use the money because it will allegedly \ncome from Social Security? Do we want agriculture in that position? Do \nwe want farmers and ranchers being the poster people for raiding Social \nSecurity? I don't think that is a very good idea.\n  Finally, you can't have it both ways. Further delay of trade \nauthority for the President and getting a consistent and aggressive \nexport policy will certainly mean a continued loss of market share and \nexports. We have to sell our commodities. If we don't, it means there \nwill be calls for another emergency bill next year. I hope we don't \nhave to have that, but we may. And this money and this emergency bill, \nor at least in the proposal offered by the distinguished chairman, \nwould have taken money from that account.\n  I was very worried this morning. I thought Senators could, maybe \nwould, take this issue and ride with it, that we would have gone \nsquarely into a boxed canyon and fired off our shotguns of partisan \nrhetoric, whoop and holler as to who was to blame. Some of that has \nbeen said on the Senate floor. Or we could have passed the House \nversion, and we did, of emergency relief and get assistance to hard-\npressed farmers and hopefully begin bipartisan work on the next farm \nbill.\n  I have been through six farm bills. You can always have an issue or \nyou can always have a bill. It is basically that simple. In this \nregard, without question, I think the decision reached spared \nagriculture and that means the assessments will be forthcoming.\n  There used to be a chairman in the House Agriculture Committee in \nTexas, Bob Poage, an outstanding chairman, great chairman. People used \nto ask Bob, when a farm bill came to the floor of the House, Mr. Poage, \nMr. Chairman, is this the best possible bill? And he would say, no; but \nit is the best bill possible.\n  In a gesture of friendship and bipartisanship with the distinguished \nchairman of the House Agriculture Committee, the distinguished ranking \nmember, and other members of the Agriculture Committee, the \ndistinguished acting Presiding Officer is a very valued member of the \ncommittee. Let's work together on this. Let's not go down this road \nagain. Let's work in a bipartisan matter for farmers. I pledge I will \ndo that. I pledge to the chairman I will do that. This morning was not \na pleasant experience for any of us. But we did the right thing as of \nthis morning.\n  To reiterate:\n  Mr. President, this is a partisan trail that we did not have to take. \nWhen you serve on the Agriculture Committee, you have the opportunity \nto serve on one of the most nonpartisan committees in the Congress. \nWith this standoff, I deeply regret the spilled partisan milk, and its \ngotten pretty sour.\n  There is an old expression we have in my home town of Dodge City, \nKS--``If you are riding ahead of the herd it's a good thing to take a \nlook back now and then to make sure its still there.''\n  My colleagues, the reverse is also true. It would be most timely and \na good idea this morning for the herd across the aisle to look ahead \nand tell your leadership that you are about to be driven off an \nemergency assistance cliff--along with our farmers and ranchers.\n  Those who are endangering emergency funding for our farmers and \nranchers, those who apparently prefer an issue to emergency farmer \nrelief are about to saw off the branch that will support farmers and \nhang all of us in the process. Here is the deal.\n  Obviously, should the majority prevail, this bill would have to be \nconferenced with the House. Check the lights over there, the House is \ngone. I went over to the House last night during the debate on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights and met with both Agriculture Chairman Larry \nCombest and Ranking Member Charlie Stenholm, not to mention many \nmembers of the House Agriculture Committee.\n  They are ADAMANT in support of the statement they released just a day \nor two ago. That statement, theirs--not mine--said this:\n\n       The Senate Majority Leader is diverting attention with a \n     fast shell game to quickly switch blame for the Senate not \n     finishing its work on farmer assistance on time. Close of \n     business set for early August has been scheduled since the \n     beginning of the year. Against this well publicized early \n     August deadline, the Senate has had the House-approved bill \n     languishing for over a month now. There has been absolutely \n     nothing keeping the Senate Agriculture Committee from moving \n     on its own package, rather than waiting until the last \n     minute. The Senate's search for an excuse on a past-due bill \n     must mean they fear going home to face the music from \n     constituents.\n\n  In another statement on July 31:\n\n       For the sake of our farmers, the U.S. Senate must put \n     politics aside and realize the critical importance of passing \n     the 2001 crop assistance bill immediately so, that the \n     process can continue and a bill can be sent to the President \n     for signature. The House Ag committee, anticipating this \n     need, acted early and responsibly, passing a bill out 6 weeks \n     ago. This bill was passed by the House on June 26, and was \n     immediately sent to the Senate where it has languished. If \n     payments are not made before September 30 of this year, then \n     $5.5 billion that was fought for and budgeted for farmers \n     will disappear. At this critical time, we must all put our \n     agendas aside and concentrate our efforts on providing the \n     needed assistance for farmers. It is unwise to encumber the \n     bill with unnecessary, non-emergency items like increased \n     conservation spending when our farmers' livelihoods hang in \n     the balance. The process must move on, and the Senate must \n     act.\n\n\n[[Page S8866]]\n\n\n  I would also point out that the House Agriculture Committee passed a \nnew farm bill out of committee last week. It uses this $2 billion for \n2002 funding on the new farm bill.\n  How do my colleagues on the other side propose to reconcile this \ndifference? I'm not sure what the farm bill will look like in the \nSenate. But would they propose the House cut the target price, AMTA, or \nloan levels in its proposal? Will the wheat, corn, cotton, rice, and \nsoybean farmers in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, \nArkansas, and other States support that move?\n  I will say it again, we are borrowing from the future if we pass this \nbill as it is currently written.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up:\n  June 5: My colleagues on the other side take over control of the \nSenate and Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  June 20: House Agriculture Committee passes its bill.\n  June 26: The full House passes the bill on a voice vote.\n  June 28 to July 24: Six hearings in the Senate Agriculture Committee \non the farm bill and other issues. No hearings or meetings on this \nassistance package.\n  July 25: Mark-up.\n  Late July 27: Bill is brought up for debate.\n  July 30 through today: debate on this legislation.\n  July 31: CBO sends letter to the Senate stating 2001 funds will be \nscored in 2002 if the bill is not passed before the August recess.\n  July 31: House Agriculture Committee Chairman Combest and Ranking \nMember Stenholm ask the Senate to approve the House passed bill and get \nour money to our farmers and ranchers.\n  August 1: Mr. Combest and Mr. Stenholm accuse the Senate majority \nleader and chairman of obstructing the passage of this important \nlegislation.\n  August 2: CBO verbally confirmed to me what they had stated in their \nprevious letter of July 31: the bill must be passed before August \nrecess or they will score the money going out in FY02.\n  Mr. President, I believe that lays out the facts.\n  Again, the point is the delay. In August, there will be a new budget \nestimate. And we all know the rhetoric and legislation that will be \nflying around here with regard any emergency or additional spending \nbumping against trust funds. Do we really want to be considering this \npackage with amendments saying we cannot use the money because it \nallegedly will come from Social Security. Do we want agriculture in \nthat position?\n  Finally, let me say you cannot have it both ways on the other side of \nthe aisle. Further delay of trade authority for the President will \ncertainly mean continued loss of market share and exports. That means \nanother emergency bill next year. And, this money robs that account.\n  Now, Senators can take the issue and ride with it, squarely into a \nbox canyon and fire off our partisan pop guns and whoop and holler as \nto who was to blame. Or we can pass the House version of emergency \nrelief and get the assistance to our hard pressed farmers and hopefully \nbegin bipartisan work on the next farm bill.\n  We can have an issue or we can enact emergency assistance, it is that \nsimple. In this regard, without question the decision reached this \nmorning will spare agriculture further delay and will provide the \nassistance needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I came to the floor last night in a \ngreat deal of frustration, and now I come to the floor in a great deal \nof disappointment. This morning, the Senate moved forward on an \nemergency assistance package for farmers that most in this body know is \ninadequate. We have done something. We have moved forward, as many \npeople have said, because the House has left or because the President \ndrew a line in the sand.\n  That is not what our job in the Senate is. Our job in the Senate is \nto do the best we can possibly do. Is this bill the best we can do? \nAbsolutely not. I don't think there is a Senator in this Chamber who \nthinks we have done the best job we could do on an Agriculture \nemergency supplemental bill. That is amazing to me.\n  We approved a bill that most Members know is not going to provide \neven the minimum of support that our farmers and our communities, our \nrural communities, our community banks, and our rural economies really \nneed. Our program crops said from day 1 of this year they needed AMTA \npayments at 100 percent of the 1999 level.\n  In February, when we started going to the administration, saying we \nare going to need an emergency Agriculture supplemental bill, we are \ngoing to need 100-percent AMTA at 1999 levels, we are going to have to \nhave it; our bankers are saying they are making loans to our \nagricultural producers based on the fact they are going to get 100 \npercent at 1999 levels, the administration and others came back and \nsaid: Wait until we get through with this tax bill. Then they said: \nWell, wait until we finish with the education bill. Then we will deal \nwith it. And then: Let's wait until we get past the Patients' Bill of \nRights and we will deal with it. Wait, wait, wait until we get back \nfrom the Fourth of July recess.\n  And guess what. We made the mistake of believing them and we waited \nin good faith, thinking at the end of the road the administration would \nhave the same consideration for production agriculture as those who \nhave grown up in it. Guess what. We were wrong. We were wrong. We \nthought they would come in good faith from the administration and work \nwith Members on this.\n  Have they? No. People have said: I am tired; it is time for vacation. \nLet's go home.\n  Our specialty crops needed more money for commodity purchases and \nother forms of support. All of our production farmers needed \nassistance. Where were we? The administration says farm income is at an \nall-time high. Guess what. Do you know why it is at an all-time high? \nBecause the rural economy has been in the tanks for years. Their energy \ncosts are at an all-time high and rising. Their fertilizer input costs \nare at an all-time high. Their energy costs, diesel--name it--implement \ncosts, the costs of buying machinery, and the costs of meeting \nenvironmental regulations, every one of them is at an all-time high, \nand many of our States have producers whose farmer income, 50 percent \nof it, is government payment. Why? Because we have not provided for our \nagricultural producers in terms of good, solid, trade opportunities and \nglobal marketplace shares because we have not taken into consideration \nwhat it means to those individuals to produce a safe and abundant and \naffordable food supply for those who enjoy it.\n  We enjoy the most environmentally sound agricultural products in the \nworld coming out of this country. That is all going away unless we make \nan obligation to production agriculture, that when it comes time to \nbeing there for them, we will be there, instead of just saying all year \nlong: Just wait. Just wait until we get through all of these other \nthings and then we will be there for you.\n  I look at some of my local spinach growers in Arkansas who are not \nfar from local canneries yet find it impossible sometimes to market \ntheir spinach just down the road because they can be outbid by spinach \nthat is coming in from Mexico, grown with chemicals we banned over 10 \nyears ago.\n  What are we doing for production agriculture, to make sure that you \nand I will continue to have that environmentally well grown product for \nour children and for future generations? What is our response? Give \nthem less than they need, close up shop, and fly home for vacation. \nWhy? Because the House is going home, we can't do anything.\n  Well if the House jumps off the bridge, are we going to jump off the \nbridge, too? What if the administration says it is just not that \nimportant; we are not going to come over to negotiate with you to come \nto some middle ground that is going to provide our producers the 100 \npercent of AMTA from 1999 levels that we promised them back in \nFebruary? I don't know. I reject that. I still believe I am here to do \nthe best job I can possibly do for those American producers. I reject \nthe argument that it is too late. I reject the argument that we cannot \ngive them what they need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I reject the argument that we cannot stay here and \nfight for our American producers and our farmers.\n  Farmers themselves say that government is just waiting until they die \naway, that the family farmer is gone and we can just depend on \ncorporate America to provide us what we need.\n  I look around at some of the fights I have been fighting this year on \nbehalf of aquaculture and fish farmers in Arkansas. They are having to \ncompete with misleading labeling from other countries that are claiming \nthey are producing that kind of product which we produce here, a farm-\nraised, grain-fed product, when we know what is coming in the country \nfrom Vietnam is not that. It is raised on the Mekong River under \nunbelievable environmental conditions. Yet it has been sent to this \ncountry in misleading ways and sold to the consumers here.\n  We are dealing with a crisis in agricultural production. I come to \nthe floor saddened. As I look around at this body, I realize that the \nMembers of the Senate years ago used to travel here from their home \nfarms in faraway States and spend the time that they did to debate the \nissues of this country, all the while still remembering where they came \nfrom, the heartland that they represented, the communities and the \nagricultural producers. In my home State of Arkansas, when that farmer \nis out in the field and he is bringing in his crop, he is picking \ncotton or he is combining beans or he is combining rice and gets to the \nend of a long hot day, and the Sun is setting and he sees a \nthunderstorm coming out of the west, do you know what. He doesn't pack \nit up and go home.

Madam President, I know for me to speak on the floor \nabout agriculture raises some eyebrows, let's say. I have found that as \nI, along with others, have been trying to help my colleague from \nVermont who has been fighting a lonely battle, for Northeast \nagriculture. When I spoke in the Democratic caucus, I heard someone \nsort of singing ``Old McDonald,'' and other things. So people ask, why \nam I so interested in agriculture, coming from a State such as New \nYork?\n  For one thing, people forget how much agriculture there is in the \nState of New York. We are a large agricultural producer. We rank third \nin dairy production. We rank second or third, depending on the year, in \napple production. We are high up in onions and many kinds of specialty \nproducts. In fact--and these are numbers that even surprised me--New \nYork has 38,000 farmers. That is 13,500 more farmers than Idaho; 10,400 \nmore than Montana; 7,700 more than North Dakota; 5,500 more than South \nDakota; and 28,800 more than Wyoming. So those States which are \nregarded as agricultural States have fewer farmers, many fewer, than my \nState of New York.\n  We do have a large city--we have several large cities. Thank God, we \nhave lots of other kinds of industries. But agriculture is a vital \nindustry.\n  The second reason I care about agriculture--and it has been new to \nme; 18 years in the House serving a district in a corner of Brooklyn \nand Queens, we didn't have any farmers--is meeting the people who do \nit. I met one family with a farm in their family in Suffolk County for \n12 generations. You look into their eyes and see how hard-working they \nare and see how productive they are, and you see the land and God's \nbeauty in a wonderful way give forth fruits and vegetables and crops. \nYou see how hard they work and you feel for them.\n  They are on a frustrating treadmill. It seems they work harder and \nharder but survival in agriculture is even more difficult for them. You \nlook into their eyes and you realize something else. These farmers are \nthe breeder reactor, the place where American values grow and are \nnurtured. It has been so since the Republic was founded, and it still \nis. The values of hard work and teamwork and self-reliance and \nindividuality, for which our country is known and blessed, have started \non the farm.\n  So even if all the food could be produced somewhere else and it could \nbe as good and as high quality, I do not think we would want to lose \nfarmers from America and the American way of life because the two are \nso inextricably tied. So I care about agriculture. I care a great deal \nabout our farmers in New York.\n  This farm bill, admittedly, does not do what we want. But I want to \ntell the farmers that we have gotten a pledge from our majority leader \nthat the part of this bill that was cut out by the House will be \ndebated in September. That includes the relief for the apple farmers \nthat many of us in the Northeast--my colleague, Senator Clinton--and \nSenator Levin and Senator Stabenow and the two Senators from Washington \nworked hard to get in the bill. That will come back and have another \nchance. The provisions the Senator from Iowa put in the bill to deal \nwith specialty crops and conservation, which affected the Northeast, \nwill come back as well. I am glad about that.\n  When the farm bill comes up, we will make our fight for the dairy \nfarmers, and it is going to be a royal fight because we really care \nabout them.\n  What I would like my colleagues to know is, my good friend from \nVermont, who has often been alone in this fight, is now being joined by \nmany of us. As I mentioned, my colleagues Senator Clinton and Senator \nTorricelli are in the fight; Senator Jeffords, of course, has always \nbeen in the fight, as have our Senators from Massachusetts and \nPennsylvania and other States as well. We are going to put Northeast \nagriculture on the legislative map.\n  It will not be good enough to have bills any longer that do not do a \nthing for us. I think we have persuaded our Democratic leadership here \nin the Senate to do so. We have a bit of work to do in the House. We \nhave a bit of work to do in the White House. But we are going to do it.\n  In fact, as I look at this as somebody admittedly new to agriculture, \nI would like to make a point to my colleagues. I have never seen a \nplace where we spend so much money and where there is so much \nunhappiness among the recipients. Something is dramatically wrong.\n  Mr. President, 50 percent or 47 percent of farm income is now \nGovernment. I do not know one other area in the country where that \nhappens. I am willing to do it because, as I said, I believe in the \nfamily farm and the values that they bring. But can't we come up with a \nbetter way? Can't we come up with a way that makes the family wheat \nfarmer in North Dakota and the family corn and hog farmers in Illinois \nhappier than they are now? Can't we as we come up with that come up \nwith something that includes the dairy farmer in New York or Vermont or \nthe apple grower in New Jersey or Massachusetts? We have to come up \nwith a better way because the present way isn't working.\n  More and more money--this is another $5 billion--doesn't help our \narea. Our fights will come later in September and in October with the \nfarm bill. But that $5.5 billion isn't making many people happy, even \nthough they are getting it, because they are still struggling.\n  Freedom to Farm is a problem. Everyone says it. I tend to agree. But \nyou know that we had problems before Freedom to Farm, too. As long as I \nhave been in the Congress, which is from 1981, we have seen more and \nmore money going to agriculture and our\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\nfamily farmers be less and less happy. They are not happy in the \nNortheast where we get very little help. They are not happy in the \nMiddle West and the South where they get a lot of help.\n  We are going to have to come together and come up with a system that \nworks that doesn't put 80 percent of the money to huge agribusiness \nwhere they do not need it but directs the dollars at the family farm \nand gives that family I talked about as I began my speech, who wakes up \nat sunrise and battles the elements and produces God's bounty from the \nEarth, a fighting chance.\n  Let's not continue on this treadmill to nowhere. It is going to \ndivide us. You see the fissures already. More importantly, it is not \ngoing to help the people we want to help--the family farmer.\n  I am here today to stick up for the 38,000 New York farmers who work \nhard--and many others who depend on them--and the Northeastern farmer \nand to say to my colleagues we have to do a lot better in a system that \ncontinually spends more money and produces less happiness among the \npeople who are its recipients.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the senior Senator from New York \nfor his statement. I note that the two Senators from New York have been \nin the conferences we held. They fought hard for the interests of the \nNortheast and the Atlantic States. It is partly because of that fight \nthat I have to stand here today to strongly oppose another of the \nmisguided, unbalanced, and actually archaic plans for emergency \nagricultural assistance.\n  To put it bluntly, not only for Vermont farmers but farmers \nthroughout the Northeast and Mid Atlantic States, they receive little \nor no relief from this package. This package is unbalanced and unfair \nto my region, even when it passed the House of Representatives, and it \nremains unbalanced and unfair as it passes the Senate today.\n  Chairman Harkin's bill that passed out of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee recognizes the emergency assistance needs for all farmers in \nall States. Chairman Harkin's bill has comprehensive assistance for \nspecialty crops, including desperately needed assistance for our \nNation's apple growers. It also adds needed funding for voluntary \nagricultural conservation programs on private lands, programs that the \nPresident chose not to fund this year despite overwhelming needs, and \nin spite of critical backlogs in all 50 States.\n  Conservation assistance funds are critical for cash-poor farmers--\nespecially in my region of the country--helping farm families comply \nwith the highest water and soil quality standards to keep their \nfarmland healthy not only for this year but for next year.\n  None of those comprehensive specialty crop funds, nor conservation \nfunds, are found in the bill we just passed.\n  Senator Harkin's bill also added disaster assistance for the \ndevastation caused by armyworms in New England and throughout the \ncountry. None of this assistance is in the bill we just passed.\n  Despite what one may hear, the bill we passed is not agricultural \nassistance for all farmers--not by a long shot. It is sodden with \nregional disparity. Those of us from the regions that have been \nslighted strongly believe that this has to be the last agricultural \nbill with such bias. It is not even fiscally responsible.\n  The bill sends billions of taxpayer dollars--dollars that come from \nfarm families across the Nation--to a handful of States in the Midwest. \nIn fact, almost $3 billion of the $5.5 billion in emergency \nagricultural assistance--about 50 percent of this agricultural \nassistance--will go to only 10 States.\n  I have to ask, Why? Why does my State of Vermont--a State where \nfamily farmers are in serious trouble, where low prices and poor \nweather conditions are forcing farmers to sell their family land--\nreceive less than four one-hundredths of a percent of this year's \nemergency agricultural assistance?\n  Vermont farmers pay taxes, too. In fact, if assistance in this so-\ncalled agricultural emergency bill were based on the true value of \nVermont's contributions to the Nation's agriculture, Vermont would \nreceive over six times what I see in this bill.\n  Farmers throughout the Northeast and Mid Atlantic States pay their \ntaxes. While those farmers produce almost 7 percent of the Nation's \nagricultural products, those farmers receive 1 percent of the $5.5 \nbillion flying out these doors to the Midwest.\n  Look at Texas. Texas farmers are going to receive about 8 percent of \nthe $5.5 billion--almost $400 million alone. When all is said and done, \nfive select States in this country will each receive over $300 million \nfor this bill. Ten States are going to get over $150 million. The rest \nget practically nothing.\n  Some may say we passed this bill to expedite funds to our Nation's \nfarmers. I think they are speaking of only a small number of farmers in \nonly a very small, select number of States. They should be saying a \nsmall number of farmers in a small number of select States will get one \nheck of a lot of money, but to make it fair every other State will be \nallowed to pay the bill. That is really what they are saying. All of us \nwill pay the bill so a small number of States can get the benefit.\n  What bothers me is this goes on year after year after year. We have \nhad disaster relief bills. We in the Northeast paid with our taxes a \nsubstantial part of the bill to try to help the country. But when we \nhave had disasters I have never seen the return.\n  We ``expedite funds to our Nation's farmers,'' as they say. They are \nnot talking about Vermont farmers; they are not talking New Jersey \nfarmers, or farmers throughout the Northeast and Mid Atlantic States, \nor the farmers in States with specialty crops not covered in the skewed \nState grant formulation we took from the House bill.\n  We had a chance to even out the bias--at least to help all farmers in \nall States. As I said, we have taken an easy in irresponsible route to \nsimply pass an unbalanced and unfair House bill. We have dismissed the \ntrue needs of specialty crop States, and we have dismissed the \nessential conservation programs that truly help my region's farmers. \nSadly, once again, we are being left out in the cold.\n  In fact, for that matter, even on the basis of this we get a bum \ndeal. We get even worse because the dairy compact was left out of it.\n  If you are a proponent of States rights, regional dairy compacts are \nthe answer. They are State-initiated, they are State-ratified, and they \nare State-supported programs that assure a safe supply of milk for \nconsumers.\n  I received a letter signed by 22 Governors, Republicans and \nDemocrats--I believe there is even an Independent in there--who are \nendorsing the dairy compact bill Because it would ratify the compacts \nthat their States have negotiated among themselves.\n\n  If you support interstate trade, regional compacts are the answer. \nThe Northeast Dairy Compact has prompted an increase in sales of milk \ninto the compact region from neighboring States.\n  If you support a balanced budget, then regional compacts are the \nanswer. Why? Because the Northeast Compact does not cost the taxpayers \na single cent, which is a lot different from some of the farm programs \nthat are being boosted up by billions of dollars in this bill.\n  If you support farmland protection programs, regional compacts are \nthe answer. In fact, that is why major environmental groups have \nendorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact; they know it helps preserve \nfarmland and prevents urban sprawl. I recently received a letter from \n33 environmental, conservation, and public interest membership \norganizations supporting the dairy compact amendment.\n  Lastly, of course, if we are worried about consumers, then we ought \nto like regional dairy compacts. Retail milk prices within the compact \nregion are lower on average than in the rest of the Nation where they \ndo not have a compact.\n  The dairy compact has done what it is supposed to do: It has \nstabilized widely fluctuating dairy prices; it has ensured a fair price \nfor dairy farmers; it has made it possible for farm families to stay in \nbusiness; and it has protected consumers' supplies of fresh milk.\n  Unfortunately, though, this is a policy debate that pits dairy \nfarmers who go to work every single day trying to\n\n[[Page S8869]]\n\nmake a living against some of the Nation's most powerful corporations. \nIt pits consumers and communities that treasure the open space and \nquality of life that local dairy farming offers, against those who can \nspend millions of dollars on ads and lobbyists here in Washington.\n  We should not stay in the way of these State initiatives that protect \nfarmers and consumers without costing taxpayers a cent.\n  Dairy compacts are one of those issues where Members have very strong \nviews even though we all share the same core beliefs. We all want to \nsupport our dairy farmers and we all believe that they should be able \nto earn a decent living for their families. We all want ample supplies \nof fresh milk, at reasonable prices, for our States' consumers. Unlike \nagricultural commodities such as wheat, corn, and soybeans, milk is \nhighly perishable.\n  When a dairy farmer brings the milk to market, that milk has to be \nsold right away, or it quickly loses its value. It can't be set aside \nin a silo. For big processors, that's just fine. They can buy milk at \ndistressed prices and store it away to make cheese or powdered milk or \nice cream. But that setup hurts farmers, who work incredibly hard just \nto make a living, and consumers, who want farmers around to supply \nfresh milk for the store shelves.\n  As a nation we have tried several remedies to cut through this knot, \nand the record is proving that regional compacts are the most sensible \nand workable answer yet. And unlike other legislative remedies that \ncome with price tags, and often hefty ones, compacts cost Federal \ntaxpayers nothing.\n  Milk is one of those unusual foods where the spread between what \nfarmers get paid for their labor, and what consumers pay for the \nproduct, is huge and increasing throughout the Nation.\n  In New England, what farmers get paid has been fairly stable since \nthe dairy compact began working in 1997, and that is one of its great \nsuccesses. But what processors and stores charge for milk has greatly \nincreased since 1997--not just in New England, but in the rest of the \nNation. Consumer prices are lower in new England than in much of the \nrest of the country and that the $10,000 to $20,000 in added annual \nincome has helped keep New England farmers in business who otherwise \nwould have had to leave farming.\n  There is a hidden risk right now to consumers and farmers in New \nEngland--and the rest of the Nation. This is the growing concentration \nof processors in the milk industry.\n  In New England, Suiza Foods is rapidly trying to cinch a stranglehold \non milk supplies. In some parts of New England they already control 70 \nto 80 percent of the fluid milk supply. They have swept in, bought \nprocessing plants in New England, and then closed them--elimiating \ncompetition.\n  The ascent of Suiza is nothing less than stunning. In a few short \nyears, Suiza has gained its dominant position in the milk processing \nbusiness. I showed you three charts a couple days ago showing the \nincredible increase in the dominance of Suiza in just a few years. Even \nworse, if its purchase of Dean Foods is approved, a strong case can be \nmade that Suiza is on the verge of becoming a monopoly in the milk \nprocessing business. I have asked the Department of Justice and its \nAntitrust Division to closely monitor Suiza's surging market dominance, \nand I again call to their attention the urgency of doing that.\n\n  But equally remarkable is the fact that Suiza is also now in the \nprocess of consolidating a dominant position as the chief purchaser of \nmilk from farmers. Simply put, in many parts of the country, Suiza \nFoods is the dominant customer--if it is not the only customer--for \nfarmers' raw milk to be used for fluid processing. Suiza Foods is now \ndominating both the purchase and the sale of fluid milk in this \ncountry. Suiza is becoming--all at once--both a monopolist and a \nmonopsonist in the fluid dairy marketplace.\n  Suiza Foods is a new type of market force. I have searched our \nantitrust case law for a name for this type of combined market power. \nThere is no adequate name on the books for what Suiza has become, as I \ncalled them in a recent Judiciary hearing, and on the Senate floor, \nthey are ``suizopolies.''\n  How can suppliers and consumers defend themselves from a giant firm--\nthis Suizopoly--that controls both the purchase of a product--from \nthousands of suppliers with little bargaining power--and its sale to \nmillions of consumers?\n  The best way is the dairy compact; it gives the public some control \nover access to milk, it assures fresh, local supplies of milk, and it \ngives farmers some ability to earn a living income.\n  I also want to respond to seven myths about the compact that the big \nprocessors have spent millions of dollars to promote, through years of \nlobbying and advertising and campaign contributions. They were \ntrumpeting many of these myths before the compact was enacted, and they \nhave not changed their songsheets, even though the compact has done \njust what it was supposed to do, proving their arguments dead wrong.\n  This first myth is that dairy compacts are milk taxes that hurt \nconsumers. As you have just heard, concentration, is the major cause of \nconsumer price increase in the milk sector.\n  And, a recent independent study funded by USDA determined that \nindustry profit taking--including profit taking by Suiza--and cost \nincreases not related to the compact, are responsible for more than 90 \npercent of the increase in retail prices in New England since the \ncompact was implemented. This leaves less than three cents of a gallon \nof milk attributable to the compact.\n  A recent GAO report requested by Senator Feingold and myself says to \nall: It compares the prices of a gallon of 2 percent milk in Boston and \nMilwaukee for last year. The wholesale price of milk in Boston was \n$2.03. The wholesale price in Milwaukee was $2.08--five cents more than \nin Boston. So you would expect retail prices to be about the same for \nBoston, or slightly less, than for Milwaukee.\n  However, Suiza controls around 70 percent of the milk supply in \nMassachusetts and a greater amount in Boston. The average retail price \nlisted by GAO is $2.74 in Boston for a gallon of milk but only $2.26 in \nMilwaukee.\n  Obviously, the compact does not cause the difference--the wholesale \nprices for Boston are lower than in Milwaukee, as the GAO makes clear.\n  The GAO report also shows that for most of the cities they examined, \nthe consumer prices in the compact region were lower.\n  There is a myth that the dairy compact has harmed nutritional \nprograms such as WIC, school lunch, school breakfast, and food stamps.\n  Wrong again. The fact is that the Compact Commission requires \ncompensation to State WIC and school lunch programs for any potential \nimpacts. In fact, if anything it has overcompensated the WIC program, \nas noted in the 1998 OMB study. A letter from the Massachusetts WIC \nDirector says this:\n\n       The Commission has taken strong steps to protect the WIC \n     Program and the School Lunch program from any impacts due to \n     the compact. . . . Because of this, our WIC Program was able \n     to serve approximately 5,875 more participants with fresh \n     wholesome milk without added costs. . . .\n\n  The New England Compact Commission has exempted school breakfast and \nlunch programs from any pricing impacts due to milk price regulation.\n  Commissioner Kassler of Massachusetts tells me in writing that \n``without the compact, this [regional New England] milk shed will \ndwindle and milk would be brought in from greater distances and at \ngreater costs.'' Those greater costs have been estimated in the range \nof from 20 to 67 cents per gallon.\n  There is also a myth that dairy compacts are unconstitutional price-\nfixing cartels. This is my favorite example of twisted logic. I believe \nmy opponents' argument goes something like this:\n\n       Interstate compacts would be unconstitutional if the \n     Constitution didn't explicitly contain a clause allowing the \n     creation of interstate compacts with the consent of Congress.\n\n  By operation of the compact clause, States explicitly have the \nopportunity to solve regional problems in this constitutionally \npermitted way. United States Federal courts have recognized the \nNortheast Dairy Compact as a constitutional exercise of congressional \nauthority under the commerce and compact clauses of the U.S. \nConstitution.\n\n[[Page S8870]]\n\n  There is a myth that dairy compacts are barriers to interstate trade. \nDairy compacts encourage greater competition in the marketplace by \npreserving more family farms and increasing trade.\n  An OMB study concluded that trade into the compact region actually \nincreased after implementation. And I would also point out that farmers \nin non-compact States, like New York, or even Wisconsin, are perfectly \nfree to sell their milk in the compact region at compact rates. New \nYork dairy producers are benefiting today by doing just that. Indeed, \nif Wisconsin were to trade places with New York, Wisconsin farmers \nwould gain the benefit of the compact.\n  There is also a myth that dairy compacts encourage farmers to \noverproduce milk and will lead to a flood of milk in the market. The \nfact is that the dairy compact regulatory process includes a supply \nmanagement program that helps to prevent overproduction. In 2000, the \nNortheast Dairy Compact States produced 4.7 billion pounds of milk, a \n0.6 percent decline from 1999.\n  In the nearly 4 years that the compact has been in effect, milk \nproduction in the compact region has risen by just 2.2 percent. \nNationally during this same period, milk production rose 7.4 percent. \nIn Wisconsin milk production rose over 4 percent.\n  There is a myth that dairy compact only help bigger farms at the \nexpense of smaller ones.\n  Just like most commodity programs, the compact benefits all \nparticipants. Also, 75 percent of the farms in New England have fewer \nthan 100 cows.\n  The worst myth is that the dairy compact has not been successful.\n  The success of the Northeast Dairy Compact is undeniable.\n  Let me just close with this.\n  Mr. President, when I was a young man--actually even before my \nteens--I thought how much I would love being in the Senate. Why? \nBecause every State has two Senators. A State with a large population, \na powerful State such as the Presiding Officer's State, or a small, \nrural State such as mine each get two. The one place where every State \nis equal, supposedly, is in the Senate; two Senators.\n  I thought what a joy it would be to represent my native State of \nVermont in the Senate; and it has been. I love the Senate. I have so \nmuch respect for Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I think of the Senate as a place where the country can come together, \nwhere regional interests can be represented, and, of course, where \nStates can maintain their identity, certainly, and where we have an \nobligation to help each other. And we have.\n  Whether it be earthquakes in California or floods in the Midwest or \ndefense programs in the Southeast, and on and on, the Senators from my \npart of the country have supported providing assistance to those parts \nof the country. I could give a million different examples. But there \nseems to be one area where that effort to help each other always falls \napart: The Northeast Mid-Atlantic States, when it comes to agriculture \ndisaster programs.\n  We are always there. We are like the fire brigade that answers the \ncall in the middle of the night. We show up all the time, show up all \nthe time to protect those other ``houses.'' It would kind of be nice \nif, just once, when it is our ``house'' on fire, some of those we have \nhelped throughout the years could come and maybe help us put out the \nfire. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, let me begin by saying how honored I am \nto have a chance to rise while the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nis in the chair. I concur strongly with the majority of the arguments \nmade by the Senator about the fairness of how our agricultural \nactivities in our country are distributed. Sometimes our agricultural \nemergencies in the Northeast are lost sight of when we get around to \nsupporting our family farmers and agricultural activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8870-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8870-S8871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TREASURY BORROWING AND TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a recent report by the \nTreasury Department that has received very little attention in \nWashington, but it is sending a very significant signal, message, about \nthe recently approved tax bill to the financial analysts around the \nworld and market participants around the globe.\n  On July 30, the Treasury Department announced that it expects to \nborrow from the public $51 billion during the quarter ending in \nSeptember. This was a whopping reversal from an estimate in a similar \nTreasury report issued just 3 months earlier.\n  Back in April, Treasury said that it expected to pay down a total of \n$57 billion in debt in this very quarter--a negative cashflow swing of \nan incredible $108 billion.\n  Let me repeat that. For this quarter, we have gone from an estimate \nshowing that we would reduce our debt by $57 billion, to an estimate \nthat we will increase our debt by $51 billion--again, a $108 billion \nswing in just 3 months.\n  I used to serve on the Treasury Department's Debt Advisory Committee \nas a private citizen, so perhaps this report by the Treasury struck me \nas a little more troubling than it did many of my colleagues. It is a \nserious reversal and worthy of a few minutes to discuss its \nimplications because it is a precursor of things to come.\n\n  The first and perhaps most important point to make is this: We are \nfinancing the tax rebates that are so much ballyhooed by borrowing, \nsomething about which the American people would be more troubled if \nthey knew it were happening. We are going into debt in order to finance \nthese tax cuts. That is not a function of any accounting tricks. It has \nnothing to do with trust fund accounting. My comments are not \npolitical. It is a simple undeniable statement of fact--a fact that is \na precursor of things to come, the end result of this flawed and \noverreaching tax cut program.\n  The tax rebates will cost $40 billion this fiscal year. But we don't \nhave $40 billion lying around, as many advocates expected. As a result, \nthe Treasury Department says it will now have to borrow every dollar \nthat will then be sent out in a check from the Treasury. In addition, \nwe will have to pay out $500 million in additional interest this year \njust to finance these tax rebates.\n  It may be the right thing to do for stimulating the economy, but it \ncomes at a real cost. And that is before we unfold all the other \nelements of this tax cut over the years.\n  To be fair, it is true that in the previous quarter the Government \nran a surplus. If you consider the fiscal year as a whole, there is \nstill a chance we will see an on-budget surplus. But it is undeniable \nthat in this quarter we will be in deficit, not just an on-budget \ndeficit but a unified deficit, meaning we enter Medicare trust fund \nmoneys and maybe even potentially Social Security trust funds.\n  Thus, every tax cut check that goes out is being financed by \nborrowing, with its accompanying interest costs. That is not what we \ntold the American people when we passed this tax cut. We said we were \njust giving back their money; that is, excess revenues. We didn't say \nwe would go out and borrow to finance that tax cut. We did not say we \nwould increase our debt to finance the tax cut. We said we had the \nmoney.\n  Now the truth is out. We don't. That is one truth that was \nconveniently left out when the administration sent out its $34 million \nnotice taking credit for the tax cut.\n  Beyond the need to finance the tax rebates, Treasury was also forced \nto build up its cash balance because of a gimmick--one of many \ngimmicks--that was built into this recently enacted tax bill. This is \none that really bothers me, actually more than the rebates, as you \ncould make an argument that we need that as a slowing economy occurs.\n  That legislation shifted the due date for corporate taxes from \nSeptember 17 of this year to October 1. This was nothing more than \naccounting magic to allow us to spend more money next year without \nshowing a raid on the Medicare surplus. But this particular gimmick has \ncome at a real cost. By delaying the receipt of those revenues,\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\nthe Treasury will pay, at a minimum, an additional $40 million in \ninterest. That is actually $40 million that comes out of the Treasury's \npocket and goes into individual corporations that benefit from the \ndelay in payment of their taxes.\n  Think about that. To finance an accounting gimmick to provide \npolitical cover in fiscal year 2002, taxpayers are going to pay an \nextra $40 million. I guess in our budget that sounds like not too much. \nWhere I come from, it is a lot. And seeing some of the things we argue \nfor, whether it is our apple growers or other folks who are in need of \nemergency aid, it is a lot of money--$40 million that could have been \nused to improve education, protect our environment, strengthen our \nnational defense. In my view, that is just plain wrong. Unfortunately, \nit is only the beginning of a number of the magic tricks we have going \non with regard to this tax cut.\n\n  Unfortunately, this $40 million gimmick was one but maybe the \nsmallest. Some of the tax cuts don't become effective for several \nyears. Others phase out before a 10-year timeframe, as we talked about. \nA number of extenders, which we know are going to be there, are left \nout. The AMT is ignored. And in what has to be the most egregious \ngimmick in the history of tax policy, the whole tax cut will expire \nafter 9 years.\n  I am new to government. I am new to politics. But I find this \ngimmickry outrageous. It is intellectually dishonest, and it would \nnever have been tolerated in most of the financial transactions in \nwhich I participated in my private life. In fact, if I ever tried to \nuse such gimmickry when I was back on the street, I would have been \ncalled to task by the SEC or the U.S. attorney, and for good reason.\n  Having said all this, I recognize that despite my personal concerns \nabout the premises of the tax bill and its many gimmicks, we don't have \nthe votes to fix the problem now. It is inevitable that we will have to \nfix it eventually if we want to address the needs of America, to invest \nin America the way we talked about with regard to education, with \nregard to agriculture, with regard to the health care system and our \nmilitary. Otherwise, we will just find ourselves further in debt and \nwithout the resources to fix Social Security and Medicare, to provide a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit, or these things that we need to \ndo in our national defense.\n  For those who continue to insist that there is plenty of money for \nthe tax cut, just read the latest statement from the Treasury \nDepartment. I suspect it is only the beginning.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Treasury Department \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Treasury Announces Market Financing Estimates\n\n       The Treasury Department announced today that it expects to \n     borrow $51 billion in marketable debt during the July-\n     September 2001 quarter and to target a cash balance of $55 \n     billion on September 30. This includes a borrowing of $61 \n     billion in marketable Treasury securities and the buyback of \n     an estimated $9\\1/2\\ billion in outstanding marketable \n     Treasury securities. In the quarterly announcement on April \n     30, 2001, Treasury announced that it expected to pay down a \n     total of $57 billion in marketable debt and to target an end-\n     of-quarter cash balance of $60 billion. The change in \n     borrowing reflects a number of factors, most significantly \n     the shift in the September 15 corporate tax due date to \n     October 1 and the need to finance in this quarter the tax \n     rebates.\n       The Treasury also announced that it expects to pay down $36 \n     billion in marketable debt during the October-December 2001 \n     quarter and to target a cash balance of $30 billion on \n     December 31.\n       During the April-June 2001 quarter, the Treasury paid down \n     $163 billion in marketable debt, including the buyback of \n     $9\\1/4\\ billion in outstanding marketable securities, and \n     ended with a cash balance of $44 billion on June 30. On April \n     30, the Treasury announced that it expected to pay down $187 \n     billion in marketable debt and to target an end-of-quarter \n     cash balance of $60 billion. The increase in the borrowing \n     was the result of a shortfall in receipts and lower issues of \n     State and Local Government Series securities.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to leave town for \nthe August recess, and most of my colleagues are perhaps already on an \nairplane, it might be useful to describe what has happened at the end \nof the legislative business we completed a couple of hours ago.\n  This past week, we considered legislation dealing with some emergency \nhelp for family farmers. In fact, it was actually kind of hard to get \nthat legislation even considered because the Republicans in the Senate \nfilibustered the motion to proceed.\n  For those who do not understand the mechanics of how the Senate \nworks, in plain English that means they demanded a debate on whether we \nshould even debate the bill. A motion to proceed and a filibuster on \nthe motion to proceed meant we had to debate whether we should even \nstart debating. If that sounds a little goofy and a little arcane to \nregular folks who sit around and talk about issues in a straightforward \nway, it is because it was arcane and, at least in this Senator's \njudgment, ``goofy.'' But sometimes, that is just the way the Senate \nworks. However, I certainly would not want to change the rules of the \nSenate.\n  We had to debate the motion to proceed and deal with a filibuster, \nand then we got the legislation to the floor. The legislation was \nwritten to help family farmers during tough times.\n  Family farmers across this country have confronted a total collapse \nin prices for that which they produce. In most cases, in my State at \nleast, they are trying to run a family operation. They are living on a \nfarm, with neighbors a good ways away. They have a yard-light that \nilluminates that farm. They often have cattle, a few horses, some \nchickens, and in some cases a half dozen or so cats running around. \nThey have a tractor, a combine, a drill or a seeder. They are all \nequipped to go about the business of farming.\n\n  Family farmers all across this country go out when the spring comes, \nwhen it is dry enough to get in the fields, and they plant some grain. \nThey hope then, after they plant their seed, nothing catastrophic is \ngoing to happen that would prevent it from growing. They hope it does \nnot hail. That might destroy their crop. They hope it rains enough. \nThey hope it does not rain too much. That would also destroy the crop. \nThey hope it does not get disease, it could, and that could destroy the \ncrop. They hope insects do not come, and they could, and those insects \ncould destroy the crop. All these things, the family farmer must cope \nwith.\n  But, there is one more thing family farmers must deal with. They have \nall this fervent hope and trust, having invested all they own in these \ntiny seeds they planted in the ground. Then in the fall, they hope they \ncan fuel up the combine and go out and harvest that crop. When they do \nthat, they put it in a truck haul it to the elevator. The country \nelevator receives that grain when they raise the hoist and dump that \ngrain into the pit. The grain trader then says to that farmer: Yes, we \nknow you worked hard. We know you and your family planted in the \nspring. We know you and your kids and your spouse drove the tractor and \ndrove the combine. We know you have your life savings in this grain, \nand that you managed against all odds to finally harvest it. But, this \ngrain is not worth much. This food you have produced does not have \nvalue. The market says this food is not very important.\n  Those family farmers, who struggle day after day in so many different \nways to try to make a living on the family farm, are told that which \nthey produce in such abundance and that which the world so desperately \nneeds somehow has no value. Talk about something that makes no sense, \nthis is it.\n  We have at least 500 million people in this world who go to bed every \nsingle night with an ache in their belly because it hurts to be hungry. \nAt the\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\nsame time, our family farmers are losing their shirts because they are \ntold the crop they struggled to produce has no value.\n  A world that is hungry and family farmers producing food the market \nsays has no value? Is there something not connecting here? You bet your \nlife there is something not connecting.\n  It is interesting to see what we have done in the last several weeks. \nThe priorities around here are not so much family farmers. The \npriorities, if one closes their eyes and listens to the debate, are: \nmissile defense, Mexican trucks, the managed care industry. Those are \nall the priorities, but when it comes to talking about the extra needs \nof family farmers during tough times, we are told they do not need that \nextra $1.9 billion. Enough votes were available in the Senate to pass \nthat legislation. We had 52 votes in favor of it.\n  I went to a real small school. I graduated from a high school in a \nclass of 9, but I figured out enough from math to understand when one \nhas 100 votes and 52 vote yes, that means yes wins.\n  We had enough votes to pass this legislation, and we had a vote on \nit. We received 52 votes. But guess what. It did not pass. Why? Because \nthere was a filibuster.\n  President Bush and the Republicans in the Senate said: We are going \nto filibuster this--which requires 60 votes to break --because we do \nnot want to give that extra aid to family farmers.\n  All we are talking about is a bridge over price valleys. We are \ntalking about a small bridge during tough times.\n\n  During this discussion, some friends of mine came to the Senate and \nsaid: Things are better on the farm, prices have improved.\n  When prices for grain hit a 25-year low and then improve slightly to \nonly an 18-year low, I suppose one could say things are better.\n  I ask those who say things are better to take a look at their bank \naccount. Have they lost 40 percent of their income? If so, then come \nhere and understand the empathy that ought to be shown to family \nfarmers. If not, do not talk about slight improvements.\n  Has anybody in the Senate, in recent years, raised a 250-pound hog? I \ndon't think so. If they had, they would be aware of the time during \nthese last several years in which a 250-pound hog brought less than 10 \ncents a pound. A 250-pound hog from the farm to the market brought less \nthan $25 for the entire hog. Someone bought that hog, processed it and \nsent it to the market to be laid on a grocery store shelf. But at the \ngrocery store, the meat from that hog cost $300 to the folks who bought \nit. This was the same hog that brought only $25 to the family farm.\n  Is there something wrong with this? Unless one has gotten less than \n$25 for a hog recently--and that has happened in recent years to those \nwho produce hogs--do not talk to me about slight improvements.\n  Yes, the price of hogs has increased, but tell me: What kind of loss \ndid family farmers incur when they went through that $25 price valley? \nCommodity prices have collapsed in a very significant way. In most \ncases, they have stayed way down. We need to do something about it.\n  I prefer that farmers get all of their income from the marketplace, \nbut at this point that is not possible. The grain markets have \ncollapsed. Until we find a way for that market to come back, if we want \nfamily farmers in our future, we need to provide a safety net. That is \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  We are trying to write a new farm bill, and we were trying to provide \nan emergency piece that will get them to the point where we get this \nnew farm bill in place. That is what this debate was about.\n  We lost today, no question about it. One can describe it a lot of \nways. There was once a general who lost badly in a battle, and the \npress asked him what happened. He said: As far as I am concerned, we \ntook quite a beating. He was pretty candid about it.\n  We lost this morning. North Dakota farmers lost $60 million, but this \nmorning was just the bell for the end of round one. There will be other \nrounds, and this issue is not going away. The $1.9 billion is not going \naway. That $1.9 billion is available to help family farmers.\n  Senator Harkin from Iowa brought that help in a bill that did not \nhave a budget point of order against it. It has been provided for in \nthe budget. It was available, and we ought to make it available when it \nis needed. It is needed now.\n  We lost today, but we will be back in September or in October. I \nbelieve in the end we will prevail on this issue.\n  Let me make a final point. Some say: Why is it I care so much about \nfamily farming? Why don't I deal with other issues, other businesses? \nMy State is 40 percent agriculture. What happens to family farmers has \nan impact on every Main Street and every business on every Main Street \nin the State of North Dakota. It is not just the economic issues that \nconcern me, however. I think our country is more secure, and I think \nour country is a better place when we have a broad network of producers \nliving on the farms in this country producing America's food.\n  Europe does it that way because they have been hungry in their past \nand they decided never to be hungry again. They want to foster and \nmaintain a network of producers across Europe. We ought to do the same.\n  The family farm is not just an economic unit. It is that, to be sure, \nand it is an economic unit that is destined to fail when prices \ncollapse if we do not do something to help. But it is much more than \njust an economic unit. Family farms produce more than just a bushel of \nwheat. Family farms produce a culture that is important to this \ncountry. They produce community. They produce values. They are a \nseedbed--and always have been a seedbed--for family values in our \ncountry. Family values that have for years been rolling from family \nfarms to our small towns to our large cities.\n  Family farms are not just some piece of nostalgia for us to talk \nabout. Those who support big corporate agriculture and would not mind \nseeing a couple big corporations farming America from California to \nMaine say the family farm is yesterday. They say, good for you, good \nfor supporting yesterday, but it is yesterday. It is like the little \nold diner, as I have said before, that is left behind when the \ninterstate comes through: It is nice to look at, does not mean much, \nbut it is not a viable part of our modern society. They are dead wrong. \nThey are as wrong as can be. The family farm is important in this \ncountry. It is important to its culture, and it is important to its \nfuture.\n  When we have a debate about these issues, we discover the answer to \nthese questions: Whom do you stand for, whom do you fight for, and what \nare your priorities? Some say: My priorities are to let Mexican trucks \ninto this country. That was the big debate we had for the past week and \na half. My priorities are to build a national missile defense system \nand it does not matter what it costs, they say. My priorities are to \nstand with the managed care industry and the big insurance companies in \nthe debate on a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what they say.\n  Those are not my priorities. My priorities are to say I stand for \nfamily farmers. I stand for the interests of family farmers and the \nrole they should play in our country's future. But they cannot and will \nnot play that roll, unless we help them over tough times.\n  Let me go back to one final point. This is a big world with a lot of \npeople living in it. I have traveled much of it. It is true that all \nover this world, even as I speak, people are dying from hunger and \nhunger-related causes, most of them children. About 40 to 45 people a \nminute die from hunger and hunger-related causes. My old friend--the \nlate Harry Chapin, who died many years ago, this wonderful singer, \nsongwriter, storyteller--used to devote half the proceeds of all of his \nconcerts every year to fight world hunger. He said this: If 45,000 \npeople died tomorrow in New Jersey, it would be headlines around the \nworld, but the winds of hunger blow every single day across this world \nand cause death. Nary a headline anywhere.\n  My point is, we have wonderful family farmers who struggle and risk \nall they have and work very hard to produce the best quality food \nproduced anywhere in the world. They produce this food in a world that \nis rife with hunger, in a world in which young children suffer by not \nhaving enough to eat in so many corners of our globe. And then our \nfamily farmers are told the food they produce has no value.\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\n  This country is the arms merchant of the world. We ship more military \nequipment and sell more military equipment than any other country in \nthe world by far. I would much prefer we be known as a country that \nhelps feed the world, as a country whose family farmers labor hard to \nproduce good quality food, and we find a way to connect that with the \nneeds that exist in this world and give children a chance.\n  This issue is a big issue, an important issue. Our family farmers \nhave a big stake in it. This morning in North Dakota, our family \nfarmers lost $60 million that they should have received to help them \nover these tough times.\n  We are going to be back. We lost round one, but we are not giving up. \nWe are going to come back and get that assistance for family farmers. \nWhy? Because we think it is important not just for family farmers, but \nbecause we think it is important for our country and for our country's \nfuture as well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I send a resolution to the desk and I ask that it be read \nin its entirety.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 154\n\n       Whereas Elizabeth B. Letchworth has dutifully served the \n     United States Senate for over 25 years;\n       Whereas Elizabeth's service to the Senate began with her \n     appointment as a United States Senate page in 1975;\n       Whereas Elizabeth continued her work as a special \n     Legislative assistant, a Republican Cloakroom assistant, and \n     as a Republican Floor Assistant;\n       Whereas in 1995 Elizabeth was appointed by the Majority \n     Leader and elected by the Senate to be Secretary for the \n     Majority;\n       Whereas Elizabeth was the first woman to be elected as \n     Republican Secretary;\n       Whereas Elizabeth was the youngest person to be elected the \n     Secretary for the majority at the age of 34: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the United States Senate commends Elizabeth \n     Letchworth for her many years of service to the United States \n     Senate, and wishes to express its deep appreciation and \n     gratitude for her contributions to the institution. In \n     addition, the Senate wishes Elizabeth and her husband Ron all \n     the best in their future endeavors.\n       Sec. 2. The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this resolution to Elizabeth Letchworth.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 154) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I know from the expressions on the faces of \nall of our officers and staff members in the Senate Chamber, there is a \nbittersweet feeling about the fact that Elizabeth Letchworth will be \nleaving to go on to the next venture in her life. I have said many \ntimes--not often enough--how much I appreciated the great work done by \nthe officers of the Senate and the staff, those who read the bills, the \nclerks, the Parliamentarians, our own floor assistants. They make this \nplace run. They serve us all so well, Democrat and Republican. We get \nto take the bows and go back home to our constituents, or home for the \nnight, and quite often they continue to work. I take this occasion to \nthank all for the great work they do and say how much I appreciate you.\n  The record will show someday that quite often I took into \nconsideration a very capable and deserving staff in deciding not to be \nin session on occasion. I do think about the staff, and I am sure that \nmy successor as majority leader will do the same.\n  Also I should say I regret that I am doing this alone, now, at this \nhour. There is probably not a Senator in this body who could not tell a \npersonal story about some event or some situation where Elizabeth \nLetchworth helped--again, Republican and Democrat, and Independent. She \nhas looked after us all, sometimes when we did not even deserve it, but \nshe was particularly helpful to me while I was majority leader. The \nrules of the Senate are not easy to understand. We mess them up every \nnow and then, especially if we try to do things on our own. If there is \nan Elizabeth or a Marty or a Lula or a Dave, quite often we avoid \nmaking a mistake.\n  Elizabeth has been special. On behalf of all the Republican Senators, \nand all Senators, we thank her for her years of service and dedication. \nSenator Dole had a lot of fine staff, but I guess Elizabeth is the one \nwho has stayed with me the longest. She serves the institution. She \ndoesn't serve one leader or another. She has served us all well. We \nhave been smart enough to keep her around.\n\n  While I wish we had all 100 Members here--and perhaps I should have \ndone this earlier today when we were all here, but it is typical of \nher--we were running around trying to figure out how we were going to \nget the Agriculture bill done with the least amount of pain and \nsuffering for both sides and for the President. And we got it done. \nOnce again, she helped to make it possible.\n  I wanted the resolution to be read in its entirety because she has \nhad quite a career. It is obvious she is quite young, still. But she \nhas been around this institution for almost 26 years, going back to \n1975. She started as a page during her junior and senior years in high \nschool. Obviously she should have known then not to stay any longer, \nbut she made a miscalculation, as young people quite often will, and \nshe has been here ever since.\n  Elizabeth had her first permanent position with former Republican \nHugh Scott of Pennsylvania. That was so long ago I was not even in \nCongress--maybe I was. I guess I would have been, but I can't remember \nthat far back. She served for Howard Baker, Bob Dole, and now for me as \nmajority and minority leader. She is the first and only one, to date, \nto hold the post of Republican secretary, and she served in that \nposition for 7 years.\n  Elizabeth is a native of Virginia. Let me note, also, her parents are \nJody and Don Baldwin. I want to mention them in particular because I \nhave known her father for about 30 years myself, going back to when I \nwas a staff member for a Democrat in the House. If that is not ancient \nhistory, I don't know what is. But I always loved him and enjoyed \nworking with him. I know he was oh so proud of Elizabeth and the \nconfidence we have had in her and the job she has done.\n  She did, again, show great wisdom. She married Ron Letchworth, born \nin Greenville, MS, finished high school at Hazlehurst, MS, and as is \ntypical of southern boys, he overran his kick coverage and married \nElizabeth. That means he married way over his head, but he is a great \nguy.\n  Elizabeth is retiring and going on to do different things, other \nthings. I believe they will live in North Carolina and she will tend to \nher other passion--other than the Senate--golf and other things about \nlife that are important. Too often, as staff members and as Senators, \nwe get to thinking this is the world, it is all here in this room, in \nthis Chamber, in this building, within the beltway. But out beyond the \nbeltway is a wonderful life, a lot of wonderful people, and a lot of \nwonderful things to do.\n  I understand there is life after the Senate. I am not sure of that, \nbut for now I look forward to finding that out someday myself.\n  Until then, I say to Elizabeth Letchworth, we appreciate all you have \ndone. We will always think of you and love you and we wish you the very \nbest at whatever you do.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I join in the accolades. I know I speak 100 percent for \nthe Independents here when I say that, having experienced the \ntremendous responsibility that is carried by Elizabeth. But I also know \nher effectiveness. There is not a Senator here who has\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\nnot been saved at least once, twice, or three times out of \nembarrassment by being astutely and highly reminded that you forgot to \ndo something, but, most of all, just the effectiveness and the \nconfidence that all of us have in Elizabeth, making sure that \neverything is fair and square. She has been fantastic.\n  I agree with every word the Senator said, and I am sure I speak for \nall Members not here.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I, too, come to the floor to publicly \nacknowledge and thank Elizabeth for the public service she has provided \nto her country. Public service is not easy. It requires many, many \nsacrifices. It is enough to provide the sacrifices, but to do it with \ngrace, with intelligence, with a sense of humor, and with a real sense \nof dedication is another matter altogether.\n  Elizabeth Letchworth did it just that way. She is a Republican. I am \na Democrat. As Senator Bond and others have noted, there are times when \nDemocrats and Republicans have it out in so many ways on the Senate \nfloor politically and philosophically. But there are those times when, \nin spite of our deep differences of opinion, we recognize there is a \nhigher calling, a higher responsibility, and a higher order. I must say \nin all the years I have known her, Elizabeth understood that and \ndemonstrated that with her actions and with her words.\n  She in many respects exemplifies the very finest of public service \nprofessionalism. She made our jobs easier. She made our jobs even more \nenjoyable, and certainly I think more rewarding.\n  On this her last day, I know I speak for all of my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle in expressing to her our heartfelt thanks, our \nsincere congratulations, and our best wishes for what we know will be a \nvery exciting future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to that of the \ndistinguished majority leader in extending my very best to a remarkable \nwoman who served all of us tremendously well during her tenure.\n  Elizabeth, we wish you the very, very best. I know to the outside \nworld, as they look at the floor and they see Republicans on one side \nand Democrats on the other, we must look slightly chaotic, to put it \nmildly to the casual observer. But what they do not see day in and day \nout is the tremendous work of the staff who represent us at one level. \nThey work so deeply and profoundly with all of us on many levels.\n  I cannot tell the Chair on how many occasions Elizabeth Letchworth \nhas been tremendously kind and generous to me when I have come to the \nfloor and asked for guidance or assistance. She never looked at me as \nif I were a Democrat when she responded to me. She looked at me as a \nSenator and a person who had a job to do.\n  We will miss you tremendously and only hope that your example will be \nfollowed by others who sit in that chair in the years to come, be they \nDemocrats or Republicans on either side.\n  I wish you and your family the very best, and I hope you come back \noften to see us.\n  I thank you for the tremendous courtesies that you have extended to \nme and to other Members of this body throughout your service. We thank \nyou immensely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a few months ago our distinguished \nRepublican leader presented a resolution which was adopted, I think, \nwith the wholehearted support of all of us. I want to take a moment for \na personal thank you to Elizabeth Letchworth, who has been an \nabsolutely invaluable guide and counselor and friend during the time I \nhave been in the Senate.\n  When we first get to the Senate, as the occupant of the chair knows \nwell, our normal question is: What is happening? It is a little bit \nobtuse and confusing. I often recall that great old saw that: In these \nchaotic times that are so complex, if you are not totally confused, you \nare not thinking clearly.\n  There are times when I have passed that test of thinking clearly by \nbeing totally confused. Usually the person I went to was Elizabeth, and \nI would say, ``What's happening?'' She could explain not only the \nprocedural aspects and what we needed to do in terms of making sure our \nrights were protected and we were able to present our views, whether on \nresolutions or bills--she was absolutely invaluable in that--but she \nalso had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen, too. Trying to \nschedule the day around the work of the Senate floor is a challenge \nwhich I don't think any of us not the leadership--maybe even not some \nof them--have mastered. Because things do change here, it is always \nvery difficult to figure out what is going on.\n  Elizabeth was the one who, time and time again, told us what was \nlikely to happen, when we could plan on things, what we could do.\n  On a personal note, as my son was growing up and going to school \nhere, the time I was able to spend with him in the evenings depended \nupon when we could complete our out-of-Senate work. Elizabeth became \nprobably the best friend I had in terms of my being able to spend some \ntime with my son. I would walk up to the desk in the front with a \nperplexed look on my face, and she would say: Are you having dinner \nwith your son tonight or do you have something planned? She knew in \nadvance what I was coming to ask her, and she was often able to tell me \nvery precisely what was going on.\n  In terms of my relationship with my son, I know I can add his thanks \nto mine for the great friendship and the thoughtfulness she exhibited \nin helping us deal with the complex time schedules of the Senate.\n  Most of all, I have to say in this body sometimes things get a little \ntense. There is tension across the aisle and there is tension with \ncolleagues on our own side of the aisle. But she was always able to \nmaintain a pleasant and a friendly attitude that helped take away some \nof the tension and helped smooth over some of the difficult times.\n  That is a high standard she has set. It is going to be very difficult \nfor those who follow her to equal that degree of service and \nfriendship. But I join with all my colleagues in saying a heartfelt \nthanks for being a wonderful friend, a great guide, great counselor. We \nwish you the very best of luck. We hope, if your sense of humor \npermits, you will come back and watch us from time to time and help \nguide us through the difficult times ahead. You have certainly done an \nexcellent job in the past.\n  I join wholeheartedly with a sincere vote of thanks for Elizabeth \nLetchworth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senate leaders have called \nattention to the fact this is the last day on which Republican \nSecretary Elizabeth Letchworth will work with us in this Chamber. Thus \nends the extraordinary career of an extraordinary Senate staff person.\n  Elizabeth originally came to the Senate as a page. She stayed for 26 \nyears. That is almost as long as Robinson Crusoe was on that island. He \nwas on that island 28 years, 2 months and 19 days, so Elizabeth has \nalmost equaled that. Her diligent, dedicated work, and her loyalty to \nthe Senate led to her eventual rise to Republican Secretary, the first \nwoman, the only woman, to serve in that capacity.\n  Ms. Letchworth has worked for or with six different Senate majority \nleaders, including myself. Therefore, I am speaking from personal \nexperience when I say she made life and work easier and more enjoyable \nfor all of us. Through the years, I came not only to respect \nElizabeth's work, but also to admire her as a person. She always \nprovided an oasis of calm in the middle of the many storms that brewed \nabout her on the Senate floor. She was friendly and courteous. She \nworked on the Republican side, but she was always straightforward with \nme, always accurate. Not once did she ever mislead me, but she always \nwas willing to be so helpful.\n  Hers were the qualities so important to Members on both sides of the \naisle because those qualities engender that precious commodity, and it \nis a most precious commodity in this Chamber, a most precious commodity \nif the Senate is to work its will. It is a commodity called trust. The \nMembers on the Democratic side of the aisle developed such a high \nregard for Elizabeth that when we learned she was leaving, the \nDemocratic Conference passed a resolution commending her for her \nextraordinary work and her illustrious career.\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\n  Elizabeth's work here in the Senate will be remembered. I hope she \nwill come back and see us. She has served the Senate well and in \nserving the Senate well, she served her country well. I wish the best \nfor Elizabeth Letchworth and her husband Ron as they embark upon a new \nphase in their lives. I doubt that our paths will ever cross in that \nnew phase because I do not play golf. I do not have much time for it, \nbut I hope this new phase in her life will be enjoyable. I trust she \nwill remember us as fondly as we will certainly remember her.\n\n                             Life's Mirror\n\n     There are loyal hearts, there are spirits brave,\n     There are souls that are pure and true,\n     Then give to the world the best you have,\n     And the best will come back to you.\n\n     Give love, and love to your life will flow,\n     A strength in your utmost need,\n     Have faith, and a score of hearts will show\n     Their faith in your word and deed.\n\n     Give truth, and your gift will be paid in kind;\n     And honor will honor meet:\n     And a smile that is sweet will surely find\n     A smile that is just as sweet.\n\n     Give pity and sorrow to those who mourn,\n     You will gather in flowers again\n     The scattered seeds from your thought out-borne,\n     Though the sowing seemed but vain.\n\n     For life is the mirror of king and slave,\n     Tis just what we are and do;\n     Then give to the world the best you have,\n     And the best will come back to you.--Madeline Bridges.\n\n  May God always bless you, Elizabeth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I rise today to voice my frustration about the events \nthat unfolded today regarding the Agricultural Economic Assistance Act. \nI am disappointed for one reason. This legislation leaves my farmers \nbehind. Of the $5.5 billion in this bill, only a very small amount goes \nto Vermont or any of the farms in our area of the country. Only $1.5 \nmillion out of the $5.5 billion in this package will reach Vermonters. \nThat amounts to only about $1,000 per farm.\n  Mr. President, 50 percent of the money goes to 10 States. Our dairy \nfarmers are the hardest working, most efficient. The compact has no \nFederal cost.\n  It is without question that the states in the Northeast are left out.\n  During the proceedings on this bill, there was much talk about the \namount of the overall spending package. As we continue to wrestle with \nbudget and spending concerns, I encourage my colleagues to take a look \nat a program that provides assistance and stability for farmers at no \ncost to the federal government, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.\n  The Northeast Dairy Compact was established to restore the regulatory \nauthority of the six New England states over the New England dairy \nmarketplace. This authority, however, must be granted by Congress.\n  By gaining the consent of Congress in 1996, the Northeast Dairy \nCompact has allowed the compact commission to regulate milk pricing in \nthe region.\n  Since July of 1997, when the compact commission first set the Class I \nover-order price at $16.94, the Northeast Dairy Compact has proven to \nbe a great success--providing farmers with a fair price for their milk, \nprotecting consumers from price spikes, reducing market dependency upon \nmilk from a single source, controlling excess supply, and helping to \npreserve rural landscapes by strengthening farm communities.\n  Farmers across our Nation face radically different conditions and \nfactors of production.\n  Differences in climate, transportation, feed, energy, and land value \nvalidate the need for regional pricing. Compacts allow states to \naddress these differences and create a price level that is appropriate \nfor producers, processors, retailers and consumers.\n  The stability created by the compact pricing mechanism is important \nfor several reasons. It guarantees farmers a fair price for their \nproduct and allows them to plan for the future. Farmers, knowing that \nthey can count on a fair price, can allocate money to purchase and \nrepair machinery, improve farming practices, and above all, stay in \nbusiness.\n  Opponents of compacts argue that compacts leads to overproduction. \nThese allegations, however, are unfounded. The Northeast Dairy Compact \nhas not led to overproduction during its first 4 years. In fact, during \n2000, the Northeast Dairy Compact states produced 4.7 billion pounds of \nmilk, a 0.6 percent reduction from 1999. Since the Northeast Dairy \nCompact has been in effect, milk production in the region has risen by \njust 2.2 percent. Nationally, milk production rose 7.4 percent from \n1997 to 2000. Over this same period, California, the largest milk \nproducing state in the country, increased its milk production by 16.9 \npercent.\n  Originally created as a three-year pilot program, the Northeast Dairy \nCompact has been extremely successful in demonstrating the merits of \ncompacts. We no longer need to speculate about the potential effects of \ncompacts. We now have the hard evidence--they are good for farmers, \ngood for consumers, and good for the environment.\n  As has been stated by several of my colleagues today, we, who \nrepresent the Northeast will do everything in our power to secure the \nsurvival of our family farms. We look forward to working throughout \nthis year to make sure the dairy compact is, again, allowed to show the \nbenefits to this Nation of effective farming which results in no cost \nto the Government.\n\n  It is certainly hard for me to understand why we get so much \ncriticism. It is the only farm program that doesn't cost the Federal \nGovernment money, and it is one of the first on some people's lists of \nprograms to get rid of. It is entirely unbelievable and \nincomprehensible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to talk about election reform. \nI have talked about it on a number of occasions.\n  Yesterday, as chairman of the Rules Committee, we had a markup of one \nof the election reform bills. I say with a high degree of sadness--and \nI truly mean this--that our good friends on the Republican side of the \naisle decided for whatever reasons not to show up; to sort of boycott \nthe markup. I haven't had that experience in my 20 years in the Senate \nand 6 years in the House. I gather that it may have happened on other \ncommittees but never on ones on which I served.\n  Again, I understand there is disappointment sometimes when our \namendments or our bills are not going to be marked up, or are not going \nto have the necessary votes to be marked up. I had scheduled the markup \nwell in advance with full notice. There are some 16 election reform \nbills that I know of which have been introduced in the Senate. We \ndidn't mark up all of them. We marked up one bill. It was open for \namendment, or substitution, as is the normal process. As I have been \nboth in the majority and minority, over the years that is how it has \nbeen done.\n  In the Rules Committee you cannot vote by proxy. You have to be there \nfor the final vote. You can only vote by proxy on amendments.\n  We had the convening of the markup at 9:00 in the morning with the \nfull idea that at least an hour-and-a-half would be available for \npeople to come and offer amendments, debate, or discuss the issue of \nelection reform.\n  I think there were some 200 to 300 people in the hearing room. Many \ncame in wheelchairs and some with seeing-eye dogs and other such \nequipment in order to assist them. There were people from various \nethnic and racial groups in the country who care about election reform, \nand average Americans who just wanted to see what Congress might do and \nwhat the Senate might do in response to the tremendously disappointing \nevents of last fall when we saw what tremendous shambles our election \nprocess is in. The events of last fall peeled back the scandalous \nconditions of our electoral processes all across the country--not only \nin one state during one election. Almost without exception, every State \nis in desperate need of repairing the election process.\n  As a result of what happened last fall, there has been a heightened \ndegree of interest in doing something about our election process. As a \nresult, as the chairman of the Rules Committee since June, I have had \nthree hearings on the issue. We had one hearing prior to that when I \nwas ranking member of the committee.\n  The bill I propose is one that has been cosponsored by 50 other \nMembers of this body. It received some rhetorical support from others \nwho are not exactly cosponsors but have told me that they will support \nthe bill when it comes to the floor. The same bill has been introduced \nby Congressman John Conyers of Michigan in the House of \nRepresentatives. It enjoys, I think, over 100 bipartisan cosponsors in \nthat body. There are also other bills that enjoy some support. The bill \noffered by the now ranking member of the Rules Committee, Senator \nMcConnell, has some 70 cosponsors. Thirty-one of those cosponsors are \ncosponsors of the bill I introduced.\n  There is a lot of interest in this subject matter. What was \ndisappointing to me and what saddened me was that on a day in which we \nwere going to hold a markup to figure out how we might improve the \nelectoral system so more people would have the opportunity to vote and \nhave their votes counted, our friends on the other side decided not to \ncome and be heard, let alone vote on this matter.\n\n  That troubles me, and I hope it is something not to be repeated. It \nis not a very good civics lesson, particularly for the dozens of people \nwho showed up yesterday. Some made the extra strenuous effort to be \nthere, considering their physical condition.\n  Mr. President, between 4 to 6 million people last November 7 showed \nup to vote and were told their votes would not count despite the fact \nthey had the right to vote. Many of them stood in lines in the colder \nnorthern tier States for hours on end.\n  I heard in our hearings in Atlanta the other day, with Senator \nCleland at my side, witnesses from Georgia who literally sat in rooms \nfor hours without chairs--elderly people simply waiting for a chance to \nvote and to have their votes counted.\n  When you have a markup of a bill that is open for all sorts of bills \nto be considered as amendments or substitutes before the committee, it \nis disheartening to me that such a message might be sent that we don't \ncare enough to vote on a bill such as this to encourage Americans to \nvote.\n  I hope that when we come back in September the offer I made in \nNovember of last year as the ranking Democrat on the committee to the \nthen-chairman of the committee to work together on a bipartisan bill \nwill be taken up, and that we can sit down and try to craft something a \nmajority of our colleagues would like to get behind and support; and \nthat the other body would do the same, and put some meaningful \nresources on the table so that States and localities will have the help \nto make the changes that are necessary in order for the election system \nin our country to work.\n  The election system is in a shambles. This is not some question of \nfixing a minor problem, I regret to report. All you need to do is read \nthe reports that have come out in the last few days--studies from the \nCivil Rights Commission report, to the reports by the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology.\n  Their studies indicate, as I noted a few moments ago, a stunning 4 to \n6 million people showed up last fall who attempted to vote or intended \nto vote and were not able to have their votes counted. It is a \nscandalous situation by any estimation.\n  For example, in my State alone--one of the most affluent States in \nthe Union, the State of Connecticut, on a per capita income basis--we \nhave not bought a new voting piece of equipment in almost a quarter of \na century. In fact, the company that made the machines we use in my \nState no longer exists.\n  Mr. President, there are some exceptions. I think some States, such \nas Rhode Island, because of the tremendous efforts of the former \nsecretary of State there--now Congressman Jim Langevin, who is a \nquadriplegic and has been elected to Congress by the good people of \nRhode Island--have become very progressive in regards to the electoral \nreform.\n  The people in Rhode Island who are blind, for instance, can vote \nwithout having someone go into the voting booth with them. It is the \nonly State I know of in the country where you can do that today. But \nCongressman Langevin was sensitive to it because of his own physical \ncondition. He told me, with very minor investments--about $400 per \nprecinct--they were able to make not only the voting place accessible \nbut the ballot accessible.\n\n  Last fall, 10 million blind people did not vote in America. I have a \nsister who is blind, blind from birth. She is legally blind. She \ntotally lacks vision in one eye, and has very slight vision in her \nother eye. From time to time, she has needed assistance--and I don't \nwant to suggest to you she has not voted on her own from time to time--\nbut she works with many people as part of the National Federation of \nthe Blind. She is a board member and attends their conventions. You \nneed only talk to people in your respective States, and ask people who \nare totally blind what it was like to go and vote last fall. They will \ntell you they had to\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\ntake someone with them to vote. Some States will allow you to bring a \nfamily member. Some insist you go in with a poll worker you don't know. \nSo the idea of casting a ballot in private is nonexistent.\n  Therefore, when I talk about trying to establish some national \nrequirements to improve the system, it isn't just better equipment, it \nis also making the voting booth more accessible to those who are \ndisabled.\n  At any rate, let me share with you these statistics. As I said, there \nwere 4 to 6 million people--this is stunning--trying to do their civic \nduty who were turned away and denied the chance to vote.\n  Earlier this week, former Presidents Ford and Carter released a \nreport. Their findings echo those of the Cal-Tech-MIT report. The \nreport makes clear that the election of 2000 was more than ``a closely \ncontested election,'' as some have attempted to characterize it. It was \nmore than a matter of a few disputed ballots in a single State. It was, \nin the words of the Ford-Carter Commission----\n  Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from the State of \nWashington. I would like to be able to proceed for about 5 additional \nminutes, if that is all right with her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  The Ford-Carter Commission described the results of last fall's \nelection as ``a political ordeal unlike any in living memory.'' It was \nan ordeal that spread beyond a few counties in Florida to encompass--\nand incriminate--the electoral system within our entire Nation.\n  Like the Cal-Tech-MIT report, this report adds to the growing body of \nevidence that in the year 2000--and in previous years--American voters \nwere disenfranchised--not by the thousands, or even by the tens of \nthousands, but by the millions. These are people who intended to vote, \nstood in line, did everything they thought they needed to do--thought \nthey had registered to vote--and for a variety of reasons were not able \nto cast their ballots, or not have their ballots counted.\n  They were people who were disproportionately poor, who are racial or \nethnic minorities, who speak English as a second--not first--language, \nand who are physically disabled.\n  In Florida alone, the U.S. Civil Rights Commission found that African \nAmerican voters were 10 times more likely than white voters to have \ntheir ballots thrown out.\n  Across the country, the votes of poor and minority voters were three \ntimes more likely to go uncounted than the ballots of wealthier Anglo \nvoters. That kind of disparity--based on race, income, ethnicity, \nlanguage, and physical ability--is unacceptable, at least it ought to \nbe, in any nation that calls itself a democracy. For a nation such as \nours--which is the birth place of modern democracy, which holds itself \nout among the community of nations as an emblem of self-governance--six \nmillion people, out of 100 million who cast their ballots, were \nthwarted. That is more than unacceptable; it is unconscionable.\n\n  Likewise, as our colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, has said, it \nis unacceptable and unconscionable when any American abuses his or her \nright to vote by committing fraud. I wholeheartedly endorse the \ncomments that he made on the Senate floor yesterday that we need to \nexpand voter participation and reduce voter fraud in our Nation.\n  I appreciate, by the way, the Senator from Missouri telling me the \nnight before what he was going to say on the floor the next day. Those \nare common courtesies we extend to each other, regardless of \ndifferences that may exist.\n  Voter fraud and voter disenfranchisement are different wrongs, but \nthey have a similar impact. They both debase our electoral system. They \nboth distort the value of votes lawfully cast. And they both diminish \nthe true will of the American people. I wholeheartedly embrace his \nstatement that we need reforms that ensure that more Americans can vote \nand that fewer can cheat.\n  I look forward to working with him during the month of August, and \nhis staff, to see if we can craft those parts of what he has proposed \nas a part of our bill.\n  Some have argued that--against this overwhelming evidence that \nmillions of Americans are routinely deprived their right to effectively \nexercise the most fundamental right we have in a democracy; against \nthis overwhelming evidence that our electoral system is in profound \nneed of reform--we should make strengthening our election laws \noptional.\n  In 1965 we passed the Voting Rights Act. We did not make the \nelimination of the poll tax or elimination of the literacy tests an \noption. We said: It is wrong because you are voting for President of \nthe United States and the National Congress.\n  If we were just voting for the local sheriff or the school board or \nthe general assembly of that State, then I do not think the Federal \nGovernment has a lot to say. You might argue that we do. But when you \nare voting for the President and the National Congress, then, if you \ndeprive people the right to vote, either de jure, by law, or de facto \nbecause of what you failed to do to make the system accessible to \npeople, then you have affected the people who vote in my State when \nthey vote for President or they vote for the National Congress.\n  So the idea that somehow we are going to make de facto barriers to \npeople's right to vote optional is as ludicrous on its face as it was \nin 1965 to say we had no right to abandon or get rid of de jure hurdles \nto people's right to vote when it came to casting ballots for the \nPresidency and the Congress of the United States.\n  I am not interested in having overly burdensome requirements. I do \nnot think having basic national standards that say, if you are blind, \nyou have the right to vote in private; if you are disabled and cannot \nreach the machine, you ought to be able to do so. We did that with the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. You cannot go into a public \naccommodation or a public restroom that isn't handicap accessible \ntoday. You ought not be able to go into a voting booth that isn't \nhandicap accessible.\n  I do not think you are going to get that by leaving it optional. I \nthink there does need to be a national requirement to see to it you do \nnot have these punch-hole ballots or chads hanging around all over the \nplace. I do not care if you want to have a different machine in every \nState, but meet basic minimum requirements.\n  Provisional voting, giving people the right to see how they voted--\nyou can go to a gasoline station and you know how much gas you put in \nyour car because you get a receipt to look at. Can't we do the same for \na voting machine, so that when you vote, and you come out of the booth, \nyou can take a look and make sure your vote was recorded as you \nintended it to be recorded in the 21st century? Or can't we have a \nsample ballot so you might have some idea about what you are going to \nsee in the voting booth when you walk into that booth for the very \nfirst time?\n  Those are the kinds of requirements I am talking about. I do not \nthink that is overly aggressive, overly excessive. And I believe that \nif the National Government requires it, that we ought to also pay for \nit.\n  My bill does both. I am pleased to say the Presiding Officer and \nothers are cosponsors of the bill we have introduced. I am not \nsuggesting it is perfect. I hope when we come back in September--I have \nbeen told by the majority leader; I appreciate his tremendous \nleadership on this issue--we will make this a priority issue so we can \nget it done. We can provide some resources and start to make a \ndifference in the 2002 elections. Hopefully, by the 2004 Presidential \nrace, we will at least reduce substantially the amount of abuse we saw \noccur in the 2000 election, and hereafter we will see to it that voting \nopportunities are not going to be left to wither and deteriorate to the \npoint they had, as we evidenced, in the year 2000. It is not easy. It \nis going to take some investment.\n  I will end on this note. It was said by Thomas Paine more than 200 \nyears ago. I know these other issues are important. I don't minimize \nthem, whether we are talking about an energy bill, a farm bill, a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, all those questions that we debate every day \nas elected representatives in this body, down the hall in the other \nbody, or down the street in the White House. All of that depends, as \nThomas Paine\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nsaid, on the right to vote. The right to vote is the right upon which \nall other rights depend. If we can't get the right to vote right, then \nwhat confidence do people have that we will make the kinds of decisions \nthey asked us to make when they sent us here as their representatives?\n  I know it is not as popular and doesn't have the same glamour \nattached to it as some of these other issues. I don't think there is \nanything more important this Congress can do than to see to it we \nredress the wrongs committed in the year 2000 and the years before \nthen.\n  I urge my colleagues, particularly those from the other side. I have \ngone to many of their offices. I have let them know. I have visited \nthem the last several weeks. I have explained the bill and asked for \ntheir ideas. I want a bipartisan bill. I have been to the office of Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, the offices of Lincoln Chafee, Peter Fitzgerald, \nKit Bond--I have talked to them--on down the list. I will continue to \ndo so because I want a bipartisan bill. I am saddened again that \nyesterday my Republican friends on the Rules Committee decided not to \ncome and vote and be heard on a bill that was going to try to improve \npeople's right to vote in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Connecticut \nfor his fine remarks on election reform, a very important issue, \nindeed, and one I am sure we will be addressing when we resume after \nour summer recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8878-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8878-S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WASHINGTON STATE AGRICULTURE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Senate is about to adjourn for a \nsummer recess, clearly doing so after having moved this morning on an \nAgriculture supplemental bill that does not truly understand the plight \nof American farmers and the impacts in my home State of Washington.\n  The impact on Washington State farmers and the impact they have on \nour State economy and the national economy is clear. There are over \n40,000 farmers in our State covering 15 million acres of land. \nWashington State apples are 50 percent of our Nation's apples, and \nWashington State is the third largest wheat-producing State in the \ncountry. We export about 90 percent of that wheat internationally.\n  Farmers in our State have been struck by a series of disasters this \nyear. They have suffered a drought, they have suffered a destructive \nstorm, and this morning they are left with an Ag supplemental bill that \ndoes not do enough for the farmers in my State. In fact, this bill we \nhave passed, compared to the Harkin bill, leaves my State with hundreds \nof millions of dollars less resources for both wheat and apples.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a document produced by \nthe State of Washington that details the elements and impacts of the \ndrought.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      How Is Agriculture Affected\n\n       The drought largely is the result of reduced snow pack in \n     the Cascade Mountains, which acts as storage for water that \n     is released during the spring and early summer. This water is \n     captured in rivers and reservoirs where it is distributed via \n     irrigation systems to farmers. This relatively reliable water \n     supply has allowed the arid fields of eastern Washington to \n     become some of the most productive and diverse agricultural \n     lands in the United States.\n       The drought affects not only the water available from \n     rivers and reservoirs for irrigated crops, but may affect \n     non-irrigated crops as well. Insufficient soil moisture of \n     prolonged dry conditions will reduce yields for those crops.\n       Agriculture is the core industry of rural Washington and \n     supports the small towns and cities of eastern Washington. In \n     1997, the food and agriculture industry--farming, food \n     processing, warehousing, transportation and farm services--\n     employed over 183,000 people. Farming, excluding farm owners \n     and families, employs about 84,000 people in Washington.\n       In, 1999 farmers harvested over $5.3 billion while food \n     processors sold $8.9 billion worth of products. Washington's \n     food and agricultural companies exported $3.5 billion of \n     products. The most valuable of these crops come from \n     irrigated land. About 27 percent of Washington's cropland is \n     irrigated, yet this acreage produces more than 70 percent of \n     the total value of all of Washington State's harvest. This \n     includes the most valuable crops: apples; cherries and other \n     tree fruit; vegetables; onions; and potatoes. All of the 20 \n     most valuable crops, by harvest value per acre, are \n     irrigated.\n       Agriculture also is potentially affected by disruptions in \n     transportation, especially barge traffic due to lower river \n     levels. In the case of wheat, for example, there is \n     insufficient truck and rail capacity to absorb the load if \n     barge transportation is curtailed.\n       The current drought, unlike other recent droughts, is \n     occurring at a time when farmers are facing many other \n     serious challenges. Many smaller farms are likely to face \n     bankruptcy or leave farming. The weak condition of many \n     segments of the agriculture industry in the state makes the \n     industry more vulnerable to the effects of the drought. Most \n     farmers are in their third year of net losses due to poor \n     market conditions. Many farmers lack the credit to either \n     survive a year without a harvest or make the investments \n     necessary to mitigate the impacts--such as drilling deep \n     wells or upgrading irrigation and distribution systems.\n       Impacts on the production of crops also may affect the \n     market prices for those corps, which will affect farmers in \n     different ways. For example, Washington produces half of the \n     U.S. apple crop and a significant reduction in harvest may \n     increase the price for those farmers who remain in business. \n     Therefore, some farmers may suffer while others who have \n     water may actually see improved revenue.\n       The extraordinary rise in energy costs exacerbates the \n     problem for farmers. Farmers rely on diesel fuel for their \n     equipment. Current diesel prices are up 20 percent to 30 \n     percent over last year's levels. The cost of electricity to \n     run pumps is expected to rise as much as 150 percent. The \n     price of natural gas, which is used to make fertilizer, has \n     risen sharply. Most of the irrigated crops are either stored \n     in controlled atmosphere warehouses or processed (canned, \n     dried, frozen, etc.) Cold storage and processing require \n     large amounts of energy (especially electricity and natural \n     gas) and water. If these costs force closure of the \n     processing plants, farmers may have no place to sell their \n     products.\n       Increased risk of disease, insects, noxious weeds, erosion, \n     and fire resulting from abandoned fields, are also concerns. \n     Without maintenance of the fields or removal of abandoned \n     orchards, the risk of damage to adjoining fields is \n     significant. The Washington State Department of Agriculture \n     (WSDA) has requested funds to assist local Weed Boards to \n     deal with these problems, while state and federal fire \n     officials are preparing for a potentially record year for \n     forest and range fires.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. It reads in part:\n\n       The current drought, unlike other recent droughts, is \n     occurring at a time when farmers are facing many other \n     serious challenges. Many smaller farms are likely to face \n     bankruptcy or leave farming altogether. The weak condition of \n     many segments of the agriculture industry in the state makes \n     the industry more vulnerable to the effects of drought. Most \n     farmers are in their third year of net losses due to poor \n     market conditions. Many farmers lack the credit to survive \n     another year without a harvest or make the investments \n     necessary to mitigate these impacts--such as drilling deep \n     wells or upgrading irrigation and distribution systems.\n\n  From Ritzville to Yakima, from Chelan to Wenatchee, the family farms \nin my State are hurting. Just this past week I met with farmers from \nRitzville; they are wheat farmers. Wheat farmers are seeing a 14-year \nlow in wheat prices. They made it clear they need help and they need \nhelp now.\n  Part of our discussion is what is the sentiment for support of the \nfamily farms across our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from a \nlocal Walla Walla newspaper about the impacts.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Poll: Voters Support Farm and Ranch Conservation Efforts\n\n       Walla Walla.--America's farms and ranches are important to \n     the nation's voters, and not just for their locally grown \n     food.\n       A new poll released today shows that voters value farms and \n     ranches for the conservation benefits they provide, such as \n     cleaner air and water and wildlife habitat. And not only do \n     voters want the federal government to support programs that \n     secure those values, by linking conservation practices with \n     farm payments, but voters are willing to pay to ensure \n     conservation benefits from farms and ranches.\n       A poll, a telephone survey of 1,024 registered voters \n     nationwide, uncovered strong support for American \n     agriculture, with 81 percent of voters saying they want their \n     food to come from within the United States.\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\n       Americans professed a close connection to farmers and \n     ranchers, with 70 percent reporting that they have bought \n     something directly from a farmer during the last year, such \n     as at a farm stand or a farmers' market. Voter concern about \n     farm environmental issues registers almost as high as for \n     current ``hot'' political issues.\n       For example, 71 percent are concerned about pesticide \n     residues on food and 69 percent of American voters say they \n     are concerned about loss of farmland to development, compared \n     with more than 80 percent of voters concerned about public \n     education and gas prices.\n       Seventy-eight percent of the American electorate report \n     they are aware of government income support programs for \n     farmers. Voters strongly approve of these programs when they \n     are used to correct low market prices or in cases of drought \n     or flood damage.\n       The addition of conservation conditions to farm supports, \n     however, received overwhelming approval, as 75 percent of \n     American voters feel income support to the American farmer \n     should come with the stipulation that farmers are required to \n     apply ``one or more conservation practices,'' such as \n     protecting wetlands or preventing water pollution.\n       ``We were struck by how many voters make the link between \n     agriculture and conservation benefits,'' said Ralph Grossi, \n     president of American Farmland Trust. ``The public \n     feels strongly about all the values they see in American \n     agriculture; not only do they appreciate America's bounty \n     on their tables, they also realize farms and ranches \n     provide environmental benefits and they are willing to \n     share the cost.''\n       Several programs exist to support conservation on farms and \n     ranches, among them the Farmland Protection Program, \n     Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Wetlands \n     Reserve Program.\n       For each of these programs, demand has far outstripped \n     federal funding in 2001. For WRP alone, unmet requests from \n     farmers totaled $568 million. This year FPP was only \n     allocated $17.5 million in funding--leaving a gap of $90 \n     million and hundreds of farmers waiting in line to protect \n     their land.\n       ``As expected, when we asked voters about how they wanted \n     to increase federal spending, they placed a high priority on \n     addressing pressing needs like finding cures for cancer, \n     educating our children and ensuring adequate energy \n     supplies,'' said Grossi. ``What we did not expect was the \n     finding that a majority of voters--53 percent--feel \n     increasing funds to keep productive farmland from being \n     developed should be a national priority.''\n       And voters are willing to spend their own money to help \n     farmers protect the environment. When asked whether they \n     would like to get all or some of possible $100 tax refund, 63 \n     percent said they'd forego some of that money to protect \n     waterways, wetlands or wildlife habitat.\n       ``With such strong support for agricultural conservation, \n     policymakers should triple conservation spending in the next \n     farm bill,'' Grossi pointed out. ``The programs are there, \n     and they work. With $21 billion allocated annually to farm \n     support payments by the budget agreement, half should be \n     reserved for conservation programs. It's just a question of \n     putting some financial muscle into making conservation \n     happen.''\n       ``Over the past 19 year I have repeatedly surveyed farmers \n     and found them very willing to conserve natural resources. \n     These new results strongly indicate that conservation-\n     oriented farm programs will please not just farmers, but most \n     voters,'' said Dr. J. Dixon Esseks, a political scientist \n     from Northern Illinois University who directed the poll.\n       The telephone survey of 1,024 registered voters nationwide \n     was conducted June 2-21, 2001, with a margin of sampling \n     error of +3.1 percent in 95 out of 100 cases.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This article discusses what Americans really want to do \nto help family farmers. Actually, a poll was taken to understand \nAmerican support for what we might do in the Senate. It said that 78 \npercent of the American electorate report that they are aware of \ngovernment income support programs for farmers, and voters strongly \napprove of these programs when they are used in a fashion to correct \nlow market prices or in case of drought or flood damage. We should be \nsecure in knowing that our constituents want to help family farms.\n  The family farms in my State are on the brink. They are on the brink \nbecause our Governor has declared a drought in Washington State. The \ndrought, along with an energy crisis, is having a catastrophic effect \non agriculture. In many cases water is not available for irrigation; \nthe farmers have been unable to get the irrigated water supply they \nneed. Right in the middle of this trouble, a severe storm occurred and \ngreatly impacted the fruit tree industry in the State, ruining various \norchards throughout the central part of Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from the \nYakima Herald that reads in part:\n\n       Silent and unyielding, drought stalks Central Washington. . \n     . . Crops are wilting, jobs are evaporating, income needed to \n     sustain family farms and rural communities is vanishing, \n     stolen away by this drought like a thief in the night.\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Yakima Herald-Republic, July 29, 2001]\n\n                             Dry, Dry Again\n\n                           (By David Lester)\n\n       Silent and unyielding, drought stalks Central Washington \n     during this unsettling summer of 2001. Crops are wilting, \n     jobs are evaporating and income needed to sustain farm \n     families and rural communities is vanishing, stolen away by \n     this drought like a thief in the night.\n       The drought could mean staggering losses, estimated in one \n     analysis at more than $270 million in reduced income for \n     farmers, lost jobs and less money circulating through the \n     local economy.\n       Some of those effects already are being felt. Farm \n     employment is down. Farm service businesses are reporting \n     steep declines in sales and have laid off workers to \n     compensate.\n       Land has been idled in some parts of the Yakima Valley \n     because there isn't enough water to go around, or the water \n     has been transferred to another district suffering a worse \n     shortage. The Roza Irrigation District, among the most \n     severely affected, has drained its reserves of $2 million to \n     buy precious water.\n       And like victims of theft, area residents are sensing a \n     loss of confidence and an eroding optimism about the future.\n       They also are grieving.\n       Carelessness may have lit the match, but drought fueled the \n     fire that took the lives of four young area firefighters July \n     10 in a tinder-dry and remote part of the Okanogan few people \n     had ever heard of.\n       The entire Northwest has many weeks yet during which it \n     must deal with the threat of raging forest fires, much as \n     during the Chelan-area Tyee Creek and the Lakebeds complex \n     fires in Klickitat County in 1994.\n       ``Locally in Central and Eastern Washington, we have the \n     potential to have fires like the ones in Montana last \n     summer,'' said Mick Mueller, an ecologist for the U.S. Forest \n     Service's Leaveworth Ranger District.\n       Wildfire blackened more than 600,000 acres in Montana and a \n     similar amount in Idaho last year. It was the worst wildlife \n     season in the West in 50 years.\n\n\n                        preparing for the worst\n\n       When Gov. Gary Locke declared a drought emergency March 14, \n     the outlook statewide was bleak for municipal water supplies, \n     irrigation, migratory fish and power production. But spring \n     rains eased drought worries in Western Washington and the \n     dryland wheat country in the far eastern part of the state.\n       Doug McChesney, state Ecology Department coordinator for \n     drought response, said the Yakima Basin continues to suffer \n     because of its reliance on a limited water-storage system \n     that places a premium on a healthy snowpack every year. Also, \n     a greater percentage of Central Washington farmland relies on \n     junior water rights than the rest of the state.\n       When the snowpack doesn't come during the winter, the basin \n     suffers, as it has this year.\n       The numbers tell the story: As of June 1, the amount of \n     water in the snow was just 22 percent of average. All snow \n     was gone by July 1. The total amount of water produced in the \n     watershed through July was just 46 percent of average and the \n     second-lowest in 75 years, second only to 1977. Reservoir \n     storage on July 1 was just 66 percent of average, the second-\n     lowest in 60 years.\n       ``The west side of the state is clearly better off. It's \n     the band down the middle of the state from the Cascade crest \n     to the east where the worst of the problems are,'' McChesney \n     said.\n       When higher energy costs, higher fertilizer costs and three \n     years of poor marketing conditions for apples and other crops \n     are added in, Central Washington farmers are carrying most of \n     the burden for the rest of the state.\n       ``They are getting clobbered. There is no doubt about \n     that,'' McChesney added.\n       The region went through a nearly identical drought in 1994, \n     but as McChesney suggested, this year's record drought \n     couldn't have come at a worse time.\n\n\n                           search for storage\n\n       Already reeling from several years of poor market prices, \n     the 2001 drought is staggering the area with another body \n     blow.\n       ``Farmers are survivors, but they are being pushed about as \n     far as they can be pushed,'' observed Tom Carpenter, a \n     longtime Granger farmer on the Roza Irrigation District.\n       Carpenter and other basin farmers are once again pushing \n     for new water storage to insulate the basin from drought. The \n     five Cascade lakes in the Yakima Irrigation Project can store \n     less than half the water used in the basin each year.\n       No new storage has been constructed since 1933. In the \n     intervening years, the basin went through a natural maturing \n     process with the planting of more perennial crops like apples \n     and other tree fruits, mint, grapes, and hops that must have \n     water every year to survive. Also, a relatively new demand \n     for water to protect threatened fish is taxing the system \n     further.\n       Carpenter, a diversified grower and an active player in \n     basin water issues for many\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\n     years, said the people who built the basin found ways to get \n     things done.\n       ``I wonder what's wrong with us. Why don't we have the \n     vision to do what we need to do and take care of everyone's \n     interests?'' he asked. ``We are just fighting over the \n     crumbs.''\n       The impacts aren't being felt solely on the 72,000-acre \n     Roza or the 59,000-acre Kittitas Reclamation District, where \n     farmers are receiving barely a third of a normal water \n     supply.\n       They are at the end of the line in a water-rights system \n     that favors those who were here first. The first homesteaders \n     have what are called senior water rights. Their rights are \n     satisfied first when there isn't enough to go around. Later \n     arrivals, known as juniors, share what's left.\n       It is a system that has led to the most restrictive \n     rationing in the Yakima Irrigation Project's 96-year history. \n     In 1994, junior users were limited to 38 percent of a full \n     supply.\n       But because the large irrigation divisions in the 464,000-\n     acre project have a combination of senioor and junior rights, \n     farmers in other parts of the basin, like the sprawling \n     Wapato Irrigation Project, are struggling with too little \n     water to have a successful harvest.\n\n\n                         Adding Up the Dollars\n\n       A 4-year-old economic-impact analysis prepared by Northwest \n     Economic Associates of Vancouver, Wash., an agriculture and \n     natural resources economics consulting firm, suggests a water \n     shortage like 2001 would cut farm income in the Yakima River \n     Basin by $136 milllion, or 13 percent of the total in an \n     average year.\n       When the effect of smaller crops on processors, farm \n     suppliers, trucking and retail are included, the figure \n     balloons to more than a quarter of a billion dollars.\n       The firm prepared the report for the Tri-County Water \n     Resource Agency, a Yakima-based consortium of counties, \n     cities and irrigation districts working to meet all water \n     needs in the three-county basin.\n       William Dillingham, a senior economist for the state \n     Employment Security Department, said the agency is trying to \n     track the effects of a historic water shortage on employment \n     in Central Washington counties.\n       ``Yakima County has a huge amount of its employment \n     associated with agriculture. When you tie in food processing, \n     transportation and ag services, that number begins to get \n     pretty big, pretty quickly,'' he said.\n       State officials have taken a stab at just how big. Using \n     the Northwest Economic Associates study as a basis for their \n     estimate, four state agencies in late June projected the 2001 \n     drought could cut statewide farm production by up to $400 \n     million, or about 12.5 percent of total farm production. In \n     addition, up to 7,500 farm jobs would be lost, as would up to \n     1,400 jobs in the farm-related processing, trucking, \n     wholesaling and warehousing industries.\n       The projection recognizes the local losses would not be \n     mirrored statewide because other parts of the state have \n     near-normal water supplies and would have average crop \n     production.\n       In the midst of all this, Central Yakima Valley fruit \n     growers suffered millions of dollars in crop damage from a \n     freak and powerful wind-and-hail storm in late June, with \n     gusts clocked at 108 mph in one Zillah orchard.\n       Looking at the growing tale of woe, a state official asked \n     privately: ``What's next, a plague of locusts?''\n\n\n                        Fish are Suffering, Too\n\n       River flows depleted to record lows in some places because \n     of too little winter snow are threatening the Northwest's \n     multimillion-dollar investment in savings its declining \n     salmon and steelhead runs. More water is being used to turn \n     Columbia River power turbines to generate needed power, \n     exposing more fish to a near-certain death.\n       The Yakima Valley's celebration of a huge returning run of \n     adult spring chinook this year, the largest in at least 50 \n     years, is tempered by the prospect that some of these fish \n     won't spawn successfully in low September river flows.\n       Also, young chinook salmon and threatened steelhead trout \n     starting their dangerous journey to the Pacific Ocean are \n     being subjected to higher water temperatures and more \n     predators as the Lower Yakima River, southeast of Prosser, \n     rides along slightly above minimum streamflows.\n       Higher fish losses this year would mean a smaller run of \n     adults in two to three years. Dwindling numbers could turn up \n     the pressure for more fish protective measures.\n       ``Rising water temperatures may not kill fish by itself, \n     but predators are more active eaters when temperatures are \n     higher,'' said Dale Bambrick of Ellensburg, the Eastern \n     Washington habitat team leader for the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service. ``It's a double whammy. The salmon and \n     steelhead critters aren't functioning well.''\n\n\n                        Drought Effect Reach Far\n\n       The struggle on the farm is being felt in town, too.\n       City residents in parts of Yakima and Kennewick are being \n     required to rotate water use to make an inadequate supply \n     stretch.\n       Workers in industries that supply farmers and process the \n     commodities they produce are being laid off because there is \n     too little work.\n       Duane Huppert, who has owned Huppert Farm and Lawn Center \n     in Ellensburg for 17 years, said he canceled a farm implement \n     order this spring when the initial water forecast came out in \n     March.\n       ``When that came out, it was like turning off the business \n     as far as ag sales are concerned,'' Huppert said. ``It really \n     stops any farmer from buying anything when you look at a year \n     like this.''\n       ``As a farm equipment dealer, our sales were cut \n     drastically,'' he added.\n       Huppert, who sells John Deere products, said he is \n     concerned about the lingering effects of this drought into \n     next year and beyond.\n       ``This community is an ag community whether people like it \n     or not,'' he said, ``We get a lot of income from farmers, and \n     the money they spend goes through a lot of businesses.''\n       In the heart of the Yakima Valley in Sunnyside, Bleyhl Farm \n     Service, a supplier of feed, fuel, fertilizer and equipment \n     to farmers, also is feeling the pinch.\n       Verle Kirk, the firm's Sunnyside store division manager, \n     said the firm cut its work force in Sunnyside by about 14 \n     percent to some 70 employees in response to a cut in sales.\n       Sales of irrigation equipment dropped when the Roza shut \n     down for three weeks in May to stretch its water supply. \n     Sales have not recovered, Kirk said.\n       Farmers are also buying less nitrogen fertilizer because of \n     higher costs for natural gas used to produce it. Corn seed \n     isn't moving because the crop requires more water.\n       ``It seems like these guys are shopping harder. \n     Profitability hasn't been good the last two years,'' he said. \n     ``It hasn't been good this year. If they don't make money, it \n     won't get any better next year.''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the article goes on to state that the \ndrought could mean staggering losses of more than $270 million in \nreduced income from farmers, lost jobs, and less money circulating \nthrough our local economy.\n  The most critical stories are emerging from my State, including those \nof the apple industry. An agricultural assistance bill such as the one \nwe passed that does not support apple growers fails to understand a \nvery important part of our agricultural sector. You heard from many of \nmy colleagues from New York, Michigan, and Maine about the fact that we \nneed to do something to help America's apple growers who are \nexperiencing the worst economic losses in more than 70 years.\n  Currently prices are as low as 40 percent below the cost of \nproduction. Between 1995 and 1998, apple growers lost approximately \n$760 million due to questionable import practices involving such \ncountries as China and Korea, in addition to the stiff export tariffs.\n  Growers like to be self-sufficient and would not ask for help if it \ndid not mean their survival. Many growers in financial crisis are being \npushed off their farms. One study has estimated that the numbers of \nthose leaving their farms could be as high as 30 percent.\n  We need to stop this exodus from the family farms by providing \nfarmers this year with the support and money they desperately need. The \nHarkin bill would have done that. Instead, as the Senator from Iowa \nstated earlier, with a gun to our head and without the recourse of \ngetting cooperation and support from the President or from our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, we passed an Ag supplemental \nbill that will mean hundreds of millions fewer dollars to the State of \nWashington and to family farmers. We need to do better.\n  Many of my colleagues have talked about the shortcomings of this \nlegislation. So as we prepare for adjournment, as wheat farmers begin \ntheir harvest, as apple growers deal with drought and suffer from storm \nloss, as communities throughout Washington State and the country deal \nwith the economic impacts being felt by the agricultural industry, I \nhope my colleagues will think hard about these issues and return in \nSeptember to do more for family farmers and to show our appreciation \nfor that industry.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Washington has \nexpired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8878-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8878-S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WASHINGTON STATE AGRICULTURE\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the Senate is about to adjourn for a \nsummer recess, clearly doing so after having moved this morning on an \nAgriculture supplemental bill that does not truly understand the plight \nof American farmers and the impacts in my home State of Washington.\n  The impact on Washington State farmers and the impact they have on \nour State economy and the national economy is clear. There are over \n40,000 farmers in our State covering 15 million acres of land. \nWashington State apples are 50 percent of our Nation's apples, and \nWashington State is the third largest wheat-producing State in the \ncountry. We export about 90 percent of that wheat internationally.\n  Farmers in our State have been struck by a series of disasters this \nyear. They have suffered a drought, they have suffered a destructive \nstorm, and this morning they are left with an Ag supplemental bill that \ndoes not do enough for the farmers in my State. In fact, this bill we \nhave passed, compared to the Harkin bill, leaves my State with hundreds \nof millions of dollars less resources for both wheat and apples.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a document produced by \nthe State of Washington that details the elements and impacts of the \ndrought.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      How Is Agriculture Affected\n\n       The drought largely is the result of reduced snow pack in \n     the Cascade Mountains, which acts as storage for water that \n     is released during the spring and early summer. This water is \n     captured in rivers and reservoirs where it is distributed via \n     irrigation systems to farmers. This relatively reliable water \n     supply has allowed the arid fields of eastern Washington to \n     become some of the most productive and diverse agricultural \n     lands in the United States.\n       The drought affects not only the water available from \n     rivers and reservoirs for irrigated crops, but may affect \n     non-irrigated crops as well. Insufficient soil moisture of \n     prolonged dry conditions will reduce yields for those crops.\n       Agriculture is the core industry of rural Washington and \n     supports the small towns and cities of eastern Washington. In \n     1997, the food and agriculture industry--farming, food \n     processing, warehousing, transportation and farm services--\n     employed over 183,000 people. Farming, excluding farm owners \n     and families, employs about 84,000 people in Washington.\n       In, 1999 farmers harvested over $5.3 billion while food \n     processors sold $8.9 billion worth of products. Washington's \n     food and agricultural companies exported $3.5 billion of \n     products. The most valuable of these crops come from \n     irrigated land. About 27 percent of Washington's cropland is \n     irrigated, yet this acreage produces more than 70 percent of \n     the total value of all of Washington State's harvest. This \n     includes the most valuable crops: apples; cherries and other \n     tree fruit; vegetables; onions; and potatoes. All of the 20 \n     most valuable crops, by harvest value per acre, are \n     irrigated.\n       Agriculture also is potentially affected by disruptions in \n     transportation, especially barge traffic due to lower river \n     levels. In the case of wheat, for example, there is \n     insufficient truck and rail capacity to absorb the load if \n     barge transportation is curtailed.\n       The current drought, unlike other recent droughts, is \n     occurring at a time when farmers are facing many other \n     serious challenges. Many smaller farms are likely to face \n     bankruptcy or leave farming. The weak condition of many \n     segments of the agriculture industry in the state makes the \n     industry more vulnerable to the effects of the drought. Most \n     farmers are in their third year of net losses due to poor \n     market conditions. Many farmers lack the credit to either \n     survive a year without a harvest or make the investments \n     necessary to mitigate the impacts--such as drilling deep \n     wells or upgrading irrigation and distribution systems.\n       Impacts on the production of crops also may affect the \n     market prices for those corps, which will affect farmers in \n     different ways. For example, Washington produces half of the \n     U.S. apple crop and a significant reduction in harvest may \n     increase the price for those farmers who remain in business. \n     Therefore, some farmers may suffer while others who have \n     water may actually see improved revenue.\n       The extraordinary rise in energy costs exacerbates the \n     problem for farmers. Farmers rely on diesel fuel for their \n     equipment. Current diesel prices are up 20 percent to 30 \n     percent over last year's levels. The cost of electricity to \n     run pumps is expected to rise as much as 150 percent. The \n     price of natural gas, which is used to make fertilizer, has \n     risen sharply. Most of the irrigated crops are either stored \n     in controlled atmosphere warehouses or processed (canned, \n     dried, frozen, etc.) Cold storage and processing require \n     large amounts of energy (especially electricity and natural \n     gas) and water. If these costs force closure of the \n     processing plants, farmers may have no place to sell their \n     products.\n       Increased risk of disease, insects, noxious weeds, erosion, \n     and fire resulting from abandoned fields, are also concerns. \n     Without maintenance of the fields or removal of abandoned \n     orchards, the risk of damage to adjoining fields is \n     significant. The Washington State Department of Agriculture \n     (WSDA) has requested funds to assist local Weed Boards to \n     deal with these problems, while state and federal fire \n     officials are preparing for a potentially record year for \n     forest and range fires.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. It reads in part:\n\n       The current drought, unlike other recent droughts, is \n     occurring at a time when farmers are facing many other \n     serious challenges. Many smaller farms are likely to face \n     bankruptcy or leave farming altogether. The weak condition of \n     many segments of the agriculture industry in the state makes \n     the industry more vulnerable to the effects of drought. Most \n     farmers are in their third year of net losses due to poor \n     market conditions. Many farmers lack the credit to survive \n     another year without a harvest or make the investments \n     necessary to mitigate these impacts--such as drilling deep \n     wells or upgrading irrigation and distribution systems.\n\n  From Ritzville to Yakima, from Chelan to Wenatchee, the family farms \nin my State are hurting. Just this past week I met with farmers from \nRitzville; they are wheat farmers. Wheat farmers are seeing a 14-year \nlow in wheat prices. They made it clear they need help and they need \nhelp now.\n  Part of our discussion is what is the sentiment for support of the \nfamily farms across our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from a \nlocal Walla Walla newspaper about the impacts.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Poll: Voters Support Farm and Ranch Conservation Efforts\n\n       Walla Walla.--America's farms and ranches are important to \n     the nation's voters, and not just for their locally grown \n     food.\n       A new poll released today shows that voters value farms and \n     ranches for the conservation benefits they provide, such as \n     cleaner air and water and wildlife habitat. And not only do \n     voters want the federal government to support programs that \n     secure those values, by linking conservation practices with \n     farm payments, but voters are willing to pay to ensure \n     conservation benefits from farms and ranches.\n       A poll, a telephone survey of 1,024 registered voters \n     nationwide, uncovered strong support for American \n     agriculture, with 81 percent of voters saying they want their \n     food to come from within the United States.\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\n       Americans professed a close connection to farmers and \n     ranchers, with 70 percent reporting that they have bought \n     something directly from a farmer during the last year, such \n     as at a farm stand or a farmers' market. Voter concern about \n     farm environmental issues registers almost as high as for \n     current ``hot'' political issues.\n       For example, 71 percent are concerned about pesticide \n     residues on food and 69 percent of American voters say they \n     are concerned about loss of farmland to development, compared \n     with more than 80 percent of voters concerned about public \n     education and gas prices.\n       Seventy-eight percent of the American electorate report \n     they are aware of government income support programs for \n     farmers. Voters strongly approve of these programs when they \n     are used to correct low market prices or in cases of drought \n     or flood damage.\n       The addition of conservation conditions to farm supports, \n     however, received overwhelming approval, as 75 percent of \n     American voters feel income support to the American farmer \n     should come with the stipulation that farmers are required to \n     apply ``one or more conservation practices,'' such as \n     protecting wetlands or preventing water pollution.\n       ``We were struck by how many voters make the link between \n     agriculture and conservation benefits,'' said Ralph Grossi, \n     president of American Farmland Trust. ``The public \n     feels strongly about all the values they see in American \n     agriculture; not only do they appreciate America's bounty \n     on their tables, they also realize farms and ranches \n     provide environmental benefits and they are willing to \n     share the cost.''\n       Several programs exist to support conservation on farms and \n     ranches, among them the Farmland Protection Program, \n     Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Wetlands \n     Reserve Program.\n       For each of these programs, demand has far outstripped \n     federal funding in 2001. For WRP alone, unmet requests from \n     farmers totaled $568 million. This year FPP was only \n     allocated $17.5 million in funding--leaving a gap of $90 \n     million and hundreds of farmers waiting in line to protect \n     their land.\n       ``As expected, when we asked voters about how they wanted \n     to increase federal spending, they placed a high priority on \n     addressing pressing needs like finding cures for cancer, \n     educating our children and ensuring adequate energy \n     supplies,'' said Grossi. ``What we did not expect was the \n     finding that a majority of voters--53 percent--feel \n     increasing funds to keep productive farmland from being \n     developed should be a national priority.''\n       And voters are willing to spend their own money to help \n     farmers protect the environment. When asked whether they \n     would like to get all or some of possible $100 tax refund, 63 \n     percent said they'd forego some of that money to protect \n     waterways, wetlands or wildlife habitat.\n       ``With such strong support for agricultural conservation, \n     policymakers should triple conservation spending in the next \n     farm bill,'' Grossi pointed out. ``The programs are there, \n     and they work. With $21 billion allocated annually to farm \n     support payments by the budget agreement, half should be \n     reserved for conservation programs. It's just a question of \n     putting some financial muscle into making conservation \n     happen.''\n       ``Over the past 19 year I have repeatedly surveyed farmers \n     and found them very willing to conserve natural resources. \n     These new results strongly indicate that conservation-\n     oriented farm programs will please not just farmers, but most \n     voters,'' said Dr. J. Dixon Esseks, a political scientist \n     from Northern Illinois University who directed the poll.\n       The telephone survey of 1,024 registered voters nationwide \n     was conducted June 2-21, 2001, with a margin of sampling \n     error of +3.1 percent in 95 out of 100 cases.\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. This article discusses what Americans really want to do \nto help family farmers. Actually, a poll was taken to understand \nAmerican support for what we might do in the Senate. It said that 78 \npercent of the American electorate report that they are aware of \ngovernment income support programs for farmers, and voters strongly \napprove of these programs when they are used in a fashion to correct \nlow market prices or in case of drought or flood damage. We should be \nsecure in knowing that our constituents want to help family farms.\n  The family farms in my State are on the brink. They are on the brink \nbecause our Governor has declared a drought in Washington State. The \ndrought, along with an energy crisis, is having a catastrophic effect \non agriculture. In many cases water is not available for irrigation; \nthe farmers have been unable to get the irrigated water supply they \nneed. Right in the middle of this trouble, a severe storm occurred and \ngreatly impacted the fruit tree industry in the State, ruining various \norchards throughout the central part of Washington.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article from the \nYakima Herald that reads in part:\n\n       Silent and unyielding, drought stalks Central Washington. . \n     . . Crops are wilting, jobs are evaporating, income needed to \n     sustain family farms and rural communities is vanishing, \n     stolen away by this drought like a thief in the night.\n\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Yakima Herald-Republic, July 29, 2001]\n\n                             Dry, Dry Again\n\n                           (By David Lester)\n\n       Silent and unyielding, drought stalks Central Washington \n     during this unsettling summer of 2001. Crops are wilting, \n     jobs are evaporating and income needed to sustain farm \n     families and rural communities is vanishing, stolen away by \n     this drought like a thief in the night.\n       The drought could mean staggering losses, estimated in one \n     analysis at more than $270 million in reduced income for \n     farmers, lost jobs and less money circulating through the \n     local economy.\n       Some of those effects already are being felt. Farm \n     employment is down. Farm service businesses are reporting \n     steep declines in sales and have laid off workers to \n     compensate.\n       Land has been idled in some parts of the Yakima Valley \n     because there isn't enough water to go around, or the water \n     has been transferred to another district suffering a worse \n     shortage. The Roza Irrigation District, among the most \n     severely affected, has drained its reserves of $2 million to \n     buy precious water.\n       And like victims of theft, area residents are sensing a \n     loss of confidence and an eroding optimism about the future.\n       They also are grieving.\n       Carelessness may have lit the match, but drought fueled the \n     fire that took the lives of four young area firefighters July \n     10 in a tinder-dry and remote part of the Okanogan few people \n     had ever heard of.\n       The entire Northwest has many weeks yet during which it \n     must deal with the threat of raging forest fires, much as \n     during the Chelan-area Tyee Creek and the Lakebeds complex \n     fires in Klickitat County in 1994.\n       ``Locally in Central and Eastern Washington, we have the \n     potential to have fires like the ones in Montana last \n     summer,'' said Mick Mueller, an ecologist for the U.S. Forest \n     Service's Leaveworth Ranger District.\n       Wildfire blackened more than 600,000 acres in Montana and a \n     similar amount in Idaho last year. It was the worst wildlife \n     season in the West in 50 years.\n\n\n                        preparing for the worst\n\n       When Gov. Gary Locke declared a drought emergency March 14, \n     the outlook statewide was bleak for municipal water supplies, \n     irrigation, migratory fish and power production. But spring \n     rains eased drought worries in Western Washington and the \n     dryland wheat country in the far eastern part of the state.\n       Doug McChesney, state Ecology Department coordinator for \n     drought response, said the Yakima Basin continues to suffer \n     because of its reliance on a limited water-storage system \n     that places a premium on a healthy snowpack every year. Also, \n     a greater percentage of Central Washington farmland relies on \n     junior water rights than the rest of the state.\n       When the snowpack doesn't come during the winter, the basin \n     suffers, as it has this year.\n       The numbers tell the story: As of June 1, the amount of \n     water in the snow was just 22 percent of average. All snow \n     was gone by July 1. The total amount of water produced in the \n     watershed through July was just 46 percent of average and the \n     second-lowest in 75 years, second only to 1977. Reservoir \n     storage on July 1 was just 66 percent of average, the second-\n     lowest in 60 years.\n       ``The west side of the state is clearly better off. It's \n     the band down the middle of the state from the Cascade crest \n     to the east where the worst of the problems are,'' McChesney \n     said.\n       When higher energy costs, higher fertilizer costs and three \n     years of poor marketing conditions for apples and other crops \n     are added in, Central Washington farmers are carrying most of \n     the burden for the rest of the state.\n       ``They are getting clobbered. There is no doubt about \n     that,'' McChesney added.\n       The region went through a nearly identical drought in 1994, \n     but as McChesney suggested, this year's record drought \n     couldn't have come at a worse time.\n\n\n                           search for storage\n\n       Already reeling from several years of poor market prices, \n     the 2001 drought is staggering the area with another body \n     blow.\n       ``Farmers are survivors, but they are being pushed about as \n     far as they can be pushed,'' observed Tom Carpenter, a \n     longtime Granger farmer on the Roza Irrigation District.\n       Carpenter and other basin farmers are once again pushing \n     for new water storage to insulate the basin from drought. The \n     five Cascade lakes in the Yakima Irrigation Project can store \n     less than half the water used in the basin each year.\n       No new storage has been constructed since 1933. In the \n     intervening years, the basin went through a natural maturing \n     process with the planting of more perennial crops like apples \n     and other tree fruits, mint, grapes, and hops that must have \n     water every year to survive. Also, a relatively new demand \n     for water to protect threatened fish is taxing the system \n     further.\n       Carpenter, a diversified grower and an active player in \n     basin water issues for many\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\n     years, said the people who built the basin found ways to get \n     things done.\n       ``I wonder what's wrong with us. Why don't we have the \n     vision to do what we need to do and take care of everyone's \n     interests?'' he asked. ``We are just fighting over the \n     crumbs.''\n       The impacts aren't being felt solely on the 72,000-acre \n     Roza or the 59,000-acre Kittitas Reclamation District, where \n     farmers are receiving barely a third of a normal water \n     supply.\n       They are at the end of the line in a water-rights system \n     that favors those who were here first. The first homesteaders \n     have what are called senior water rights. Their rights are \n     satisfied first when there isn't enough to go around. Later \n     arrivals, known as juniors, share what's left.\n       It is a system that has led to the most restrictive \n     rationing in the Yakima Irrigation Project's 96-year history. \n     In 1994, junior users were limited to 38 percent of a full \n     supply.\n       But because the large irrigation divisions in the 464,000-\n     acre project have a combination of senioor and junior rights, \n     farmers in other parts of the basin, like the sprawling \n     Wapato Irrigation Project, are struggling with too little \n     water to have a successful harvest.\n\n\n                         Adding Up the Dollars\n\n       A 4-year-old economic-impact analysis prepared by Northwest \n     Economic Associates of Vancouver, Wash., an agriculture and \n     natural resources economics consulting firm, suggests a water \n     shortage like 2001 would cut farm income in the Yakima River \n     Basin by $136 milllion, or 13 percent of the total in an \n     average year.\n       When the effect of smaller crops on processors, farm \n     suppliers, trucking and retail are included, the figure \n     balloons to more than a quarter of a billion dollars.\n       The firm prepared the report for the Tri-County Water \n     Resource Agency, a Yakima-based consortium of counties, \n     cities and irrigation districts working to meet all water \n     needs in the three-county basin.\n       William Dillingham, a senior economist for the state \n     Employment Security Department, said the agency is trying to \n     track the effects of a historic water shortage on employment \n     in Central Washington counties.\n       ``Yakima County has a huge amount of its employment \n     associated with agriculture. When you tie in food processing, \n     transportation and ag services, that number begins to get \n     pretty big, pretty quickly,'' he said.\n       State officials have taken a stab at just how big. Using \n     the Northwest Economic Associates study as a basis for their \n     estimate, four state agencies in late June projected the 2001 \n     drought could cut statewide farm production by up to $400 \n     million, or about 12.5 percent of total farm production. In \n     addition, up to 7,500 farm jobs would be lost, as would up to \n     1,400 jobs in the farm-related processing, trucking, \n     wholesaling and warehousing industries.\n       The projection recognizes the local losses would not be \n     mirrored statewide because other parts of the state have \n     near-normal water supplies and would have average crop \n     production.\n       In the midst of all this, Central Yakima Valley fruit \n     growers suffered millions of dollars in crop damage from a \n     freak and powerful wind-and-hail storm in late June, with \n     gusts clocked at 108 mph in one Zillah orchard.\n       Looking at the growing tale of woe, a state official asked \n     privately: ``What's next, a plague of locusts?''\n\n\n                        Fish are Suffering, Too\n\n       River flows depleted to record lows in some places because \n     of too little winter snow are threatening the Northwest's \n     multimillion-dollar investment in savings its declining \n     salmon and steelhead runs. More water is being used to turn \n     Columbia River power turbines to generate needed power, \n     exposing more fish to a near-certain death.\n       The Yakima Valley's celebration of a huge returning run of \n     adult spring chinook this year, the largest in at least 50 \n     years, is tempered by the prospect that some of these fish \n     won't spawn successfully in low September river flows.\n       Also, young chinook salmon and threatened steelhead trout \n     starting their dangerous journey to the Pacific Ocean are \n     being subjected to higher water temperatures and more \n     predators as the Lower Yakima River, southeast of Prosser, \n     rides along slightly above minimum streamflows.\n       Higher fish losses this year would mean a smaller run of \n     adults in two to three years. Dwindling numbers could turn up \n     the pressure for more fish protective measures.\n       ``Rising water temperatures may not kill fish by itself, \n     but predators are more active eaters when temperatures are \n     higher,'' said Dale Bambrick of Ellensburg, the Eastern \n     Washington habitat team leader for the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service. ``It's a double whammy. The salmon and \n     steelhead critters aren't functioning well.''\n\n\n                        Drought Effect Reach Far\n\n       The struggle on the farm is being felt in town, too.\n       City residents in parts of Yakima and Kennewick are being \n     required to rotate water use to make an inadequate supply \n     stretch.\n       Workers in industries that supply farmers and process the \n     commodities they produce are being laid off because there is \n     too little work.\n       Duane Huppert, who has owned Huppert Farm and Lawn Center \n     in Ellensburg for 17 years, said he canceled a farm implement \n     order this spring when the initial water forecast came out in \n     March.\n       ``When that came out, it was like turning off the business \n     as far as ag sales are concerned,'' Huppert said. ``It really \n     stops any farmer from buying anything when you look at a year \n     like this.''\n       ``As a farm equipment dealer, our sales were cut \n     drastically,'' he added.\n       Huppert, who sells John Deere products, said he is \n     concerned about the lingering effects of this drought into \n     next year and beyond.\n       ``This community is an ag community whether people like it \n     or not,'' he said, ``We get a lot of income from farmers, and \n     the money they spend goes through a lot of businesses.''\n       In the heart of the Yakima Valley in Sunnyside, Bleyhl Farm \n     Service, a supplier of feed, fuel, fertilizer and equipment \n     to farmers, also is feeling the pinch.\n       Verle Kirk, the firm's Sunnyside store division manager, \n     said the firm cut its work force in Sunnyside by about 14 \n     percent to some 70 employees in response to a cut in sales.\n       Sales of irrigation equipment dropped when the Roza shut \n     down for three weeks in May to stretch its water supply. \n     Sales have not recovered, Kirk said.\n       Farmers are also buying less nitrogen fertilizer because of \n     higher costs for natural gas used to produce it. Corn seed \n     isn't moving because the crop requires more water.\n       ``It seems like these guys are shopping harder. \n     Profitability hasn't been good the last two years,'' he said. \n     ``It hasn't been good this year. If they don't make money, it \n     won't get any better next year.''\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, the article goes on to state that the \ndrought could mean staggering losses of more than $270 million in \nreduced income from farmers, lost jobs, and less money circulating \nthrough our local economy.\n  The most critical stories are emerging from my State, including those \nof the apple industry. An agricultural assistance bill such as the one \nwe passed that does not support apple growers fails to understand a \nvery important part of our agricultural sector. You heard from many of \nmy colleagues from New York, Michigan, and Maine about the fact that we \nneed to do something to help America's apple growers who are \nexperiencing the worst economic losses in more than 70 years.\n  Currently prices are as low as 40 percent below the cost of \nproduction. Between 1995 and 1998, apple growers lost approximately \n$760 million due to questionable import practices involving such \ncountries as China and Korea, in addition to the stiff export tariffs.\n  Growers like to be self-sufficient and would not ask for help if it \ndid not mean their survival. Many growers in financial crisis are being \npushed off their farms. One study has estimated that the numbers of \nthose leaving their farms could be as high as 30 percent.\n  We need to stop this exodus from the family farms by providing \nfarmers this year with the support and money they desperately need. The \nHarkin bill would have done that. Instead, as the Senator from Iowa \nstated earlier, with a gun to our head and without the recourse of \ngetting cooperation and support from the President or from our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, we passed an Ag supplemental \nbill that will mean hundreds of millions fewer dollars to the State of \nWashington and to family farmers. We need to do better.\n  Many of my colleagues have talked about the shortcomings of this \nlegislation. So as we prepare for adjournment, as wheat farmers begin \ntheir harvest, as apple growers deal with drought and suffer from storm \nloss, as communities throughout Washington State and the country deal \nwith the economic impacts being felt by the agricultural industry, I \nhope my colleagues will think hard about these issues and return in \nSeptember to do more for family farmers and to show our appreciation \nfor that industry.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Washington has \nexpired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8881-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8881-S8882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      FAMILY FARMS NEED ASSISTANCE\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before leaving for the recess, I, too, \nwanted to address a couple of points on my mind and I am sure on the \nminds of the people of Louisiana. We have enjoyed, as a State, some \nsuccess this session on many different issues. Of course, some of them \nare not resolved.\n  Senator Breaux and I have been very involved with the issue of \neducation and health care. As we wind down this particular part of our \nsession, I wish to speak for a moment on the area of agriculture.\n  The Senator from Washington just spoke. She says she is leaving town \nwith some disappointment. I add my voice to say I, too, am disappointed \nin the outcome of our Agriculture supplemental appropriations bill. We \nseem to have room in the budget for many other items, but sometimes \nwhen it comes to our farmers and agriculture, they are cut short or \ndraw the short straw.\n  That is very unfortunate because, according to the budget outline, \nthere was money available to allocate in an emergency and supplemental \nway to meet the needs of farmers, not only in Louisiana and throughout \nthe South but, as the Senator from Washington said, the farmers and \nagricultural interests in her State and throughout the Nation.\n  The House adjourned, setting the floor quite low at $5.5 billion. The \nSenate, in a bipartisan fashion and with bipartisan support, went on \nrecord as supporting a higher number of $7.5 billion. When $2 billion \nis cut out, a lot of farmers in Louisiana are shortchanged.\n  Our AMTA payments were reduced substantially. The conservation \nprograms, so important to farmers in Louisiana because of our \ntremendous wetlands conservation efforts, are shortchanged.\n  The public/private partnerships that farmers and landowners can enter \ninto with the Government to reduce production and help keep prices \nhigh, was curtailed because of our lack of commitment to this funding \nlevel. In addition, because of the unfortunate timing, we are not going \nto be able to come back in the fall and recoup the lost ground because \nwe will be past the September deadline.\n  I have here an interesting letter from the American Soybean \nAssociation, National Corn Growers, National Association of Wheat \nGrowers, and, of course, the National Cotton Council.\n  This letter says: We would rather have $5.5 billion than nothing, and \nso would I. But they should not have had to settle for the $5.5 billion \nwhen even settling for $7.5 billion is not enough to meet the needs and \nthe emergencies being experienced by farmers everywhere who are, \nfrankly, entitled to more.\n  I most certainly do not blame these associations for saying, listen, \nwe are between a rock and a hard place. They are saying, ``The House \nhas adjourned. It has approved $5.5 billion. We would just as soon take \nthat.'' I know if they could stand here and speak their minds, and \nspeak the truth, they would say $5.5 billion is not enough. It is going \nto leave a lot of our farmers with higher debts and impact a lot of our \nrural communities across the Nation.\n  In Louisiana, we have experienced some of the lowest prices in \ndecades, and a severe drought. This drought has brought about an \nintrusion of saltwater into many of our marshes and farmland, creating \nadditional problems. It is a very difficult time in agriculture.\n  I did not want to leave without saying I am extremely disappointed we \nwere not able to get the level of AMTA payments higher. It is very \nimportant to our farmers and our conservation programs. I think we will \nend up paying a higher price in the months and years to come.\n  In addition, it is of particular disappointment we do not have \nincluded in this particular package our voluntary State-supported, \nState-recommended, and State-endorsed dairy compacts. Compacts are \nimportant to dairy farmers all over this Nation and come at no cost to \nthe taxpayer.\n  We are arguing about an agricultural funding bill because the two \nHouses cannot decide whether $5.5 billion is the right amount or $6.5 \nbillion or $7.5 billion. I know money does not grow on trees, and we do \nnot want to overspend.\n  We want to live within budgetary constraints, but what puzzles me so \nmuch about this debate is the dairy compact does not cost the taxpayers \na penny. We could have added it and not added one penny to the \nAgriculture supplemental appropriations bill because dairy compacts do \nnot cost the taxpayers any money. They are a voluntary, State-run, \nState-supported and allow dairy farmers, along with consumers and the \nretail representatives, to set a price for fluid milk so we can make \nsure everyone in our districts and our regions have a fresh, steady \nsupply of milk.\n  It is a system whereby if prices go up, the producers pay out of \ntheir profits; if the prices go down, the farmers are paid out of the \nprofits to retailers and others, therefore, leveling the price and \nallowing the farmers to make plans for their growth and production of \ndairy products.\n  It has been proven very successful in the Northeast. The Senators \nfrom Vermont have been two of the lead sponsors and advocates. New York \nhas petitioned to join, Pennsylvania has petitioned to join, and the \nSouthern delegates and the Southern Senators want the South to have the \nsame right to organize into compacts and help our farmers.\n  In Louisiana, we have lost 204 dairy farms since 1995. We have only \n468 remaining. If we do not answer in some way to the dairy farms, I am \ngoing to be back in 3 years saying: We had 468, now we are down to 250, \nand 3 years from now we will be down to 150. Before you know it, we \nwill be in a position where we are importing all of our milk from other \nparts of the Nation. We will be paying higher prices, because there \nwill be less competition and less of a competitive organization of \ndairy farmers.\n  Had Louisiana been a member of the Southern Dairy Compact last year, \nour 468 dairy farms would have received almost $12 million in compact \npayments. That is not a huge amount of money by Washington standards. \nIt is not in the billions, but I can tell my colleagues, $12 million \nmeans a lot to the people of Louisiana and to these farmers who are \nscratching out a living, trying to operate their enterprises at a \nprofit. It not only means a lot to the farmers and their families, but \nto the communities in which they buy supplies, pay taxes that provide \nfor vital community services.\n  When a dairy farmer goes out of business, it does not just collapse \nthat particular dairy farm and bring harm to that particular family, it \naffects the whole rural economy of many of our States.\n  Northeast Dairy compact States show the compact had a steadying \ninfluence on the support of farms. Without exception, we know, based on \nthe facts and the figures, that the Northeast experiment has been very \npositive.\n  When we come back in the fall, I am not sure what we can do to \nrestore the level of funding. As I said, this was an opportunity lost. \nWe now have to operate under new budget constraints. I am not sure how \nwe are going to fill in the gaps, but because the dairy compact does \nnot cost additional funding, I am hopeful. I look forward to joining \nwith my colleagues in building a bipartisan support for State-run, \nState-supported voluntary dairy compacts that do not cost the taxpayer \na dime but help keep a steady, reliable source of fluid milk coming to \nour consumers and to consumers in every region of this Nation. I am \nhopeful that when we get back, we will have success.\n  We have a farm bill to debate. There are many changes that our \nfarmers are going to need so that we can compete more effectively. We \nneed to open up trade opportunities, more risk management tools, and \nthe dairy compact that can help our farmers help themselves and not \njust rely on a Government handout. That is all they ask. They just want \nto be met halfway. We can most certainly do a better job.\n  I am going to fight as hard as I can for the Southern region of this \nNation that, in my opinion, has historically been shortchanged when it \ncomes to agriculture. I am going to join with Senators from New York, \nNew Jersey, and Washington, and other States which have, in some way, \nalso been shortchanged because of the lack of emphasis on speciality \ncrops. Although I do not represent New Jersey, New\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\nYork, or Washington, I think it is important for us to make sure the \nagriculture bill is fair and equitable to every region of this Nation.\n  The South has been shortchanged time and again. We are going to join \na coalition to make sure our farmers get their fair share and that we \nare providing the taxpayers a good return on the money that is \ninvested. We need to create ways to help farmers minimize the cost to \nthe taxpayers and maximize the total benefit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8882-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION REFORM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I will take 2 more minutes, if I can, to \nsay a word about the election reform measure that Senator Dodd spoke \nabout just a few minutes ago.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of that election reform measure. I thank \nthe Senator from Connecticut for leading this effort, for being such a \nterrific and articulate spokesperson for improving our election system \nin this Nation.\n  It truly is a travesty and really a hypocrisy for us to encourage \npeople to register to vote, urge them to exercise their full rights as \ncitizens, and then not count their votes, or turn them away at the \npolls.\n  In the year 2001, that should not be the case. That should not be the \ncase at any time. Unfortunately, there have been dark places in our \nhistory where people by the millions were turned away or were not \nallowed to register. Our country has made great progress.\n  As the last election showed, and as we need to discuss when we come \nback, we have a lot of fixing to do. There are improvements that need \nto be made. We need to proudly stand up to the world and say: Yes, we \nwant our citizens registered, and if they are a legal voter, whether \nthey are in a wheelchair, visually impaired, or have other physical \nchallenges, despite the fact they may be older or not as strong and as \nable, they have a right to vote and they have a right to have their \nvote counted, and they have a right to the kind of equipment and \ntechnology that is available that makes sure those votes are counted \nand certified.\n  In conclusion, no system is going to be perfect, but the evidence is \nin to suggest that the system we have in the United States can and \nshould be perfected. I am proud that in Louisiana we do have \nstandardized voting machines, and we have worked very hard on opening \naccess to those polling places.\n  Even in Louisiana, where we do have standardized voting machines, and \nstate-of-the-art technology in poor and wealthy districts, rural and \nurban districts, we can make improvements there.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important \nsubject when we return.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Will the Senator withhold her \nrequest for a quorum call?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I will try to be brief because I am \nsure there are many who would like to start the recess.\n  Madam President, I call your attention and that of my colleagues to \nthe activity in the U.S. House of Representatives which occurred the \nday before yesterday, rather late at night. This involved the reporting \nout of an energy bill, a very comprehensive bill. As a consequence, the \nbaton now passes to the Senate. There is going to be a great deal of \ndebate in the committee, on which I am the ranking member, along with \nother members of that committee, including the Senator from Louisiana \nwho just addressed this body. As a consequence of that debate and the \ndevelopment of our own energy bill at this time, I will highlight one \nof the topical points in that bill that affects my State of Alaska. \nThat is the issue of ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n\n  The action by the House is very responsible. It puts the issue in \nperspective. The issue has been that somehow this huge area called \nANWR, an area of 19 million acres, an area that is approximately the \nsize of the State of South Carolina, is at risk by any action by the \nCongress to initiate authorization for exploration.\n  What the House has done is extraordinary, mandating a limitation of \n2,000 acres to be the footprint associated with any development that \nmight occur in that area. It takes the whole issue and puts it in \nperspective that, indeed, This is not more than four or five small \nfarms, assuming the rest of the area of the State of South Carolina \nwere a wilderness. That is the perspective.\n  For those who argue ANWR is at risk, the House action has clearly \nidentified the footprint will be 2,000 acres. What will that do to \nAmerica's technology, to America's ingenuity? It will challenge it. It \nwill say, we must develop this field, if indeed the oil is there, with \nthis kind of footprint.\n  This technology has been developed in this country. The exploration \nphase is three-dimensional. It suggests that you can drill under the \nU.S. Capitol and come out at gate 8 at Reagan Airport. That is the \ntechnology. This gives side views of what lies under the ground and the \nprospects for oil and gas. It mandates the best technology. It mandates \nwe must develop this technology, and as a consequence puts a challenge \nto the environmental community, the engineering community, and our \nNation. That challenge will help make this the best oilfield in the \nworld, bar none.\n  What else does it have? It has a project labor agreement. That means \nthere will be a contractual commitment between the unions, the \nTeamsters, and the AFL-CIO, and it will create thousands of jobs in \nthis country. These are American jobs.\n  I urge Members to consider for a moment that over half of our deficit \nbalance of payments is the cost of imported oil. Once the Congress \nspeaks on this issue, there will be a reaction from OPEC. That reaction \nwill be very interesting. OPEC is going to increase its supply and the \nprice of oil is going to be reduced in this country. There is no \nquestion about it. If OPEC knows we mean business about reducing our \ndependence on imported oil, they will clearly get the signal.\n  Furthermore, it is rather interesting what the House did with the \ndisposition of royalties. The anticipated revenue from lease sales for \nthe Federal land in this area is somewhere in the area of $1.5 to $2 \nbillion. That money is not just beginning to go in the Federal \nTreasury; it will go into the development of alternative and renewable \nsources of energy. So we have the funds to develop the new \ntechnologies.\n  One of the misconceptions in this country that covers energy is that \nit is all the same. It isn't. We generate electricity from coal. The \nState of West Virginia is a major supplier of coal. Nearly 51 percent \nof the energy produced in this country comes from coal. We also have \nthe capability to produce from nuclear. About 22 percent of our energy \ncomes from nuclear. We also use a large amount of natural gas, but our \nnatural gas reserves are going down faster than we are finding new \nones.\n  We have hydro; we have wind; we have solar. These are all important \nin the mix. The funds from the sale or lease in ANWR are going to go \nback and develop renewable sources of energy.\n\n  The point I make is why these energies are important. America moves \non oil. The world moves on oil. There is no alternative. We must find \nan alternative, perhaps fuel sales, perhaps hydrogen technology, but it \nis not there. We will be increasingly dependent on sources from \noverseas.\n  I know the President pro tempore remembers the issue of the U2 over \nRussia, Gary Powers, an American pilot in an observation plane that was \nshot down. At that time, we were contemplating a major meeting of the \nworld leaders to try and relieve tensions. When his plane was shot \ndown, tensions were increased dramatically between the Soviet Union and \nthe United States. It was a time of great tension.\n  The other day we had a U2 flying over Iraq with an American pilot. We \nwere enforcing a no-fly zone. We were doing an observation. A missile \nwas shot at that aircraft, barely missing it. It blew up behind the \ntail. It hardly made page 5 in the news.\n  We are importing a million barrels a day from Iraq. We are enforcing \na no-fly zone over Iraq. We have flown 231,000 individual sorties, with \nmen and\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nwomen flying our aircraft, enforcing this no-fly zone, ensuring his \ntargets are not fully developed. Occasionally we bomb and take out \ntargets.\n  How ironic; here we are, importing a million barrels a day, enforcing \na no-fly zone, taking on his targets, but we are taking this oil and \nputting it in our aircraft to do it. I don't know about our foreign \npolicy.\n  What does he do with the money he receives from us? His Republican \nGuards keep Saddam Hussein alive. He develops a missile delivery \ncapability. He puts on a biological warhead, perhaps. Where is it \naimed? At our ally, Israel. Virtually every speech Saddam Hussein gives \nis concluded with ``death to Israel.''\n  Where does this fit in the big picture? Six weeks ago we imported \n750,000 barrels a day from Iraq. I find it frustrating. We had another \nlittle experience about 3\\1/2\\ weeks ago. Saddam Hussein was not \nsatisfied with the sanctions being levied by the U.N. He said: I will \ncut my oil production 2.5 million for 30 days. That is 60 million \nbarrels. We all thought OPEC would stand up and increase production. \nThey didn't. They have a cartel. We can't have cartels in this country. \nWe have antitrust laws against them.\n  My point is quite evident. OPEC, the Mideast nations, are trying to \nstick together, hold up the price, because they are increasing their \nleverage on the United States. What does that do to the national \nsecurity of this country? It is quite obvious to me.\n  There is another argument that was used. We heard it on the House \nfloor: Ban the export of any Alaskan oil that might come from ANWR. \nFine, I will support that.\n  One of the amusing observations I made the other day is that one of \nthe Members of the House got up and said we have to oppose opening this \nbecause all the oil is going to Japan. That is nonsense. So it is \nprohibited in the authorization. The last oil that was exported outside \nthe United States from Alaska occurred a year ago last April, a very \nsmall amount that was surplus. But it is not surplus anymore because \nCalifornia is now importing a great deal of foreign oil because they \nhave increased their utilization while Alaska has declined in its \nproduction.\n  If you go through the arguments that will be before this body on the \nANWR issue, please think about the action of the House, the responsible \naction of the House. No longer is 19 million acres at risk, an area the \nsize of the State of South Carolina; 2,000 acres is at risk. Is that a \nreasonable compromise to address our energy security? Certainly. It \nmandates the best use and the highest use of particular knowledge. It \nhas a project labor agreement in it. The unions think very highly of \nthis because it has become a jobs issue.\n  We have an obligation to do what is right for America. We know our \nenvironmental friends have taken a stand on this, but most of their \narguments are gone. Can you open it safely? Surely; and the Federal \nroyalties are going to go back for conservation and renewables and R \nWe are going to put a ban on exports, resolving that issue.\n  ANWR has been the focal point of a lot of misinformation by \nenvironmental extremists. They have tried to hold it hostage for their \nown publicity, membership, and dollars, and they have been quite \neffective. But the House vote proves that when we really look beyond \nthe rhetoric, we can safely explore the resources in ANWR.\n  I applaud the House leadership for crafting a compromise, a balanced \nbill, one that I think every Member should seriously consider.\n  After the recess, I am going to be discussing this issue at some \nlength. I hope my colleagues will join me. We have heard from a few who \nsay, we are going to filibuster this. You are going to filibuster an \nenergy bill? Is that what you really want to do? Are you going to \nfilibuster and in effect cause us to increase our dependence on \nimported oil? Filibuster a bill that will provide more American jobs \nfor American labor? I welcome that debate.\n  It is amusing, and I am going to conclude on this note because I see \nthe President pro tempore patiently waiting, how things change in our \nmedia as they are exposed to the pressures from special interest \ngroups. I am going to quote from the Chattanooga Free Press, June 3 of \nthis year, an article done by Reed Irvine. He cites the issue of the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge, the issue of arsenic in the drinking \nwater, the idea of trying to bring things into balance. He specifically \ntakes on two of the major newspapers in this country, the Washington \nPost and the New York Times, by reminding us of their gross \ninconsistency. He states:\n\n       In 1987, a Washington Post editorial describing ANWR as one \n     of the ``bleakest, most remote places on the continent'' \n     said, ``(T)here is hardly any other place where drilling \n     would have less impact on surrounding life . . . Congress \n     would be right to go ahead and, with all the conditions \n     and environmental precautions that apply in Prudhoe Bay, \n     see what's under the refuge's tundra.''\n       In 1988, a New York Times editorial said of the area, \n     ``(T)he potential is enormous and the environmental risks are \n     modest . . . the likely value of the oil far exceeds \n     plausible estimates of the environmental cost.'' It \n     concluded, ``(I)t is hard to see why absolutely pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     over the nation's energy needs.''\n\n  That was in 1988. We are importing right now close to 60 percent of \nthe oil we consume. The article goes on to say:\n\n       Since then our energy needs have become more pressing, but \n     with new editorial page editors, both these papers are now \n     singing a different tune about the ANWR. At the Times, \n     editorial-page editor Howell Raines has dumbed-down the \n     paper's editorial pages and op-ed pages. A good example is an \n     editorial on drilling for oil in ANWR published last March. \n     It said, ``This page has addressed the folly of trespassing \n     on a wondrous, wildlife preserve for what, by official \n     estimates, is likely to be a modest amount of economically \n     recoverable oil.''\n\n  What the Post had described as ``one of the bleakest, most remote \nplaces on the continent'' had somehow in the flick of a new editorial \neditor been transformed, in 14 years, to some wonderful wildlife \npreserve.\n\n       Having worked that miracle, Raines has been designated as \n     the next executive editor of the paper.\n\n  Over on the other side:\n\n       Fred Hiatt, who succeeded Meg Greenfield as the editorial \n     page editor of the Washington Post, effected a similar \n     transformation. Now a Post editorial describes that formerly \n     remote, bleak wasteland as, ``a unique ecological resource'' \n     and says that exploiting it ``for more oil to feed more of \n     the same old profligate habits would be to take the wrong \n     first step.'' The Post accused [those of us in this body who \n     support this] of ``demagoguery.''\n\n  How clever.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [From the Chattanooga Times/Chattanooga Free Press, June 3, 2001]\n\n                         Shady Environmentalism\n\n                            (By Reed Irvine)\n\n       Environmentalists come in many shades of green, but a lot \n     of them are just plain shady, ignoring science and common \n     sense and jumping on the green bandwagon for partisan \n     political purposes. This is evident in the rush of people to \n     bash the Bush environmental initiatives. All of a sudden, \n     thanks to a last minute move by Bill Clinton, countless \n     Americans began quaking in their boots, having learned from \n     the media that something very few of them had ever heard of \n     before, arsenic in drinking water, might give them cancer.\n       They were not told that this conclusion was based on \n     studies in countries where the level of arsenic in drinking \n     water is as much as 10 times higher that the 50 parts per \n     billion maximum level permitted in the U.S. We have yet to \n     see a study showing that cancers caused by arsenic are more \n     prevalent in communities in this country where arsenic in \n     drinking water is above average than in those communities \n     where it is below average. We have seen a story in the New \n     York Times reporting that arsenic is used at the Sloan \n     Kettering Institute to cure a particularly vicious type of \n     leukemia.\n       Even more than arsenic in drinking water, the proposed \n     drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has \n     been used to bash President bush and Vice President Dick \n     Cheney. Back in the 1980s. two of our most influential \n     newspapers, the Washington Post and the New York Times, \n     favored exploitation of the oil in this remote, inhospitable \n     region of Alaska.\n       In 1987, a Washington Post editorial describing this area \n     as ``one of the bleakest, most remote places on this \n     continent'' said, ``(T)here is hardly any other place where \n     drilling would have less impact on the surrounding life . . . \n     Congress would be right to go ahead and, with all the \n     conditions and environmental precautions that apply to \n     Prudhoe Bay, see what's under the refuge's tundra.''\n       In 1988, a New York times editorial said of this area, \n     ``(T)he potential is enormous and the environmental risks are \n     modest . . . the likely value of the oil far exceeds \n     plausible estimates of the environmental cost.'' It concluded \n     ``(I)t is hard to see why absolutely\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\n     pristine preservation of this remote wilderness should take \n     precedence over the nation's energy needs.''\n       Since then our energy needs have become more pressing, but \n     with new editorial-page editors, both of these papers are now \n     singing a different tune about the ANWR. At the Times, \n     editorial-page editor Howell Raines, has dumbed-down the \n     paper's editorial and op-ed pages. A good example is an \n     editorial on drilling for oil in the ANWR published last \n     March. It said, ``This page has addressed the folly of \n     trespassing on a wondrous wildlife preserve for what, by \n     official estimates, is likely to be a modest amount of \n     economically recoverable oil.'' What the Post had described \n     as ``one of the bleakest, most remote places on this \n     continent,'' had been transformed in 14 years to ``a wondrous \n     wildlife preserve.'' Having worked that miracle, Raines has \n     been designated as the next executive editor of the paper.\n       Fred Hiatt, who succeeded Meg Greenfield as editorial-page \n     editor of the Washington Post, effected a similar \n     transformation. Now a Post editorial describes that formerly \n     remote, bleak wasteland as ``a unique ecological resource'' \n     and says that exploiting it ``for more oil to feed more of \n     the same old profligate habits would be to take the wrong \n     step first.'' The Post accused the Alaska senators who \n     advocate drilling for oil in the ANWR of ``demagoguery.''\n       Sen. Frank Murkowski sent a letter to the Post in which he \n     pointed out that Alaska has 125 million acres of national \n     parks, preserves and wildlife refuges, of which 19 million \n     acres are in the ANWR. Congress set aside 1.5 million ANWR \n     acres for possible oil and gas exploration. The Bush proposal \n     is to permit drilling on about 2,000 acres, about one-\n     hundredth of 1 percent of the entire refuge. Sen. Murkowski \n     concluded, ``I suggest the demagoguery comes when you follow \n     the extreme environmentalist line: 19 million acres for \n     wildlife and pristine conditions and not even 2,000 acres for \n     energy security.'' Energy security is not a minor \n     consideration. The U.S. imported 37 percent of its oil in the \n     1970s and 57 percent today. It is said that ANWR could supply \n     only enough oil to meet our needs for six months. That might \n     be true if ANWR were our only source of oil. The U.S. \n     Geological Survey estimates that there is enough oil there to \n     replace our imports from Saudi Arabia for the next 20 to 30 \n     years. Only a very shady environmentalist would shun that.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My next effort after the recess will be to come back \nand discuss the energy situation. It is not a matter of pointing \nfingers. When we come back, I will say why we are focusing in on oil \nexploration as well. I am going to try to answer the question why is it \nsafer and better to import our oil rather than drilling right here in \nAmerica by providing the facts. We need to know what we have in America \nfirst.\n  I am going to talk about how the experts estimate ANWR might only \ncontain a 6-month supply of oil, which is absolutely ridiculous because \nthat would be true only if we produced no oil nor imported any into the \nUnited States for 6 months. ANWR has the potential of equaling what we \nare currently importing from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year period of time.\n  We are going to answer the question of whether we should focus more \non conservation. I am going to answer that by saying we need a balance.\n  I am going to answer the question of why it takes energy so long to \nturn it around once the shortage begins to become noticed.\n  I am going to talk about why we must act now because we are going to \nbe held responsible if, indeed, we do not act now.\n  Madam President, I thank the President pro tempore for his attention. \nI remind my colleague we have some heavy lifting to do because the \nAmerican people are looking for action.\n  We started in 1992. I was on the committee. Senator Bennett Johnston \nwas chairman of that committee. We put out an energy bill from that \ncommittee. When it came to this floor, we gave away clean coal; we gave \naway nuclear; we gave away hydro; we gave away natural gas; we gave \naway oil; and we concentrated on alternatives and renewables. We \nexpended $6 billion. That was a worthwhile effort. But we didn't \nincrease supply.\n  This is a different year. The ``perfect storm'' has come together. \nOur natural gas prices have quadrupled. We haven't built a new coal-\nfired plant in this Nation since 1995. We haven't done anything with \nnuclear energy in a quarter of a century. We haven't built a new \nrefinery in 25 years. Now we suddenly find that we don't have a \ndistribution system for our electrical generation or our natural gas \ngeneration. We are constrained. It is affecting the economy. It is \naffecting jobs. It is going to get worse. The American people expect us \nto come back and do something about it. They will not stand for \ngrandstanding. They will not stand for the status quo. They will not \nstand for the threat of filibusters.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, what is the time limit for Senators to \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak using \nwhatever time is necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8884-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8884-S8887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND BUDGET SURPLUS REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Commerce Department reported last \nweek, July 27, that the U.S. economy grew at an anemic 0.7 percent rate \nin the second quarter of this year, April 1-June 30. This is the \nslowest growth rate in 8 years, and considerably lower than the 8.3 \npercent growth rate seen just 18 months ago.\n  ``If you applied logic to the [economic] news these days,'' wrote \nAllan Sloan in the Washington Post on Tuesday, July 31, ``the logical \nconclusion would be that the economy has fallen off a cliff and is \nabout to splatter all over the canyon floor and take us with it.''\n  This week, July 30, the Wall Street Journal reported, ``the economy \nhas been pushed to the edge of a recession by a breathtaking decline in \nbusiness investment.'' In the second quarter, nonresidential investment \ntumbled at a 13.6 percent rate. Consumer spending, along with robust \nstate and local government spending, is the only thing that prevented \nthe economy from shrinking over the last three months.\n  In an effort to stem the tide, the Federal Reserve has dramatically \ncut short-term interest rates by almost 3 percentage points over the \nlast 7 months. These are the most aggressive rate reductions since the \n1982 recession under President Reagan.\n  Despite this negative economic news, the Administration remains \nresolutely optimistic about the economy's future, pinning their hopes \non the recently enacted tax cut. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said \nlast week, July 23, that the U.S. economy might grow by more than 3 \npercent next year. The President's chief economic advisor, Larry \nLindsey, in a speech before the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, \nreaffirmed this optimistic outlook.\n  What concerns me is the effect that these tax cuts have had on the \neconomy so far.\n  Despite the Fed's efforts to cut short-term interest rates to \nsimulate the sluggish economy, long-term interest rates have remained \nflat or have even risen since earlier this year. The interest rate on \nthe 10-year bond, for example, increased from 4.75 percent in mid-March \nto just over 5.1 percent today, August 3. Long-term rates have limited \nefforts by the Fed to stimulate the economy.\n  What's keeping those rates from falling is the expectation by Wall \nStreet that the recently enacted tax cut has seriously jeopardized our \ndebt retirement efforts. Fed Chairman Greenspan said last week, July \n24, before the Senate Banking Committee that long-term rates are higher \nthan expected because of Wall Street's uncertainty about the size of \nthe surpluses and how much debt the federal government will be able to \nretire.\n  Just 4 months ago, the President sent his budget to Congress and \nprojected a $125 billion non-Social Security surplus in the current \nfiscal year. Today, that surplus may have virtually disappeared. Now \nyou see it. Now you don't see it. It did a Houdini on us. It virtually \ndisappeared.\n  The Treasury Department this week, July 30, announced its debt \nretirement plans for the next 3 months. Instead of retiring $57 billion \nin debt, as the Treasury had expected on April 30 before the tax cut \nwas passed, the Treasury now plans to borrow $51 billion. That's a \ndifference of $108 billion.\n  In part, this quarter's borrowing results from a bookkeeping gimmick \nin the tax cut bill and will be paid back next quarter. But, the fact \nremains\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nthat interest rates are higher than necessary because of Wall Street's \nperception that our debt retirement efforts have been threatened in \nrecent months.\n  If the Federal Government fails to meet Wall Street's expectation \nabout debt retirement, and if surpluses do repeatedly come in below \nforecasts, investors will continue to drive up long-term interest \nrates, offsetting the limited stimulus that the tax cuts were supposed \nto provide, and further stifling economic growth.\n  Madam President, in his ``Report on the Public Credit'' to the House \nof Representatives in January 1790, Alexander Hamilton--our Nation's \nfirst Secretary of the Treasury and arguably our Nation's most gifted \nSecretary of the Treasury--wrote that ``states, like individuals, who \nobserve their engagements are respected and trusted, while the reverse \nis the fate of those who pursue an opposite conduct.''\n  When the administration makes false promises about a budget that can \nadequately provide for the operations of Government and allow for a \nmassive tax cut without disrupting debt retirement efforts, and then \ndoes not deliver on those promises, that administration breaks faith \nwith the American people and undermines trust in their government.\n  That is the message that the financial markets are sending to the \nAmerican people. Fiscal responsibility is slipping.\n  After 10 years of belt tightening and two deficit reduction \npackages--OBRA of 1990 and OBRA of 1993--signed into law by Republican \nand Democratic Presidents, this administration's reliance on 10-year \nprojections and its dogged determination to force a massive tax cut \nthrough the Congress has put this country in danger of falling back \ninto the deficit dungeon. Will we never learn?\n  The Senate Budget Committee--based on the administration's own \ninformal estimates--projects that $17 billion in Medicare surpluses \nwill be used in fiscal year 2001 to offset the loss of revenues from \nthe tax cut recently enacted into law. What is worse is that, in fiscal \nyear 2002, the Budget Committee estimates that the entire Medicare \nsurplus and $4 billion of the Social Security surplus will have to be \nused to offset the loss in revenues from the tax cut.\n  Meanwhile, this administration is trying to divert attention from its \nown complicity--divert attention from its own complicity, you see--in \ncreating our current budgetary morass. Despite a tax cut that cost $74 \nbillion in the current fiscal year, White House officials have \nroutinely said that--aha--``the real threat''--they say down there at \nthe other end of the avenue--``the real threat''--this is the White \nHouse now; the White House is talking--``the real threat to the \nsurpluses comes from spending (Fliescher, July 9).''\n  Well, Madam President, I just have to ask, whose spending? Whose \nspending? The President, himself, requested the only appropriations \nspending bill that this Congress has passed for the current fiscal \nyear. The Congress passed the supplemental appropriations bill at \nexactly the same level--exactly the same level--that was requested by \nthe President--not one thin dime more did the Congress appropriate; not \none thin dime more than the President requested. So whose spending? The \nonly other spending that has occurred so far is the spending caused by \nthis year's colossal tax cut. Remember, tax cuts spend money--your \nmoney--from the U.S. Treasury just like appropriation bills.\n  Well, I already have the notice for my check. Here it is: ``Notice of \nstatus and amount of immediate tax relief.'' Here is what it says: \n``Dear taxpayer: We are pleased to inform you that the U.S. Congress \npassed, and President George W. Bush signed into law, the Economic \nGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. As part of the \nimmediate tax relief, you''--me; ``you'' it says--``will be receiving a \ncheck in the amount of $600 during the week of September 10, 2001.''\n  That is spending. That says the Treasury is going to send me and my \nwife of 64 years $600. That is spending. Tax cuts have spent that \nsurplus that we were talking about a few months back, and we have \nsmashed the piggy bank to the tune of $74 billion in just 1 year. That \nis just $74 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born.\n  Moreover, it costs an additional $116 million just to mail out the \nchecks. Here is part of it. Here is part of the $600 million it cost to \nprocess and mail out the checks, and to tell taxpayers like Robert Byrd \nthat he is going to get $600. Half of it will be his and half will be \nhis wife's.\n  Now, as the fiscal outlook worsens, there are some who are running \nfor cover or spinning the old blame game wheel as fast as it will go. \nIn fact, I have noted media reports that some Senators are considering \nraising the old specter of a constitutional amendment--aha, they are \ngoing to amend this Constitution now, they say, the Constitution which \nI hold in my hand--the old specter of a constitutional amendment that \nwould require a balanced budget. Talk about gimmicks. That one is the \nmother of all gimmicks. Now because of this flashy tax cut--because of \nthis flashy tax cut--and a sluggish economy, we are poised to spend the \nMedicare surpluses, disrupt our debt retirement efforts, and dive right \nback into the deficit doldrums. The present course threatens to push \nthe economy and the American people off a cliff into that old familiar \nsea of red ink.\n  Look out below.\n  The Congress had the opportunity earlier this year to pass a \nresponsible budget--to exercise some restraint, to show some caution--\nbefore pressing ahead with a budget based on half-baked economic \nprojections and political promises that were made first in the New \nHampshire snows of a campaign year--last year, the year 2000. We could \nhave afforded a smaller tax cut, we could have lived within our means \nwhile protecting Social Security and Medicare.\n  That is your money.\n  Madam President, in spite of the hand that was dealt to us, this \nSenate is trying to craft 13 responsible appropriations bills. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee, on which I have sat now for 44 years, \nhas successfully reported out 9 of the 13 appropriations bills--\nAgriculture, Commerce-Justice-State, energy and water, foreign \noperations, Interior, legislative branch, Transportation, Treasury-\nGeneral Government, and VA-HUD--and stayed within our 302(b) \nallocations. There you are. We have stayed within our 302(b) \nallocation. In other words, we have not bust the budget. So don't blame \nit on us. These are balanced and responsible bills. We have done our \nbest.\n  Unfortunately, the full Senate has not been able to act as quickly.\n  To date, the President has not signed one--not one--of the 13 regular \nappropriations bills for the coming fiscal year into law--not one.\n  The full Senate has passed only five appropriations bills so far, \nenergy and water, Interior, legislative branch, Transportation, and VA-\nHUD--five of the nine that the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nreported out. That means that when the Congress returns from its summer \nrecess, the Senate will have to pass eight appropriations bills and all \nthirteen conference reports before the fiscal year ends on September \n30.\n  Earlier this year I was optimistic about the appropriations and \nbudget process. Our new President was preaching bipartisanship. We were \nbeing told that there would be a new spirit, a new spirit in \nWashington, a new tone, a new era, a new era of cooperation between \nDemocrats and Republicans working together to address our nation's \nchallenges. What a pretty picture! Aha.\n  When the President missed the deadline for submitting his budget to \nCongress, we gave him the benefit of the doubt. We knew it takes a new \nadministration time to get up and running. We all know that. The \ndetails of that budget were not sent to the Congress before Congress \ntook up the budget resolution, although this Senator and others asked \nfor those details repeatedly. Yet, Congress passed the President's \nplan. Cooperation ruled.\n  When the President delayed sending us his Defense budget amendment \nuntil after his tax cut bill had been passed, Congress again gave him \nthe benefit of the doubt. Congress was doing its part to encourage the \nnew spirit, the new tone in Washington. A review of our national \ndefense needs was underway, and it seemed logical that the \nadministration would need time to complete that review before \nrequesting additional defense funds.\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\n  When Congress learned that the administration's Office of Management \nand Budget would miss the July 15 statutory deadline for submitting its \nmid-session review to Congress, not much grumbling was heard in these \nquarters. It is not unprecedented for an administration to miss these \nbudgetary deadlines, but it is also well to remember that these are \nstatutory deadlines, not recommendations that the administration may \nchoose to meet whenever it is convenient.\n  Now in the final days before the August recess, I have detected a \ndistinct slowdown in the appropriations process.\n  With only 17 legislative days left before the start of the new fiscal \nyear, we still have to pass eight appropriations bills, and we have not \nconferenced one single bill with the House.\n  It is becoming clear that Congress is very likely to blow right by \nthe September 30 deadline for passing 13 appropriations bills. I do not \nwant to see the budgetary train wreck that we have sometimes witnessed \nin recent years. Senator Ted Stevens and I, and the other members of \nthe Appropriations Committee--Republicans and Democrats--have been \nworking diligently to avoid just such an outcome. However, unless we \nchange track soon, this train is heading straight for a thirteen car \npile-up once again.\n  I can see the sign. Just read it with me: ``Danger, stop, look, \nlisten: Omnibus Bill Ahead!''\n  If that happens, much of the fiscal restraint that this Congress has \nmustered is likely to be jettisoned. No matter how carefully Congress \ntries to craft disciplined, balanced spending bills, when it comes to \nthe final hours before the end of the fiscal year, the pressure to \nbundle these spending bills has a way of melting all fiscal restraint. \nBoth the Senate and the House need to redouble our efforts to pass \nthese appropriations bills, get them to conference and send them to the \nWhite House before September 30.\n  Let us work diligently instead of playing the blame game and letting \nthe chips fall where they may.\n  I hope the American people will not be misled by the fancy rhetoric \nthat will certainly fill the political balloons over the coming weeks. \nYou are going to heat lots of it. The tax cut and spending plan that \nwere passed earlier this year were sheer madness. The political \nballoons may fill the air--even though we are past the fourth of July, \nthe balloons are going up--but they cannot obscure the clear, plain \nfact of what has happened here. It is not traditional Congressional \nspending which has cut the surplus, headed us back towards deficits, \nand threatened our efforts to pay back the debt.\n  Rather, a Republican-led Congress, at the prodding of the \nadministration, took a gamble and played the odds that the shortfalls \nof a fiscally irresponsible tax cut could be held off for several \nyears. Maybe we would be lucky. Maybe the gamble would work. But the \nchickens are coming home to roost much sooner, and lady luck seems to \nhave taken a hike.\n  In 1981, then-Senate Republican leader Howard Baker called the Reagan \ntax-cut plan a ``river boat gamble.'' The country lost on that bet. Two \ndecades later, we are only just beginning to recoup our losses.\n  President Bush took another spin at the roulette wheel and he has \nwagered our economic prosperity and retirement security that our budget \nwill land in the black. It seems like nothing ever changes in this \ncity. I have been here 49 years. Some things do change.\n  The Senate will soon recess for the month of August, and, before we \nleave, it is important that the American people understand that the \nwheel was rigged. The earnest claims of bipartisan cooperation have \nvaporized like the smoke at the poker table. In this tax cut casino, \nthe budget can only land on red.

Madam President, let me congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, our chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, for his eloquence and for his wisdom.\n  I share his view on the propriety of the tax cut. I share his pride \nin the actions taken by the Appropriations Committee in this body over \nthe last several weeks as we have attempted to make up for lost time on \nthe appropriations process.\n  We inherited a horrendous schedule. Slowly but surely we have been \ncatching up. Were it not for his leadership and his absolute \ndetermination to get back on track, we could not have a full \nappreciation of how far we have come in the last couple of weeks. As he \nsaid, we have done it staying within the budget parameters outlined in \nthe budget resolution. We have not broken the caps, once again \ndemonstrating the fiscal discipline so critical when we began this \nprocess several months ago.\n  We will continue our work when we return. I commend the Senator for \nhis comments today, as well as for his work throughout the last several \nweeks in reaching this point.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \ntenacity, his determination, and his desire to pass all nine of the \nappropriations bills which have been reported from the Appropriations \nCommittee before the August recess.\n  Our committee, Democrats and Republicans, have worked together to \nreport these bills. It is a committee sui generis, one of a kind. The \nDemocrats and the Republicans on that committee work together. There is \nno hemming and hawing. We work until we get the work done.\n  The leader said he wanted those bills out of the committee. They are \nout of the committee. They are on the calendar. He wanted to act on \nthem in the Senate before the August break.\n  The Senate appointed conferees on at least three of the \nappropriations bills. I see three on the calendar. Three bills in \nconference, three appropriations bills with the Senate conferees \nappointed but there are no House conferees appointed, which concerns \nme.\n  I hope when we return from the August recess the other body will \nappoint its conferees, and we can join with our House counterparts on \nthese conference reports and report them back to the Senate at good \nspeed.\n  I have been in consultation with the chairman of the House \nAppropriations Committee and with the subcommittee chairman on the \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Interior, and others. They assure me \nthey will move rapidly when we do return, but in the meantime our \nstaffs can be doing some of the preliminary work which will make it \nmuch easier for our conferees to do their work speedily upon our \nreturn.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and share his \nconcern for the fact we have not yet named conferees on the House side. \nWe are ready to go to work, and we could have accomplished a good deal \nin the last several weeks were it not for the fact we are unable to go \nto conference until our House counterparts are prepared to work with \nus.\n  I am hopeful when we come back we can make up for lost time because \nthere certainly has been a great deal of lost time today.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to executive \nsession.\n  I stand corrected. Mr. President, I understand our Republican \ncolleagues are not yet prepared to move to executive session. I will \nsimply say we are prepared to move 58 additional nominees today. That \nis in addition to the 30 we have already done this week, making a total \nof 88 nominations we will have done should our Republican colleagues \nallow us to move forward with the unanimous consent request.\n  That means since July 9, which is the first business day following \nthe completion of the organizing resolution, we will have completed 168 \nnominations. That is some record.\n  As I said all along, we want to be fair. We want to be responsive. We \nrecognize many of these people need to know the outcome of their \nnominating process. Unlike so many occasions over the last 6 years, we \nare desirous of treating all nominees fairly and moving as quickly as \nwe can. Until our Republican colleagues are prepared to provide us with \nthe ability to move forward on this unanimous consent request, I will \nwithhold the request.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S8887]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8884-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8884-S8887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN AND BUDGET SURPLUS REVISIONS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the Commerce Department reported last \nweek, July 27, that the U.S. economy grew at an anemic 0.7 percent rate \nin the second quarter of this year, April 1-June 30. This is the \nslowest growth rate in 8 years, and considerably lower than the 8.3 \npercent growth rate seen just 18 months ago.\n  ``If you applied logic to the [economic] news these days,'' wrote \nAllan Sloan in the Washington Post on Tuesday, July 31, ``the logical \nconclusion would be that the economy has fallen off a cliff and is \nabout to splatter all over the canyon floor and take us with it.''\n  This week, July 30, the Wall Street Journal reported, ``the economy \nhas been pushed to the edge of a recession by a breathtaking decline in \nbusiness investment.'' In the second quarter, nonresidential investment \ntumbled at a 13.6 percent rate. Consumer spending, along with robust \nstate and local government spending, is the only thing that prevented \nthe economy from shrinking over the last three months.\n  In an effort to stem the tide, the Federal Reserve has dramatically \ncut short-term interest rates by almost 3 percentage points over the \nlast 7 months. These are the most aggressive rate reductions since the \n1982 recession under President Reagan.\n  Despite this negative economic news, the Administration remains \nresolutely optimistic about the economy's future, pinning their hopes \non the recently enacted tax cut. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said \nlast week, July 23, that the U.S. economy might grow by more than 3 \npercent next year. The President's chief economic advisor, Larry \nLindsey, in a speech before the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, \nreaffirmed this optimistic outlook.\n  What concerns me is the effect that these tax cuts have had on the \neconomy so far.\n  Despite the Fed's efforts to cut short-term interest rates to \nsimulate the sluggish economy, long-term interest rates have remained \nflat or have even risen since earlier this year. The interest rate on \nthe 10-year bond, for example, increased from 4.75 percent in mid-March \nto just over 5.1 percent today, August 3. Long-term rates have limited \nefforts by the Fed to stimulate the economy.\n  What's keeping those rates from falling is the expectation by Wall \nStreet that the recently enacted tax cut has seriously jeopardized our \ndebt retirement efforts. Fed Chairman Greenspan said last week, July \n24, before the Senate Banking Committee that long-term rates are higher \nthan expected because of Wall Street's uncertainty about the size of \nthe surpluses and how much debt the federal government will be able to \nretire.\n  Just 4 months ago, the President sent his budget to Congress and \nprojected a $125 billion non-Social Security surplus in the current \nfiscal year. Today, that surplus may have virtually disappeared. Now \nyou see it. Now you don't see it. It did a Houdini on us. It virtually \ndisappeared.\n  The Treasury Department this week, July 30, announced its debt \nretirement plans for the next 3 months. Instead of retiring $57 billion \nin debt, as the Treasury had expected on April 30 before the tax cut \nwas passed, the Treasury now plans to borrow $51 billion. That's a \ndifference of $108 billion.\n  In part, this quarter's borrowing results from a bookkeeping gimmick \nin the tax cut bill and will be paid back next quarter. But, the fact \nremains\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\nthat interest rates are higher than necessary because of Wall Street's \nperception that our debt retirement efforts have been threatened in \nrecent months.\n  If the Federal Government fails to meet Wall Street's expectation \nabout debt retirement, and if surpluses do repeatedly come in below \nforecasts, investors will continue to drive up long-term interest \nrates, offsetting the limited stimulus that the tax cuts were supposed \nto provide, and further stifling economic growth.\n  Madam President, in his ``Report on the Public Credit'' to the House \nof Representatives in January 1790, Alexander Hamilton--our Nation's \nfirst Secretary of the Treasury and arguably our Nation's most gifted \nSecretary of the Treasury--wrote that ``states, like individuals, who \nobserve their engagements are respected and trusted, while the reverse \nis the fate of those who pursue an opposite conduct.''\n  When the administration makes false promises about a budget that can \nadequately provide for the operations of Government and allow for a \nmassive tax cut without disrupting debt retirement efforts, and then \ndoes not deliver on those promises, that administration breaks faith \nwith the American people and undermines trust in their government.\n  That is the message that the financial markets are sending to the \nAmerican people. Fiscal responsibility is slipping.\n  After 10 years of belt tightening and two deficit reduction \npackages--OBRA of 1990 and OBRA of 1993--signed into law by Republican \nand Democratic Presidents, this administration's reliance on 10-year \nprojections and its dogged determination to force a massive tax cut \nthrough the Congress has put this country in danger of falling back \ninto the deficit dungeon. Will we never learn?\n  The Senate Budget Committee--based on the administration's own \ninformal estimates--projects that $17 billion in Medicare surpluses \nwill be used in fiscal year 2001 to offset the loss of revenues from \nthe tax cut recently enacted into law. What is worse is that, in fiscal \nyear 2002, the Budget Committee estimates that the entire Medicare \nsurplus and $4 billion of the Social Security surplus will have to be \nused to offset the loss in revenues from the tax cut.\n  Meanwhile, this administration is trying to divert attention from its \nown complicity--divert attention from its own complicity, you see--in \ncreating our current budgetary morass. Despite a tax cut that cost $74 \nbillion in the current fiscal year, White House officials have \nroutinely said that--aha--``the real threat''--they say down there at \nthe other end of the avenue--``the real threat''--this is the White \nHouse now; the White House is talking--``the real threat to the \nsurpluses comes from spending (Fliescher, July 9).''\n  Well, Madam President, I just have to ask, whose spending? Whose \nspending? The President, himself, requested the only appropriations \nspending bill that this Congress has passed for the current fiscal \nyear. The Congress passed the supplemental appropriations bill at \nexactly the same level--exactly the same level--that was requested by \nthe President--not one thin dime more did the Congress appropriate; not \none thin dime more than the President requested. So whose spending? The \nonly other spending that has occurred so far is the spending caused by \nthis year's colossal tax cut. Remember, tax cuts spend money--your \nmoney--from the U.S. Treasury just like appropriation bills.\n  Well, I already have the notice for my check. Here it is: ``Notice of \nstatus and amount of immediate tax relief.'' Here is what it says: \n``Dear taxpayer: We are pleased to inform you that the U.S. Congress \npassed, and President George W. Bush signed into law, the Economic \nGrowth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. As part of the \nimmediate tax relief, you''--me; ``you'' it says--``will be receiving a \ncheck in the amount of $600 during the week of September 10, 2001.''\n  That is spending. That says the Treasury is going to send me and my \nwife of 64 years $600. That is spending. Tax cuts have spent that \nsurplus that we were talking about a few months back, and we have \nsmashed the piggy bank to the tune of $74 billion in just 1 year. That \nis just $74 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born.\n  Moreover, it costs an additional $116 million just to mail out the \nchecks. Here is part of it. Here is part of the $600 million it cost to \nprocess and mail out the checks, and to tell taxpayers like Robert Byrd \nthat he is going to get $600. Half of it will be his and half will be \nhis wife's.\n  Now, as the fiscal outlook worsens, there are some who are running \nfor cover or spinning the old blame game wheel as fast as it will go. \nIn fact, I have noted media reports that some Senators are considering \nraising the old specter of a constitutional amendment--aha, they are \ngoing to amend this Constitution now, they say, the Constitution which \nI hold in my hand--the old specter of a constitutional amendment that \nwould require a balanced budget. Talk about gimmicks. That one is the \nmother of all gimmicks. Now because of this flashy tax cut--because of \nthis flashy tax cut--and a sluggish economy, we are poised to spend the \nMedicare surpluses, disrupt our debt retirement efforts, and dive right \nback into the deficit doldrums. The present course threatens to push \nthe economy and the American people off a cliff into that old familiar \nsea of red ink.\n  Look out below.\n  The Congress had the opportunity earlier this year to pass a \nresponsible budget--to exercise some restraint, to show some caution--\nbefore pressing ahead with a budget based on half-baked economic \nprojections and political promises that were made first in the New \nHampshire snows of a campaign year--last year, the year 2000. We could \nhave afforded a smaller tax cut, we could have lived within our means \nwhile protecting Social Security and Medicare.\n  That is your money.\n  Madam President, in spite of the hand that was dealt to us, this \nSenate is trying to craft 13 responsible appropriations bills. The \nSenate Appropriations Committee, on which I have sat now for 44 years, \nhas successfully reported out 9 of the 13 appropriations bills--\nAgriculture, Commerce-Justice-State, energy and water, foreign \noperations, Interior, legislative branch, Transportation, Treasury-\nGeneral Government, and VA-HUD--and stayed within our 302(b) \nallocations. There you are. We have stayed within our 302(b) \nallocation. In other words, we have not bust the budget. So don't blame \nit on us. These are balanced and responsible bills. We have done our \nbest.\n  Unfortunately, the full Senate has not been able to act as quickly.\n  To date, the President has not signed one--not one--of the 13 regular \nappropriations bills for the coming fiscal year into law--not one.\n  The full Senate has passed only five appropriations bills so far, \nenergy and water, Interior, legislative branch, Transportation, and VA-\nHUD--five of the nine that the Senate Appropriations Committee has \nreported out. That means that when the Congress returns from its summer \nrecess, the Senate will have to pass eight appropriations bills and all \nthirteen conference reports before the fiscal year ends on September \n30.\n  Earlier this year I was optimistic about the appropriations and \nbudget process. Our new President was preaching bipartisanship. We were \nbeing told that there would be a new spirit, a new spirit in \nWashington, a new tone, a new era, a new era of cooperation between \nDemocrats and Republicans working together to address our nation's \nchallenges. What a pretty picture! Aha.\n  When the President missed the deadline for submitting his budget to \nCongress, we gave him the benefit of the doubt. We knew it takes a new \nadministration time to get up and running. We all know that. The \ndetails of that budget were not sent to the Congress before Congress \ntook up the budget resolution, although this Senator and others asked \nfor those details repeatedly. Yet, Congress passed the President's \nplan. Cooperation ruled.\n  When the President delayed sending us his Defense budget amendment \nuntil after his tax cut bill had been passed, Congress again gave him \nthe benefit of the doubt. Congress was doing its part to encourage the \nnew spirit, the new tone in Washington. A review of our national \ndefense needs was underway, and it seemed logical that the \nadministration would need time to complete that review before \nrequesting additional defense funds.\n\n[[Page S8886]]\n\n  When Congress learned that the administration's Office of Management \nand Budget would miss the July 15 statutory deadline for submitting its \nmid-session review to Congress, not much grumbling was heard in these \nquarters. It is not unprecedented for an administration to miss these \nbudgetary deadlines, but it is also well to remember that these are \nstatutory deadlines, not recommendations that the administration may \nchoose to meet whenever it is convenient.\n  Now in the final days before the August recess, I have detected a \ndistinct slowdown in the appropriations process.\n  With only 17 legislative days left before the start of the new fiscal \nyear, we still have to pass eight appropriations bills, and we have not \nconferenced one single bill with the House.\n  It is becoming clear that Congress is very likely to blow right by \nthe September 30 deadline for passing 13 appropriations bills. I do not \nwant to see the budgetary train wreck that we have sometimes witnessed \nin recent years. Senator Ted Stevens and I, and the other members of \nthe Appropriations Committee--Republicans and Democrats--have been \nworking diligently to avoid just such an outcome. However, unless we \nchange track soon, this train is heading straight for a thirteen car \npile-up once again.\n  I can see the sign. Just read it with me: ``Danger, stop, look, \nlisten: Omnibus Bill Ahead!''\n  If that happens, much of the fiscal restraint that this Congress has \nmustered is likely to be jettisoned. No matter how carefully Congress \ntries to craft disciplined, balanced spending bills, when it comes to \nthe final hours before the end of the fiscal year, the pressure to \nbundle these spending bills has a way of melting all fiscal restraint. \nBoth the Senate and the House need to redouble our efforts to pass \nthese appropriations bills, get them to conference and send them to the \nWhite House before September 30.\n  Let us work diligently instead of playing the blame game and letting \nthe chips fall where they may.\n  I hope the American people will not be misled by the fancy rhetoric \nthat will certainly fill the political balloons over the coming weeks. \nYou are going to heat lots of it. The tax cut and spending plan that \nwere passed earlier this year were sheer madness. The political \nballoons may fill the air--even though we are past the fourth of July, \nthe balloons are going up--but they cannot obscure the clear, plain \nfact of what has happened here. It is not traditional Congressional \nspending which has cut the surplus, headed us back towards deficits, \nand threatened our efforts to pay back the debt.\n  Rather, a Republican-led Congress, at the prodding of the \nadministration, took a gamble and played the odds that the shortfalls \nof a fiscally irresponsible tax cut could be held off for several \nyears. Maybe we would be lucky. Maybe the gamble would work. But the \nchickens are coming home to roost much sooner, and lady luck seems to \nhave taken a hike.\n  In 1981, then-Senate Republican leader Howard Baker called the Reagan \ntax-cut plan a ``river boat gamble.'' The country lost on that bet. Two \ndecades later, we are only just beginning to recoup our losses.\n  President Bush took another spin at the roulette wheel and he has \nwagered our economic prosperity and retirement security that our budget \nwill land in the black. It seems like nothing ever changes in this \ncity. I have been here 49 years. Some things do change.\n  The Senate will soon recess for the month of August, and, before we \nleave, it is important that the American people understand that the \nwheel was rigged. The earnest claims of bipartisan cooperation have \nvaporized like the smoke at the poker table. In this tax cut casino, \nthe budget can only land on red. But, some of us knew that before we \never got into the game.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORZINE). The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, let me congratulate the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, our chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, for his eloquence and for his wisdom.\n  I share his view on the propriety of the tax cut.

Mr. President, last week, 178 countries reached an \nagreement in Bonn, Germany, on implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. \nWhile this agreement does not settle all the details of how a ratified \nprotocol might work, nearly all the signatories to that treaty hailed \nlast week's agreement as a step forward in the worldwide response to \nglobal climate change.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the United States remained on the \nsidelines of this latest round of negotiations. I urged the Bush \nadministration not to abandon the negotiation process. I think that we \nhave seen, in last week's agreement, proof that the rest of the world \nwill not sit idly by and wait for the United States. Perhaps this is a \ngood lesson for the administration to learn. America must make an \neffort, in concert with both industrialized and developing countries, \nto address the real and serious problem of global climate change.\n  While I believe that the United States must remain engaged in \nmultilateral talks to address the ever-increasing amounts of greenhouse \ngases that are emitted into our atmosphere, this does not mean that we \nshould simply sign up to any agreement that may come down the road. The \nSenate has been very clear on the conditions under which a treaty on \nclimate change may be ratified.\n  Developing countries must also be included in a binding framework to \nlimit their future emissions of greenhouse gases. It makes no \ndifference if a greenhouse gas is released from a factory in the United \nStates or a factory in China; the global effect is the same. \nQuizzically, the Kyoto Protocol, as now written, does make such \ndistinctions. It ignores scientific knowledge about the global nature \nof the problem.\n  The question of developing country participation was not addressed at \nthe conference in Bonn. Without the United States' full engagement in \nthe talks, there is no other country that can raise this issue and \nstand a chance of success. This is not meant to disparage the herculean \nefforts of some of our closest allies to improve the technical aspects \nof last week's agreement. Some of our allies made substantial \ncontributions to the agreement on technical issues such as allowing the \nuse of forests to absorb carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, and \nattempting to improve the compliance mechanisms of the treaty. Those \nallies should be applauded for their efforts to craft an agreement that \ndoes not preclude the United States from participating in future talks, \nbut even our allies would agree that the United States must return to \nthe table.\n  Despite the shortcomings in the agreement reached at Bonn, I see a \nwindow of opportunity for the United States to rejoin the multilateral \ntalks on the Kyoto Protocol. It is a small window, and it is closing, \nbut it is a window nonetheless. In October 2001, the next round of \nnegotiations on climate change will begin in Marrakesh, Morocco. If the \nadministration were to formulate a new, comprehensive, multilateral \nplan to address climate change before that conference, I believe there \nwould be several factors working in our favor.\n  The world agrees that any treaty on climate change will be of limited \nuse unless the United States is a full participant, because we are, for \nnow, the largest emitter of greenhouse gases. Developing countries know \nthat we will be the source of much of the new technology that will \nallow them to use cleaner, more efficient forms of energy. The United \nStates also has much to gain by working with other countries to secure \n``emission credits'' that will help us to reduce our greenhouse gas \nemissions in a manner that lessens the impact on our economy. Other \ncountries recognize these facts, and many may be willing to hear a \nbold, new proposal from the United States that may facilitate our \nreturn to an improved version of the Kyoto Protocol.\n  Make no doubt about it, if the United States does return to \nnegotiating on the Kyoto Protocol, progress will not come easy. But in \nsome respects, our role as an international leader is at stake. In \nBonn, by remaining on the sidelines during the negotiation, the United \nStates ceded its leadership because of a hasty declaration that the \nProtocol was, in the words of the President, ``fatally flawed.'' I \ncontinue to urge President Bush to demonstrate the indispensability of \nour leadership in the world by rejoining the negotiations on global \nclimate change, and directing those negotiations toward a solution that \nencourages developing country participation and protects the health of \nour economy.\n  I note that my colleagues on the Committee on Foreign Relations also \nrecognize the importance of remaining engaged in these discussions. On \nWednesday, that committee accepted, by a unanimous vote, an amendment \nto the State Department authorization bill that expounds upon the \nSenate's position on climate change. Sponsored by Senator Kerry, this \namendment expresses the sense of the Congress that the United States \nmust address climate change both domestically and internationally, and \nsupports the objective of our participation in a revised Kyoto Protocol \nor other, future binding climate change agreement, that includes \ndeveloping country participation and protects our economy. It is a wise \nand well-crafted statement, which I support fully.\n  Formulating an international response to climate change is an \nambitious goal. It is a challenge to which the United States must rise. \nI hope that when Congress returns to session in September, the \nPresident will have made the decision that our country must be a full \nparticipant in international talks on the Kyoto Protocol, and that he \nwill have made progress in developing specific proposals to improve a \nmultilateral treaty on climate change.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

They had simply \ngiven us an extension until November. That really does not help very \nmuch. So I asked the President's Chief of Staff, Andrew Card, if we can \nget a letter from the President indicating how important this was and \nthat he would use whatever Executive powers he had at his control \nduring this period of time when we are in a situation where companies \ncannot sell what they need to sell, and the President fulfilled that \nresponsibility. I appreciate it very much.\n  Condoleezza Rice said among other things:\n\n       I am pleased that the Senate plans to take up S. 149 on \n     September 4, 2001. Because the current Export Administration \n     Act will expire on August 20, 2001, the President is prepared \n     to use the authorities provided him under the International \n     Emergency Economic Powers Act to extend the existing dual-use \n     export control program. As you know, IEEPA authority has \n     previously been used to administer our export control \n     programs. Since a new EAA will provide us the strongest \n     authority to administer dual-use export controls, \n     particularly as related to enforcement, penalties for export \n     control violations, and the protection of business propriety \n     information, we support swift enactment of S. 149.\n\n  Mr. President, this statement says a great deal. As I indicated, I am \nvery appreciative.\n  To maintain America's technology superiority, the United States must \nmodernize outdated export controls on information products and \ntechnology. Reform of the export control system is critical because \nrestricting access to computing power is not feasible and no longer \nserves the national interest. It needlessly undermines technological \npreeminence of America's information technology industry without \naccomplishing any significant national security objective.\n  The continued use of MTOPS, a standard design by the United States \nGovernment to regulate the export of information technology is outdated \ngiven today's technological and economic realities and the global \neconomy.\n  Under current law, the President of the United States is required to \nuse an antiquated metric, called MTOPS, which means millions of \ntheoretical\n\n[[Page S8888]]\n\noperations per second, to measure computer performance and set export \ncontrol thresholds based on country tiers. This is the intelligence \ninformation we have in various countries.\n  The conclusion could not be clearer. MTOPS are increasingly useless \nas a measure of performance. MTOPS cannot accurately measure \nperformance of current microprocessors or alternative supercomputing \nsources clustering. This makes MTOPS-based hardware controls \nirrelevant. The best choice is to eliminate MTOPS.\n  Eliminating MTOPS will ensure America's continued prosperity and \nsecurity in the networked world. It will ensure Government policies \nthat promote U.S. global economic, technological, and military \nleadership.\n  Eliminating MTOPS will remove unnecessary and unproductive layer of \nregulation that no longer serves a meaningful national security purpose \nand will help level the playing field for American companies that \ncompete in the global economy.\n  President Bush, the Department of Defense, the General Accounting \nOffice, and the Defense Science Board all recently concluded that MTOPS \nis an ``outdated and invalid'' metric and that the current system is \nsimply ineffective. Repeal of NDAA language would give the President \nthe flexibility to develop a more modern, effective system.\n  This is a bill good for America, and when we come back, I will urge \nmy colleagues to quickly move this legislation.\n  I again express my appreciation to the President of the United States \nand his Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice for giving us this \ninformation. We will, with their approval, move on this legislation as \nsoon as we get back.\n  This letter was sent to the majority leader, Senator Daschle. I ask \nunanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, August 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Thank you for your efforts to advance the \n     Senate's consideration of S. 149, the Export Administration \n     Act of 2001. This bill has the Administration's strong \n     support.\n       I am pleased that the Senate plans to take up S. 149 on \n     September 4, 2001. Because the current Export Administration \n     Act (EAA) will expire on August 20, 2001, the President is \n     prepared to use the authorities provided to him under the \n     International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to extend \n     the existing dual-use export control program. As you know, \n     IEEPA authority has previously been used to administer our \n     export control programs. Since a new EAA will provide us the \n     strongest authority to administer dual-use export controls, \n     particularly as related to enforcement, penalties for export \n     control violations, and the protection of business \n     proprietary information, we support swift enactment of S. \n     149.\n       I look forward to continuing to work with you on these \n     important national security issues.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Condoleezza Rice,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n                                        National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8888-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8888-S8891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as if in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent all nominations received by the Senate during the 107th \nCongress, except numbers PN 386 and PN 630, remain in status quo, \nnotwithstanding the August 3, 2001, adjournment of the Senate, and the \nprovisions of rule 31, paragraph 6 of the Standing Rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, it is my \nunderstanding if this consent were granted on the two nominations, the \ntwo cited as PN 386 and PN 630, they would be returned to the White \nHouse. However, the White House could immediately resubmit the names. \nTherefore, I modify the request, or ask to modify the request so that \nall nominations remain in status quo during the adjournment of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object to that. I \nsimply say Mary Gall had a hearing and she was not reported out of the \ncommittee. In fact, the committee acted affirmatively not to report \nthat to the Senate. I say that Otto Reich as the Assistant Secretary of \nState--there have been a number of Senators who raised questions about \nthat. If the President feels strongly about Otto Reich, during this \nperiod of time we are gone, he has the absolute authority to send that \nname back to us. I think that would be an appropriate way to proceed.\n  Therefore, I object to the modified request of the minority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, I object to the original request by the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I respect very much, of course, the decision \nmade by the minority leader. I just disagree with him. It seems to me \nit is going to unnecessarily create a lot of work for a lot of people. \nSending those two names back--if the President wishes to resubmit them, \nhe can do that, but there is no need to belabor that any further today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could be recognized just to respond \nbriefly, I understand what the Senator from Nevada is saying. We \ndiscussed it.\n  We believe Mary Sheila Gall's nomination to be Chairman of the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission was treated very badly and very \nshabbily in terms of the things that were said about her and the vote \nthat occurred. I am sure there will be those who make the argument on \nthe other side.\n  With regard to Otto Reich to be Assistant Secretary of State, he has \nnot had a hearing. We believe it is unfair to single him out and send \nback just one nominee at this time.\n  My understanding is over the past several years, during the 5 years I \nwas majority leader, in every year but one we sent back no nominees. In \n1999, we did actually send back nine. To isolate it down to one or two \nthis early in the session, we believe, is a problem. We realize it is a \nministerial process now. They will all be sent down and all will be \nbundled up and sent back, but it does highlight our concern about the \nway these two nominees are being treated.\n\n  I understand what Senator Reid was saying. We have taken that action, \nright or wrong. Now we can move on.\n  Mr. REID. I just say to the distinguished Republican leader, I had a \nmeeting in my office yesterday on Otto Reich. Some of my friends came \nto speak to me very favorably about Otto Reich.\n  I think the decision may focus more attention on it than if the \nPresident simply resubmitted the name, but as I said earlier, time will \nonly tell if he will resubmit the name. I am sure he will resubmit the \nnames of all the others. It just creates a lot of paperwork for a lot \nof people.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will just yield on one point, I thank the \nSenator for nominations we are going to be able to move now. A lot of \nwork has been done to get this list cleared. You have given a lot of \ntime to it, as has Senator Nickles. I just wanted to thank you in \nadvance for the work that has been done.\n  Mr. REID. Of course, nothing would be done but for the two leaders. \nSenator Nickles and I were given an assignment to do what we could to \nclear these names. He came to me yesterday and he said, since you have \nbeen given this job, I have been able to clear three. He said prior to \nmy getting involved he cleared 58 or so. For Senator Nickles and me, \nthis makes us look good also. But these names could not have been \ncleared but for the work of our two leaders.\n  The nominations returned are as follows:\n\n                          Nominations Returned\n\n       The following nominations were returned to the President of \n     the United States pursuant to Rule XXXI, paragraph 6 of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate on Friday, August 3, 2001.\n\n\n           Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry\n\n       PN336  Department of Agriculture.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations were considered and confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could take a brief minute to speak on \nJohn Huntsman to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, I have known the \nHuntsman family for many, many years. A finer family is no place in \nexistence. John will be the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative. He is one \nof about 9, 10, or 11 siblings. He is from a huge family. John \nHuntsman, Sr., is one of the finest philanthropic individuals I have \never known. He is a giver.\n  I went to a meeting with a number of other Senators and met him. He \nhas dedicated most of his life to giving away the fortune that he has \nbeen able to accumulate. He started a great cancer institute, one of \nthe finest in the world, in Salt Lake City. This month, August 25, the \nVice President is going to go break ground for this new hospital.\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\n  I was with John Huntsman, Sr., recently, the father of this fine man \nwho is going to be Deputy U.S. Trade Representative. He had made a \ncommitment this year to give many millions of dollars to charity. Times \nwere bad in his business. Oil prices went up, and he simply didn't have \nthe money to fulfill this commitment. He went out and borrowed the \nmoney so he could give it away.\n  He is a wonderful man. I am happy to be present when he is confirmed \nas Trade Representative. He is from the same hue as his father, and we \ncan expect great things for the country from John Huntsman.\n  The nominations were considered and confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of the following \nnominees:\n  John Henshaw to be Assistant Secretary of Labor;\n  Emily DeRocco to be Assistant Secretary of Labor;\n  And the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of the nomination of Martin Silverstein to be Ambassador \nto the Oriental Republic of Uruguay;\n  That the nominations be considered and confirmed en bloc, the motions \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, that any statements thereon be printed \nin the Record, and the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the nominations \nof Frederico Juarbe, Jr., to be Assistant Secretary of Labor for \nVeterans' Employment and Training, be referred jointly to the HELP \nCommittee and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Nomination of Robert D. McCallum, Jr.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate completes the confirmation \nprocess for Robert D. McCallum, Jr. to be the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral to head the Civil Division at the Department of Justice. I \ncongratulate Mr. McCallum and his family.\n  The Judiciary Committee has worked very hard since returning in July \nto act on presidential nominations to fill vital positions at the \nDepartment of Justice. In addition to the confirmations of the Deputy \nAttorney General, the Solicitor General, the Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Criminal Division, the Assistant Attorney General for \nLegislative Affairs, and the Assistant Attorney General for Legal \nPolicy, during the last month we have held four hearings on Department \nof Justice nominees and today we confirm a sixth nominee to a \nleadership role at the Department of Justice in the last month.\n  With the confirmation of Mr. McCallum, we have confirmed seven of the \nAttorney General's Assistant Attorneys General. We have also completed \naction on Asa Hutchinson to head the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nJim Ziglar to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service and Bob \nMueller to serve as the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation. I commend the Members of the Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle for their cooperation in this regard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8893-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, many of our colleagues have indicated \ntheir strong support for H.R. 1088, the Investor and Capital Markets \nFee Relief Act. I share the belief that the Senate should take action \non this critical legislation promptly.\n  A number of Senate leaders on securities matters have noted the \nimportance of this bill, including the senior Senator from New York, \nMr. Schumer, Chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. Sarbanes, the \nChairman of the Securities Subcommittee, Senator Dodd, the Assistant \nMajority Leader, Senator Reid, and many others.\n  I want to take this opportunity to update the Senate on the status of \nH.R. 1088. The Senate approved the bill unanimously in March. After \ngood-faith negotiations between both bodies, the House then approved an \namended bill, which included agreed-upon improvements by an \noverwhelming bipartisan vote of 404 to 22. It is now pending on the \nSenate calendar.\n  This legislation is long overdue. The Securities Exchange Commission \nnow collects fees from the investing public that are six times higher \nthan needed to cover the costs of operating the Commission. Fee \nreductions can free up new investment capital that can help spur the \neconomy at a time when it needs a boost.\n  Equally important are provisions in the bill that provide the \nCommission staff pay parity with other Federal financial regulators, \nwhich can help the agency stem turnover and retain quality staff. \nInvestors in our securities markets deserve the best quality regulators \nto protect them, and those fine public servants deserve proper \ncompensation.\n  This legislation should have been approved last year. It was \nunfortunate that, in the last Congress, even though the bill was \napproved by committees in both the House and Senate, it was never \nconsidered on the floor of either body. Efforts by many Senators to \nmove the bill in the waning days of the last Congress were stymied.\n  Under new leadership, the Senate will soon have an opportunity to \nmake amends for that lapse by finalizing this legislation. When \nCongress returns from its August work period, I will continue working \nwith my colleagues to ensure enactment of this key measure.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Majority Leader \nwill work to ensure enactment of the SEC pay parity and fee reduction \nlegislation when Congress returns from the August recess. Passage of \nH.R. 1088 is very important to the staff of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission as well as to the many segments of the securities industry.\n  This bill enjoys wide bipartisan support in the Senate. The Senate \nversion of the bill, S. 143, The Competitive Market Supervision Act of \n2001, was passed by the Banking Committee on March 1 by voice vote. It \nwas passed by the full Senate on March 22, by unanimous consent.\n  I want to focus on the importance of the bill's pay parity \nprovisions. These would authorize the Commission to pay its employees \non a par with the other Federal financial regulators. Our securities \nmarkets are the envy of the world. It is important that the regulator \nof those markets be in a favorable position to attract and retain \nqualified employees. Enacting pay parity contributes towards this goal \nand will result in enhanced supervision of the securities markets.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Majority \nLeader, Mr. Daschle, and the Chairman of the Banking Committee, Mr. \nSarbanes, for their commitment to this important piece of legislation, \nH.R. 1088, of which I am the chief Democratic sponsor. This bill is of \ntremendous importance to New York.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, has indicated, this \nlegislation would reduce transaction fees paid by investors to fund the \nongoing activities of the SEC. Such fee reductions will be of \nsubstantial benefit to investors, businesses and individual investors, \nalike. The bill also gives pay parity for employees at the SEC so that \nthe SEC may attract and retain highly qualified regulators to ensure \nthe integrity of our markets.\n  As my colleague knows, H.R. 1088, as passed by the House, \nincorporated the Senate position reflected in S. 143, which was \napproved by this Senate under unanimous consent in March. There will be \nno conference on the bill and we have assurances the President will \nsign it. All that is left is for the Senate to act, and I urge that we \ndo so as expeditiously as possible upon our return from the August \nrecess.\n  I also thank the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Reid, for his commitment to moving this critical \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my friend, the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, \nfor his unwavering leadership on this\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nbill. I couldn't agree more that this bill is very important to \ninvestors. It is unfortunate that we have not been able to act on this \nbill before the August recess, but this should not be interpreted as \nanything other than a difficulty with timing.\n  As my friend knows, I support this legislation. I think it is a good \nbill and I look forward to getting it to the floor. As the Majority \nLeader has indicated, although there will be a number of important \nmeasures competing for floor time this fall, including appropriations \nbills, it is our intention to bring this bill before the Senate.\n  I am hopeful our friends in the minority will extend to us the \nnecessary cooperation to complete action on this matter. I look forward \nto working with the Senator from New York and our colleagues to pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to add my support for the \npassage of H.R.1088, the Investor and Capital Markets Relief Act. As \nmany of my colleagues have noted, this legislation is the result of \nbipartisan cooperation in both the Senate and the House.\n  We have worked closely to craft legislation that I believe will have \nimportant benefits for both retail and institutional investors, the \nsecurities industry and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  I would specifically like to recognize the Chairman and Ranking \nMembers of the Banking Committee for their efforts on this bill, \nespecially with regard to ensuring pay parity for employees of the SEC. \nThe inclusion of this vital component will help to maintain the high \nlevel of competency we currently enjoy at the SEC .\n  I would also like to thank the Majority Leader and the Assistant \nMajority Leader for their commitment to the timely consideration of \nthis legislation. It is my hope that when we return from the August \nwork period, we can consider this legislation in a prompt fashion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8894-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE RETIREMENT OF REAR ADMIRAL LARRY BAUCOM, USN\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding \nnaval officer and public servant, Rear Admiral Larry C. Baucom, U.S. \nNavy, as he completes more than 30 years of active duty with the U.S. \nNavy. Whether as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy, as the \ncommanding officer of a fighter squadron, as the commander of a \nnuclear-powered aircraft carrier, or, most recently, as the Director of \nthe Navy's Environmental Protection, Safety and Occupational Health \nDivision, he tirelessly worked to serve America and our Navy and Marine \nCorps. It is a privilege for me to honor his many outstanding \nachievements and service to our great Nation and our service men and \nwomen.\n  Rear Admiral Baucom is a son of Columbia, SC. A 1970 Naval Academy \ngraduate, he was awarded his Naval Flight Officer wings in 1971. During \nhis 30-year career in the Navy, he served in a variety of operational \nassignments, including Fighter Squadron 32, Fighter Wing ONE, the U.S. \nNaval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, MD, and as Executive Officer \nof USS George Washington, CVN 73. An inspired, confident leader, he \ncommanded Fighter Squadron 143, USS Trenton, LPD 14, and the nuclear-\npowered aircraft carrier, USS Carl Vinson, CVN 70. Under his command, \nUSS Carl Vinson was awarded two Meritorious Unit Commendations and the \nBattle Efficiency Award for 1996 following a highly successful Arabian \nGulf deployment that included combat operations in support of Operation \nDESERT STRIKE. Following this tour, he served at the Supreme Allied \nHeadquarters as the Assistant Chief of Staff for Plans and Policy. Rear \nAdmiral Baucom also continuously pursued educational opportunities \nthroughout his career being awarded a Master's Degrees in Systems \nManagement from the University of Southern California and in National \nSecurity and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College.\n  In his most recent assignment as the Navy's Director of Environmental \nProtection, Safety and Occupational Health Division, Rear Admiral \nBaucom worked to ensure that the Navy remains a leader of environmental \nstewardship and towards ensuring the safety and welfare of its Sailors, \nMarines and civil service employees. Whether contributing to the \nDepartment's efforts to guarantee critical training at the Atlantic \nFleet Weapons Training Facility at Vieques, Puerto Rico, protecting the \nhealth and safety of shipyard workers, or addressing the encroachment \nissues that complicate our operational and training ranges, Rear \nAdmiral Baucom's leadership has been vital to the readiness and success \nof our country's military forces.\n  Rear Admiral Baucom provided exceptional advice, support and guidance \nto the Secretary of the Navy and the Chief of Naval Operations. His \nkeen insight, relentless dedication, and extraordinary talent have \ncontributed significantly to building and maintaining the world's best-\ntrained, best-equipped, and best-prepared Navy and Marine Corps. His \nvision has positively shaped the future readiness and capabilities of \nthe fleet in ways that will resonate for generations.\n  I thank Rear Admiral Baucom for his many public service contributions \nand a life devoted to ensuring our national security. It is my distinct \nhonor to wish him, and his wife Linda, much happiness and fair winds \nand following seas as they begin a new chapter in their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8894-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8894-S8896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CAP AND TRADE APPROACH TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise with my friend and colleague from \nConnecticut to express our concerns on a subject that is at the \nforefront of the many issues of global concern, climate change. The \nscience surrounding this issue has come increasingly into focus, and \nSenator Lieberman and I believe that it is time to take action.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I also am pleased to rise to join my \nfriend and colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, in making this call \nfor consideration of the development of an economy-wide cap-and-trade \nsystem to control our emissions of greenhouse gases. Senator McCain and \nI have been discussing the need to develop such legislation for some \ntime, and upon our return from recess, we plan to discuss with leaders \nfrom each sector of our economy to discuss what commitments they can \nmake to curb our growing problem of global warming without seriously \nharming our economy.\n  At this point, I invite Senator McCain to comment on his views on the \nsubject.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Over the past year, the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee has held several hearings on the various \nscientific reports from the National Academy of Science and the \nInternational Panel on Climate Change, IPCC. These reports conclude \nthat air temperatures are, in fact, rising. The IPCC report states that \nthere is new and stronger evidence that most of the observed warming \nover the past 50 years is attributable to human activities. We continue \nto see throughout the world the melting of glaciers, the dying of coral \nreefs, and rising ocean temerpatures.\n  The agreement reached last week in Bonn, Germany on the Kyoto \nProtocol means that the rest of the world is moving forward to address \nthis important problem. Given the fact that the United States produces \napproximately 25 percent of the total greenhouse gases emissions, the \nUnited States has a responsibility to cut its emissions of greenhouse \ngases. The United States must realize that when it comes to the \nclimate, there are no boundaries. Therefore, climate change is an \nglobal problem and must be resolved globally.\n  The current situation demands leadership from the United States. In \naccordance with the agreement reached last week, there is going to be a \nworld marketplace for carbon reductions, a marketplace that rewards \nimprovements in energy efficiency, advances in energy technologies, and \nimprovements in land-use practices--and we are running the risk that \nAmerica is not going to be part of it.\n  The risks that climate change poses for businesses have now \nincreased. In addition to the risk of unpredictable impacts of global \nwarming, and of unpredictable regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, \nAmerican companies now face the risk of being left out of the global \nmarketplace to buy and sell emission reductions.\n  While U.S. businesses are gaining experience with voluntary programs \nand are recognized as the world's experts in\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\nthis area, they are increasingly recognizing that purely voluntary \napproaches will not be enough to meet the goal of preventing dangerous \neffects on the climate system. Increasingly, businesses confronting \nthese risks see sensible regulation of carbon dioxide and other \ngreenhouse gases as necessary and inevitable. Clearly, they prefer the \ncap-and-trade approach.\n  In a July 23 editorial in the Wall Street Journal, a cap and trade \nprogram was discussed as one of the incentive-based market strategies \nthat has been developed as an alternative to traditional fiat-based, \n``nanny-sez-so'' regulation. The editorial further states that `` a cap \nand trade program will result in more abatement from those firms who \ncan do it at relatively lower costs and less abatement from those firms \nwho can only do it at relatively higher costs. The net will be the same \namount of overall pollution reduction, but achieved at lower cost than \nwould obtain under traditional regulation.''\n  As usual, industry is ahead of government in this area. Many \ncompanies have already started trading programs either within their \ncompany or as members of partnerships to meet pre-determined levels. \nNot only are these companies meeting their environmental goals, they \nare also realizing it on a profitable basis. We all know that improved \nefficiencies mean improved profitability.\n  The 1990 Clean Air Act's acid rain emissions trading program for \nlimiting sulfur dioxide has shown that there can be top-down limits on \npollutants and not endanger the economy. The key is unleashing the \npower of markets to find the most innovative, cost-effective ways of \nmeeting those top-down limits. That's what a cap-and-trade system does \nbest. Deploying the power of a marketplace to pursue the least \nexpensive answers is a unique and powerful American approach to the \nthreat of climate change.\n  In 1994, the Arizona Public Service (APS), an Arizona public utility, \nentered into an agreement with the Niagara Mohawk, a New York utility, \nand the US Department of Energy to swap carbon dioxide and sulfur \ndioxide credits. APS had reduced its sulfur dioxide emissions below \nlevels mandated under the 1990 Clean Air Act. Niagara Mohawk had \nreduced its carbon dioxide emissions below the level of its voluntary \ncommitment. APS exchanged its sulfur dioxide allowances issued under \nthe Clean Air Act's acid rain program for Niagara Mohawk carbon dioxide \nemissions reductions that APS could then use to help meet its \ncommitment to DOE to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. After receiving \nthe sulfur dioxide allowances, Niagara Mohawk donated them to an \nenvironmental organization to be retired. The cost savings achieved \nthrough this plan were used to fund new domestic and overseas projects \ndesigned to create additional carbon dioxide reductions.\n\n  However, we should not be deceiving ourselves. Designing a cap and \ntrade system is not an easy task. Critical decisions will have to be \nmade as to the design and implementation of such a system. These \ndecisions will ultimately affect some industries more than others. I \nwould hope that the government can work hand-in-hand with industry to \nmake this happen should a decision be made to pursue a cap and trade \nprogram.\n  A comprehensive cap on America's greenhouse gas emissions, paired \nwith an allowance trading system, can encourage innovation across the \nfull range of opportunities for reducing emissions. That would provide \nbusinesses with the regulatory certainty and flexibility they need to \nconfront the climate challenge successfully. Industry has repeatedly \nsaid that if Government sets the rules, they will take them from there \nand make it work.\n  Trading helps to establish a market value per unit of greenhouse gas. \nThis can be especially helpful as corporate decisions are made on major \ninvestments in new technologies. The market value will allow them to \nmake a real comparison by which to consider purchasing new credits for \nthe markets or investing in technologies and capital improvements.\n  We also have to recognize that the international system for \naddressing climate change is evolving. Only a few years ago, many of \nAmerica's trading partners were reluctant to accept market-based \nsolutions. But now they have embraced them, and the global marketplace \nfor greenhouse gas cap-and-trade is beginning. A national cap-and-trade \nsystem could give America the business valuable experience they will \nneed to remain competitive with other companies in countries where \ngreenhouse emissions trading is moving forward. We can expand trade \nopportunities through a new marketplace for the environment.\n  Given this developing international market, it also makes sense to \nensure that what we do domestically can be integrated and recognized on \nthe international level. Ultimately, we need to make sure that the \nemissions reductions our companies, our farmers, and our foresters \nproduce are fully recognized and fully tradable in the emerging global \ngreenhouse gas marketplace.\n  I think it is clear that a cap and trade program is a good idea \nworthy of further consideration by the U.S. Senate. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Lieberman and others who have expressed a \nwillingness to consider this type of approach to address this problem \nof global climate change.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to join my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, in advocating an economy-wide cap-and-trade \nsystem to control our emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  I have been extremely troubled by the failure of our government to \nengage on this crucial issue. Last Monday, 180 nations agreed to take \nhistoric action against global warming by agreeing to the Kyoto \nProtocol. One did not. We are the one. I believe this failure abdicates \nthe United States' position as a leader in environmental affairs and \nplaces U.S. industry at risk.\n  We now have general scientific agreement that climate change is a \nproblem we must face. Early this year, the United Nation's \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its Third Assessment \nReport on global warming. According to this panel of expert scientists, \nunless we find ways to stop global warming, the Earth's average \ntemperature can be expected to rise between 2.5 and 10.4 degrees \nFahrenheit during the next century. Such a large, rapid rise in \ntemperature will profoundly alter the Earth's landscape in very \npractical terms. Sea levels could swell up to 35 feet, potentially \nsubmerging millions of homes and coastal property under our present-day \noceans. Precipitation could become more erratic, leading to droughts \nthat would aggravate the task of feeding the world's population. \nDiseases such as malaria and dengue fever could spread at an \naccelerated pace. Severe weather disturbances and storms triggered by \nclimatic phenomena, such as El Nino, could become more routine.\n  As the IPCC report reminds us, this threat is being driven by our own \nbehavior. Let me quote the scientists directly, ``There is new and \nstronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 50 \nyears is attributable to human activities.'' There is no doubt that \nhuman-induced emissions are warming the planet.\n  After receiving the IPCC's dire report, the White House requested and \nreceived a second opinion from the National Academy of Sciences. The \nNAS confirmed the findings of the IPCC. Let me quote:\n\n       The IPCC's conclusion that most of the observed warming of \n     the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase \n     in greenhouse gas concentrations accurately reflects the \n     current thinking of the scientific community on this issue . \n     . . . Despite the uncertainties, there is general agreement \n     that the observed warming is real and particularly strong \n     within the past twenty years.\n\n  By going forward with the Kyoto Protocol even without the United \nStates, the world has taken a giant stride forward in response to this \npressing problem. That agreement will create a worldwide market in \ngreenhouse gas reductions, using market forces to drive environmental \ngains. Unfortunately, because the United States did not participate, \nU.S. interests were virtually ignored in crafting the final deal. In \nthe end, I believe that not just our environment but our economy will \nsuffer as a result.\n  For example, let's say a multinational corporation is faced with the \nneed to invest in new, more efficient technology, and has the choice of \ninstalling it in the United States or overseas. Under the Kyoto \nProtocol, the corporation will be able to receive valuable credits for \nmaking those efficiency gains--and therefore reducing\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\nits greenhouse gas emissions. Those credits will be worth cold, hard \ncash in the world market that will be established under the treaty. In \ncontrast, the United States currently has no system by which the \ncompany will gain credit for the gains. The result will be that more \nefficient, more competitive technology will be driven overseas.\n\n  The agreement in Bonn also has probably made millions of dollars in \nU.S. investment worthless. A number of our large corporations have \ninvested heavily in forest conservation on the assumption that they \nwould receive credit for these forests' ability to pull carbon out of \nthe atmosphere. In Bonn, however--without the U.S. at the table--credit \nfor forest conservation was written out of the agreement.\n  After the agreement at Bonn, it will take a lot of work to convince \nthe other nations of the world to reopen the negotiations to U.S. \nparticipation.\n  We can begin by creating a credible domestic system that can work in \nparallel with the Kyoto Protocol so the United States remains in tune \nwith the remainder of the world as we move forward. Such an approach \nmust move beyond our laudable but inadequate voluntary efforts. As we \nsaw with the Rio Treaty, which former President Bush supported and the \nSenate ratified in 1992, voluntary programs unfortunately do not work. \nInstead, Senator McCain and I believe that we need a set of standards \nrequiring action. We need an economy-wide cap and trade approach. In \ncontrast to the current international agreement, such a system will \ntake the interests of the United States into account.\n  I also believe having such a system in place will much better enable \nus to negotiate an acceptable international agreement with the Kyoto \nparticipants when the U.S. does come back to the table. If we do not \nhave our own domestic cap-and-trade system, our companies will be years \nbehind the rest of the world in operating within the system and \ntherefore disadvantaged when we join an international agreement.\n  The bona-fides of a cap and trade approach are impressive. I was \ninvolved in the drafting of the cap-and-trade program in the Clean Air \nAct to reduce acid rain--one of the most successful environmental \nprograms on the books. Recent reports from the CBO and the Resources \nfor the Future espoused such an approach. Progressive companies such as \nBritish Petroleum have greatly reduced their greenhouse emissions by \nusing their own internal cap-and-trade markets. And no less authority \nthan the Wall Street Journal has endorsed such an approach to address \nour climate problems, stating that the Bush Administration should \n``propose a domestic cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide that \ncould, of course, be easily expanded to Canada and Mexico.'' It would \nbe a giant step forward if the Bush Administration would make such a \nproposal to the next international meeting on climate change in \nMarrakesh, Morocco during October.\n  If we adopt a cap and trade system, we will create a market by which \ncorporations will receive valuable credits for efficient investments. \nWe also will create a market by which corporations can receive credit \nfor the laudable investments they have made to date. And we will \nunleash the power of that market to drive the United States back into \nits leadership position in the international effort to avoid the worst \neffects of one of the most serious environmental problems the world \ncommunity has ever faced.\n  I look forward to working with Senator McCain when we return in \nSeptember as we meet with environmentalists and representatives of the \nvarious sectors of our economy who are currently generating greenhouse \ngases. We will ask them to help us fashion a cap and trade system that \nwill work.\n  Together we can and will meet this historic test and protect our \nchildren and grandchildren, and all who follow on the Earth, from the \nreal dangers of an overheated planet.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the Wall Street \nJournal editorials in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            Review & Outlook\n\n\n                         Emissions Impossible?\n\n       While Genoa burned--a topic we take up at greater length in \n     the space below--bureaucrats in Bonn continued to fiddle with \n     a dead treaty, the Kyoto Protocol on global warming. Japan \n     and Europe appear more determined than ever to resuscitate \n     the treaty without the United States. At the risk of sounding \n     flippant, we ask: Why bother?\n       The whole idea behind Kyoto is puzzling at best, outrageous \n     at worst. Why require the nations of this planet to spend the \n     hundreds of billions of dollars necessary to reduce carbon \n     dioxide and other emissions when we don't even know if the \n     earth's climate is getting permanently hotter or if that \n     temperature change is caused by human activity or if that \n     change is even dangerous?\n       Why, indeed. Except that if new and more sophisticated \n     research proves that human-generated greenhouse gases are a \n     menace to civilization as we know it, then it is better to \n     start now to control them and far better to do so in the most \n     cost effective fashion. And that's why we harbor a certain \n     fondness for one part of the Kyoto treaty--emissions trading.\n       Emissions trading--part of a package called ``cap-and-\n     trade''--is one of the incentive-based market strategies that \n     has been developed as an alternative to traditional fiat-\n     based, nanny-sez-so regulation. The idea is simple: a lower \n     level of pollution is agreed upon and targeted; permits \n     reflecting that level are issued, or even sold, to polluters; \n     firms that produce emissions below their targets can sell \n     their excess permits to firms that exceed their targets. \n     Firms have a straightforward incentive to come up with \n     emission-reducing innovations because they can keep the \n     financial rewards of their innovation through reduced \n     abatement costs, reduced payments for emission permits and/or \n     selling unneeded permits.\n       Thus, by providing flexibility and financial incentives, \n     cap-and-trade program will result in more abatement from \n     those firms who can do it at relatively lower cost and less \n     abatement from those firms who can only do it at relatively \n     higher cost. The net will be the same amount of overall \n     pollution reduction, but achieved at lower cost than would \n     obtain under traditional regulation.\n       And cost is really mega-important. Consider the tab if--as \n     mandated by Kyoto--the U.S. had to reduce its carbon dioxide \n     emissions 7% below its 1990 levels by 2012. Without the \n     ability to buy permits from other countries, compliance would \n     have to be achieved mainly by switching from coal-fired \n     plants to natural gas plants, resulting in the premature \n     retirement of tens of billions of dollars of capital stock, \n     the zooming of energy costs throughout the economy, and the \n     loss of millions of jobs. According to the Energy Information \n     Administration, the cost could be as much as 4% of GDP.\n       Now, however, consider the cost if the U.S. could meet its \n     targets by buying permits from other countries. In a scenario \n     offered back in 1998 by the Clinton Administration's Council \n     of Economic Advisors, if the U.S. buys permits for its \n     ``excess'' emissions--so that if doesn't have to reduce by \n     very much its own emissions--the cost would be only 10% of \n     GDP.\n       If you doubt these estimates--and we agree that the models \n     they are based on are technically complex--then how about a \n     real-life example? Look no further than the fabulously \n     successful cap-and-trade program for sulfur dioxide. The \n     program, which was started in the U.S. in 1995 as part of the \n     effort to cut the emissions that cause acid rain, saves about \n     $700 million annually compared with the cost of traditional \n     regulation and has been reducing emissions by four million \n     tons annually. When the program is fully implemented, \n     sometime over the next couple of years, cost savings should \n     be as much as $2 billion a year--that's twice as much as \n     originally estimated by the EPA.\n       In fact, the idea of emissions trading to reduce pollution \n     has proved so attractive that some firms--which are under no \n     legal obligation to cut greenhouses gases--have begun to set \n     up programs for internal trading of permits. For firms \n     interested in external trading, there are already several \n     ``precompliance'' markets where permits can be traded across \n     companies and across national borders.\n       So, who needs Kyoto? While whatever number of government \n     bureaucrats are filling the air in Bonn with carbon dioxide, \n     the private sector is going ahead with its own cap-and-trade \n     solutions. Not surprisingly, European leaders would rather \n     bureaucrats control the ebb and flow of private sector \n     emissions and have bad mouthed cap-and-trade proposals in the \n     past. Recently, however, even the Euros are beginning to see \n     the light.,\n       President Bush got it exactly right when he dissed Kyoto. \n     And after Kyoto is pronounced dead in Bonn, the Bush \n     Administration should propose a domestic cap-and-trade \n     program for carbon dioxide that could, of course, be easily \n     expanded to Canada and Mexico. And then to Latin America. And \n     then the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8896-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8896-S8897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ARSENIC IN RURAL WATER SUPPLIES\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday the Senate passed the \nAppropriations bill funding the Environmental Protection Agency and \nother departments. I have grave concerns about a provision in that \nbill, the amendment adopted by the Senate that directs the EPA \nAdministrator to establish a new national primary drinking water \nregulation for arsenic. This is a slight\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\nmodification from the House version of this bill, which requires the \nAdministrator to establish this standard at the level set by the \nprevious administration--10 parts per billion. While the Senate \nlanguage is not that specific, I still have grave concerns over the \ndirection Congress is heading on this issue.\n  I understand that 59 public water systems in Alaska, most of which \nare in rural villages, have naturally occurring, background levels of \narsenic in their water supplies that substantially exceed the 10 parts \nper billion standard. If Congress imposes this standard or a similar \none on these villages, they will need nearly twenty million dollars to \npurchase modern, high-tech water treatment facilities. This is money \nthat will otherwise be spent on their more immediate water and sewer \nneeds, including safe wastewater systems. We are moving many rural \nvillages off of honey buckets, but many people on the haul system still \nhave to cart their own untreated wastewater from their homes to local \ncollection bins, where it lies until the city takes it to a sewage \nlagoon on the outskirts of town. I know of one village in rural Alaska \nwhere a young girl was playing near one of these wastewater collection \nbins when she scratched at a mosquito bite. She developed a bacterial \ninfection and later died. We are making good progress towards getting \nher village on to a safe, centralized water and wastewater system. \nCongress should allow areas without reliable sanitary water supplies to \naddress those needs before turning to the relative luxury of removing a \nfew parts per billion of naturally-occurring arsenic. I invite any \nSenator who disagrees with me to join me on a trip to rural Alaska \nwhere they can see these challenges first hand.\n  I can foresee another unanticipated consequence of a national arsenic \nstandard applied in rural Alaska. There are no toxic waste facilities \navailable to process the arsenic after it is taken out of the water. We \ncan not drive it away because these villages are not on the road \nsystem. The arsenic will end up in the local landfill on the edge of \ntown, next to the sewage lagoon. Like a lot of other things that end up \nin the landfill, the wind will blow it around town, where it will end \nup in homes and schools. This arsenic may do far more harm to people in \nrural Alaska than if we were to just leave it alone.\n  I intend to seek a modification in conference that will recognize the \npractical problems of forcing a national standard on the most remote, \nrural areas of the country. We should not turn away from the most \npressing sanitation needs in order to impose an unfunded mandate on \nrural areas, especially one that may result in a greater health risk \nthan the one we are trying to address.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8897-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8897-S8898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF PAUL R. CAREY\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to draw the attention of the \nSenate to the recent passing of Paul R. Carey, an extraordinary public \nservant and New Yorker who died on June 14th at the age of 38 after a \nlong battle with cancer.\n  Paul Carey was a Commissioner of the United States Securities and \nExchange Commission at the time of his death. Previously, he served in \nthe Clinton White House as Special Assistant to the President for \nLegislative Affairs, and before that as Finance Director for the \nnortheastern United States for the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign.\n  Commissioner Carey was a scion of a great New York family whose \npatriarch is my friend and political hero, the distinguished former \nGovernor of New York, Hugh L. Carey.\n  The loss of Paul Carey at such an early age was a blow to the causes \nhe fought for as an SEC Commissioner and White House official, and of \ncourse to his loving family and his literally thousands of friends, who \nmourned him at a mass of Christian burial at St. Patrick's Cathedral in \nNew York on June 18th, and celebrated his life at a memorial service \nhere in Washington on July 25th. Governor Carey and his family honored \nthis Senator by asking me to participate in the memorial service, which \nwas a wondrous event whose other celebrants included former SEC \nChairman Arthur Levitt; Senator CLINTON; former President Clinton; \nGovernor Carey; and an audience of hundreds of colleagues, Members of \nthe Senate and the House of Representatives, and other loved ones.\n  All of the remembrances shared at the memorial service were special \nand poignant, but none could have been more moving or inspiring than \nthe remarks of Paul's father, Governor Carey. He told the uplifting \nstory of the life of a truly gallant young man.\n  I ask unanimous consent that excerpts of Governor Carey's remarkable \nstatement be printed in the Record. And on behalf of the Senate, I \nextend our thoughts and prayers to the Carey family on the loss of \ntheir beloved Paul.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Excerpts From Remarks by Former Governor Hugh L. Carey\n\n       This extended gathering of Paul's family, both the Carey \n     family and his extended family in public service, has been a \n     wonderful tribute to Paul. On behalf of our family, I would \n     like to thank Rev. Coughlin, President Clinton, Senators \n     Clinton and Schumer, Arthur Levitt, Jim Molloy, Mark \n     Patterson, Janet Howard and the many great friends who were \n     responsible for this day of remembrance--and it is, we feel, \n     a celebration, with no remorse, no regret.\n       When he was about 3 years old, Paul showed signs of the \n     peripatetic propensity he would continue throughout his life. \n     After finding that he was wandering to the neighbors' houses \n     at all hours, his mother fastened a small cowbell to a soft \n     ribbon around his neck. So it became the custom in our house \n     to listen for the bell and to ask, ``where's Paul?''\n       Over the years, Paul's whereabouts gave us some concern but \n     even greater satisfaction. When we took summer vacations, \n     while others took lessons in swimming and waterskiing, he \n     would accompany his mother to Camp Shelter Island, \n     volunteering with disabled teens and adults. Summer after \n     summer, he began to learn, and to show us, his great capacity \n     to help others.\n       In 1973, Paul's mother--who was then waging her own battle \n     with the illness that was to take her the next spring, and \n     later Paul--was eager to see the family under one roof. She \n     decreed that the Congressional career had separated us too \n     often. By agreement, we decided to give up Congress for an \n     office that would give the family a home. So we committed, \n     against all odds, to the race for Governor of New York.\n       It was in that 1974 campaign that Paul's appetite and zeal \n     for his avocation--campaigning--started to shine. He and his \n     11 brothers and sisters took to the road in a Winnebago, \n     bringing the Carey campaign message to county fairs all \n     summer long. And he never stopped reminding me that of the 62 \n     counties in New York State, I carried all but the one I had \n     to canvass on my own after sending my children back to school \n     in the fall.\n       Later, after his graduation from Colgate, Paul embarked on \n     a career in finance. I rejoiced in the thought that my \n     future comfort was assured by the prospect of a string of \n     successful IPO's. But after he faced his initial surgery \n     and the prospect of a life-threatening illness, he was \n     determined to pursue a life in public service. When he \n     told me he was offered a fundraising position in a \n     national campaign, I tried to steer him away, but \n     swallowed my initial advice when I saw his great \n     enthusiasm and success. Indeed, he did an outstanding job \n     in that role, as the northeast finance director for the \n     Clinton-Gore campaign in 1992, and President Clinton has \n     recounted for you how pivotal Paul's help was at a time \n     when it was needed most.\n       And when that victory was won, Paul took his passion for \n     public service to the White House. There, he astounded \n     everyone but himself with his accomplishments at the command \n     center of the greatest country in the world. He mastered \n     legislative detail and created relationships on Capitol Hill \n     that would help his President and his administration achieve \n     the most sweeping fiscal reform and debt reduction package \n     since Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson.\n       Then suddenly, one Christmas, his life was suddenly and \n     cataclysmically threatened by the returning disease. But, to \n     our family's lasting gratitude, the brilliant surgeon Dr. \n     Murray Brennan and the medical team at Memorial Sloan-\n     Kettering Cancer Center saved Paul's life and gave him the \n     gift of time. And we will always be especially grateful to \n     Dr. Jim Dougherty, who cared for Paul for more than 5 years \n     since then and worked with him to battle each successive \n     phase of the illness while enabling Paul to live his life to \n     the fullest.\n       I remember that critical time so clearly, not only because \n     we almost lost Paul that winter, but because I saw a strength \n     and determination in my son that I had never known. One \n     morning, after his surgery, when I visited his room and saw \n     that he was apparently asleep, under heavy sedation, I told \n     Paul's sister that I was about to leave for Albany for the \n     state of the State address. Paul suddenly awoke, sat up, and \n     said clearly and adamantly: ``When you get to Albany, you \n     tell them that we put money in the budget for research and \n     teaching hospitals and they'd better be sure they don't cut \n     it.'' I\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\n     took my orders, went to Albany, and carried Paul's message to \n     the legislature.\n       Although Paul would continue to battle illness over the \n     next 5\\1/2\\ years, he would do it on his own terms. He made a \n     deal with Dr. Dougherty, to structure his treatments around \n     his work schedule. When he became a Commissioner of the SEC, \n     he waged a spirited battle for the least powerful, individual \n     investor, and never let his illness impair his commitment to \n     that work.\n       He would sometimes have to travel to the Netherlands, to \n     take powerful treatments, but he would combine those trips \n     with visits to friends at European Embassies, or tours with \n     his brothers and sisters through France and Italy.\n       Among his most memorable journeys was the White House \n     delegation's trip to Ireland last winter, where he and I were \n     privileged to join President Clinton as he made a farewell \n     visit to the country he had guided toward peace.\n       And this spring we had the honor to attend the investiture \n     of new Cardinals by his Holiness Pope John Paul II. On that \n     trip, we visited many glorious and deeply religious sites, \n     including the Basilica of his namesake, Saint Paul.\n       And although we mark today his passing into eternal life, \n     we repeat our belief that today is a joyous remembrance, with \n     no remorse or regret.\n       And there is no need to ask now, ``Where's Paul?'' Because \n     today we celebrate Paul's Homecoming. We know where Paul is, \n     he's in his mother's arms.\n       And now that Paul's ascendancy is complete, I wonder if \n     when he arrived at the Heavenly Gate, perhaps St. Peter had \n     gone fishing as was his custom, and that day St. Paul may \n     have been there to greet him.\n       If so, Paul may have had a chance to ask a question he had \n     long pondered: When St. Paul wrote to the Romans and the \n     Colossians and the Corinthians, did they ever write back?\n       But before he'd answer, St. Paul might say, I have a \n     question for you: ``Did you bring your Rolodex?''\n       ``Why,'' Paul would ask, ``Would you want my Rolodex?''\n       And St. Paul would answer, ``If it contains the names of \n     all the people you helped, and the people who helped you, \n     that's a list we want to have!''\n       So if you were in Paul's Rolodex, you're halfway to Heaven!\n       And you can count on us to be there with you, until we all \n     make it the rest of the way. Thank you and God bless you!\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to join the senior Senator from \nNew York, Mr. Schumer, in paying tribute to the late Paul R. Carey. I \nwas also honored to have been invited to speak at the memorial service \nfor Paul here in Washington last week, and I wish every Senator could \nhave been there to share in the outpouring of emotion and affection for \nthis wonderful young man. My husband and I knew Paul Carey well and we \nconsidered him a dear friend. Paul made many important contributions to \nPresident Clinton's work in the White House, and he remained a close \nfriend after he left the White House to become a Commissioner of the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission. He touched so many of us with his \nwonderfully passionate attitude toward life and his truly special gift \nfor friendship. I join Senator Schumer in paying tribute to Paul Carey, \nand in expressing condolences to Governor Carey, to Paul's 11 brothers \nand sisters, and to his many friends. He was a great New Yorker and we \nwill never forget him.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senators from New York, Mr. \nSchumer and Mrs. Clinton, for their statements about Paul Carey. I also \nknew Paul and his work, both at the SEC and at the White House, and I \njoin the Senators from New York in expressing condolences to his \ndistinguished father, Governor Hugh Carey, and to the rest of Paul's \nfamily and many friends. He was a fine public servant and a fine man, \nand he will be sorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8898-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SALUTE TO JIM GOODNIGHT AND HIS ASSOCIATES AT SAS INSTITUTE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, this Nation was founded on the principle of \nfreedom and, needless to say, America's free enterprise system is the \nhallmark of our Founding Fathers' economic vision. The news on \ntelevision and in the newspapers report remarkable success stories, \nand, indeed, our Nation's most notable businesses were founded by men \nand women who had the ideas and the vision, and the courage to convert \nthose visions into incredible successes.\n  Those of us blessed to live in North Carolina are proud of our \nState's history of business successes, citizens like Buck Duke who \ndeveloped a system to roll tobacco, William Henry Belk, the amazing \nmerchant, whose Main Street sidewalk in Monroe grew into a chain of \nhigh-end department stores. There are countless others whose vision and \nfaith in the free enterprise system made North Carolina one of the \nleading states in which to do business.\n  Now then, it's an honor to salute another remarkable North Carolinian \nwho has fulfilled the principles of the free enterprise system and \nthereby developed the largest privately-held software company in the \nworld which, by the way, is headquartered in Cary, NC. SAS Institute, \nas it is known, was co-founded and now co-owned by James H. Goodnight \nand John P. Sall in 1976. Today their dream and wisdom ranks as one of \nNorth Carolina's largest employers.\n  This remarkable enterprise was born following a research grant from \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture to several universities which were \nseeking new ways to analyze enormous volumes of agricultural data. A \nresult of this grant was the development of the Statistical Analysis \nSystem from which SAS takes its name. The customer list of SAS is \nreplete with the vast majority of the Fortune 100 companies, plus all \n14 Federal Government departments now use software developed by SAS. \nSAS software is used by customers in more than 111 countries around the \nworld. It has vast overseas operations which are based in Heidelberg.\n  I could go on and on reciting the SAS company's business successes \nbut when you get down to it SAS is a reflection of its leadership. It \nis important to note the innovation of Dr. Goodnight, the distinguished \nChairman and Chief Executive Officer who has created one of the most \ndesirable workplace environments in America.\n  For example, Jim Goodnight had the forethought to create an on-site \nchildcare center back in 1981 and SAS has an extensive medical facility \nproviding healthcare for all of its associates on its campus. As a \nresult of such creative and family friendly innovations SAS has one of \nthe lowest personnel turnover rates in the industry; moreover SAS has \nbeen justifiably praised nationally by countless publications such as \nWorking Mother, Fortune and Business Week.\n  SAS's longstanding commitment to its community, its State and the \nworld is evidenced by its significant contributions to multiple \ncharitable organizations which focus on education and technology.\n  Jim Goodnight took his personal commitment to education further by \nestablishing a world-class independent co-educational college \npreparatory day school, which is a model for integrating technology \ninto all facets of education.\n  Its vast campus might easily be confused for that of a major \nuniversity.\n  As the SAS Institute marks its silver anniversary, it's an honor, \nindeed a privilege to join other friends across North Carolina in \nsaluting this remarkable corporate citizen, the great leader, Dr. Jim \nGoodnight, on his incredible 25 years. Jim Goodnight's sound business \npractices, his adherence to the principles of the free enterprise \nsystem, together guarantee another remarkable 25 years for this great \nNorth Carolina business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8898-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8898-S8899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GUNS AND TEEN SUICIDE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we often rise on this floor to speak on the \nsubject of gun violence and what we can do to prevent it. The debate \nfrequently centers on how we can keep guns out of the hands of \ncriminals and what penalty is appropriate for using a gun to commit a \ncrime. While the importance of these debates cannot be overstated, \nthese discussions all too often ignore a second related and equally \nimportant issue--gun-related suicide.\n  According to statistics from the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun \nViolence, most gun deaths in America are not the result of murder, but \nsuicide. The numbers are particularly shocking for young people. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1993 \nthrough 1997, an average of 1,409 young people took their own lives \nwith guns each year. The connection between access to guns and suicide \nis particularly strong. In fact, The Brady Campaign reports that the \npresence of a gun in the home increases the risk of suicide fivefold.\n  While this problem cannot simply be legislated away, trigger locks \nand\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\nother sensible gun safety measures can help limit children's access to \nfirearms. It is clear that reducing our kids' access to guns can save \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8899-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PROTECTING AGAINST WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again state my strong \nsupport for legislation that increases access to post conviction DNA \ntesting.\n  Our judicial system has numerous safeguards in place to help protect \nagainst wrongful convictions of innocent people. The presumption that a \nperson is innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt is one \nof many protections our judicial system provides to protect against \nwrongful convictions. Rights to appeal criminal convictions are another \nexample.\n  Despite these many protections, I recognize that wrongful \nconvictions, unfortunately, do occur. In my view, we must continuously \nexamine our judicial system to determine if new protections are \navailable to ensure that individuals are not imprisoned for crimes they \ndid not commit.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, we need look no further than the \nEarl Washington case to understand that individuals can be convicted of \ncrimes they did not commit. Washington, a mentally retarded man, spent \nmore than a decade on death row after being convicted for the 1982 rape \nand murder of 19-year-old Rebecca Williams.\n  In 1994, Governor Wilder commuted Washington's sentence to life in \nprison as a result of DNA test results. Since 1994, more sophisticated \nDNA tests became available, and these tests proved conclusively that \nWashington did not commit the rape and murder. As a result, last year, \nGovernor Gilmore granted Washington a full pardon for this conviction. \nSubsequently, the Virginia General Assembly unanimously passed \nlegislation signed into law by Governor Gilmore that allows for inmate \naccess to post conviction DNA testing.\n  Certainly, Earl Washington's case is not unique to Virginia. Wrongful \nconvictions occur in both Federal and State courts all across the \ncountry. The Washington case, however, makes clear to me that post \nconviction DNA testing must be made more available.\n  Over the last few years, DNA testing has proved to be a reliable \nmeans for identifying criminals when biological evidence exists. While \nDNA testing is standard in today's investigations, such technology was \nnot available even a decade ago. DNA is more and more frequently used \nby prosecutors to prove guilt. In my view, it should also be made \navailable to prove innocence. Access to post conviction DNA testing, in \ncircumstances where DNA evidence can prove innocence, is of utmost \nimportance to the administration of justice.\n  In addition to increasing access to DNA testing, we must look at \nother ways to improve the administration of justice in our system. The \nJustice Project, a national non-profit organization focusing on \nidentifying and solving issues of fairness in our judicial system, \nreports that since 1973, 95 people have been exonerated and released \nfrom death row. Of those 95 wrongful convictions, only 10 were \ndiscovered as a result of DNA testing. Thus, while access to DNA \nevidence is one new, important component that we must pursue to protect \nagainst wrongful convictions, it cannot be the only avenue we pursue.\n  We have all read or heard about the horrific cases where individuals \nare convicted and sentenced to death after a trial where the defense \nattorney slept through portions of the case, was inexperienced in death \npenalty cases, or failed to even interview important witnesses. Such \nincompetency on the part of a defense attorney undoubtedly results in \nsome wrongful convictions.\n  Certainly, convicted defendants may appeal their conviction to a \nhigher court based on the assertion that they were denied a \nconstitutional right to effective assistance of counsel. However, I \nbelieve that our system, particularly in the highly complex capital \npunishment cases, can do a better job at ensuring effective assistance \nof counsel prior the time a case gets the appellate level.\n  In this regard, I share the views of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor, who, in a recent speech, stated that perhaps it's time to \nlook at the minimum standards for appointed counsel in death cases and \nadequate compensation for appointed counsel when they are used.\n  Increasing access to post conviction DNA testing, and undertaking a \ncloser examination of the issue of national, minimum standards for \nappointed counsel in death penalty cases, are two steps in the right \ndirection to improving our judicial system and further protecting \nagainst wrongful convictions.\n  My colleague, Senator Leahy, has joined with Senator Gordon Smith and \nSenator Collins in introducing legislation that improves access to post \nconviction DNA testing and provides for minimum standards for appointed \ncounsel in death penalty cases. Today, I am pleased to join as a \ncosponsor of this important legislation, S. 486, the Innocence \nProtection Act.\n  While I do believe that some technical improvements can be made to \nthe Innocence Protection Act, I support its overall goal of additional, \nreasonable, protections against wrongful convictions.\n  Specifically, the Innocence Protection Act contains provisions \nrelating to habeas corpus reform. Under the bill, prisoners in States \nthat do not adopt appointed counsel minimum competency standards will \nbe subject to differing habeas corpus rules than prisoners in States \nwhich have adopted such standards. In my view, habeas corpus reform is \noutside the scope of this legislation, and the issue ought to be \nthoroughly examined by the Judiciary Committee and addressed in \nseparate legislation.\n  In addition, the Innocence Protection Act directs the Attorney \nGeneral to withhold a portion of the funds awarded under the prison \ngrant programs from death penalty States that have not established or \nmaintained a system for providing legal representation in capital cases \nthat satisfy the standards called for by this bill. In my view, a more \nappropriate way to encourage States to adopt minimum competency \nstandards would be through awarding new grant money for those States \nthat adopt such standards.\n  Nevertheless, despite these differences, the goal of the Innocence \nProtection Act is an important one. I look forward to working with the \nsponsors of this legislation on these concerns, and look forward to \nworking for passage of legislation that will further protect against \nwrongful convictions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8899-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN HONOR OF PURPLE HEART MEDAL RECIPIENTS\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize those \nveterans who have earned the Purple Heart Medal. My own State of \nMinnesota has recently decided to designate August 7, 2001 as a day to \nhonor these veterans.\n  The Purple Heart Medal was created by General George Washington and \nfirst awarded to soldiers who were wounded as a result of actions by an \nenemy of the United States. General Washington established the award on \nAugust 7, 1782. The Purple Heart Medal is still awarded to members of \nour Nation's armed forces who are wounded while protecting our Nation \nand democracy.\n  Our Government issues several medals to soldiers for bravery, good \nconduct and efficiency. However, the Purple Heart Medal is unique in \nthe fact that a soldier who is awarded this medal received a wound as a \nresult of hostile actions by an enemy of our Nation. As a U.S. Senator \nand a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I have had the \nopportunity to personally thank many of the Purple Heart Medal \nrecipients in the State of Minnesota for the sacrifice they made for \nour Nation and democracy. I believe that every recipient of this \ndistinguished award should also receive appropriate acknowledgment from \nthe Senate.\n  I invite all members of the Senate to join me and urge all 50 States \nto hold appropriate ceremonies to honor their Purple Heart Medal \nrecipients.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8899-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8899-S8900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WE NEED A DRUG CZAR\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in the last several days, I have \nreceived a copy of the most recent PRIDE survey of youth drug use in \nthis country. The numbers are not encouraging. In fact, the numbers \nover the last several years\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\nhave not been encouraging. Drug use among teenagers since 1992 has \nrisen sharply. This is true for use of more traditional drugs, like \nheroin. It is true for the newer or more recently popular designer \ndrugs, like meth and now ecstasy.\n  I have spoken about these trends frequently here and in hearings. The \nCaucus on International Narcotics Control, which I co-chair, has held a \nnumber of hearings on these dangerous trends and their consequences. No \none who is familiar with the details can be anything but concerned \nabout what is happening. No one that is except those who seek to \nlegalize drugs in our society and make them even more available than \nthey now are.\n  The legalizers, of course, do not admit that this is their intent. \nBut it is like the old magician's trick, watch the birdie. They cloak \ntheir efforts to legalize with various disguises. They want marijuana \nfor sick people. They want treatment not prisons. They want compassion \nnot punishment. But it's an old game. It's just a variation on the \nuseful lie: I am for a good cause so I don't have to be honest. Well, \nas the old saying has it, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice \nshame on me.\n  And they are trying to fool people again. The goal this time is to \nstop the nomination of John Walters to be the nation's drug czar. Their \neffort is a purely cynical one trying to portray Mr. Walters as some \nkind of stone age, Neanderthal throwback who is out of step with the \nneeds of real drug policy. But the policy they really advocate is to \nmake drugs more widely available. What they object to is that Mr. \nWalters does not accept that. So they have begun a campaign to impugn \nhis character, misstate his views, and misrepresent the facts and their \nown goals. They do not want strong leadership on this issue.\n  They are trying to portray Mr. Walters as a total supply side \nadvocate who cares nothing about treatment or prevention. They are \nrelying on the hope that people will read what they have to say about \nhis record rather than look at his record. Remember, watch the birdie. \nThey hope to block his nomination in order not to help stop drug use \nbut to clear the way for their efforts to legalize.\n  The main voices against him have come from groups funded by \nbillionaire advocates for drug legalization. It is coming from a number \nof journals and organizations that are on record favoring drug \nlegalization. They would have us believe that their motive for opposing \nthe President's candidate to be the drug czar is out of concern for \ntreatment and prevention. This is like the wolf expecting Little Red \nRiding Hood to believe it is really grandma in the bed.\n  Some facts. When Mr. Walters was the chief of staff for Bill Bennett, \nthe first Drug Czar, Walters was a key player in helping to ensure that \nwe had a serious demand reduction effort as part of our policy. In the \nBush years, demand reduction resources doubled. In 4 years of that \nadministration, the rate of funding for demand was higher than in the 8 \nyears of the last administration. Mr. Walters was a player in making \nthat happen in the first Bush administration. It is true he spoke out a \nlot on supply reduction. That too was part of the President's strategy \nand he was responsible for helping to implement that as well. He also \nbecame the Deputy Director for Supply at ONDCP. It was his job to speak \non these issues. There was a Demand Deputy. It was his job to speak on \ndemand issues. You will not find a lot of supply talk in Dr. Kleber's \npublic comments. As the demand guru it wasn't the focus of his job. You \nwon't find a lot of demand comments in Mr. Walters' statements. Why do \nyou think that is?\n\n  In the years after he left ONDCP, Mr. Walers made numerous public \nstatements. Many of these were before Congress. He was asked by \ncommittees in Congress responsible for dealing with supply issues to \nspeak on them. Is it any wonder that most of those concern supply \nreduction? It isn't a mystery, but, remember, watch the birdie.\n  Let's be clear. The objection to Mr. Walters is not that he is a \nsupply sider or a hawk on demand. It is that he believes we need a \nserious drug policy that is comprehensive. That is what Congress wants \nand funds. The President has made it clear that that is what he wants \nand expects. It's the President's policy. As a member of the \nPresident's Cabinet, Mr. Walters will be a strong voice, a forceful \nadvocate. We need that. The major demand groups in this country \nrecognize that and support him.\n  Mr. Walters is not a drug legalizer. He is a man committed to \nstopping the flow of illegal drugs across our borders and into our \nschools and neighborhoods. He is committed to prevention and effective \ntreatment. He has children of his own. He is determined to help protect \nthem in their schools from the drug pushers among us. He cares \npassionately about this issue.\n  That is why I believe the Senate needs to move quickly on his \nnomination. We need leadership. We need commitment. We need passion. \nMr. Walters can supply those needs in working with Congress to \naccomplish a common goal. The only people who benefit from blocking \nthis nomination are the legalizers. We should not become their \nunwitting allies.\n  I support this nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me. It is \nlate in the year. The August recess is almost upon us. We need to give \nMr. Walters a speedy hearing and a quick confirmation so that he can \nget about the Nation's business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8900-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8900-S8901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JOHN WALTERS NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to encourage my colleagues \nto expedite the nomination of John Walters to be Director of the Office \nof National Drug Control Policy, ONDCP.\n  We continue to be faced with a major drug problem in America. Drugs \nare easily available and kids are using them.\n  While I believe that we must address the supply of drugs coming into \nthis country, I believe that true achievement can only come from within \nour Nation.\n  We must decrease the demand for drugs in America before our efforts \nto stop the flow of drugs can gain any measure of success.\n  The real challenge is developing a multifaceted approach to move us \ndown the road to substantial reduction in drug use.\n  According to the University of Michigan, ``Monitoring the Future'' \nsurvey, that has tested students for 20 years, for 12 years under the \nReagan and Bush administrations, drug use went down every single year. \n(University of Michigan, ``Monitoring the Future Study,'' 1999.)\n  This was done through a commitment to energizing our Nation as a \nwhole against this threat. Parents, educators, law enforcement \nofficials, business and community leaders, and the media were all \nenlisted to create a climate of intolerance.\n  As a Federal prosecutor in Mobile, AL, during these years, I am proud \nto say that I participated in this effort.\n  Unfortunately, when the Clinton-Gore administration took office, \nthings began to change. When President Clinton appeared on MTV and \njoked about whether or not he inhaled marijuana by saying ``Maybe I \nwish I had,'' he began to erode the leadership by example that is the \ncrucial first step in the war against drugs.\n  When President Clinton nominated people who did not carry out a tough \ndrug policy this further weakened the message to our children and to \ndrug criminals regarding the importance of the war on drugs.\n  After taking office, the Clinton-Gore Administration all but \neliminated the Drug Czar's office, slashing the number of employees \nfrom 146 to 25.\n  It is not a surprise that the same University of Michigan study that \nshowed the gains we made during the Reagan-Bush years, showed that drug \nuse had steadily risen among our youth during the Clinton-Gore years.\n  According to the Monitoring the Future Study, since 1992: overall \ndrug use among 10th graders increased 55 percent. Marijuana and hashish \nuse among 10th graders increased 91 percent; heroin use among 10th \ngraders increased 92 percent; cocaine use among 10th graders increased \n133 percent.\n  Except for a slight decline in 2000, drug use generally increased \nduring the Clinton-Gore administration.\n  If we are going to make real progress in combating drug use in \nAmerica, we must return to the key concepts of leadership by example, \ntough law enforcement initiatives, and community\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\ninvolvement. We must also ensure that Federal Government programs that \nare meant to combat drug use really do work.\n  There are those in this body who have advocated spending hundreds of \nmillions of dollars on increased drug treatment. Treatment is very \nvaluable, but don't we get more for our money if we prevent individuals \nfrom using and becoming addicted to drugs in the first place.\n  President Bush has made a commitment to reducing drug abuse in \nAmerica. In order to achieve this goal he has nominated a strong \ncandidate in Mr. Walters. I believe that Mr. Walters will provide the \nstrong leadership we so desperately need.\n  President Bush's approach will focus on reducing the demand for drugs \nthrough effective education, prevention, treatment, and law \nenforcement.\n  President Bush has nominated Mr. Walters for this position because he \nis an experienced leader in reducing the demand for and supply of \ndrugs. John Walters was indeed a major catalyst for the successes \nachieved during the Reagan-Bush years. Indeed during his tenure as \nAssistant to our Drug Czar, Bill Bennett, America saw a marked and \ndramatic reduction in drug use. The war on drugs was not a failure, it \nwas one success after another.\n  Some members of the press have focused on Mr. Walters experience in \ninterdiction and law enforcement, but he actually started in public \nservice at the Department of Education, specializing in drug abuse \nprevention, including writing and taking a lead on the ``Schools \nWithout Drugs'' prevention and education program.\n  Mr. Walters went on to serve as the ONDCP chief of staff in the first \nBush administration and later was confirmed by the Senate as deputy \ndirector. We achieved some of our greatest victories under his watch. \nIt is obvious he has the qualifications and experience for the job.\n  William Bennett, the former director of ONDCP and Mr. Walters former \nboss while he was at the agency, has said ``John is the best person for \nthe job. He is one of the three or four most knowledgeable people about \nthe issue and he has a deep passion about the job of stopping illegal \ndrugs.''\n  Now more than ever we need strong leadership. The Director of ONDCP \ncoordinates all Federal anti-drug efforts, but it is also important \nthat the Director work more effectively to support State and local \nefforts. President Bush's plan stresses this aspect.\n  Let me give you an example of the crisis we face. Last year a study \nwas released by the National Center for Addiction and Substance Abuse \nat Columbia University. According to the study, adolescents in small-\ntown and rural America are much more likely than their peers in urban \nareas to have used drugs.\n  The study reports that 8th-graders in rural areas are 104 percent \nlikelier than those in big cities to use amphetamines, including \nmethamphetamines, and 50 percent likelier to use cocaine.\n  Law enforcement officials in Alabama have come to me with major \nconcerns about increased drug use and trafficking in the rural parts of \nthe South, particularly an alarming rise in Methamphetamine use and \nproduction.\n  We must take steps to reverse this alarming trend. We need solid \nleadership at the Office of National Drug Control Policy to address \nthis issue. One area were Mr. Walters can have a major impact on this \nproblem is in regards to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area or \nHIDTA program.\n  The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 authorized the Director of ONDCP to \ndesignate areas within the United States which exhibit serious drug \ntrafficking problems and harmfully impact other areas of the country as \nHigh Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas.\n  The HIDTA program provides additional Federal funds to those areas to \nhelp eliminate or reduce drug trafficking and its harmful consequences. \nThe program enhances and coordinates drug control efforts among local, \nState, and Federal law enforcement agencies.\n  The House and Senate Appropriations Committees have passed increases \nfor the HIDTA program in both versions of the Treasury Postal \nAppropriations bills. Much of these funds will be left to the \ndiscretion of the director of ONDCP.\n  We need immediate, strong, and competent leadership at ONDCP to \nensure that issues like this are properly addressed. The funding must \nflow to the areas with the most need, where law enforcement can make a \nreal difference. Mr. Walters has the knowledge and expertise to make \nthese types of important decisions.\n  Mr. Walters can also provide strong leadership in our overall Federal \nefforts. Our Federal campaign against drugs is spread over a number of \nagencies, including the Justice, Treasury, and Defense Departments. We \nneed strong leadership to ensure that these efforts are coordinated. I \nhave become concerned in recent months that perhaps some of these \nagencies efforts have become repetitive.\n  I have requested that the GAO study these efforts to ensure that is \nnot happening. Mr. Walters has the expertise to take a close look at \nall our efforts to ensure that our dollars are being sent wisely.\n  I believe we can make a real difference in the problems with drugs in \nAmerica. Under President Bush and Mr. Walters leadership, I know we can \nsend a clear message to our youth that drugs use is dangerous and just \nplain wrong. We can also send a clear message to drug dealers, that \nthere activities will not be tolerated.\n  I urge my colleagues to move toward confirmation of John Walters \nnomination. This is not an area where we can afford to delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8901-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8901-S8903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      KOREAN GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my extreme concern \nabout developments in the Republic of Korea that have far reaching \nnegative implications for U.S. semiconductor companies. I am referring \nto the massive and unjustified government bailout that the South Korean \ngovernment is providing to Hyundai Electronics, now known as Hynix.\n  To date, the South Korean Government and the government-owned banks \nhave given Hynix over $4 billion in loans and other types of financing \nwhich carry the guarantee of the government of Korea. This is a subsidy \npure and simple. As if this is not bad enough, however, two Wall Street \nJournal articles over the past week report that the Korean government \nis now planning on giving Hynix an additional billion dollars to keep \nthem solvent.\n  In the year 2000, Hynix was the world's largest producer of dynamic \nrandom access memory, or DRAM, an important type of memory \nsemiconductor that is used in everything from personal computers to \nsatellites. Hynix has captured over 24 percent of the world \nsemiconductor market. However, Hynix achieved such a large share of the \nglobal market not because it is particularly good at making DRAMs, but \nbecause it borrowed excessively and built up enormous capacity.\n  Now, Hynix is broke and cannot repay the loans it took out to finance \nits expansion. Verging on bankruptcy, Hynix has been kept alive by the \nSouth Korean government through infusions of new cash. Far from solving \nthe company's problems, however, these government subsidies are just \nplunging Hynix deeper into debt. This behavior circumvents normal \nmarket forces and has very severe implications for the companies in the \nU.S. and the rest of the world that are forced to compete with Hynix's \nillegally subsidized products.\n  Over the past several months, the Korean government has given \nassurances to me, to my colleague Senator Crapo, and other members of \nthis body, as well as Ambassador Zoellick, Secretary Evans and \nSecretary O'Neill, that the Korean government will stop giving these \nsubsidies to Hynix, subsidies that clearly violate our international \ntrade agreements. Now, the Korean government seems poised to violate \nthese assurances completely, destroying the U.S. semiconductor industry \nin the process.\n  I call on the Korean government to stop subsidizing Hynix, to stop \nthis distortion of the international semiconductor market, and to let \nHynix sink or swim on its own.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the Internet has \nrevolutionized communication and business. Unfortunately, it also \nprovides a new tool for some very traditional villains: child \nmolesters. While it is already a Federal crime to cross State\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\nlines to sexually molest a minor, in recent years the number of people \nusing the Internet to violate this law has skyrocketed. According to a \nreport issued to Congress last year by the National Center for Missing \nand Exploited Children, NCMEC, one in five children, aged 10-17, were \nsexually solicited over the Internet in 1999. And from 1998-2000 alone, \nthe FBI's cybermolester caseload increased by 550 percent.\n  Unfortunately, loopholes in the current law allow some of these \npredators to escape without any real consequences. Because most \ncybermolesters are well-educated, middle-class, and have no previous \ncriminal record, many judges are giving them laughably light sentences. \nIronically, the purveyors of child-pornography receive mandatory ten-\nyear sentences, but those who use the Internet to meet children and act \nout pornographic fantasies often receive no jail time at all.\n  We need to end the double standard that gives lighter sentences to a \nspecial set of privileged criminals. For this reason, last week I re-\nintroduced my Cybermolesters Enforcement Act to ensure that these new \non-line molesters are apprehended and brought to justice. Like last \nyear, my bill provides for a five-year mandatory minimum sentence for \nthose who abuse the Internet in an effort to sexually abuse America's \nchildren, but it does not change the maximum sentence provided by \nFederal law.\n  This year, the bill contains two additional provisions to help the \nBureau apprehend these abusers and destroy their disgusting wares. \nFirst, my bill would allow law enforcement to obtain a Federal wiretap \non those suspected of committing certain child sexual exploitation \noffenses, such as transmitting computer-generated child pornography, \nenticing a minor to travel for sexual activity, or transporting a minor \nfor sexual activity. Adding these offenses to the list of crimes for \nwhich Federal law enforcement may obtain wiretaps will significantly \nincrease the ability of the authorities to detect and interdict those \nwho use the Internet to send pornography to minors and then arrange to \nmeet them for unlawful sexual activity. As with any other wiretap \nrequest, though, the government first must demonstrate probable cause \nto the satisfaction of a Federal judge in order to use this important \ntool.\n  Second, this year my bill would classify child pornography as \ncontraband. Illegal drugs and counterfeit currency are already defined \nas contraband, and child pornography is at least as dangerous to our \nsociety. Classifying child pornography as contraband would enable law \nenforcement officials to seize it based upon probable cause and destroy \nit automatically after its use as evidence is no longer needed. \nFurthermore, treating this odious material as contraband will likely \nlead to increased cooperation from commercial entities, such as \nInternet service providers, which are unwittingly used by child \npornographers to store and transmit this disgusting material. Because \nno customer can claim a legitimate property interest in contraband, \nthese entities will be free to seize child pornography, delete its \npresence on the Internet, and send the images to law enforcement \nwithout fear of civil liability from their customers.\n  The Cybermolesters Enforcement Act addresses a real and chilling \nthreat to our Nation's children. It will support the FBI's ``Innocent \nImages'' program, which is on the front lines of the battle against on-\nline pedophiles. Both Ernie Allen, President of the NCMEC, and by John \nWalsh of ``America's Most Wanted'' have endorsed it. ``Predators are \nhiding behind the relative anonymity of the Internet to target \nchildren,'' said Mr. Allen. ``While we're making enormous progress in \naddressing this problem, it is clear that too many of these cases are \nnot being viewed in a serious way by the courts. Senator McConnell's \nbill sends a loud, clear message that enticing children for sexual \npurposes over the Internet is just as illegal and just as dangerous as \ndoing it in a shopping mall or playground,'' said Allen. And John Walsh \nnotes that ``yesterday's child molesters are today's cybermolesters. \nSenator McConnell's bill is a comprehensive approach to fighting these \ndespicable crimes. It helps the FBI track down these criminals, allows \nthe Bureau to seize their perverse wares, and makes sure we do not let \nthem escape justice.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this initiative, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article by George Will outlining the problem of \ncybermolesters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 23, 2000]\n\n                               Nasty Work\n\n                          (By George F.

Criminal sexual activity on the Internet is \n     a growth industry.\n       In many homes, children are the most competent computer \n     users. They are as comfortable on the Internet as their \n     parents are on the telephone. On the Web, children can be pen \n     pals with the entire world, instantly and at minimal cost. \n     But the world contains many bad people. Parents should take \n     seriously a cartoon that shows two dogs working on computers. \n     One says to the other, ``When you're online, no one knows \n     you're a dog.''\n       A child does not know if the person with whom he or she is \n     chatting is another child or a much older person with \n     sinister intentions. The typical person that the agents call \n     a ``traveler''--someone who will cross state lines hoping to \n     have a sexual encounter with a child--is a white male age 25-\n     45. He has above-average education--often an advanced degree, \n     and he can find his way around the Internet--and above-\n     average income, enabling him to travel. Many ``travelers'' \n     are married.\n       But these cyber-stalkers do not know if the person with \n     whom they are chatting is really, as they think, a young boy \n     or girl, or an FBI agent. Some ``travelers'' who thought they \n     had arranged meetings with children have been unpleasantly \n     surprised, arrested, tried and jailed.\n       Since the first arrest under Innocent Images in 1995, there \n     have been 487 arrests of ``travelers'' and pornographers, and \n     409 convictions. Most of the 78 nonconvictions are in cases \n     still pending. The conviction rate is above 95 percent. \n     However, the FBI is distressed by light sentences from some \n     judges who justify their leniency by the fact that the \n     offenders are socially upscale and first offenders. \n     (Actually, probably not: How likely is it that they get \n     caught the first time they become predators?) Lenient judges \n     also call the crime ``victimless'' because it is an FBI \n     agent, not a child, receiving the offender's attention.\n       Agents are trained to avoid entrapment, and predators \n     usually initiate talk about sexual encounters. But children \n     implicitly raise the subject by visiting such chat rooms. \n     Most children recoil when sexual importunings become overt. \n     (``When you come to meet me, make sure you're not wearing any \n     underwear.'') But some importunings, including gifts and \n     sympathetic conversation about the problems of children, are \n     cunning, subtle and effective.\n       Publicity about Innocent Images may deter some predators, \n     but most are driven to risk-taking by obsessions. America \n     Online and other service providers look for suspect chat \n     rooms and close those they spot, but they exist in such \n     rapidly changing profusion that there are always many \n     menacing ones open.\n       Digital cameras, and the plunging price of computer storage \n     capacity for downloaded photographs, have made this, so to \n     speak, the golden age of child pornography. The fact that the \n     mere possession of it is a crime does not deter people from \n     finding, in the blizzard of Internet activities, like-minded \n     people to whom they say things like, ``I'm interested in \n     pictures of boys 6 to 8 having sex with adults.''\n       A booklet available from any FBI office, ``A Parent's Guide \n     to Internet Safety,'' lists signs that a child might be at \n     risk online. These include the child's being online for \n     protracted periods, particularly at night. Being online like \n     that is the unenviable duty of FBI agents running Innocent \n     Images.\n       Each of the FBI's 56 field offices has an officer trained \n     to seek cyber-stalkers and traffickers in child pornography. \n     Ten offices have Innocent Images operations. Agents assigned \n     to Innocent Images can spend as many as 10 hours a day \n     monitoring the sexual sewer that is a significant part of the \n     ``information superhighway.'' So the FBI looks for \n     ``reluctant volunteers'' who, while working, are given \n     psychological tests to see that they are not becoming \n     ``damaged goods.''

Mr. President, I rise today to express my extreme concern \nabout developments in the Republic of Korea that have far reaching \nnegative implications for U.S. semiconductor companies. I am referring \nto the massive and unjustified government bailout that the South Korean \ngovernment is providing to Hyundai Electronics, now known as Hynix.\n  To date, the South Korean Government and the government-owned banks \nhave given Hynix over $4 billion in loans and other types of financing \nwhich carry the guarantee of the government of Korea. This is a subsidy \npure and simple. As if this is not bad enough, however, two Wall Street \nJournal articles over the past week report that the Korean government \nis now planning on giving Hynix an additional billion dollars to keep \nthem solvent.\n  In the year 2000, Hynix was the world's largest producer of dynamic \nrandom access memory, or DRAM, an important type of memory \nsemiconductor that is used in everything from personal computers to \nsatellites. Hynix has captured over 24 percent of the world \nsemiconductor market. However, Hynix achieved such a large share of the \nglobal market not because it is particularly good at making DRAMs, but \nbecause it borrowed excessively and built up enormous capacity.\n  Now, Hynix is broke and cannot repay the loans it took out to finance \nits expansion. Verging on bankruptcy, Hynix has been kept alive by the \nSouth Korean government through infusions of new cash. Far from solving \nthe company's problems, however, these government subsidies are just \nplunging Hynix deeper into debt. This behavior circumvents normal \nmarket forces and has very severe implications for the companies in the \nU.S. and the rest of the world that are forced to compete with Hynix's \nillegally subsidized products.\n  Over the past several months, the Korean government has given \nassurances to me, to my colleague Senator Crapo, and other members of \nthis body, as well as Ambassador Zoellick, Secretary Evans and \nSecretary O'Neill, that the Korean government will stop giving these \nsubsidies to Hynix, subsidies that clearly violate our international \ntrade agreements. Now, the Korean government seems poised to violate \nthese assurances completely, destroying the U.S. semiconductor industry \nin the process.\n  I call on the Korean government to stop subsidizing Hynix, to stop \nthis distortion of the international semiconductor market, and to let \nHynix sink or swim on its own.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as we are all aware, the Internet has \nrevolutionized communication and business. Unfortunately, it also \nprovides a new tool for some very traditional villains: child \nmolesters.

Mr. President, as momentum builds for the \ndeployment of missile defense and the abandonment of the obsolete ABM \nTreaty, those who oppose missile defense are getting more and more \ndesperate in their arguments. One argument that we're hearing with more \nfrequency is the threat of the suitcase bomb. This argument maintains \nthat we shouldn't be spending our scarce defense dollars on ballistic \nmissile defense when there are easier and cheaper ways a potential \nenemy could deliver a weapon of mass destruction to the United States. \nRogue states could just smuggle a bomb in on a ship, or put it in a \nsuitcase in New York, or drop biological weapons into our water supply. \nA missile defense system won't do anything to stop a suitcase bomb, so \nit must be a waste of money, or so the argument goes.\n  This argument is repeated with such frequency, it might be useful to \nstate for the record why it misses the point.\n  Let me state the most obvious reason first. The presence of one kind \nof threat doesn't mean you shouldn't also defend against other threats. \nImagine if this logic were applied consistently to our approach to \nnational defense. Why have an army if you can be attacked by sea? Or, \nwhy have air defenses if you can be attacked by land? Such reasoning is \nabsurd. If we refused to defend against one threat simply because other \nthreats exist, we would end up completely defenseless.\n  National defense capabilities are like insurance policies: we hope we \nnever have to use them, but the consequences of not having them could \nbe catastrophic. No one would argue that because you have auto \ninsurance you shouldn't also buy insurance for your house. However, \nopponents of missile defense argue that you don't need insurance \nagainst ballistic missiles, but that you only need insurance against \nsuitcase bombs and other terrorist threats.\n  I think we would all agree that a potential adversary would likely \ntry to exploit any perceived vulnerabilities in our defenses. This is \nonly logical. If the U.S. forgoes the capability to repel a missile \nattack, that creates a powerful incentive for our adversaries to seek a \nballistic missile capability. Once again, this is only logical.\n  I would like to emphasize that defending against the so-called \nsuitcase bomb threats is not an alternative to defending against \nballistic missiles, as opponents of missile defense assert. We must do \nboth. We have an obligation to do both.\n  Keep in mind that terrorist acts, such as those that would be \nperpetrated by a suitcase bomb, serve purposes entirely different from \nballistic missiles. The surreptitious placement and detonation of a \nweapon, such as occurred at the World Trade Center or in Oklahoma City, \nis intended to disrupt society by spreading terror. Such acts depend on \ncovert action and their goal is the actual use of the weapon. That's \nnot why nations acquire ballistic missiles.\n  How many times have we heard opponents of missile defense drag out \nthe tired cliche ``Missiles have a return address!'' as though that \nsomehow devalues them. The opposite is true, missiles derive their \nvalue from the knowledge of their existence and the belief that they \nmight be used. Of course they have a return address; their owners want \nto make sure we know it. The point is not, as it is with terrorist \nweapons, to hide the existence of ballistic missiles, but to broadcast \nit. The ability to coerce the United States with ballistic missiles \ndepends on our belief that a potential adversary has nuclear missile \nand would be willing to use them against us. We called this principle \ndeterrence when the Soviet Union was in existence. However, in the \nhands of a dictator, deterrence can quickly become coercion and \nblackmail.\n  Those who argue that missile defense is not necessary as long as a \npotential adversary could use a suitcase bomb erroneously assume that \nthe goal of a rogue state in having a ballistic missile is to use it \nsomewhere. This is not necessarily correct. These rogue states \nrecognize that ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads provide \nan effective way to coerce the United States. Imagine a dictator who \ncould stand up to the United States with a nuclear missile, knowing \nfull well that there is nothing the United States can do to defend \nitself.\n  There is another huge difference between the terrorist act and the \nballistic missile--we are actively fighting against terrorism but doing \nnothing whatsoever to protect ourselves against ballistic missiles. \nLast year, the United States spent around $11 billion in counter \nterrorism programs, more than double what we spent on the entire \nmissile defense program, including theater missile defenses. Spending \nthis year on counter terrorism programs will be even higher. And that \nlayer of defense is working, as evidenced last year by the successful \ninterdiction of terrorist infiltration attempts on our northern border. \nCounter terrorism is an important aspect of our national security \nprogram and we need to continue to be vigilant and to dedicate the \nnecessary resources to it. But we have no defense against ballistic \nmissiles, and we cannot continue to have this glaring vulnerability in \nour defenses.\n  For those opponents of missile defense, I pose the following \nquestions. Why are nations like North Korea and Iran spending billions \nof dollars on the development of ballistic missiles? Are they \nirrational, spending money on things they don't need? I think that's \nhighly unlikely. I think a better explanation is that the leaders of \nsuch nations see tremendous value in such weapons. They understand that \nthe only way to counter the power of the United States and reduce its \ninfluence is to exploit its vulnerabilities. I think they have surveyed \nthe landscape and have correctly perceived that our one glaring \nvulnerability is our utter defenselessness against ballistic missile \nattack.

Above all, I \nam pleased that the committee has provided significant increases in \nfunding for veterans' health care, veterans' medical research, State \nveterans home construction and other vital programs that serve those \nwho have sacrificed for our Nation.\n  Nevertheless, I cannot endorse the order of priority accorded to the \nvarious programs funded within this bill. I object to leaving veterans' \nneeds unmet while funding hundreds of earmarked projects. And I regret \nthat our appropriations process compels Members to, in effect, choose \nbetween voting for rightly popular veterans' programs and voting \nagainst wasteful social spending.\n  For a number of years, I have questioned the desirability of grouping \nagencies with unrelated missions into omnibus appropriations bills, and \nI have cited the VA-HUD bill as the best illustration of the problem. \nDespite my strong support for veterans benefits I have, more often than \nnot, voted against the VA-HUD bill since I came to the Senate, because \nI believed that the spending levels and earmarks in the HUD portion \ncould not be defended.\n  We all know that HUD is a Department fraught with serious problems, \nas detailed repeatedly by the General Accounting Office, which to this \nday, classifies HUD as the only ``high risk'' executive branch agency \nat the Cabinet level. Yet the bill before us provides HUD with a robust \nnine percent increase, bigger than the increase provided for veterans.\n  The HUD title also includes eleven pages of earmarked projects, the \nvast bulk of them in States represented by appropriators. If past \nhistory is any guide, the final list of earmarks will grow beyond what \nis in this bill, or the House bill.\n  Last night, I reluctantly voted against the amendment offered by the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota, because I believed that the additional\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\nfunding for veterans' health it provided needed to be, and could have \nbeen, fully offset. The first $140 million could be found in those \neleven pages of earmarks!\n  Another $420 million could be found in the allocation for AmeriCorps, \nformer President Clinton's program to pay salaries and benefits to \n``volunteers.''\n  Nearly all of the remaining $90 million could be found by reclaiming \nfor veterans money this bill allocates for federally-funded community \ncomputer centers, an unauthorized expenditure.\n  It is all about priorities, you see, and the priorities in this bill \nare out of whack.\n  Finally, I must reiterate my disappointment with the failure of the \nSenate to adopt needed reforms to restore equity in the formula used to \ndistribute funding for wastewater needs to the various States. Although \nthe managers graciously adopted my amendment urging the authorizing \ncommittee to act this year to address the need for reform, the Senate \nhas lost a real opportunity to bring this outmoded formula into the \n21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8904-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WILDFIRE TRAGEDIES\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to reflect on a \ntragedy that weighs very heavy upon my heart. Last month four \nfirefighters were killed in a conflagration in Washington State's \nOkanogan National Forest. My prayers and thoughts are with the families \nof Tom Craven, Devin Weaver, Jessica Johnson, and Karen FitzPatrick. \nTheir service and bravery will not be forgotten.\n  This tragedy, like those at Mann Gulch and Storm King Mountain, \nreminds us of the very real, imminent and often hidden specter of \nwildfire. While Congress and the Administration have made a commendable \ncommitment to fighting and preventing wildfire, this most recent \ntragedy raises valid concerns about potential administrative and \nregulatory barriers to responsible fire management.\n  There are reports that conflicting authorities, involving the \nrequirements to protect bull trout under the Endangered Species Act, \ndelayed a water drop on the fire for nearly 12 hours, during which time \nthe fire grew from 25 to 2,500 acres. I am aware that the Forest \nService is investigating this matter, and in no way want to comment on \nthe verity of this report. The fact that such an occurrence is \npossible, however, is cause enough for great alarm, and a call for \nimmediate attention by this body and the administration.\n  I would pose two questions to my colleagues: What obstacles are \npreventing the protection of human life during emergency situations? If \nthere is indecision in the face of danger, is there also inconsistency \nin our laws, and our priorities as a government?\n  There is a clause in the Endangered Species Act, ESA, that provides \nfor threats to human life. It says that ``No civil penalty shall be \nimposed if it can be shown . . . that the defendant committed an act \nbased on a good faith belief that he was acting to protect himself . . \n. or any other individual from bodily harm, from any endangered \nspecies.'' This is the ``charging bear'' scenario, which I believe in \nspirit, should apply to any conflict between human and animal life.\n  As the Forest Service investigates this tragedy, I believe that \nclarity should be given to all Federal land management agencies, as \nwell as the National Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS, giving explicit \nauthority, in emergency situations, to take without reservation \nnecessary actions to prevent the loss of human life. While this \nauthority is consistent with the Endangered Species Act, it seems to be \nconstrained by a bureaucracy that has repeatedly turned a blind eye to \nthe human side of natural disasters.\n  I also want to express my disappointment in one of the government's \nmissed opportunities to prevent wildfire threats in the first place. \nThe National Fire Plan provided a landmark level of funding to reduce \nhazardous fuel loads on 3.2 million acres of public lands. In addition, \nthe Forest Service and NMFS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement to \nstreamline the ESA consultation process for fuels reduction projects \nwhile protecting salmon habitat. NMFS was consequently given $4 million \nto accomplish this. Over a month ago, thirty NMFS biologists were sent \nto the Pacific Northwest to expedite these consultations. It appears \nthat, to date, they have not been assigned a single project. In \naddition, testimony from the General Accounting Office this week \nreported that there are serious flaws in the implementation of the \nNational Fire Plan, including interagency cooperation.\n  When I go home to Oregon tomorrow I want to tell my constituents, \nincluding my friends and neighbors, that ``help is on the way.'' In \norder to do that, I must be confident that this body will exert every \npower at its disposal to protect our citizens, and our forests, from \nNature's disasters, and our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8904-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LANCE ARMSTRONG\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in the world of sports, there are \ncompetitions, there are grueling tests of strength and endurance, and \nthere is the Tour de France. For 22 days--through 20 different stages--\nover 2,286 miles--over mountains--across valleys--through cities--some \nof the world's greatest athletes ride. They compete against each other, \nthe elements, the terrain and themselves, primarily with the hope of \nsimply completing the ride.\n  Competing in the Tour de France, there are the great athletes, there \nare the elite athletes, and there is Lance Armstrong. On his Circum \nVitae, Lance might list himself as a two time Olympian, a two time US \nChampion, World Champion, or--a feat boasted by only eight riders since \nthe beginning of the tour in 1903--a three time Tour de France winner.\n  On this past Sunday, July 29, the 29 year old Texan pulled up to the \nChamps-Elysees, six minutes and 44 seconds ahead of his next closest \ncompetitor. It was his third victory at the Tour de France in as many \nyears. While he has been reluctant to accept the title, many of his \nfellow cyclists consider him to be ``the Patron''--the unquestioned \nboss of the race.\n  However, as remarkable as his competitive achievements may be, Mr. \nArmstrong's Circum Vitae has one addition that establishes him as a \ntruly remarkable human being--he is a cancer survivor. With the same \nfortitude that carried him over 6 peaks in the Pyrenees, Mr. Armstrong \ndefeated choriocarcinoma, an aggressive form of testicular cancer. By \nthe time it was discovered, the cancer had spread to, and established \nitself in, Mr. Armstrong's abdomen, lungs and brain. Some of the 11 \nmasses in the talented young cyclist's lungs were the size of golf \nballs. According to medical science, Mr. Armstrong had an estimated 50/\n50 chance of survival. Needless to say, the odds of his ever returning \nto the sport he loved were more slim.\n  However, as has been made obvious in the last three tours, Lance \nArmstrong is a man of great determination. Since 1997, Mr. Armstrong \nhas been cancer free. Despite having endured brain surgery, the removal \nof a testicle and intense chemotherapy, he has returned to and excelled \nin one of the toughest competitions in the history of sport.\n  Beyond his professional triumphs, Mr. Armstrong has lived a fulfilled \npersonal life. In 1998, Lance Armstrong and Kristen Richard were joined \nas husband and wife. In 1999, the couple were blessed with the birth of \ntheir first son, Luke David.\n  Beyond his incredible professional and personal triumphs, Mr. \nArmstrong has become a beacon of hope to his community. Through his \nwork with the Lance Armstrong Foundation, Mr. Armstrong has greatly \nbenefitted the causes of research, early detection and treatment, and \nsurvivorship. The name Lance Armstrong has come to signify hope for \ncancer patients and their families.\n  So, I rise today not to congratulate Mr. Armstrong, but to thank him. \nHe has meant a great deal to a great many people. The word ``hero'' is, \nin my opinion, overused in the world of sports. Lance Armstrong is a \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8904-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8904-S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET OUTLOOK\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, on July 20 the senior Senator from the \ngreat State of North Dakota made a series of thought-provoking comments \non the\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\nfloor of the Senate. Many of those comments related to a speech Larry \nLindsey, President Bush's economic advisor and a distinguished public \nservant, delivered in Philadelphia on July 19.\n  In his statement my colleague alleges that Dr. Lindsey misrepresented \nhis views on raising taxes at a time of economic slowdown. In fact, on \npage 12 of his speech, Dr. Lindsey said, ``In recent hearings conducted \nby Senator Conrad at which Budget Director Daniels testified, the \nSenator agreed that raising taxes this year might not be a good idea \ngiven the economy. But he went on to be clear that next year might be \ndifferent. He hinted at a tax increase in 2002, just as the economy is \nrecovering.''\n  If, when he made his remarks on the floor of the Senate, Senator \nConrad had not seen a copy of Dr. Lindsey's speech, I can well \nunderstand that he may not have realized that his allegation on the \nmatter of his favoring a tax increase this year was false. As to \nSenator Conrad's views on the advisability of a tax increase next year, \nI must say that the transcript of his floor statement on July 20 only \nreinforces the view that he might support a tax increase next year when \nthe economy is growing more robustly. Independent observers have drawn \nthe same conclusion about Senator Conrad's views from his public \nstatements. Robert Samuelson, in the July 11 Washington Post wrote, \n``To protect on-budget surpluses, Conrad says the Bush administration \nhas `an affirmative obligation to come up with spending cuts or new \nrevenue (tax increases).''' If this is not the case, and Senator Conrad \nis opposed to tax increases next year, I can assure you that I would \napplaud his decision.\n  In his Philadelphia speech, Dr. Lindsey provided compelling reasons \nwhy we should not even be talking about the possibility of raising \ntaxes next year. First, a tax increase next year would undermine the \nsense of permanence associated with this year's tax cut. That sense of \npermanence is key to the success of this year's tax cut. Talk of \nincreasing taxes, or of repealing the tax cut next year, thus reduces \nthe effectiveness of this year's tax cut. Furthermore, you need only \nlook at Japan's experience when it increased taxes early in an \nexpansion. It wasn't pretty.\n  A second point of concern in this dialogue involves the timing of the \ntax cut. I am pleased to discover the amount of agreement between the \nadministration and Senator Conrad on the need for a fiscal stimulus \nthis year. When he announced his tax program in December, 1999, the \nPresident said that the country may need an insurance policy. Thus, \nwhile he proposed a basic plan involving a 5-year phase-in, the \nPresident left flexible the actual timing of his tax reduction, \nexplicitly letting it depend on macroeconomic circumstances. In January \nhe indicated a need to work with Congress on an acceleration of the tax \ncut. And in his formal proposal in February, the President said \nexplicitly, ``I want to work with you to give our economy an important \njump-start by making tax relief retroactive.'' That was a full month \nbefore the distinguished senior Senator from North Dakota proposed his \n$60 billion tax cut proposal for this year.\n  Fortunately, Congress did pass a fiscal stimulus for 2001. Senator \nConrad's floor statement indicates support for a $60 billion tax \nreduction this year. That figure is very close to the $74 billion \nfigure that actually passed and was signed into law. I don't believe \nthat the $14 billion difference in these figures could be the basis for \nSenator Conrad's assertion that the administration is ``driving us into \nthe fiscal ditch,'' especially given a $2 trillion Federal budget and \nthe Senator's apparent support for cutting taxes during an economic \nslowdown.\n  Furthermore, the spending side of the fiscal year 2001 budget was \ndetermined last fall under President Clinton. At that time, the \nPresident and the Congress increased discretionary spending by more \nthan 8 percent. Had that rate of spending increase been sustained, we \ncertainly would have deficit problems later this decade. Fortunately \nPresident Bush proposed a budget, and Congress adopted a budget \nresolution, with a sharp deceleration of that rate of spending \nincrease.\n  Looking forward, a comparison of the Democratic alternative that \nSenator Conrad referred to in his remarks and the bill that actually \npassed is instructive. For example, in fiscal year 2002 the bill that \npassed the Congress and was signed by the President was scored at $38 \nbillion. By comparison, the Democratic alternative was scored at $64 \nbillion. Would the Democratic alternative tax proposal have driven us \ninto the ``fiscal ditch'' deeper and faster than the President's \nbudget?\n  In fiscal year 2003, the relevant scoring by Congress' Joint \nCommittee on Taxation shows the bill that actually passed cost $91 \nbillion while the Democratic alternative cost $83 billion. In fiscal \nyear 2004 the figures were $108 billion for the bill that actually \npassed and $101 billion for the Democratic alternative. In fiscal year \n2005 the actual legislation cost $107 billion while the Democratic \nalternative cost $115 billion. Surely this $7 billion difference \nbetween the two bills over a three year period cannot plausibly be \nlabeled ``driving us into the fiscal ditch'' either.\n  One must assume that Senator Conrad's assertions are based on the \nlong-term revenue effects of the President's proposal. Yet, in fiscal \nyear 2006 and later no one is forecasting anything but a large budget \nsurplus. Thus, it is hard to find any factual basis for claims that the \nPresident's tax plan is ``driving us into the fiscal ditch'' by any \ndefinition of that term that does not also apply to the proposals \nSenator Conrad and his Democrat colleagues advanced during the budget \ndebate.\n  It is apparent from Senator Conrad's remarks that he and Dr. Lindsey \ndiffer on the proper measure of fiscal tightness. Dr. Lindsey asserted \nin his speech that the best measure of the Government's effect on the \nfinancial markets is the Unified Budget Surplus. This was a concept \ncreated by a special commission appointed by President Lyndon Johnson \nand has been in use for more than 30 years. It has long been the \nstandard for non-partisan analysis of the budget. For good measure, on \npage fifteen of his speech, Dr. Lindsey quoted Robert Samuelson \nregarding the usefulness of alternative definitions.\n  As to the appropriate size of the unified surplus, I concur \nwholeheartedly with the administration's view that the unified surplus \nshould be at least as large as the Social Security surplus. Dr. Lindsey \noutlined in his Philadelphia speech why this is appropriate. But, \nSenator Conrad and Dr. Lindsey disagree fundamentally regarding the \nright term to apply to Medicare. As Dr. Lindsey stated in his speech, \nevery dollar of Medicare premiums paid by beneficiaries and every \ndollar of Medicare taxes paid by workers and their employers is spent \non Medicare. In addition, Medicare receives $50 billion in extra money \nfrom the rest of the Federal budget. Frankly, the ``surplus'' concept \ndoes not make much sense under the circumstances.\n  In his floor speech Senator Conrad made an analogy to ``defense,'' \nnoting that all of its funding is paid for from the rest of the Federal \nbudget. But no one talks of a ``defense surplus.'' Indeed, the concept \nof a ``surplus'' in a program that requires net inflows from the rest \nof the budget seems to make little sense. I therefore do not see why \nreferences to the budgetary funding of defense conceivably supports the \nassertion that Medicare has a ``surplus.''\n  Finally, Senator Conrad and Dr. Lindsey also seem to disagree on the \nextent to which the Government should control the fruits of our \nNation's labor, saving, and risk-taking. Over the last 8 years, the \nshare of GDP taken in Federal receipts has increased from 17.3 percent \nto 20.3 percent. Even if the President's original campaign proposal on \ntaxes were to have been enacted, the tax share of GDP would have been \nrolled back only modestly, and would still have been above the post-War \naverage. I believe that I am on firm ground stating that Senator \nConrad's opposition to even this modest rollback means that he supports \nsomething close to the current record-setting tax take.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I urge my colleagues to \nconsider these facts as they consider the appropriate course for fiscal \npolicy in the months and years ahead.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8904-3", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8904-S8906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE BUDGET OUTLOOK\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the need to \nrevisit an unfortunate chapter in the FBI's history: the investigation \nof the FBI's actions at Ruby Ridge.\n  While there have been a number of internal investigations of the \nFBI's actions at Ruby Ridge, the most recent investigation, sponsored \nby the Justice Management Division of the Department of Justice, was \ncompleted in 1999. The results of this investigation have raised \nserious questions about the integrity of the previous joint \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice and the FBI, which was \ncompleted in 1993. Among these questions is whether FBI supervisors who \nheaded that previous investigation were personal friends of some of the \nsenior executives they were investigating. These questions, and many \nothers, were raised in the testimony of four FBI Agents who appeared at \na Judiciary Committee Hearing on FBI Oversight, chaired by Senator \nLeahy, last month. These exemplary Agents exposed the double standard \nthat has existed in how rank and file FBI Agents are punished versus \nFBI Senior Officials.\n  So, you might think that the Justice Management Division's report \nwould have cleared this matter up. Well, you'd be wrong. As a matter of \nfact, most of us didn't even realize the existence of this report until \nit was brought to light by the testimony of these Agents. It was also \nthen that we found that Justice Management sat on this report for two \nyears before releasing it internally in January of this year. And, \ndespite clear and convincing evidence of irregularities in how FBI \nofficials have been punished in this matter, Justice Management \ndivision has ruled that no new discipline would be imposed against any \nFBI personnel. One of the FBI Agents testifying at the hearing \ndescribed this decision as ``outrageous'' and ``alarming.''\n  Three weeks ago, I joined Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter in \nrequesting documents relating to the Justice Management Division's \nreport. While the Department of Justice was responsive in providing the \nrequested materials, many of these documents were subject to protection \nunder the privacy act and our staffs could only review them for a short \nperiod of time.\n  Once again, Senator Specter and I have joined Chairman Leahy, along \nwith Ranking Member Hatch, and Senator Kohl, to request that these \ndocuments be provided again, this time with appropriate redactions to \ncomply with Privacy act concerns. I ask that this letter be made part \nof the Record.\n  Less than twenty-four hours ago we confirmed the nomination of Robert \nMueller to head the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In his testimony \nbefore the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Mueller stated, as their new \nDirector, the FBI would be honest and forthright about mistakes. While, \nI understand that the mistakes of Ruby Ridge did not occur on Mr. \nMueller's watch I truly believe that the FBI will never truly make a \nclean break with the past unless matters such as these are resolved.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2001.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear General Ashcroft: As you are aware, the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee is conducting oversight hearings on the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation. At our hearing last week, \n     three present FBI agents and one former agent testified that \n     there is a widespread perception among FBI agents that a \n     ``double standard'' has been applied in FBI internal \n     disciplinary decisions, with members of the FBI's senior \n     executive service receiving far lighter punishment than line \n     agents for similar infractions.\n       As a case in point, the witnesses cited the various \n     internal investigations that the FBI conducted into the 1992 \n     incident at Ruby Ridge. A 1993 investigation conducted by a \n     DOJ/FBI task force led to the imposition of discipline \n     against 12 FBI employees in 1995. However, information that \n     subsequently came to light has called into question the \n     integrity of that internal investigation. It was alleged for \n     example, that FBI supervisors who headed the internal \n     investigation were personal friends of some of the senior \n     executives they were investigating and that they failed to \n     take basic investigative steps that would have uncovered \n     significant new evidence on questions such as who had \n     approved the FBI's rules of engagement during the Ruby Ridge \n     siege. Based upon this new information, the Office of \n     Professional Responsibility for the Department of Justice and \n     a Task Force of the Justice Management Division recommended \n     in 1999 that two FBI senior executives be suspended and that \n     the FBI Director and one other FBI agent be censured. They \n     also recommended that discipline imposed in 1995 on three FBI \n     agents be rescinded because of procedural irregularities in \n     their disciplinary proceedings as well as exculpatory \n     evidence that had subsequently been developed. However, in \n     January of 2001, the outgoing Assistant Attorney General for \n     the Justice Management Division ruled that no new discipline \n     would be imposed against any FBI agents and that no \n     previously-imposed discipline would be rescinded. One of the \n     agents at our hearing described this decision as \n     ``outrageous'' and ``alarming.''\n       In order to evaluate these issues, we requested the \n     production of documents relating to the Justice Management \n     Division's disciplinary decision. The Department of Justice's \n     Office of Legislative Affairs provided our Committee with \n     outstanding cooperation and managed to pull together the \n     requested material in a short period of time. However, \n     because the material contained information that was subject \n     to protection under the Privacy Act, we agreed to return \n     all of the material, with the exception of one document, \n     at the conclusion of the hearing. We have requested, \n     however, that the Office of Legislative Affairs provide us \n     with copies of these documents with appropriate redactions \n     to comply with Privacy Act concerns.\n       Although our review of this material has necessarily been \n     limited by time constraints, what we have seen thus far has \n     confirmed that this material is relevant to the issues that \n     our Committee is examining, including the Justice Management \n     Division's January 2001 decision. It appears that the former \n     Assistant Attorney General's decision was based entirely upon \n     an April 17, 2000 memorandum by two Deputy Assistant \n     Attorneys General. That memorandum contains some surprising \n     conclusions. For example, the memorandum appears to conclude \n     that the FBI's rules of engagement at Ruby Ridge were not \n     contrary to any established Department of Justice policy. As \n     you may know, the Senate Subcommittee on Terrorism, \n     Technology and Government Information, after conducting \n     extensive hearings on the Ruby Ridge incident in 1995, \n     concluded that the rules of engagement were clearly \n     unconstitutional and contrary to the FBI's policy on the use \n     of deadly force. Indeed, the illegality of the rules of \n     engagement was conceded in testimony before the Subcommittee \n     by former Deputy Attorney General Gorelick and former FBI \n     Director Louis Freeh. Further, two FBI agents were \n     disciplined in 1995 for their part in promulgating the rules \n     of engagement, precisely because the rules were inconsistent \n     with established FBI policy on the use of deadly force. It is \n     therefore mystifying how anyone could still believe that the \n     rules of engagement were lawful.\n       The April 17 memorandum raises other troubling issues. For \n     example, the authors concluded that no discipline was \n     appropriate for senior FBI executives who conducted \n     incomplete investigations into the Ruby Ridge matter because \n     there was insufficient proof that their failures were the \n     result of intentional misconduct. However, under the \n     precedents employed by both the Department of Justice's and \n     the FBI's OPR, intentional misconduct has, in our view, never \n     been a prerequisite for imposing internal discipline; rather, \n     it has been sufficient that an FBI employee acted in reckless \n     disregard of an obligation or standard imposed by law, \n     applicable rule of professional conduct, or Department \n     regulation or policy. For example, according to other \n     documents we have reviewed, it appears that an FBI Inspector \n     who prepared the Ruby Ridge shooting incident report in \n     September 1992 was suspended for five days because Director \n     Freeh found that his analysis of the justification for the \n     shootings was incorrect and incomplete and because his report \n     showed ``inattention to detail'' in referring, for example, \n     to Vicki Weaver as ``Vicki Harris.'' It is difficult to \n     square the suspension imposed on this lower-level FBI \n     employee with the ruling of the Justice Management Division \n     that no discipline may be imposed on senior FBI executives in \n     the absence of proof of intentional misconduct.\n       We, of course, understand that none of thee matters \n     occurred under your watch. However, we believe that it is \n     important for our Committee to review carefully how decisions \n     on matters of internal discipline are made within the FBI. As \n     we are sure you can appreciate, the poisonous perception that \n     there is a double standard being applied threatens to \n     undermine FBI morale as well as public confidence. We would \n     therefore appreciate your providing us with appropriately-\n     redacted copies of the documents previously produced to our \n     Committee as soon as possible. In its report on Ruby Ridge \n     filed in December of 1995, the Subcommittee on Terrorism, \n     Technology and Government Information noted that allegations \n     of a cover-up in Ruby Ridge were then under investigation by \n     the Department of Justice, but that ``a full public airing of \n     this matter must eventually be undertaken'' and that ``the \n     Subcommittee will consider additional hearings to deal with \n     the cover-up allegations.'' (p. 1124). We intend to pursue \n     these matters\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\n     within the Committee to ensure that Congress, and the public, \n     are fully informed as to how the FBI handled these important \n     investigations.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick J.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 4, 1996 \nin Santa Monica, CA. Lawrence Ford, 61, a retired stockbroker, was \nfound beaten to death in his apartment, allegedly killed by a man who \nbelieved Ford was gay. Michael Robert Schafer, 28, was arrested and \nfaced first-degree murder and hate crime charges.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8907-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

FRED GILLIARD\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nrecognize a good friend of mine and a man who has committed his life to \neducation--Dr. Fred Gilliard.\n  Dr. Gilliard announced this year that he will retire as President of \nthe University of Great Falls on August 13, 2001.\n  I have seen first hand the impact Dr. Gilliard has had on the \nUniversity of Great Falls community. Without a doubt, he was a huge \nsuccess and will be missed.\n  Dr. Gilliard was proud of his students, staff and facility. Not only \ndid he understand the importance of a good, solid education, but he \nfollowed the mission of the University at work and everyday in his \nlife. When I read the mission of the University of Great Falls, three \nareas, in my view, tell us who Dr. Gilliard is and what he stands for:\n  Character--have a positive impact on the world and on the communities \nin which they live and work, particularly by recognizing and accepting \npersonal accountability to themselves, to society and to God;\n  Competence--further their ability to live full and rewarding lives by \nbecoming competent working members of society who know the basics of \ntheir professional field and have access to future learning;\n  Commitment--find meaning in life which enables them to participate \neffectively in society while transcending its limitations, by living \naccording to their own moral and religious convictions, as well as \nrespecting the dignity and beliefs of other people.\n  Dr. Gilliard achieved so much during his tenure as President. From \nintroducing the Student Service Learning Center, moving the institution \nfrom ``College'' to ``University'' status, and broadcasting classes \nover the Internet, to completing a successful capital campaign, \ncompleting the Jorgenson Library addition and re-starting the Argos \nmen's and women's basketball program. These are just a few Dr. \nGilliard's successes.\n  In early 2000, I called Fred to see if he would be interested in \nhosting ``Montana's Economic Development Summit'' at the University of \nGreat Falls. Without hesitation he said, ``yes.'' Since that time, Dr. \nGilliard has continued to work tirelessly to help me grow Montana's \neconomy.\n  I wish the best to Dr. Fred Gilliard and his wife, Berry Lynn. I know \nDr. Gilliard will be spending lots of his free time cheering for the \nDetriot Tigers with his grandson.\n  Semper Fi, Fred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8907-4", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8907-5", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8907-6", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:31 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.

A bill to designate the Federal building located at 10th \nStreet and Constitution Avenue, NW, in Washington, District of \nColumbia, as the ``Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building''; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with Senators \nHatch, Schumer, Specter, Clinton, and McCain, a bipartisan bill to name \nthe Department of Justice building in honor of the late Robert F. \nKennedy. I am also pleased to join the bipartisan efforts of \nCongressmen Roemer and Scarborough, who are introducing companion \nlegislation in the House of Representatives today.\n  Robert F. Kennedy was a man of great courage and conviction. Of his \nmany accomplishments during his life, the one we honor today is his \ntenure as Attorney General of the United States. Appointed by his \nbrother, President John F. Kennedy, on January 21, 1961, he served his \ncountry admirably in the office of Attorney General until September 3, \n1964.\n  During his tenure as Attorney General, Robert Kennedy led the fight \nagainst injustice and championed civil rights for all Americans. He \nordered United States Marshals to protect the Freedom Riders in \nMontgomery, Alabama. He sent Federal troops to open\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\nthe doors for James Meredith to walk with dignity as the first African-\nAmerican to attend the University of Mississippi. He pushed Congress to \nenact the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to guarantee basic freedoms for all \nour citizens, regardless of race, religion or creed.\n  Robert F. Kennedy's commitment to justice for all echoed in his fond \nsaying: ``Some men see things as they are and ask why; I dream of \nthings that never were and ask why not.''\n  Attorney General Kennedy also was a determined prosecutor. His \ninvestigated organized crime throughout America and became the first \nattorney general to establish coordinated federal law programs for the \nprosecution of organized crime. From 1960 to 1963, Department of \nJustice convictions against organized crime rose 800 percent because of \nhis efforts and dedication to bring organized crime figures to justice.\n  As Attorney General, Bobby Kennedy represented President Kennedy in \nforeign affairs and closely advised the President in times of trouble. \nAttorney General Kennedy's wise counsel during the Cuban Missile Crisis \nin October of 1962, as well as secret negotiations with the Soviet \nEmbassy, helped bring a peaceable end to the crisis.\n  The memory of Robert F. Kennedy lives on in the work of others who \ncare as much for justice as he did. As Attorney General, Robert Kennedy \nwrote these words: ``What happens to the country, to the world, depends \non what we do with what others have left us.'' It is in that spirit \nthat we honor him today.\n  I am proud to led this bipartisan effort to name the Department of \nJustice Building after Robert F. Kennedy with the greatest respect, \nadmiration and appreciation for his service to his country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ENSIGN (for himself and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1349. A bill to provide for a National Stem Cell Donor Bank \nregarding qualifying human stem cells, and for the conduct and support \nof research using such cells; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague John Ensign \nof Nevada in proud support of The Responsible Stem Cell Research Act of \n2001, legislation aimed at committing our Nation to a bold investment \nin promising, ethical medical research with which we all can live.\n  As my colleagues well know, the issue of stem cell research has been \nthe subject of rigorous debate in Congress, within the medical, \nbioethical, legal, and patient advocacy communities, and on the pages \nand airwaves of the local and national media.\n  Over the past several months in particular the American public has \nbeen witness and subject to a maddening barrage of charges and \ncountercharges about how our public conscience may or may not \ncountenance the deliberate destruction of a human embryo for the \npurpose of research.\n  If one thing is clear on this controversial issue, it is that the \ncountry is divided about this wrenching dilemma, about whether or not \nthe Federal Government ought to lend support--and thus communal moral \nsanction--to the speculative potential of stem cell research which \ninvolves the destruction of human embryos. This is a profound policy \nquestion which is fraught with considerable ethical, moral and legal \nquestions. It requires that our body politic make the monumental \ndetermination that will forever brand our public conscience as to \nwhether a human embryo is a life, or conversely, a property which can \nbe destroyed and exploited for the advancement of science and research.\n  I fervently believe that fertilization produces a new member of the \nhuman species, that it is a categorical imperative that human life be \ntreated as an end and not a means. To use a human being, even a newly \nconceived one, as a commodity is never morally acceptable. Each person \nmust be treated as an end in himself, not as a means to improve someone \nelse's life.\n  Indeed, current Federal law explicitly prohibits Federal funding of \nexperiments that destroy embryos outside the womb precisely because \nindividual human life begins at fertilization.\n  But while President Bush continues to review the stem cell guidelines \nissued under the previous administration to determine whether or not \nthey violate current Federal law barring the use of Federal funds in \nresearch that leads to the destruction of embryos, and it is my hope \nthat President bush will uphold current Federal law and reject any \nsemantical nuances or euphemisms with regard to what embryonic stem \ncell research is all about, the field of promising research behind \nwhich all Americans can unite, which is ethical and beyond controversy, \nis that which involves embryonic-type post-natal stem cells.\n  Unfortunately, the opportunities for developing successful therapies \nfrom stem cells that do not require the destruction of human embryos \nhave been given relative short shrift by the media. But adult and other \npost-natal stem cells have been successfully extracted from umbilical \ncord blood, placentas, fat, cadaver brains, bone marrow, and tissues of \nthe spleen, pancreas, and other organs. They can be located in numerous \ncell and tissue types and can be transformed into virtually all cell \nand tissue types. And perhaps most important of all, these alternative \ncell therapies are already treating cartilage defects in children, \nsystemic lupus, and helping restore vision to patients who were legally \nblind, just to name a few. By contrast, embryonic stem cell research \nhas no equivalent record of success even in animal studies. Embryonic \ncells have never ameliorated one human malady.\n  In order to move forward with and build upon the successes of this \npromising research, the Responsible Stem Cell Research Act would \nauthorize $275 million for this ethical stem cell research which is \nactually proven to help hundreds of thousands of patients, with new \nclinical uses expanding almost weekly. This represents a 50 percent \nincrease in current NIH funding being devoted to this stem cell \nresearch.\n\n  This legislation would also establish a National Stem Cell Donor Bank \nfor umbilical cord blood and human placenta to generate a source of \nversatile, embryonic-type stem cells that could be matched with people \nwho need stem cells for treatment. These stem cells would be available \nfor biomedical research and clinical purposes.\n  No matter where one stands on the divisive issue of embryonic stem \ncell research, this issue and many others dealing with the rapid \nadvancements in biotechnology are coming to define the very important \nchoices which confront us as a society and the courses we must choose \nas policymakers. With stem cell research moving forward so rapidly, we \nhave a duty to be well educated to be able to make informed decisions \nabout these issues. For this reason, and because of biotechnology's \nprospects for affecting positive change in other areas of our lives \nsuch as in our agriculture community, I have recently joined as a \nmember of the bipartisan Senate Biotechnology Caucus. Co-chaired by our \ncolleagues Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Chris Dodd of Connecticut, \nthe Biotechnology Caucus regularly hosts educational forums for members \nof the Senate and their staff about a broad scope of biotech issues, \nfrom the increasing availability of genetically-engineered products to \nresearch, trade, and bioethics. The group also acts as a resource for \ninformation about biotechnology and encourage committee hearings on the \ntopic.\n  The possibility that biotechnology may help improve the health \nhumankind holds great promise and must be examined closely. But there \nis no reason for our Nation to lie fallow with respect to the federal \ngovernment's support for type of stem cell research which is life-\nfriendly and beyond controversy. It is my hope that our colleagues here \nin the Senate and in the House will pause from the rancor that has \nsurrounded the stem cell research debate and come to support the \nResponsible Stem Cell Research Act, an aggressive initiative to fund \nand develop promising medical research with which we all can live.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DAYTON:\n  S. 1350. A bill to amend the title XVIII of the Social Security Act \nto provide payment to medicare ambulance suppliers of the full costs of \nproviding such services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Medicare \nAccess\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nto Ambulance Service Act of 2001. Reliable ambulance service is often a \nmatter of life and death. This bill is designed to head off growing \nproblems that are putting ambulance providers in Minnesota and across \nthe country in financial jeopardy and affecting their ability to \ndeliver emergency services to patients.\n  The Medicare Access to Ambulance Service Act of 2001 will help \nambulance providers whose service quality is threatened by inadequate \nMedicare payments and the inappropriate payment denials by Medicare \nclaims processors. The continuing difficulties jeopardize the quality \nof care, and ultimately may increase the time it takes to respond to \nemergencies.\n  Recently my staff in Minnesota met with ambulance providers and \nMedicare beneficiaries in Hibbing, Duluth, Moorhead, St. Cloud, \nBemidji, Marshall, and Harmony, Minnesota to listen to their concerns \nover Medicare ambulance service. In every part of the State the stories \nwere the same. The biggest concern was Medicare's denial of ambulance \nclaims. Medicare has denied claims for such medical emergencies as \ncardiac arrest, heart attack, and stroke. One elderly woman from \nDuluth, Minnesota was so upset with the Medicare process and the year \nit took to get her claim paid, that when she needed an ambulance again \nshe called a taxi. This is unacceptable.\n  To make matters worse, when Congress enacted the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997 it required that ambulance payments be moved to a fee schedule \non a cost-neutral basis. Moving to a fee-schedule makes sense, but not \non a cost-neutral basis for a system that is already underfunded. The \nproposed fee-schedule is especially unfair to rural areas and will mean \nthe end of small ambulance providers in Minnesota and throughout the \ncountry.\n  My bill includes four components to address these problems. First, \nthe bill requires that the Medicare fee schedule be based on the \nnational average cost of providing the service. Second, the bill \nrequires the General Accounting Office to determine a reasonable \ndefinition for how to identify rural ambulance providers and higher \npayments for rural ambulance services. Third, the bill includes a \n``prudent layperson'' standard for the payment of emergency ambulance \nclaims. Simply stated, this provision means that if a reasonable person \nbelieved an emergency medical problem existed when the ambulance was \nrequested then Medicare would pay the claim. Minnesota already leads \nthe nation with this successfully implemented standard for all other \npatients, with the exception of those covered by Medicare. And finally, \nthe bill requires Medicare to adopt a ``condition coding'' to be used \nby the ambulance provider.\n  Medicare beneficiaries deserve more from the health insurance system \nthan additional anxiety in an emergency situation for a system into \nwhich they have paid. When people in Minnesota and across the country \nhave an emergency requiring an ambulance, they want to know that they \nwill quickly and reliably get the care they need. However, current \nMedicare policies and procedures are putting quality ambulance service \nat risk and are forcing many ambulance providers to struggle to stay in \nbusiness, especially in rural communities. My legislation addresses \nproblems that threaten quality ambulance service for patients in \nMinnesota and across the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1351. A bill to provide administrative subpoena authority to \napprehended fugitives; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would help Federal law enforcement track down and apprehend \ndangerous fugitives who are roaming the streets of America.\n  I am pleased to have as original cosponsors Senator Biden and Senator \nHatch. Both of them are distinguished members of this Body with \nextensive knowledge in crime issues, and I greatly appreciate their \nsupport on this important legislation.\n  Fugitives from justice pose a serious threat to public safety. These \ncriminals are evading the criminal justice system with impunity, and \nmany of them are committing more crimes while they are free. We should \nhelp law enforcement bring them to justice and prevent future crime.\n  It has been estimated that fifty percent of the crime in America is \ncommitted by five percent of the offenders. It is these serious, repeat \ncriminals, many of whom are fugitives, that law enforcement must \naddress today.\n  There are over 550,000 felony or other serious Federal and State \nfugitives listed in the National Crime Information Center database. The \nnumber has more than doubled since 1987, and is growing every year.\n  This bill would respond to the growing fugitive threat by providing \nthe Justice Department administrative subpoena authority for fugitives. \nFederal officers already have this crime-fighting tool in other areas, \nand this legislation would fill a serious gap that currently exists for \nfugitive investigations. Information such as telephone or apartment \nrecords may provide the missing link to track down a fugitive. Also, it \ncan be critical to track down leads very quickly because fugitives are \noften transient and the trail can quickly become cold.\n  The grand jury is routinely available to obtain information about the \nwhereabouts of those who are suspected of committing crimes. \nSurprisingly, the same cannot be said for those who were caught but got \naway. The grand jury is generally not an option to get information \nabout known fugitives who are evading justice.\n  It is true that a Federal prosecutor can seek the approval of a judge \nfor a administrative subpoena under the All Writs Act. However, it is a \nlong, time-consuming process to get overworked federal judges with \ncrowded dockets to act on these requests, especially if they are not \nrare. In any event, it may be too late by the time the court responds. \nAdministrative subpoenas can prevent costly delays.\n  Last year, we worked hard to give law enforcement tools to address \nthe serious fugitive threat, holding hearings and moving important \nlegislation. The Congress authorized $40 million over three years to \ncreate task forces led by the Marshals Service to apprehend dangerous \nfugitives. As part of this effort, the Senate passed administrative \nsubpoena authority twice by unanimous consent last year. However, this \nauthority was not included in the final legislation because it stalled \nin the House last year. I hope that, as we explain the need for this \nauthority and how it is really a very narrow expansion beyond current \nlaw, we will receive widespread support in both Houses of Congress.\n\n  Administrative subpoenas are not new to federal law enforcement. They \nhave existed for years to help authorities solve various crimes, \nincluding drug offenses, child pornography, and even health care fraud. \nHowever, this bill places greater restrictions on the use of the \nsubpoenas than currently exist in these other areas. These subpoenas \ncould be used only to obtain documents and records, not testimony.\n  None of us want a subpoena issued unless it is needed and fully \ncomplies with the law. This bill contains procedures for people to \nchallenge the subpoena that they receive and have a judge review \nwhether it should be issued. Judicial review is required in any case \nwhere the person requests it.\n  The subpoena authority has no impact on the Fourth Amendment and its \ngeneral prohibition on searches and seizures without a court-approved \nwarrant. Courts have routinely upheld administrative subpoenas as \nentirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Administrative subpoenas \ndo not allow law enforcement to enter a home or business to conduct any \nsearch.

Administrative subpoenas to apprehend fugitives.''.\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be able to join with \nSenators Thurmond and Hatch in introducing the Fugitive Apprehension \nAct of 2001. This bill authorizes the Attorney General to issue \nadministrative subpoenas in cases involving fugitives. Its passage will \nprovide law enforcement with the tools it needs to more effectively \ntrack and apprehend fugitives from justice, and I look forward to its \nprompt consideration.\n  Crime across the country continues to trend downwards, though we have \nseen some mixed statistical signals of late. As chairman of the newly-\ncreated Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I am extremely \nconcerned by the Nation's fugitive problem. According to estimates from \nthe Department of Justice, there are approximately 54,000 fugitives \nfrom justice in Federal cases. A total of 565,611 fugitives, including \nstate and local felony cases, have been entered into the database of \nthe National Crime Information Center, up from 340,000 10 years ago. \nBut this figure only begins to measure the problem, as the National \nCrime Information Center receives just 20 percent of all outstanding \nState and local felony warrants.\n  These fugitives from justice are a very real and dangerous concern. \nFor example, last December, there was a shooting in Wilmington, DE. The \nshooter was charged with attempted murder and weapons violations and \nwas jailed in Chester, PA, on a separate, earlier shooting charge. He \nthen posted $500 bail on those charges, and promptly fled the \njurisdiction. Members of Delaware's Violent Fugitive Task Force soon \ndetermined this violent criminal was hiding out in West Los Angeles. \nThey alerted local FBI agents, who soon located the fugitive in a car \nand tried to stop him. He led the agents on a two-mile, high-speed \nchase, crashed into a pole, then tried to escape on foot. He was \neventually captured, arrested, and he was recently returned to Delaware \nto face charges. This fugitive is particularly dangerous: he has a long \nrecord of drug and other offenses, including 52 arrests in Delaware \ndating all the way back to when he was 13.\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\n  Unfortunately, this incident from my home State is not an isolated \none, and we should not hamstring law enforcement when they try to catch \nthese criminals. To better equip our Federal law enforcement agents \nwith the resources they need to track and apprehend dangerous fugitives \nfrom justice, we need to make some changes to our criminal laws. The \nFugitive Apprehension Act of 2001 gives the Attorney General, \nprincipally through the United States Marshals Service, authority to \nissue administrative subpoenas in cases involving fugitives. Last year, \nthe Director of the Marshals Service testified as to the need for these \nsubpoenas in fugitive cases; he noted that seldom is a grand jury \navailable to issue a subpoena in these instances. In fugitive cases, \ntime is often of the essence and successful investigations depend on \nreal-time information, such as telephone subscriber and credit records. \nThe time required to get a court order can make the difference between \nwhether a fugitive is apprehended or remains at large.\n  Given the privacy concerns that rightfully arise whenever Fourth \nAmendment protections are impacted, I want to take a moment to describe \nsome of the safeguards in the bill we introduce today. First, and \nimportantly, the bill's provisions apply only to those fugitives \ncharged with or convicted of violent felonies or trafficking in drugs.\n  Second, the bill in no way authorizes searches by law enforcement \nagencies; the subpoenas envisioned by the bill may be used only to \nobtain documents. Witness testimony and searches still must meet the \nConstitution's warrant requirement.\n  Third, each administrative subpoena issued must be approved by the \nlocal United States Attorney for the district in which the subpoena \nwill be served. I realize the Marshals Service and other law \nenforcement groups would rather this safeguard not be in the bill, but \nI insisted upon its inclusion at this point so as to ensure this new \ninvestigative power is not abused. I look forward to continuing my \ndiscussions with the Marshals Service and others concerning the effect \nthis safeguard could have on their fugitive apprehensions.\n  Fourth, the bill allows the person on whom an administrative subpoena \nis served to request to a court that it be overturned--judicial review \nis mandated each time an administrative subpoena is challenged.\n  I am mindful of the fact that Federal law enforcement already has \nadministrative subpoena power in other types of cases, including drug \nenforcement, child abuse and child pornography investigations. The need \nfor administrative subpoena authority should be more clear in fugitive \ncases; there, the criminal being pursued has already proven his danger \nto society by committing a very serious crime. The bill we are \nintroducing today is quite limited in scope, and its built in \nsafeguards coupled with the opportunity for judicial review I believe \nbalance well the rights of individuals with the clear need to catch \nthose violent criminals on the lam, criminals whose very presence on \nour streets threatens us all. I thank Senator Thurmond for his \nleadership in this area, and I look forward to working with him and \nSenator Hatch to see this bill signed into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1352. A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to carry out the Americorps program as a voucher program that \nassists charities serving low-income individuals, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which \nreforms and expands service opportunities through the AmeriCorps \nprogram by transitioning the service program toward an individual model \nwith voucher-like awards to individuals desiring to serve low-income \nindividuals or communities. The goal is to decrease dependency on \nlarge, more permanent group service locations and dramatically increase \nthe scope of service opportunities and charitable locations which would \nbe eligible for voucher recipients to serve communities and to require \nthat site locations be predominantly serving low-income communities or \npeople.\n  Under the leadership of former Senator Harris Wofford and the States, \nsignificant steps were taken to improve the management of the \nAmeriCorps program of the Corporation for National Service, CNS, and I \nrecognize the dedication and contributions of AmeriCorps participants. \nI also believe that more can be done to expand the effectiveness of the \nAmeriCorps by expanding the opportunities for service and have been \nlooking at a number of options for more than a year.\n  The bill's approach to reform should better enable participants to \nget to know the communities that they are serving. It is also a goal of \nthis initiative to place an additional emphasis on the importance of \nleveraging volunteers and providing technical assistance and capacity \nbuilding skills for these organizations. This will increase the long-\nterm benefit which the organizations and the communities that they \nserve receive. The new proposal has some similarities to \nAmeriCorpsVISTA under the CNS but the scope of the proposed \nauthorization is limited to AmeriCorps, although I believe that other \nrestructuring may well be warranted.\n  The reform proposal includes the following elements: The individual \naward or voucher would be for use at charitable organizations \npredominantly serving the poor (like the current AmeriCorpsVISTA \nfocus). All eligible qualifying charities (consistent with IRS \nrequirements for 501(c)(3)'s) predominantly serving the poor would be \neligible locations for service. All receiving locations must comply \nwith the current supervisory and reporting requirements (e.g., web-\nbased reporting system) of the Corporation for National Service. The \nvoucher is awarded to the individual who chooses a qualified location \nfor service and not the charitable organization. The current education \nand stipend benefits of AmeriCorps would remain the same and be \nincluded with the new voucher. The education award may be given to \nanother individual chosen by the AmeriCorps volunteer without impacting \nthe ability of the donee to receive other sources of grant and \nscholarship assistance, increasing the attractiveness for older \nAmericans to participate. If the number of applicants exceeds the \navailable vouchers, a lottery system established by the Corporation for \nNational Service would be used to determine the selection of qualified \nvoucher recipients. The bill provides for consolidation of Americans \nand AmeriCorpsVISTA state offices to better leverage resources. A one-\nyear transition period to the new system is provided.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider this opportunity to reform \nAmeriCorps participants. I believe that refocusing the program on \npoverty alleviation efforts, expanded choice, and placing a greater \nemphasis on serving charities and the needy communities they serve \nthrough provision of expanded technical assistance and capacity \nbuilding services will provide a brighter future for AmeriCorps and a \nmore strategic contribution from this federally supported program for \nAmericans in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, and Mr. \n        Schumer):\n  S. 1355. A bill to prevent children from having access to firearms; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nKennedy, Levin, Reed, and Schumer to introduce the Children's Firearm \nAccess Prevention Act of 2001.\n  My legislation is modeled after similar legislation that Texas \nenacted into law under then Governor George W. Bush in 1995. It is my \nsincere hope that President Bush will work with Congress to enact this \nimportant bill.\n  While many in Congress have argued that the Second Amendment \nguarantees individuals the right to bear arms, there has been far less \ndiscussion about the corresponding responsibilities of gun owners to \nkeep their firearms away from children.\n  The Children's Firearm Access Prevention, CAP, Act of 2001 subjects \ngun owners to a prison sentence of up to 1 year and a fine of up to \n$4,000 when they fail to use a secure gun storage or safety device for \ntheir firearms and a juvenile under the age of 18 uses that firearm to \ncause serious bodily injury to themselves or others. The CAP bill also \nsubjects gun owners to a fine of up\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\nto $500 when they fail to use a secure gun storage or safety device for \ntheir firearm and a juvenile obtains access to the firearm.\n  My legislation includes commonsense exceptions. Gun owners would not \nbe subject to criminal or civil liability when a juvenile uses a \nfirearm in an act of lawful self-defense; takes the firearm off the \nperson of a law enforcement official; obtains the firearm as a result \nof an unlawful entry; or obtains the firearm during a time when the \njuvenile was engaged in agricultural enterprise. Gun owners would also \nnot be liable if they had no reasonable expectation that juveniles \nwould be on the premises, or if the juvenile was supervised by a person \nolder than 18 years of age and was engaging in hunting, sporting, or \nother lawful purposes.\n  CAP laws have reduced unintentional shootings in states that have \nenacted these laws. In Florida, the first State to pass a CAP law, \nunintentional shooting deaths dropped by more than 50 percent in the \nfirst year following enactment. 17 states, including my home state of \nIllinois, have enacted CAP laws.\n  A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, \nJAMA, in October of 1997 found a 23 percent decrease in unintentional \nfirearm related deaths among children younger than 15 in those States \nthat had implemented CAP laws. According to the JAMA article, if all 50 \nStates had CAP laws during the period of 1990-1994, 216 children might \nhave lived.\n  While I understand that some Americans feel safer with a gun in the \nhome, the sad reality is that a gun in the home is far more likely to \nbe used to kill a family member or a friend than to be used in self-\ndefense. Over 90 percent of handguns involved in unintentional \nshootings are obtained in the home where these shootings occur. Many \nunintentional shootings could be prevented if firearms were safely \nstored.\n  Children and easy access to guns are a recipe for tragedy. I ask my \nSenate colleagues to join me in this effort to protect children from \nthe dangers of gun violence.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a commission to review the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding injustices suffered by European Americans, \nEuropean Latin Americans, and European refugees during World War II; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Wartime \nTreatment of European Americans and Refugees Study Act. This bill would \ncreate a Commission to review the United States Government's treatment \nduring World War II of German Americans, Italian Americans, certain \nLatin Americans, and refugees of Nazi Germany.\n  I am very pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators Grassley \nand Kennedy, have joined me as cosponsors of this important bill. I \nparticularly want to thank them for their input and valuable \ncontributions to this bill.\n  The allied victory in the Second World War was an American triumph, \nand most of all, a triumph for human freedom. Today we rightly \ncelebrate the contributions of what Tom Brokaw has called the Greatest \nGeneration, the courage displayed by so many Americans in that terrible \nstruggle should be a source of pride for every American.\n  Those Americans fought, and often gave their lives, to restore \nfreedom and democracy abroad. But, as brave Americans fought enemies in \nEurope and the Pacific, here at home the U.S. government was curtailing \nthe freedom of its own people. Of course, every nation has the duty to \nprotect its homefront in wartime. But, even in war, we must respect the \nbasic freedoms for which so many Americans have given their lives, \nincluding untold numbers of German and Italian Americans.\n  Many Americans are by now aware that during World War II, under the \nauthority of Executive Order 9066, our government forced more than \n100,000 ethnic Japanese from their homes and into camps. This \nevacuation policy forced Japanese Americans to endure great hardship. \nApproximately 15,000 additional ethnic Japanese were selectively \ninterned in government operated internment camps. They often lost their \nbasic freedoms, their livelihood, and perhaps worst of all, suffered \nthe shame and humiliation of being locked behind barbed wire and \nmilitary guard, by their own government. Under the Civil Liberties Act \nof 1988, this shameful episode in American history received the \nofficial condemnation it deserved. Under the Act, people of Japanese \nancestry who suffered either relocation or selective internment \nreceived an apology and reparations, on behalf of the people of the \nUnited States.\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\n  But, while the treatment of Japanese Americans has finally received \nthe attention it deserves by the public, most Americans have never even \nheard about the approximately 11,000 ethnic Germans living in America, \nthe 3,200 ethnic Italians living in America, or the scores of ethnic \nBulgarians, Hungarians, Rumanians or other European Americans who were \ntaken from their homes and placed into internment camps during World \nWar II. Hundreds remained interned for up to three years after the war \nwas over.\n  Today I introduce legislation to convene an independent commission to \nexamine this tragic history, try to understand why it happened, and to \ntry to ensure that it never happens again. We must learn the lessons of \nhistory, however painful they might be for us, and for the families \nthat endured this shameful treatment. In a time of American heroism \nabroad, here at home we faltered. We failed to protect the liberty of \nall Americans. Through our restrictive immigration policies, we also \nfailed to offer safe harbor to European refugees fleeing Nazi genocide. \nWe turned away thousands of refugees fleeing Germany, delivering many \nof them to their deaths.\n  As a Nation we have been slow to address our conduct during the war. \nThere has finally been some measure of justice for Japanese Americans \nwho suffered in the United States, however little or however late. And \nCongress has finally begun to address the treatment of Italian \nAmericans. Last year, the President signed into law The Wartime \nViolation of Italian American Civil Liberties Act, which called for a \nreport from the Department of Justice detailing injustices suffered by \nItalian-Americans during World War II. I believe that this is a step in \nthe right direction, but an independent panel should be convened to \nconduct a full and thorough review.\n  I think many Americans would be surprised to learn that, to this day, \nmore than 50 years later, there has been no recognition of the ordeal \nof thousands of German Americans during and after the Second World War. \nThere has been no justice for ethnic Germans living in America who were \nbranded ``enemy aliens'' by their own government. The U.S. government \nlimited their travel, imposed curfews and seized their personal \nproperty. Thousands were interned in camps, often separated from other \nmembers of their family, living in miserable conditions. Many of these \nfamilies, including American children, were later shipped back to war-\ntorn Europe in exchange for Americans held there, and suffered \nterribly. It is past time for the U.S. Government to recognize the pain \nand anguish these actions caused.\n  And there has been no justice for European Latin Americans, including \nGerman and Austrian Jews, who were actually repatriated or deported to \nhostile, war-torn European Axis powers, often as part of an exchange \nfor Americans being held in those countries. The U.S. government \nuprooted these people from their homes and forced them into camps in \nthe United States, essentially kidnaping them from nations not even \ndirectly involved in the War. Again, many were then shipped for \nexchange to Europe.\n  And finally, there has been no justice for Europeans, often Jews, who \nsought refuge from the Nazis on our shores. We must examine the U.S. \nimmigration policies of the 1930s and 1940s that turned these people \naway, and often delivered them into the hands of the Third Reich.\n  This legislation proposes an independent commission to look at U.S. \npolicies during World War II, including the policies regarding German \nand Italian Americans, European Latin Americans, and the refugee \nimmigration policies of the World War II era.\n  In the 1940s, Germans and Italians were the two largest foreign-born \npopulations in the United States. Under the policy put in place by the \nU.S. government, thousands of aliens were simply arrested by the FBI. \nFar more often than not, these arrests were based on highly \nquestionable evidence. Those arrested were held indefinitely pending a \nhearing. Many times their families did not know where they had been \ntaken for weeks, and if both parents were taken, children were often \nleft to fend for themselves until family members or local governments \ntook custody of them.\n  They received a brief hearing before local hearing boards during \nwhich the local U.S. Attorney acted as prosecutor. The hearing boards \nthen recommended to the Department of Justice whether they should be \nreleased, paroled, or interned for the duration of the War. Despite the \nserious nature of this proceeding, those arrested did not have the \nright to have their own lawyer and did not have the right to confront \nwitnesses against them. The hearing boards would then send their \nrecommendations to the Department of Justice, where a final \ndetermination could take months. Internment orders were issued for the \nduration of the war. Ironically, many were interned on Ellis Island, \nwhere immigrants had been welcomed for decades.\n  Families, often left destitute, struggled to survive and often lost \ntheir homes. Finally, the government would permit families to join \ntheir loved ones in a family camp, where they would live indefinitely \nbehind barbed wire. These spouses and children were frequently American \ncitizens.\n  In addition to internment, all enemy aliens during World War II were \nsubject to strict regulations affecting their daily lives. Enemy aliens \nwere required to carry photo-bearing identification booklets at all \ntimes, were forbidden to travel beyond a five mile radius of their \nhomes, were required to turn in any short wave radios and cameras they \nowned. They were required to given the government a full-week's notice \nif they planned to spend a night away from home, and could not ride in \nairplanes. Thousands of enemy aliens were prohibited from entering \nmilitary zones, some even evacuated from their homes. Many aliens and \nEuropean American citizens were also subject to restrictions in or \nexcluded from military areas that collectively covered one-third of the \ncountry.\n\n  As I've said, there has been some recognition of the wrongs done to \nItalian Americans during the war, but there has yet to be any formal \nrecognition of the pain that German American families went through. So \nI want to take a few moments to give examples to help my colleagues and \nthe public understand the kind of harassment they endured.\n  The FBI searched tens of thousands of alien residences between 1943 \nand 1945. The stories of homes ransacked, or people being taken from \ntheir families for years, are chilling. Take the case of Guenther \nGreis. Mr. Greis, as U.S. citizen, was 17 years old when World War II \nbegan in 1941. On December 7, 1941 Guenther's father, a German citizen \nwho had lived in the U.S. for at least 15 years, and worked in the \nchemical industry, was arrested.\n  Weeks passed before Guenther, his mother, and his family of four \nboys, three born in the United States, finally learned where their \nmissing father had been taken. He was to be interned for the duration \nof the war. In the meantime, Guenther's family had struggled to keep \ntheir home. Even as their father was being detained by the government, \ntwo sons enlisted in the merchant Marines and served in the Pacific War \nZone on behalf of the United States. The remaining family eventually \nwas sent to the internment camp in Crystal City, TX, until Guenther and \nhis brother were released in 1946. Guenther's parents remained interned \nuntil 1947, two years after the end of the war. To this day, the Greis \nfamily does not have explanation of why their father was interned.\n  Or take the story of Anton Schroeger, a German citizen who came to \nAmerica at the age of 16, and by the time World War II began, had lived \nhalf his life in America. When World War II broke out, Anton was lucky \nto have a relatively high paying job as a skilled painter at the \nMilwaukee Road repair shops. Based on what Anton believed to be a false \ntip from somebody who wanted his job, however, Anton was arrested while \nat work, and taken to a series of interment camps. After his arrest, \nhis wife, Anna, insisted on joining him in the internment camps, and, \nin fact, gave birth to a daughter in a camp in Texas. After World War \nII, Anton earned a living working at lower paying jobs. Despite this \nordeal, Anton eventually became a U.S. citizen in 1952. His family is \ncertain that Anton did not engage in any activity that deserved such \ntreatment.\n  Let me say here that there may have been people affected by these \npolicies\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\nwho harbored sympathy for our adversaries, and was potentially \ndangerous. And every government must take steps to protect its \nhomefront in a time of war. But even the people who may have posed a \nthreat to our security should have had the basic protections enshrined \nin our Constitution. War tests all of our principles and values, \nwithout question. But it is during these times of conflict, and fear, \nthat we need to protect those principles the most.\n  At least 11,000 German-Americans were placed in internment camps \nduring WWII. Thousands more were denied basic freedoms that most of us \ntoday take for granted. These Germans and German-Americans deserve a \nfull fact-finding review and acknowledgement from the U.S. government, \nand they deserve to have their story told so that we may strive to \nensure that the individual rights of all Americans will remain free \nfrom arbitrary persecution.\n  The work of the commission created by this bill would include a \nreview of The Alien Enemy Act of 1798, which permitted this treatment \nunder U.S. law and remains on the books today. So, the first act of the \nCommission would involve a full and thorough review of the federal \ngovernment's treatment of European Americans and European Latin \nAmericans.\n  The second part of the Commission's work would be to study America's \ntreatment of refugees from Nazi Germany. After Hitler took power in \n1933, the freedoms of German Jews were eroded until many of them sought \ndesperately to flee the country. First came an economic boycott, the \nloss of civil rights, citizenship, and jobs.\n  Then, in November 1938, came the Kristallnacht pogrom, and \nultimately, incarceration and systematic murder in concentration camps. \nUnfortunately, as restrictions began to tighten and many Jews sought \nrefuge outside of Nazi Germany, America, instead of acting as a haven \nfor these refugees, was tightening its immigration rules. Between 1933 \nand 1939, 300,000 Germans, mostly Jews fleeing Nazi persecution, \napplied for visas to America. Yet only about 90,000 applicants were \never admitted into our nation.\n  The requirements just to be considered for a visa were formidable. An \napplicant had to submit an application, a birth certificate, a \ncertificate of good conduct from the German police, affidavits of good \nconduct, submit to a physical exam, proof of permission to leave a \ncountry of origin, proof of booked passage to the U.S., two sponsors in \nAmerica, and on and on. These requirements made immigrating to the U.S. \nvery difficult. Then, in 1941, a new regulation forbidding the granting \nof a visa to anyone who had relatives in an Axis-occupied territory \nessentially made seeking refuge in America impossible for many Jews.\n  Thanks to research conducted by the United States Holocaust Museum \nand other American scholars, we now have a fuller understanding of the \nramifications of U.S. immigration policies. To put the tragic results \nof those policies into perspective, I'll recount the fate of the \npassengers aboard a ship called the St. Louis. The St Louis sailed from \nHamburg in April 1939 with 937 passengers aboard. Over 900 of those \npassengers were Jews, attempting to flee Germany. America denied entry \nto the refugees on the ship, and it eventually sailed back to Antwerp \nin June 1939. From there, the refugees frantically searched for new \ncountries to offer them protection. Some of them succeeded, while many \ndid not, and were later detained and killed at Auschwitz.\n  Some attempts were made to allow the most vulnerable of these \nrefugees, children, into the United States. On February 9, 1939 the \nWagner-Rogers refugee bill was introduced in this very Senate. The bill \nwould have allowed admission to the United States of 20,000 German \nrefugee children under the age of 14 over a period of two years, in \naddition to the immigration normally permitted. But sadly, that bill \nwas not even considered by the full Senate.\n  The United States' failure to offer refuge to Jews attempting to flee \nthe Nazis is one of the most shameful periods in our history. We closed \nour borders to people fleeing persecution, and at the same time, within \nthose borders, we treated too many people of ``enemy ethnicity'' as \nthreats to a national security. The purpose of this proposed \ncommission, is to understand and acknowledge the United States' actions \nduring this period. As a Nation, we have repeatedly called on other \ncountries to acknowledge their wartime offenses against civilians. \nToday we have to ask of ourselves what we ask of other nations--why did \nwe do it, and how can we prevent it from happening again?\n  During the Second World War, we defeated terrible enemies abroad, but \nwe also lost something of ourselves as we denied freedoms to people at \nhome. For many, the nation they called home would never be the same to \nthem after their loyalty was questioned, and their lives were ripped \napart. Too many German and Italian Americans were harassed and \nhumiliated by the country where they lived, struggled, raised children, \nran businesses, and built their dreams for a better life. This was the \ncountry they chose, like millions before them, and like each and every \none of us. I hope by establishing a commission we can better understand \nhow we allowed such a gross injustice, and how we can guard against \nimplementing similar policies in the future.\n  No American can justify using ethnicity as a basis for the terrible \ntreatment these people endured. And there's no way we can justify the \npolicy which allowed European Latin Americans to be torn from their \nhomes, brought here to the U.S. under deplorable conditions to be \ninterned, and sometimes deported back to hostile European nations. \nFinally, there's surely no way we can justify our World War II era \nimmigration policy, which undoubtedly led to the deaths of thousands of \npeople--people who turned to the U.S., in fear and desperation, for a \nsafe harbor, and were tragically turned away.\n  We cannot learn from this troubling history unless we first seek to \nacknowledge it and understand it. Coming to terms with these events \nwill be difficult, but for the families who suffered under these \nwartime policies, it will be, at long last, a recognition of the ordeal \nthey went through at the hands of their own government. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation, so that we can learn from this \npainful past, and ensure that we will never again let our worst fears \ndrive us to neglect our most cherished freedoms. Thank you, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the Wartime Treatment \nof European Americans and Refugees Study Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill as ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1356\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment of \n     European Americans and Refugees Study Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has long encouraged other nations to \n     acknowledge their wartime offenses against civilians. Now, \n     the United States Government should fully assess its \n     treatment of European Americans and European Latin Americans \n     during World War II and its effect on Italian American, \n     German American, and other European American communities.\n       (2) The United States Government should also fully assess \n     its treatment of European refugees who fled persecution and \n     genocide in Europe to seek refuge in the United States prior \n     to and during World War II.\n       (3) During World War II, the United States Government \n     branded as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born \n     and 300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and \n     their families and required them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification, limited their travel, and seized their \n     personal property. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (4) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations, many to be exchanged for Americans held in those \n     nations.\n       (5) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American countries, many European Latin Americans, \n     including German and Austrian Jews, were captured, shipped to \n     the United States and interned. Many were later expatriated, \n     repatriated or deported to hostile, war-torn European Axis \n     nations during World War II, most to be exchanged for \n     Americans and Latin Americans held in those nations.\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\n       (6) Millions of European Americans served in the armed \n     forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (7) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the Italian Americans and German American \n     communities, individuals and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (8) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of European refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution and sought safety in the United States. During \n     the 1930's and 1940's, the quota system, immigration \n     regulations, visa requirements, and the time required to \n     process visa applications affected the number of European \n     refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, who \n     could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (9) Time is of the essence for the establishment of a \n     Commission, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Feingold and \nmy other colleagues in the Senate in introducing the Wartime Treatment \nof European Americans and Refugees Study Act. This legislation will \nauthorize the study of U.S. policies and practices during World War II \nthat resulted in severe civil liberties violations against European \nAmericans and European Latin Americans. The bill also authorizes an \ninvestigation into U.S. refugee policy during World War II that caused \nmany persons seeking safe haven to be turned away from our shores.\n  This bill will examine these issues by establishing a commission to \ninvestigate U.S. policies and programs during that period. Other \ncountries are re-examining their own policies, and so must the United \nStates. Identifying the abuses of the past is one of the best ways to \nensure that they never happen again. I urge the Senate to adopt this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1357. A bill to provide for an examination of how schools are \nimplementing the policy guidance of the Department of Education's \nOffice for Civil Rights relating to sexual harassment directed against \ngay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am introducing a modest bill \nthat can help us take an important step toward providing all of \nAmerica's students physically and psychologically safe school \nenvironments so they can live up to their full potential as students. I \nappreciate that Senator Feingold is joining me as an original co-\nsponsor.\n  Unfortunately, there is increasing evidence that schools are anything \nbut safe havens for American students who are gay and lesbian, or for \nthose who are perceived to be gay or lesbian. Two studies in recent \nmonths have focused on the issue of school harassment of gay and \nlesbian students. A 7-State study of abuses of gay and lesbian students \nby their peers, conducted by Human Rights Watch, found that these \nstudents often were not protected by school officials, and that in some \ncases harassment was even condoned by teachers and administrators. That \nreport's troubling summation was that, ``Gay youth spend an inordinate \namount of energy plotting how to get safely to and from school, how to \navoid the hallways when other students are present so they can avoid \nslurs and shoves, how to cut gym class to escape being beaten up, in \nshort, how to become invisible so they will not be verbally and \nphysically attacked. Too often, students have little energy left to \nlearn.'' A second, more general report on school bullying, conducted by \nthe American Association of University Women, AAUW, found that 61 \npercent of students had seen fellow students bullied for being gay or \nlesbian, whether or not the students actually were gay or lesbian. Boys \nwere the most likely target of such teasing, according to the report.\n  Further, the recent Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote \nSexual Health and Responsible Behavior notes that ``anti-homosexual \nattitudes are associated with psychological distress for homosexual \npersons and may have a negative impact on mental health, including a \ngreater incidence of depression and suicide, lower self-acceptance and \na greater likelihood of hiding sexual orientation.'' That report finds \nthat: ``Averaged over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and \nlesbians have experienced verbal or physical harassment on the basis of \ntheir orientation, 45 percent had been threatened with violence, and 17 \npercent had experienced a physical attack.''\n  These studies and numerous journalistic reports describe the verbal, \nphysical and psychological abuse that becomes part of two many gay, \nlesbian, bisexual and transgendered students' daily lives.\n  We should seek to provide equal learning experiences for gay and \nlesbian students. We should also be concerned about the widespread \nbullying of students with sexual orientation-based epithets in view of \nthe growing evidence that students who are bullied are more likely to \nharm their fellow students.\n  The Department of Education's ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: \nHarassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, or Third \nParties,'' issued in 1997 by the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights, \nincludes in one section the following statement: ``sexual harassment \ndirected at gay or lesbian students that is sufficiently serious to \nlimit or deny a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the \nschool's program constitutes sexual harassment prohibited by Title \nIX.'' This guidance was revised in 2001, clarifying that school \nofficials have a responsibility to respond to ``acts of verbal, \nnonverbal, or physical aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on \nsex or sex-stereotyping.''\n  In spite of the Department's existing guidance, evidence is clear \nthat harassment of gay students remains a serious problem. Even so, the \nAAUW study cited earlier points out that many schools and universities \nhave not established grievance procedures or designate any \nrepresentative to address complaints of sex discrimination, including \nharassment.\n  To better understand the true level of sexual harassment against gay \nand lesbian students by peers and school officials in schools, as well \nas the degree to which schools are employing the Office of Civil \nRights, OCR, standard in reacting against such cases of harassment, \nthis bill calls for a study by the Commission on Civil Rights. The \nstudy would seek to answer five questions:\n  What is the best estimate of the true level of harassment against gay \nand lesbian students in America's schools and universities, applying \nthe OCR standard?\n  What is the best estimate of the level of gender-based harassment \nsuch as that described in the 2001 update of the policy guidance that \nnegatively affects the learning environment of gay and lesbian \nstudents?\n  To what degree are school officials and teachers aware of the \nalteration of the guidelines in 1997 that now includes certain \nharassment of gay and lesbian students?\n  Are the 1997 guidelines being accurately and aggressively enforced by \nschools?\n  What are the Commission's recommendations for an alternation in \npolicy or enforcement based on the findings of the study?\n  The bill calls for completion of the study within 18 months so that \nCongress can act thoughtfully in working to create safe learning \nenvironments for all our students, gay and straight alike. It is \nendorsed by a number of the groups focused on promoting learning \nenvironments that are safe ones for gay students. I hope my colleagues \nwill support it also.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\n                                S. 1357\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Although title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 \n     (20 U.S.C. 1681 et seq.) does not prohibit discrimination on \n     the basis of sexual orientation, one section of the \n     Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights' 1997 final \n     policy guidance, entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: \n     Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, \n     or Third Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March \n     13, 1997, 62 Fed. Reg. 12034, included a determination that \n     ``sexual harassment directed at gay or lesbian students that \n     is sufficiently serious to limit or deny a student's ability \n     to participate in or benefit from the school's program \n     constitutes sexual harassment prohibited by title IX under \n     the circumstances described in this guidance.''. This \n     language was unchanged in a 2001 update of the policy \n     guidance entitled ``Revised Sexual Harassment Guidance: \n     Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, \n     or Third Parties'' for which a notice of availability was \n     published in the Federal Register on January 19, 2001, 66 \n     Fed. Reg. 5512.\n       (2) That section of the 2001 ``Revised Sexual Harassment \n     Guidance: Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other \n     Students, or Third Parties'' went on to state: ``Though \n     beyond the scope of this guidance, gender-based harassment, \n     which may include acts of verbal, nonverbal, or physical \n     aggression, intimidation, or hostility based on sex or sex-\n     stereotyping, but not involving conduct of a sexual nature, \n     is also a form of sex discrimination to which a school must \n     respond, if it rises to the level that denies or limits a \n     student's ability to participate in or benefit from the \n     educational program. . . . A school must respond to such \n     harassment in accordance with the standards and procedures \n     described in this guidance.''.\n       (3) There is evidence that brings into question the degree \n     to which the policy guidance on sexual harassment against \n     gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students is being \n     implemented. For example, a 7-State study by Human Rights \n     Watch of the abuses suffered by gay, lesbian, bisexual, and \n     transgender students at the hands of their peers, published \n     in ``Hatred in the Hallways: Violence and Discrimination \n     Against Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Students in \n     U.S. Schools'' found that such students were often the \n     victims of abuses.\n       (4) A 2000 study by the American Association of University \n     Women focused on implementation of title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972 more generally, and the findings of that \n     study, published in ``A License for Bias: Sex Discrimination, \n     Schools, and Title IX'', included a finding that many schools \n     and universities have not established procedures for handling \n     title IX-based grievances.\n       (5) The 2001 report of the Surgeon General, entitled \n     ``Surgeon General's Call to Action to Promote Sexual Health \n     and Responsible Sexual Behavior'' notes that ``antihomosexual \n     attitudes are associated with psychological distress for \n     homosexual persons and may have a negative impact on mental \n     health, including a greater incidence of depression and \n     suicide, lower self-acceptance and a greater likelihood of \n     hiding sexual orientation.''. It goes on to report: \n     ``Averaged over two dozen studies, 80 percent of gay men and \n     lesbians had experienced verbal or physical harassment on the \n     basis of their orientation, 45 percent had been threatened \n     with violence, and 17 percent had experienced a physical \n     attack.''.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for an \n     examination of how secondary schools are implementing the \n     policy guidance of the Department of Education's Office for \n     Civil Rights related to sexual harassment directed against \n     gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender students.\n\n     SEC. 2. STUDY OF HOW EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE \n                   IMPLEMENTING THE POLICY GUIDANCE RELATING TO \n                   SEXUAL HARASSMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The United States Commission on Civil \n     Rights (hereafter in this Act referred to as the \n     ``Commission'') shall conduct a study of the 1997 final \n     policy guidance entitled ``Sexual Harassment Guidance: \n     Harassment of Students by School Employees, Other Students, \n     or Third Parties'' published in the Federal Register on March \n     13, 1997, 62 Fed.

Reg. 5512;\n       (C) the level of awareness by school officials and students \n     of the policy guidance described in subsection (a); and\n       (D) the level of implementation of such policy guidance.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``secondary \n     school'' has the meaning given the term in section 14101 of \n     the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \n     8801).\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORTING OF FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 18 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Commission shall transmit to \n     Congress and to the Secretary of Education--\n       (1) a report of the Commission's findings under section 2; \n     and\n       (2) any policy recommendations developed by the Commission \n     based upon the study carried out under section 2.\n       (b) Dissemination.--The report and recommendations shall be \n     disseminated, in a manner that is easily understandable, to \n     the public by means that include the Internet.\n\n     SEC. 4. COOPERATION OF FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The head of each Federal department or \n     agency shall cooperate in all respects with the Commission \n     with respect to the study under section 2.\n       (b) Information.--The head of each Federal department or \n     agency shall provide to the Commission, to the extent \n     permitted by law, such data, reports, and documents \n     concerning the subject matter of such study as the Commission \n     may request.\n       (c) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Federal \n     department or agency'' means any agency as defined in section \n     551 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this Act, such sums as may be necessary for fiscal \n     year 2002.\n       (b) Availability.--Any amount appropriated under the \n     authority of subsection (a) shall remain available until \n     expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAYH:\n  S. 1358.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Facilitating Access to \n     Speedy Transmissions for Networks, E-commerce and \n     Telecommunications (FASTNET) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 was enacted to \n     foster the rapid deployment of advanced telecommunications \n     and information technologies and services to all Americans by \n     promoting competition and reducing regulation in \n     telecommunications markets nationwide.\n       (2) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 specifically \n     recognized the unique abilities and circumstances of local \n     exchange carriers with fewer than two percent of the Nation's \n     subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide.\n       (3) Given the markets two percent carriers typically serve, \n     such carriers are uniquely positioned to accelerate the \n     deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives \n     for the benefit of consumers in less densely populated \n     regions of the Nation.\n       (4) Existing regulations are typically tailored to the \n     circumstances of larger carriers and therefore often impose \n     disproportionate burdens on two percent carriers, impeding \n     such carriers' deployment of advanced telecommunications \n     services and competitive initiatives to consumers in less \n     densely populated regions of the Nation.\n       (5) Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers \n     will enable such carriers to devote additional resources to \n     the deployment of advanced services and to competitive \n     initiatives to benefit consumers in less densely populated \n     regions of the Nation.\n       (6) Reducing regulatory burdens on two percent carriers \n     will increase such carriers' ability to respond to \n     marketplace conditions, allowing them to accelerate \n     deployment of advanced services and competitive initiatives \n     to benefit consumers in less densely populated regions of the \n     Nation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to accelerate the deployment of advanced services and \n     the development of competition in the telecommunications \n     industry for the benefit of consumers in all regions of the \n     Nation, consistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n     by reducing regulatory burdens on local exchange carriers \n     with fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines \n     installed in the aggregate nationwide;\n       (2) to improve such carriers' flexibility to undertake such \n     initiatives; and\n       (3) to allow such carriers to redirect resources from \n     paying the costs of such regulatory burdens to increasing \n     investment in such initiatives.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION.\n\n       Section 3 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 153) \n     is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (51) and (52) as paragraphs \n     (52) and (53), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (50) the following:\n       ``(51) Two percent carrier.--The term `two percent carrier' \n     means an incumbent local exchange carrier within the meaning \n     of section 251(h) whose access lines, when aggregated with \n     the access lines of any local exchange carrier that such \n     incumbent local exchange carrier directly or indirectly \n     controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, \n     are fewer than two percent of the Nation's subscriber lines \n     installed in the aggregate nationwide.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

To reauthorize the Price-Anderson provisions of the Atomic \nEnergy Act of 1954; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto reauthorize the Price Anderson Act, which provides the insurance \nprogram for our Nation's commercial nuclear reactor fleet. In 1954, \nCongress passed the Atomic Energy Act which ended the government \nmonopoly over possession, use, and manufacturing of ``special nuclear \nmaterial''. While the Act allowed the private sector access to the \nnuclear market, due to concerns over liability, the private sector was \nextremely hesitant to invest in the new market.\n  Due to these liability concerns, Congress passed the Price-Anderson \nAct in 1957, the Act was reauthorized on three occasions, most recently \nin 1988. The Act is due to be reauthorized in 2002. In 1998 the NRC \nissued their report to Congress called ``The Price Anderson Act--\nCrossing the Bridge to the Next Century: A Report to Congress.'' In \nthat report the NRC recommended renewal of the Price Anderson Act \nbecause the Act provides a valuable public benefit by establishing a \nsystem for prompt and equitable steelement of public liability claims \nresulting from a nuclear accident.\n  While the report originally suggested that consideration be given to \ndoubling the maximum annual retrospective premium installment from each \npower reactor license, the NRC has reconsidered this suggestion and now \nrecommends that original premium level be retained. They expressed this \nview in a letter to me, as the Chairman of the Nuclear Safety \nSubcommittee on May 11th of this year.\n  The reason for the change is that in 1998 the NRC had projected that \nmany of the existing commercial reactors would not file for license \nrenewal. The drop in the number of reactors would cause a corresponding \ndrop in the contributions to the fund. There is now heightened interest \nin extending the operating license of most of the commercial reactors. \nTherefore an increase in the premium from each reactor is no longer \nnecessary. This has occurred because of the growing interest in nuclear \nenergy. Nuclear energy is a clean, emissions-free source of electricity \nwhich currently provides almost twenty percent of our nation's energy \nsupply.\n  This legislation will help further the commercial application of \nnuclear energy for electricity, as well as the growing number of \nmedical applications of nuclear medicine. Nuclear energy is vital to \nsupplying cost-efficient and environmentally sound power to the \nAmerican consumer. This legislation will continue to ensure the \navailability of our commercial nuclear reactor program. I am joined in \nintroducing this legislation by the ranking members of the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Smith, and the Nuclear \nSafety Subcommittee Senator Inhofe, as well as an important member of \nthe Subcommittee Senator Crapo.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNETT:\n  S. 1361. A bill to amend the Central Utah Project Completion Act to \nclarify the responsibilities of the Secretary of the Interior with \nrespect to the Central Utah Project, to redirect unexpended budget \nauthority for the Central Utah Project for wastewater treatment and \nreuse and other purposes, to provide for prepayment of repayment \ncontracts for municipal and industrial water delivery facilities, and \nto eliminate a deadline for such prepayment; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would amend the Central Utah Project Completion Act, CUPCA, as \noriginally enacted in 1992. CUPCA re-authorized and provided funding \nfor the completion of the Central Utah Project, CUP, a project that \ndevelops Utah's share of water from the Colorado River for use in ten \ncentral Utah counties. The CUP was originally authorized in 1956 as \npart of the Colorado River Storage Project Act and includes five units. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation began construction of this project in 1964. \nHowever, in 1992 CUPCA conferred CUP planning and construction \nresponsibilities to the Central Utah Water Conservancy District, which \nhas cultivated an excellent working relationship with the Office of CUP \nCompletion in the Interior Department.\n  The legislation I am introducing would amend CUPCA to clarify the \nrelationship between the Department of the Interior and the CUP by \nensuring that the Secretary of the Interior continue to retain full \nresponsibility for the CUP after the completion of the project's \nconstruction phase. It only makes sense that the decisions regarding \nfuture operations and maintenance, contract negotiations, and program \noversight functions of the Interior Department are consistent with the \ncooperative decisions made during the project's planning and \nconstruction stages. As such, language is needed to clarify the \nSecretary's further involvement.\n  Since 1992, numerous changes in the project have occurred to better \nreflect contemporary water needs. Certain project features were \ndownsized or eliminated while other water management programs grew in \nsize. The 106th Congress, in an effort to address these changes, \napproved a CUPCA amendment that allowed unused funding authorization \nresulting from the redesign of the Bonneville Unit to be used ``to \nacquire water and water rights for project purposes including in stream \nflows, to complete project facilities authorized in this title and \ntitle III, to implement water conservation measure . . .'' In light of \nthe continuing need to address the redesign replacement projects \noriginally designed in the sixties, my legislation would again extend \nthe unused authorization provision to all CUP units.\n  Finally, this legislation also extends a CUPCA provision that \nauthorizes the Secretary of the Interior to accept prepayment of parts \nof the project's Municipal and Industrial repayment debt. The original \nprovision's expiration was to occur in 2002 for reasons relating to the \nFederal Budget scoring process. This provision has enabled the Central \nUtah Water Conservancy District to prepay over $138 million to the \nfederal treasury, while also avoiding unnecessary interest charges. The \nlegislation introduced today would remove the 2002 expiration provision \nand extends the provision to allow the repayment of obligations \nassociated with projects relating to the Uinta Basin.\n  The water supplied by CUP's many water diversion projects is crucial \nto the livelihoods of Utah's rural residents and to Utah's burgeoning \npopulation. I believe that legislation will serve to better facilitate \nthe timely, economically responsible, and fiscally efficient completion \nof the Central Utah Project.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1362. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act and \ntitle VII of the Public Health Service Act to expand medical residency \ntraining programs in geriatrics, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined by my \ncolleague, Senator Craig, In introducing the Advancement of Geriatric \nEducation Act of 2001, or AGE Act is comprehensive legislation which \nseeks to prepare physicians and other health care professionals to care \nfor our Nation's growing aging population.\n  It is a know fact that children cannot be treated like little adults \nand prescribed the same medications in the same dosage amounts. For \nthis reason, we have pediatricians. But just as there are differences \nbetween children and adults, so are there differences between middle \naged adults and seniors. Many people are unaware that aging individuals \noften exhibit different symptoms than younger adults with the same \nillness. For example, an older person who has a heart attack may not \nexperience excruciating chest pain, but rather, show signs of dizziness \nand confusion. Similarly, older people often exhibit different \nresponses to medications than younger people.\n  The demographic reality is that there is an enormous segment of the \npopulation which will soon be age 65 or older, and there is serious \ndoubt that the U.S. health system will be equipped to handle the \nmultiple needs and demand of an aging population. By 2030, it is \nprojected that one in five Americans will be over age 65.\n  Geriatricians are physicians who are experts in aging-related issues \nand the\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nstudy of the aging process itself. They are specially trained to \nprevent and manage the unique and often multiple health problems of \nolder adults. Geriatric training can provide health care professionals \nwith the skills and knowledge to recognize special characteristics of \nolder patients and distinguish between disease states and the normal \nphysiological changes associated with aging. Our health care system \nmust increase its focus in this vital area.\n  Today, there are 9,000 practicing, certified geriatricians in the \nUnited States, far short of the 20,000 geriatricians estimated to be \nnecessary to meet the needs of the current aging population. By the \nyear 2030, it is estimated that at least 36,000 geriatricians will be \nneeded to manage the complex health and social needs of the elderly. \nThese figures, as astounding as they sound, say nothing of the \ngeriatrics training needed for all health care professionals who are \nfacing such an increasingly older patient population.\n  Unfortunately, out of 125 medical schools in our country, only 3 have \nactual Departments of Geriatrics, including the University of Arkansas \nfor Medical Sciences. Moreover, only 14 schools include geriatrics as a \nrequired course, and one-third of medical schools do not even offer \ngeriatrics as a separate course elective.\n  Congress has taken some positive steps to increase our focus on \ngeriatrics, including the establishment of Geriatric Education Centers \nand Geriatric Training Programs, which seek to train all health \nprofessionals in the area of geriatrics. Congress has also established \nthe Geriatric Academic Career Award program, which promotes the \ndevelopment of academic geriatricians.\n  It is clear to me, however, that more steps need to be taken, which \nis why I have introduced the AGE Act today. The AGE Act encourages more \nphysicians to specialize in the area of geriatrics and enhances the \ncurrent federal programs relating to geriatrics under the Public Health \nService Act. The AGE Act is supported by the American Geriatrics \nSociety, the International Longevity Center, and the American \nAssociation of Geriatric Psychiatry. I ask unanimous consent that a \nsummary of the AGE Act and the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1362\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The \n     1997 BBA instituted a per-hospital cap based on the number of \n     GME residency slots in existence on or before December 31, \n     1996. As geriatrics is a relatively new specialty, the cap \n     has resulted in either the elimination or reduction of \n     geriatric of geriatric training programs. This is because a \n     lower number of geriatric residents existed prior to December \n     31, 1996. The AGE Act provides for an exception from the cap \n     for up to 5 geriatric residents.\n\n\n    ii. requires medicare gme payment for the 2nd year of geriatric \n                          fellowship training\n\n       Under current law, hospitals receive 100 percent GME \n     reimbursement for an individuals's initial residency period, \n     up to five years. The law also includes a geriatric exception \n     allowing programs training geriatric fellows to receive full \n     funding for an\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\n     additional period comprised of the first and second years of \n     fellowship training. Programs training non-geriatric fellows \n     receive 50 percent of GME funding for fellowship training. In \n     1998, the period of board eligibility for geriatrics was \n     decreased to one year, in an effort to encourage more \n     geriatrics specialists. However, this change was not intended \n     to reduce support for training of teachers and researchers in \n     geriatrics. A two-year fellowship remains the generally \n     accepted standard, and is generally required to become an \n     academic geriatrician. The AGE Act explicitly authorizes \n     Medicare GME payments for the second year of fellowship.\n\n\n  iii. directs the secretary of hhs to report to congress on ways to \nimprove the medicare programs to ready the physician workforce to serve \n    the aging population, including whether an initiative should be \n             established to develop academic geriatricians\n\n       It is estimated that the country currently has one-quarter \n     of the academic geriatricians necessary to train and educate \n     physicians in the area of geriatrics. Out of 125 medical \n     schools in our country, only 3 have actual Departments of \n     Geriatrics. Moreover, only 14 schools include geriatrics as a \n     requried course, and one third of medical schools do not even \n     offer geriatrics as a separate course elective. The AGE Act \n     requires the Secretary of HHS to examine ways to prepare the \n     physician workforce to serve the aging population, including \n     initiatives to develop academic geriatricians, and to report \n     to Congress within 6 months after the date of enactment.\n\n\niv. enhances and authorizes greater funding for the geriatric training \n               sections of the public health service act\n\n       Section 735, Title VII of the Public Health Service Act, \n     encompasses Geriatric Education Centers, which provide \n     geriatrics training to all health professionals (Arkansas has \n     a Geriatric Education Center program), a program to provide \n     geriatric training to dentists and behavioral and mental \n     health benefits, and the Geriatrics Academic Development \n     Award program, which creates junior faculty awards to \n     encourage the development of academic geriatricians. The AGE \n     Act increases the amount of the Geriatric Academic \n     Development Award from $50,000 to $75,000, and authorizes \n     greater funding for all three programs in Fiscal Years 2002 \n     through 2006 ($20 million in Fiscal Year 2002, $24 million in \n     Fiscal Year 2003, $28 million in Fiscal Year 2004, $32 \n     million in Fiscal Year 2005, and $36 million in Fiscal Year \n     2006).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Leahy, \n        and Mr. Jeffords):\n  S. 1363. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance in implementing cultural heritage, conservation, and \nrecreational activities in the Connecticut River watershed of the \nStates of New Hampshire and Vermont; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce \nthe Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act of 2001. This legislation \nis a truly locally-led initiative. I believe it will result in great \nenvironmental benefits for the Connecticut River.\n  The Connecticut River forms the border to New Hampshire and Vermont \nand provides for a great deal of recreational and tourism opportunities \nfor residents of both States. This legislation takes a major step \nforward in making sure this River continues to thrive as a treasured \nresource.\n  To understand just how significant this legislation is, I would like \nto share with my colleagues some history about the Connecticut River \nprogram. In 1987-88, New Hampshire and Vermont each created a \ncommission to address environmental issues facing the Connecticut river \nvalley. The commissions were established to coordinate water quality \nand various other environmental efforts along the Connecticut river \nvalley. The two commissions came together in 1990 to form the \nConnecticut River Joint Commission. The Joint Commission has no \nregulatory authority, but carries out cooperative education and \nadvisory activities.\n  To further the local influence of the Commission, the Connecticut \nRiver Joint Commission established five advisory bi-state local river \nsubcommittees comprised of representatives nominated by the governing \nbody of their municipalities. These advisory groups developed a \nConnecticut River Corridor Management Plan. A major portion of the plan \nfocuses on channeling federal funds to local communities to implement \nwater quality programs, nonpoint source pollution controls and other \nenvironmental projects. Over the last ten years, the Connecticut River \nJoint Commission has fostered widespread participation and laid a \nstrong foundation of community and citizen involvement.\n  As a Senator from New Hampshire and the ranking Republican of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, as well as someone who enjoys \nthe beauty of the Connecticut River, I am proud to be the principal \nauthor and cosponsor of this locally led, voluntary effort that \naccomplishes real environmental progress. Too often we depend on \nbureaucratic federal regulatory programs to accomplish environmental \nsuccess. This bill takes a different approach and one that I bet will \nachieve greater results on the ground. I hope that other communities \nand neighboring states will look at this model as an example of how to \ndevelop and implement true voluntary, on the ground, locally-led \nenvironmental programs.\n  I want to thank my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and \nthe two distinguished Senators of Vermont, Senators Leahy and Jeffords, \nfor joining me as original cosponsors to this legislation. I look \nforward to working with them as we move this important legislation \nthrough the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1364. A bill to ensure full and expeditious enforcement of the \nprovisions of the Communications Act of 1934 that seek to bring about \nthe competition in local telecommunications markets, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce, S. 1364, the \nTelecommunications competition Enforcement Act of 2001.\n  I introduce this bill to affirm and enforce the competitive tenants \nof the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Some want to deregulate the Bell \ncompanies and mistakenly assert that deregulation will lead to \nincreased deployment of broadband services. I disagree. The evidence \nsimply does not support such a conclusion. It is only through \nstrengthening and enforcing the competitive provisions of the 1996 Act \nthat local phone markets will become open to competition and the \ndelivery of advanced services will be enhanced.\n  Congress in conjunction with members of the industry worked to pass \nthe 1996 Act. I should note that at that time, everyone realized the \nimpending innovations in technology and the potential for new and \nadvanced services. These technological changes were expected to allow \nphone companies to provide high speed data and video services over \ntheir facilities, while also allowing cable companies to provide high \nspeed data and phone services over their facilities. It was \nunquestionably understood by everyone involved that competition would \nbe the driving force for incumbent companies to provide new services. \nAnd was this the right way to proceed? Of course it was. A wall street \nanalysis with Montgomery Securities stated that ``RBOCs have finally \nbegun to feel the competitive pressure from both CLECs and cable modem \nproviders and are now planning to . . . accelerate/expand deployment of \nADSL in order to counter the threat.'' Another wall street analyst with \nPrudential Securities noted that with respect to RBOC deployment of \nbroadband service an ``important motivating factor is the threat of \ncompetition [and] [o]ther players are taking dead aim at the high-speed \nInternet access market.''\n  Let us not forget the context in which the 1996 Act was passed. When \nJudge Greene in the 1990s broke-up Ma Bell, the agreement limited the \nservice areas that the Regional Bell Operating Companies could enter. \nJudge Greene understood the significant market power of the Bell \ncompanies who had no competitors in their local markets and had \ncomplete access to the customer. Clearly, under such conditions, if \nBells were allowed to enter new markets, they could quickly decimate \ntheir competitors by leveraging their monopolies in their local \nmarkets. Consequently, in an effort to protect competition in other \nareas, Judge Greene restricted their access to other markets. For these \nreasons, the Bell companies came to Congress for a solution that would \neliminate their service restrictions. After many years of hard work, \nnumerous hearings, and tons of analyses, Congress in an agreement\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nwith all the relevant parties including the Bells, long distance \nservice providers, cable companies, and consumer organizations put \ntogether a framework that met the needs and requests of all involved \nparties and one that gave the Bells what they most coveted, entrance \ninto all markets. In doing so, however, Congress also put in place \nprovisions to preserve competition.\n  Under these conditions, the Bell companies worked with Congress to \ndraft and pass the 1996 Act, and when the Act was finally passed, the \nBell companies stated that they would quickly and aggressively open \ntheir local markets to competition. On March 5, 1996, Bell South-\nAlabama President, Neal Travis, stated that ``We are going full speed \nahead . . . and within a year or so we can offer [long distance] to our \nresidential and business wireline customers.'' Ameritech's chief \nexecutive officer, Richard Notebaert on February 1, 1996, indicated his \nsupport of the 1996 Act by stating that, ``[T]his bill will rank as one \nof the most important and far-reaching pieces of federal legislation \npassed this decade. . . . It offers a comprehensive communications \npolicy, solidly grounded in the principles of the competitive \nmarketplace. It's truly a framework for the information age.'' On \nFebruary 8, 1996, US West's President of Long Distance, Richard \nColeman, predicted that USWest would meet the 14 point checklist in a \nmajority of its states within 12-18 months. Unfortunately, the Bell \ncompanies have not kept their promises. Instead of getting down to the \nbusiness of competing, the Bell companies chose a strategy of delay. In \ndoing so, they have litigated, they have complained, and they have \ncombined. In other words they have done everything except work to \nensure competition in local markets.\n\n  When the Bells first filed applications with the Federal \nCommunications Commission, FCC, to enter the long distance market, \ncontrary to their assertions, the FCC and the Department of Justice, \nDOJ, found that the local markets were not open to competition, and on \nthat basis denied the companies entry into the long distance market. \nOnce the Bells realized that they were not going to get into the long \ndistance market before complying with the 1996 Act, they began a \nstrategy of litigation which had two effects: 1. to delay competition \ninto their local markets and 2. to hold on to their monopoly structure \nas they entered new markets in order to demolish their competitors. \nThey appealed a series of the FCC's decisions to the courts and \nchallenged the constitutionality of the 1996 Act even taking the case \nto the Supreme Court.\n  Having lost in the courts, the Bells have now returned to Congress \ncomplaining about the 1996 Act, the very Act that they had previously \nchampioned. Many of the Bell companies have been meeting with Senators \nand Representatives, often accompanied by the same lawyers who helped \nwrite the 1996 Act. But this time their message is different. Instead \nof embracing competition, the once laudable goal they had proclaimed to \nbe seeking, they now want to change the rules of the game and move in \nthe opposite direction. Specifically, they now want to offer lucrative \nhigh-speed data services to long distance customers without first \nopening their local markets to competition, and they want to block \ntheir competitors from using their networks to provide high speed data \nservice. As a result of these efforts, the Bells have successfully \nconvinced some members of Congress to introduce bills that in essence \nallow them to offer such service while protecting the Bells against \ncompetition and slowing the delivery of affordable advanced service to \nconsumers by gutting the 1996 Act.\n  Bell companies claim that because no one contemplated the growth of \ndata services that they should be permitted to continue their hold on \nthe local customer as they provide broadband services. To state it \nplainly, they are wrong. The technology to provide broadband data \nservices over the Bell network has been around since the early 1980s, \nbut the Bells were slow to deploy service until competition prompted \nthem to do so. Furthermore, recognizing the great potential of \nbroadband services, Richard McCormick, then CEO and Chairman of USWest, \nin 1994 testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee stated the \nfollowing:\n\n       I want to touch briefly on USWest's business plan. We have \n     embarked on an aggressive program both within our 14-state \n     region and outside to deploy broadband. We want to be the \n     leader in providing interactive, that is, two-way multimedia \n     services, voice, data, video.\n\n  In addition to the Bells realizing the importance of broadband \nservice, Congress recognized the importance of broadband services when \nit passed the 1996 Act and included section 706 which is dedicated to \npromoting the development and deployment of advanced services. To quote \nthe Act, ``advanced telecommunications capability'' is defined as \n``high-speed switched, broadband telecommunications capability that \nenables users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, \ngraphics, and video telecommunications using any technology.'' Also a \nsearch of the legislative debate on the 1996 Act reveals that the word \n``Internet'' appears 273 times. Even the preamble to the 1996 Act \nrefers to ``advanced telecommunications and information technologies \nand services.'' With this evidence before it, the FCC also concluded \nthat the competitive provisions of the 1996 Act included high-speed, \nadvanced data and voice services.\n  Today, all Bell companies are providing DSL service to customers. In \nfact, in October of 1999, SBC announced it would spend $6 billion over \n3 years on ``project Pronto'' which is the company's initiative to \nbecome the largest single provider of advanced broadband services in \nAmerica. And on that point, I certainly commend SBC on its efforts. \nThrough 2000, the four Bell companies invested 3.3. billion in DSL \ndeployment and are expected to spend $10.3 billion through 2003. This \ninvestment is expected to payoff as earnings from their DSL investments \nare expected to be positive by late 2002 as market penetration hits 10 \npercent. By the end of the first quarter of this year, SBC and \nBellSouth reached about 50 percent of their customer base while Verizon \nreached abut 42 percent with DSL service offerings.\n  Additionally, reports indicate that broadband service is being \neffectively deployed. In an August 2000 report, the FCC concluded that \noverall, broadband service is being deployed on a reasonable and timely \nbasis. It also found that there has been ample national deployment of \nbackbone and other fiber facilities that provide backbone \nfunctionality. In October of 2000, the FCC issued another report in \nwhich it determined that high speed lines connecting homes and small \nbusinesses to the Internet increased by 57 percent during the first \nhalf of 2000. These developments effectively demonstrate why there is \nno justification for further deregulation of the Bells at least not \nuntil competition in the local markets is acheived.\n  A major issue in this debate is how to serve rural and underserved \nares. However, there it is no demonstrated commitment by the Bells to \nserve the rural markets. In fact, there behavior would lead you to the \nopposite conclusion. Qwest/USWest has sold nearly 600 smaller exchanges \nrepresenting about 500,000 access lines and GTE has sold $1.6 milion \naccess lines. Joe Nacchio, Chief Executive Officer of Qwest stated, ``I \nwould have not qualms selling seeral million access lines if [I] could \nfind the real deal.'' He also noted that ``we have about 17.5 million \naccess line--we really like 11 [million].''\n\n  While expending a great deal of resources litigating and complaining, \nBell companies also have expended a fair amount of their energies in \nanother area, that is merging and combining. In August of 1997, Verizon \nacquired NYNEX and in June of 2000 acquired GTE. First, SBC acquired \nPac Bell, and in October of 1999, acquired Ameritech. The combined \ncompany now controls one-third of all access lines in the United \nStates. In March of 2000, Qwest acquired USWest. At the same time, Bell \nAtlantic acquired Vodafone. In September of 2000, Bell-South Wireless \nand SBC Wireless entered into a joint venture, Cingular. Yet the local \nphone markets remain largely closed to competition.\n  Even though there are many companies working to build a business in \nthe local market, the Bells have met the 271 checklist in only six \nStates, New York, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Massachusetts, and \nConnecticut. Undoubtedly, if they cannot obtain real access\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\nto the local phone markets, competitive companies will not be able to \nmake a go of their businesses. My grave concern is that they will not \nbe able to survive the Bell strategy of delay. Today, CLECs are \nstruggling to survive. Of the 300 CLECs that began providing service \nsince 1996, several have declared bankruptcy or are on the verge of \nfailing and several others have scaled back their buildout plans. CLECs \nare faced with a significant downturn in the marketplace, tremendous \ndifficulty in raising capital, and local markets that remain largely \nclosed to competition. From the standpoint of capital, CLECs are \nparticularly sensitive to the financial market since the vast majority \nof them are not profitable and rely on the capital markets for funding. \nRelying on the marketplace, CLECs have raised and spent $56 billion in \ntheir attempts to compete in the local market. Of the publicly traded \nCLECs in 2000, only 4 CLECs made a profit. Additionally, as a result of \nthe market downturn, the market capitalization of CLECs fell from a \nhigh of $86.4 billion in 1999 to $32.1 billion in 2000.\n  In Congress, we hear about the continued problems faced by \ncompetitive carriers trying to obtain access to the Bell network. \nBetween December 1999 and April 2001, both the FCC and state regulators \nhave imposed fines on several Bell companies for violations of their \nmarket opening and service quality requirements and other rules. For \nBellSouth, these fines totaled $804,750, for Qwest, $78.6 million, for \nSBC, $175 million, and for Verizon, $233 million. However, while these \nfines may be substantial to most businesses, many in the industry \nbelieve that they simply represent the cost of doing business for the \nBell companies which over the past year had annual revenues in the \nrange of tens of billions of dollars. Specifically, BellSouth's total \nrevenues were $25.6 billion, Qwest, $18.3 billion, SBC, $50.1 billion, \nand Verizon, $66.4 billion. Chairman Powell has stated that in order to \nmake fines a more effective tool, Congress should increase the FCC's \ncurrent fine authority against a common carrier for a single continuing \nviolation from $1.2 million to at least $10 million and extend the \nstatute of limitations for violations which currently stands at 1 year.\n  In order to get local competition going, the Pennsylvania PUC \nmandated the functional separation of the retail and wholesale \nfunctions of Verizon. Petitions have been filed to impose structural \nseparation in, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, \nMississippi, New Jersey, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and \nVirginia. Legislation has also been introduced in the State \nlegislatures of Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, and New Jersey on the \nissue of structural separation. In September of last year, Chairpersons \nof the Commissions in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin, \nissued a joint statement asserting that although the Commissions had \ntaken repeated and sustained actions over the past months to address \noperating deficiencies with respect to SBC-Ameritech, CLEC customers \nhad experienced a marked decline in service quality in purchasing \nnetwork elements from SBC-Ameritech.\n\n  In addition to these actions by regulators, the courts also have \ntaken action. In California in 1997, Caltech International Telecom \nCorporation sued SBC-Pacific Bell claiming that SBC was violating \nantitrust laws by acting anticompetitively and blocking competitors \nfrom their local phone market. Last year, a Federal district court \nruled in favor of Caltech. Covad has sued SBC, Verizon, and BellSouth \nand already has obtained a $24 million arbitration ruling against SBC. \nConsumers have filed suit in the Superior Court of D.C. alleging that \nVerizon signed up over 3,000 new customers per day knowing that the \ncompany would be unable to provide high-speed service as promised and \nthat its customers would experience significant disruptions and \nsignificant delays in obtaining technical support.\n  Regrettably, as Bells seek to block their competitors from entering \ntheir markets, many consumers are suffering through poor quality of \nBell service. In New York, the Communications Workers of America issued \na service quality report in which it stated that ``Verizon has \nsystematically misled state regulators and the public by falsifying \nservice quality data submitted to the PSC'' and ``60 percent of workers \nhave been ordered to report troubles as fixed when problems remained.'' \n91 percent of field technicians surveyed reported that they were \ndispatched on repairs of recent installations only to find that dial \ntone had never been provided. Additionally, consumers with inside \nwiring maintenance plans were not receiving the services for which they \nwere paying.\n  Concerned about competition and service quality, the FCC as well as \nstate Commissions have opposed legislative efforts to further \nderegulate the Bell companies. In response to such measures, former \nChairman of the FCC, William Kennard, stated that such legislation \nwould only upset the balance struck by the 1996 Act, . . . [and] would \nreverse the progress attained by the Act.'' Mr. Kennard went on to \nstate that ``the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is working. Because of \nyears of litigation, competition did not take hold as quickly as some \nhad hoped. The fact that it is now working, however, is undeniable. \nLocal markets are being opened, broadband services are being deployed, \nand competition, including broadband competition is taking root.'' More \nrecently at a hearing before Congress in March, Chairman Powell of the \nFCC counseled against reopening the Telecommunications Act of 1996. He \nstated that ``any wholesale rewrite of the Telecom Act would be ill-\nadvised.'' The Former Assistant Secretary for Communications and \nInformation, Greg Rhode also stated that ``[d]espite the progress being \nmade under the procompetitive approach of the Telecommunications Act of \n1996, some in Congress are talking about changing directions. Under the \nveil of `de-regulation for data services' some are talking about \nstopping the progress of competition . . . competition, structured \nunder the 1996 Act, is the model that will best deliver advanced \ntelecommunications and information services, such as high speed \nInternet access. Walking away from the Act's pro-competitive provisions \nat this point would be a serious mistake.'' Recognizing the importance \nof the 1996 Act, the National Association of Regulatory Utilities \nCommissioners adopted a resolution opposing federal legislation that \nwould deregulate the Bells and restrict the ability of State public \nutility commissions from fulfilling their obligations to regulate core \ntelecommunications facilities that are used to provide both voice and \ndata services and to promote deployment of advanced telecommunications \ncapabilities.\n\n  Given the lack of competition in the local markets, the intransigent \nbehavior of the Bell companies, and concerns about poor service \nquality, we are left with no choice but to adopt measures that will \nensure Bell compliance with the 1996 Act. This will have to include not \nonly fines, but also the separation of a Bell's retail operations \nresponsible for marketing services to consumers from its wholesale \noperations responsible for operating and selling capacity on the \nnetwork. Bell companies continue to have substantial profit margins and \nrevenues in the billions of dollars. In contrast, Bear Stearns has \nstated that it expects half of the CLECs to disappear because of \nbankruptcy and consolidation. Unquestionably, I do anticipate that \ncompetition will weed out poor competitors. However, it does not serve \nconsumers well for competitors to be weeded out because monopolies are \nnot playing fair.\n  I strongly believe that the power that the Bell companies have \nwielded to block their competitors from the local markets must be \ncurbed. That's why I rise to introduce legislation today. Under my bill \nwithin one year after passage of the legislation, a Bell company is \nrequired to provide retail service through a separate division. If a \nBell company has to resell or provide portions of its network to its \ndivision on the same terms and conditions that it provides to its \ncompetitors, then it will quickly and affordably make its network \navailable to competitors.\n  Requiring a company to separate functions or divest property is not a \nnovel concept. In 1980, the court decided that the only way to \nintroduced competition into the long distance market was to require Ma \nBell to divest the Baby Bells. This has worked well and now the long \ndistance market is competitive. More recently, the Pennsylvania PSC has \nrequired Verizon\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\nto separate its retail operations from its wholesale operations. These \ndecisions are all based on concerns about the ability of a company to \ndistort competition because the company has significant market power.\n  Also, my bill clarifies that a carrier may bring an action against a \nBell company to comply with the competition provisions of the 1996 Act \nat the FCC or at a State commission, and has the option of entering an \nalternative dispute resolution, ADR, process to enforce an \ninterconnection agreement. The FCC is required to resolve such a \ncomplaint in 90 days and issue an interim order to correct the dispute \nwithin 30 days upon a proper showing by the carrier bringing the \ndispute.\n  My bill requires the FCC to impose a penalty of $10 million for each \nviolation and $2 million for each day of each violation. The FCC can \ntreble the damages if the Bell company repeatedly violates competitive \nprovisions of the 1996 Act. I have chosen to include hefty \nfines, because the fines at the FCC are too small to have any real \neffect. I am also struck by the fact that for the Bells, fines seem to \nbe just a cost of doing business and not a punishment that deters or \npositively affects their behavior. As Chairman Powell has stated, the \nFCC's ``fines are trivial and the cost of doing business to many of \nthese companies.'' My bill would also require the FCC to establish \nperformance guidelines detailing what Bell companies must do in order \nto allow CLEC's to interconnect with the Bell network.\n\n  Today, our communications network remains the envy of the world and \nthe development of innovative advanced services is accelerating \nrapidly. Last year in a discussion about the lead America has over \nEurope with respect to the technology revolution, Thomas Middlehof, \nchief executive of Bertlemann, which is Europe's largest media \nconglomerate stated that ``Europe just doesn't get the message . . . \n[g]overnments are still trying to protect the old industrial \nstructure.'' The article also noted that ``many [European] leaders now \nacknowledge a basic policy failure of the past decade [was] subsidizing \ndying industries.'' With that said, it is unfortunate that the rollout \nof local and broadband services on a competitive basis to all Americans \nis being thwarted by the failure of Bell companies to open their \nmarkets to competition. These same monopolists told us their markets \nwould be open years ago. This legislation seeks to hold them to their \nword.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1364\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Fair \n     Competition Enforcement Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds:\n       (1) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 put in place the \n     proper framework to achieve competition in local \n     telecommunications markets.\n       (2) The Telecommunications Act of 1996 recognized that \n     local exchange facilities are essential facilities and \n     required that all incumbent local exchange carriers open \n     their markets to competition by interconnecting with and \n     providing network access to new entrants, a process to be \n     overseen by Federal and State regulators.\n       (3) To increase the incentives of the Bell operating \n     companies to open their local networks to competition, the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 allows the Bell operating \n     companies to provide interLATA voice and data services in \n     their service region only after opening their local networks \n     to competition.\n       (4) While some progress has been made in opening local \n     telecommunications markets, the Federal Communications \n     Commission has determined that, 6 years after passage of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bell operating companies \n     have met the market opening requirements of that Act in only \n     5 States.\n       (5) It is apparent that the incumbent local exchange \n     carriers do not have adequate incentives to cooperate in this \n     process and that regulators have not exercised their \n     enforcement authority to require compliance.\n       (6) By improving mandatory penalties on Bell operating \n     companies and their affiliates that have not opened their \n     network to competition, there will be greater assurance that \n     local telecommunications markets will be opened more \n     expeditiously and, as a result, American consumers will \n     obtain the full benefits of competition.\n       (7) Competitive carriers continue to experience great \n     difficulty in gaining access to the Bell network, and, 5 \n     years after enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n     Bell operating companies continue to control over 92 percent \n     of all access lines nationwide.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to improve and strengthen the enforcement of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996, in order to ensure that local \n     telecommunications markets are opened more rapidly to full, \n     robust, and sustainable competition; and\n       (2) to provide an alternative dispute resolution process \n     for expeditious resolution of disputes concerning \n     interconnection agreements.\n\n     SEC. 4. ENFORCEMENT OF COMPETITION.\n\n       Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 201 \n     et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n                         ``PART IV--ENFORCEMENT\n\n     ``SEC. 291.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide appropriate reimbursement under the medicare program for \nambulance trips originating in rural areas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing legislation today to \nprovide needed financial relief to rural ambulance providers.\n  Historically, Medicare payments for ambulance services provided by \nfreestanding ambulance providers have been based on a proportion of \ntheir reasonable charges, while payments to hospital-based providers \nhave been\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\nbased on their actual costs. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997, however, \ndirected the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a fee \nschedule for the payment of ambulance services using a negotiated \nrulemaking process. This rulemaking Committee finalized its agreement \nin February of 2000, and the then-Health Care Financing Administration, \nHCFA, issued a proposed rule last September. The new fee schedule was \noriginally scheduled to start on January 1, 2001, but its \nimplementation has been delayed while HCFA, now the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, continues to work on publishing a final \nrule.\n  Payment under this new fee schedule will preclude hospital providers \nof ambulance services from recouping their actual costs. For the \naverage, high-volume urban provider, this should not pose a significant \nproblem. Ambulance services in rural areas, however, tend to have \nhigher fixed costs and low volume, which means that they are unable to \ntake advantage of any economies of scale. I am therefore extremely \nconcerned that the proposed rule fails to include a meaningful \nadjustment for low-volume ambulance providers.\n  I recently heard about the impact that this change will have on one \nof Maine's rural hospitals, Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, \nME. Logging, tourism, and recreational activities are central to the \neconomic viability of this region, and good emergency transport is \nessential Franklin Memorial owns and operates five local ambulance \nservices that cover more than 2,000 square miles of rural Maine. They \nserve some of the most remote areas of the State, and ambulances often \nhave to travel more than 80 miles to reach the hospital. Moreover, \nthese trips frequently involve backwoods and wilderness rescues which \nrequire highly trained staff. Since there are only 30,000 people in \nFranklin Memorial's service area, however, volume is very low.\n  Under the current Medicare reimbursement system, Franklin Memorial \nhas just managed to break even on its ambulance services. Under the \nproposed fee schedule, however, these services stand to lose up to \n$500,000 a year, system-wide. While the small towns served by Franklin \nMemorial help to subsidize this service, there is no way that they can \nabsorb this loss. The Medicare, Medicaid and S-CHIP Benefits \nImprovement and Protection Act, BIPA, did increase the mileage \nadjustment for rural ambulance providers driving between 17 and 50 \nmiles by $1.25. While this is helpful, it will not begin to compensate \nlow-volume ambulance services like Franklin Memorial Hospital \nadequately.\n  Congress has required the General Accounting Office to conduct a \nstudy of costs in low-volume areas, but any GAO-recommended adjustments \nin the ambulance fee schedule would not be effective until 2004. The \nRural Ambulance Relief Act that I am introducing today with Senator \nFeingold will therefore establish a hold harmless provision allowing \nrural ambulance providers to elect to be paid on a reasonable cost \nbasis until the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is able to \nidentify and adjust payments under the new ambulance fee schedule for \nservices provided in low-volume rural areas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire):\n  S. 1368. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to improve the \norganization and management of the Department of Defense with respect \nto space programs and activities, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce, along with \nSenator Bob Smith, a bill to improve the organization and management of \nthe Department of Defense with respect to space programs and \nactivities. To my very good friend, I would like to extend my \ncongratulations for being the driving force in establishing the \n``Commission to Assess United States National Security Space Management \nand Organization'' or better known as the Space Commission which led to \nthis legislation.\n  The Commission looked at the role of organization and management in \nthe development and implementation of national-level guidance and in \nestablishing requirements, acquiring and operating systems, and \nplanning, programming and budgeting for national security space \ncapabilities. What the Commission found is that the United States \ndependence on space is creating vulnerabilities and demands on our \nspace systems which requires space to be recognized as a top national \nsecurity priority. This priority must begin at the top with the \nPresident and must be embraced by the country's leaders.\n  Senator Smith and I agree that space must be a top priority and that \nis why we are introducing this legislation. We want this to be a \nstatement to everyone, that space is a priority and must be treated as \nsuch.\n  The Commission also concluded that these new vulnerabilities and \ndemands are not adequately addressed by the current management \nstructure at the Department. The Commission found that a number of \nspace activities should be merged, chains of command adjusted, lines of \ncommunications opened and policies modified to achieve greater \nresponsibility and accountability.\n  I understand the Department is making some of these changes today. \nHowever, we believe Congress should show its support to our military \nmen and women involved in space that Congress wants them to succeed and \nthat we will provide the tools for them to achieve that goal.\n  This legislation will provide the Secretary of Defense the tools he \nneeds for more effective management and organization of space program \nand activities. Specifically the legislation:\n  Provides permissive authority for the Secretary of Defense to \nestablish an Under Secretary of Defense for Space, Intelligence and \nInformation--This permissive authority will provide the Secretary of \nDefense flexibility.\n  Designates the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Space, \nIntelligence and Information, provides for an additional Assistant \nSecretary of Defense (conditional on creation of the new Under \nSecretary of Defense position). This provision follows the \nrecommendations of the Commission.\n  Requires the Secretary of Defense to issue a report 30 days prior to \nexercise of the authority to establish the new Under Secretary position \non the proposed organization; and requires a report one year after \nenactment if the new position has not been created to describe how the \nintent of the Space Commission is being implemented.\n  Establishes the Secretary of the Air Force as the Executive Agent for \nDOD space programs for DOD functions designated by the Secretary of \nDefense; and assigns to acquisition executive function to the Under \nSecretary of the Air Force. The Secretary of Defense has flexibility in \nassigning and defining functions of the Executive Agent;\n  Assigns the Under Secretary of the Air Force as the director of the \nNRO; and directs the Under Secretary of the Air Force to coordinate the \nspace activities of DOD and the NRO;\n  Directs the Under Secretary of the Air Force to establish a space \ncareer field and directs the Secretary of the Air Force to assign the \nCommander of Air Force Space Command to manage the space career field. \nEstablishment of career field is an important commission recommendation \nand key indicator concerning AF implementation.\n  Requires that, to the maximum extent practicable, space programs be \njointly managed. I believe this will encourage the Army and Navy to \ndevelop space personnel.\n  Creates a major force program for space which will provide visibility \ninto space program funding.\n  Requires a GAO assessment of the progress made by DOD in implementing \nthe recommendations of the Space Commission.\n  Requires the commander of Air Force Space Command to be a four star \ngeneral; and prohibits the commander of Air Force Space Command from \nserving concurrently as CINCSPACE or and commander of the U.S. element \nof NORAD--Elevates space component commander to level of all other \nmajor Air Force component commanders\n  Finally, it expresses the sense of Congress that CINCSPACE should be \nthe best qualified four-star officer from the Army, Navy, Marines, or \nAir Force--Rotation of CINCSPACE will encourage Army, Navy, and Marines \nto develop space expertise\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\n  These measures provide the authority which, if exercised by the \nSecretary, can provide the focus and attention that space programs and \nactivities deserve. This is imperative in a world where some \ntechnology's life span can be less than 24 months. DOD must be able to \nrespond to these changing environments.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank my colleague for joining with me in \nthis effort to provide the Department the tools it needs to make space \na top national security priority. We look forward to seeing this bill \nbecoming law and welcome all Senators to join us on this important \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to send to \nthe desk a bill that will make improvements in our current national \nsecurity space management and organization.\n  I am delighted to stand here today and state that the Department of \nDefense is moving forward to implement the recommendations of the \nCommission to Assess United States National Security Space Management \nand Organization, more commonly known as the Space Commission. I pushed \nmy colleagues to charter this group of 13 senior military-space experts \nin the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense Authorization Act to assess the \nmanagement of military space matters today and make recommendations to \nstrengthen the national security space organization in the future.\n  It is a wonderful coincidence that the chairman of the bipartisan \nSpace Commission, the Honorable Donald Rumsfeld, was appointed by \nPresident Bush and confirmed by the Senate for the position of \nSecretary of Defense. As a result, Secretary Rumsfeld brings to his \nposition a keen appreciation of the importance of space to the future \nnational security of the United States.\n  The Space Commission, the efforts of the Secretary of Defense, and \nthis proposed legislation will set this nation on a bold new course. \nMore than fifty years ago, this nation took a similar bold step in \nestablishing military air power with the creation of the U.S. Air \nForce. This decision, under the National Security Act of 1947, was \nsigned into law by President Truman and dramatically restructured our \ninstitutional approach to military air power. This restructuring \nresulted from years of air-power management problems under the Army, \ninsufficient reforms under the Army Air Corps established in 1926, and \nassessments of numerous committees like the recent Space Commission.\n  The military management and organizational reforms of fifty years ago \nwere a great success, and today, quite a bit has changed for the \nbetter. As a result of the formation of a separate service focused on \nair power, we soon developed, and have had, right up to today, the best \nequipped and best trained Air Force in the world. The U.S. Air Force is \ncapable of surpassing any enemy.\n\n  However, we have come to see that there are structural limitations \ninherent in the Air Force today with respect to space power just as \nthere were in the Army fifty years ago with respect to air power. The \nArmy has been structured to meet ground requirements. Its training, \ndoctrine, leaders, and culture are all focused on fighting ground \nbattles. For systemic reasons, the Army was not able to develop a \nstrong, viable military air power. Therefore, the Air Force was created \nby the 1947 National Security Act which called for the creation of a \nseparate organization designed to deal specifically with air power.\n  There are many parallels between the early struggle for air power \nthat led to the creation of the Air Force and the issues we face today \nin seeking space power. The similarities between these two issues are \ntruly astounding.\n  Today, space is used only in support of air, land, and sea warfare in \nmuch the same manner that air power was at first seen as only a way to \nsupport ground forces. Space today is used to provide ``information \nsuperiority'' in support of other missions, but there is the potential \nfor so much more. We, as a Nation, need to stop talking and dreaming of \na dominant space presence and start doing. We must recognize the \nimportance of space as a permanent frontier for the military, so that \nAmerica may proceed into space with the same confidence, assurance, and \nauthority that marked our entrance into the skies.\n  Currently, space programs are raided for funds ten times more often \nthan other Air Force programs because space programs are either not \naggressively defended and/or not aggressively executed consistent with \nthe intent of Congress. Other space opportunities like the military \nspace plane, an air and space vehicle promising future power projection \nfrom the U.S. to anywhere in the world in 45 minutes or less, are \nextremely important to the cost-effective transformation of the \nmilitary especially during this period of shrinking American military \npresence around the globe. Yet the space plane and most of the space \nprograms continue to be underfunded. We need a better leader in space.\n  The reason for this is simple: the top priority of the Air Force is \nand will remain air power, not space power. The top jobs do and will \ncontinue to elude space officers in an Air Force run by pilots unless \nwe can create an organization whose job it would be to defend space \nprograms, to make sure that funding for space opportunities goes where \nit is supposed to go, and does not get rerouted back to other non-space \nprograms.\n  Space is too important a frontier and too vital a resource to be \nallowed to remain untapped and unexplored, undefended and unmanned. \nAmerica's future security and prosperity depends on our constant \nvigilance. We cannot afford to ignore space because our enemies will \nnot. While we are ahead of any potential rival in exploiting space, we \nare not unchallenged. Our future superiority is by no means assured. To \nensure superiority, we must combine expansive thinking with a sustained \nand substantial commitment of resources and vest them in a dedicated, \npolitically powerful, independent advocate for space.\n  The way it is organized today, the Air Force is not building the \nmaterial, cultural, or organizational foundations of a service \ndedicated to space power. Where are the space science and technology \ninvestments? Where is the funding for key space-power programs? Where \nare the personnel investments? What concrete steps are being taken to \nbuild a dedicated cadre of young space-warfare officers?\n  Before closing, let me assure my colleagues of what this legislation \nis and what it is not. This legislation is about streamlined \nmanagement, efficient operations, and the elimination of redundancy. It \nis about establishing an advocate for space who can evaluate space \nopportunities and bring those proposals forward to the President and \nCongress for disposition. It is about maximizing the national-security \ncapability for every tax dollar spent. I have seen press stories that \ntwisted Secretary Rumsfeld's support of the Space Commission \nrecommendations as an intent to weaponize space. Let me assure my \ncolleagues that this bill does not weaponize space. This is about \nmanagement and organization. It is about good government. Enacting this \nlegislation merely ensures that the concrete management reforms \nrecommended by the Space Commission are implemented quickly.\n  The Secretary of Defense, the Services, and the Intelligence \nCommunity all support the unanimous bipartisan recommendations from the \nSpace Commission. I urge my Colleagues to support this bill which \nimplements those recommendations. Space is critical to the future of \nthis nation. It is important for Congress to provide leadership so that \nthese recommendations are implemented quickly and not watered-down. \nWhile the Secretary does have broad management authority to run the \nDepartment of Defense, space is too important to be managed in-the-\nmargin or through loopholes in statute. Just as Congress established \nthe Army Air Corps in 1926 and the Air Force in 1947, it is right that \nCongress legislate these space management reforms.\n  Space dominance is too important to the success of future warfare to \nallow any bureaucracy, military department, or parochial concern to \nstand in the way. To protect America's interests we need to move \nforward consistent with the spirit of the Space Commission. This \nlegislation is a good first step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                             By Mr. WARNER:\n\n  S. 1369. A bill to provide that Federal employees may retain for \npersonal use\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\npromotional items received as a result of travel taken in the course of \nemployment; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill allow Federal employees to keep frequent flyer miles they receive \nwhile on official government travel. This will level the playing field \nbetween Federal employees and their counterparts in the private sector \nwhere companies traditionally allow employees to retain frequent flyer \nmiles and similar benefits earned while on business travel.\n  In 1994, a law was passed that requires Federal employees to \nsurrender their frequent flyer miles back to their agencies. The \nfrequent flyer miles would then be used to defray the costs of future \ntravel costs by agency personnel.\n  A recent review conducted by the Government Accounting Office reports \nthat these miles usually become lost, however, in an administrative \nshuffle. Airlines do not keep separate business and personal accounts \nfor the same individual. While the law had good intentions, it is \nimpractical, if not impossible, for an agency to apply the miles or \ntravel benefits elsewhere.\n  While travel may be inherent with certain jobs, business related \ntravel often impedes on an individual's personal time, time that person \ncould be spending with family and at home. Allowing Federal employees \nto keep their frequent flyer miles will also help to support the \ngovernment's ongoing efforts to recruit and retain a skilled, qualified \nworkforce. Furthermore, I believe it will boost morale in the federal \nworkforce.\n  I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and show \ntheir support for the dedicated employees of the Federal workforce.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1369\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to combat money laundering and protect the United \nStates financial system by strengthening safeguards in private banking \nand correspondent banking, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along with my \ncolleagues Senator Grassley, Senator Sarbanes, Senator Bill Nelson, \nSenator Mike DeWine, and Senator Jon Kyl, the Money Laundering \nAbatement Act, a bill to modernize and strengthen U.S. laws to detect, \nstop and prosecute money laundering through U.S. banks.\n  The safety and soundness of our banking system, the stability of the \nU.S. dollar, the services our banks perform, and the returns our banks \nearn for depositors make the U.S. banking system an attractive location \nfor money launderers. And money launderers who are able to use U.S. \nbanks can take advantage of the prestige of these banks to lend \ncredibility to their operations, reassure victims, and send wire \ntransfers that may attract less scrutiny from law enforcement. So \nwhether it is to protect their funds or further their crimes, money \nlaunderers want access to U.S. banks, and they are devising one scheme \nafter another to infiltrate the U.S. banking system.\n  The funds they want to move through our banks are enormous. Estimates \nare that at least $1 trillion in criminal proceeds are laundered each \nyear, with about half of that amount, $500 billion, going through U.S. \nbanks.\n  Stopping this flood of dirty money is a top priority for U.S. law \nenforcement which spent about $650 million in taxpayer dollars last \nyear on anti-money laundering efforts. That's because money laundering \ndamages U.S. interests in so many ways, rewarding criminals and \nfinancing crime, undermining the integrity of international financial \nsystems, weakening emerging democracies and distorting their economies, \nand impeding the international fight against corruption, drug \ntrafficking and organized crime.\n  The bill we are introducing today would provide new and improved \ntools to stop money laundering. Because it includes provisions that \nwould outlaw the proceeds of foreign corruption, cut off the access of \noffshore shell banks to U.S. banks, and end foreign bank immunity to \nforfeiture of laundered funds, this bill would close some of the worst \ngaps and remedy some of the most glaring weaknesses in existing anti-\nmoney laundering laws. For example, the bill would: 1. add foreign \ncorruption offenses, such as bribery and theft of government funds, to \nthe list of foreign crimes that can trigger a U.S. money laundering \nprosecution; 2. bar U.S. banks from providing banking services to \nforeign shell banks, which are banks that have no physical presence in \nany country and carry high money laundering risks; 3. require U.S. \nbanks to conduct enhanced due diligence reviews to guard against money \nlaundering when opening (a) a private bank account with $1 million or \nmore for a foreign person, or (b) a correspondent account for an \noffshore bank or foreign bank in a country posing high money laundering \nrisks; and 4. make a depositor's funds in a foreign bank's U.S. \ncorrespondent account subject to the same civil forfeiture rules that \napply to depositors' funds in other U.S. bank accounts.\n  These provisions are the product of almost three years of work by my \nstaff at the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations examining \nmoney laundering problems in the private and correspondent banking \nfields. Countless interviews with money laundering experts, bankers, \nregulators, law enforcement personnel, criminals and victims, and the \ncareful review of literally tens of thousands of pages of documents led \nto the issuance of two staff reports in 1999 and 2001, and several days \nof Subcommittee hearings, setting out the problems uncovered and \nrecommendations for strengthening U.S. enforcement efforts.\n  The first Subcommittee investigation examined private banking, a \ngrowing and lucrative banking sector which offers financial services to \nwealthy individuals, who usually must deposit $1 million or more to \nopen a private bank account. In return, the client is assigned a \n``private banker'' who provides the client with sophisticated financial \nservices, such as offshore accounts, shell corporations, and high \ndollar wire transfers, which raise money laundering concerns.\n  A key issue to emerge from this investigation is the role that \nprivate banks play in opening accounts and accepting hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in deposits from senior foreign officials or their \nrelatives, even amid allegations or suspicions that the deposits may be \nthe product of government corruption or other criminal conduct. The \n1999 staff report described four case histories of senior government \nofficials or their relatives depositing hundreds of millions of suspect \ndollars into private bank accounts at Citibank, the largest bank in the \nUnited States. These case histories showed how Citibank Private Bank \nhad become the banker for a rogues' gallery of senior government \nofficials or their relatives. One infamous example is Raul Salinas, the \nbrother of the former President of Mexico, who is imprisoned in Mexico \nfor murder and is under indictment in\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\nSwitzerland for money laundering associated with drug trafficking. He \ndeposited almost $100 million into his Citibank Private Bank accounts. \nAnother example involves the three sons of General Sani Abacha, who was \nthe former military leader of Nigeria and was notorious for \nmisappropriating and extorting billions of dollars from his country. \nHis sons deposited more than $110 million into Citibank Private Bank \naccounts.\n  The investigation determined that Citibank's private bankers asked \nfew questions before opening the accounts and accepting the funds. It \nalso found that, because foreign corruption offenses are not currently \non the list of crimes that can trigger a U.S. money laundering \nprosecution, corrupt foreign leaders may be targeting U.S. banks as a \nsafe haven for their funds.\n  Another striking aspect of the investigation was how a culture of \nsecrecy pervaded most private banking transactions. Citibank private \nbankers, for example, routinely helped clients set up offshore shell \ncompanies and open bank accounts in the name of these companies or \nunder other fictional names such as ``Bonaparte'' or ``Gelsobella.'' \nAfter opening these accounts, secrecy remained such a priority that \nCitibank private bankers were often told by their superiors not to keep \nany record in the United States disclosing the true owner of the \noffshore accounts or corporations they manage. One private banker told \nof stashing with his secretary a ``cheat sheet'' that identified which \nclient owned which shell company in order to hide it from Citibank \nmanagers who did not allow such ownership information to be kept in the \nUnited States.\n\n  On some occasions, Citibank Private Bank even hid ownership \ninformation from its own staff. For example, one Citibank private \nbanker in London worked for years on a Salinas account without knowing \nSalinas was the beneficial owner. Salinas was instead referred to by \nthe name of his offshore corporation, Trocca, Ltd., or by a code, ``CC-\n2,'' which stood for ``Confidential Client Number 2.'' Citibank even \nwent so far as to allow Mr. Salinas to deposit millions of dollars into \nhis private bank accounts without putting his name on the wire \ntransfers moving the funds, instead allowing his future wife, using an \nassumed name, to wire the funds through Citibank's own administrative \naccounts. Later, when Mr. Salinas' wife was arrested, Citibank \ndiscussed transferring all of his funds to Switzerland to minimize \ndisclosure, abandoning that suggestion only after noting that the wire \ntransfer documentation would disclose the funds' final destination.\n  That's how far one major U.S. private bank went on client secrecy.\n  The Subcommittee's second money laundering investigation focused on \nU.S. correspondent accounts opened for high risk foreign banks. \nCorrespondent banking occurs when one bank provides services to another \nbank to move funds or carry out other financial transactions. It is an \nessential feature of international banking, allowing the rapid movement \nof funds across borders and enabling banks and their clients to conduct \nbusiness worldwide, including in jurisdictions where the banks do not \nmaintain offices.\n  The problem uncovered by the Subcommittee's year-long investigation \nis that too many U.S. banks, through the correspondent accounts they \nprovide to foreign banks that carry high risks of money laundering, \nhave become conduits for illicit funds associated with drug \ntrafficking, financial fraud, Internet gambling and other crimes. The \ninvestigation identified three categories of foreign banks with high \nrisks of money laundering: shell banks, offshore banks, and banks in \njurisdictions with weak anti-money laundering controls. Because many \nU.S. banks have routinely failed to screen and monitor these high risk \nforeign banks as clients, they have been exposed to poorly regulated, \npoorly managed, sometimes corrupt, foreign banks with weak or no anti-\nmoney laundering controls. The U.S. correspondent accounts have been \nused by these foreign banks, their owners and criminal clients to gain \ndirect access to the U.S. financial system, to benefit from the safety \nand soundness of the U.S. banking system, and to launder dirty money \nthrough U.S. bank accounts.\n  In February of this year, my staff released a 450 page report \ndetailing the money laundering problems uncovered in correspondent \nbanking. The report indicated that virtually every U.S. bank examined, \nfrom Chase Manhattan, to Bank of America, to First Union, to Citibank, \nhad opened correspondent accounts for offshore banks. Citibank also \nadmitted opening correspondent accounts for offshore shell banks with \nno physical presence in any jurisdiction.\n  The report presents ten detailed case histories showing how high risk \nforeign banks managed to move billions of dollars through U.S. banks, \nincluding hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit funds associated \nwith drug trafficking, financial fraud or Internet gambling. In some \ncases, the foreign banks were engaged in criminal behavior; in others, \nthe foreign banks had such poor anti-money laundering controls that \nthey did not know or appeared not to care whether their clients were \nengaged in criminal behavior. Several of the foreign banks operated \nwell outside the parameters of normal banking practices, without basic \nfiscal or administrative controls, account opening procedures or anti-\nmoney laundering safeguards. All had limited resources and staff and \nrelied heavily upon their U.S. correspondent accounts to conduct \noperations, provide client services, and move funds. Most completed \nvirtually all of their transactions through their correspondent \naccounts, making correspondent banking integral to their operations. \nThe result was that their U.S. correspondent accounts served as a \nsignificant gateway into the U.S. financial system for criminals and \nmoney launderers.\n  In March 2001, the Subcommittee held hearings on the problem of \ninternational correspondent banking and money laundering. One witness \nwas a former owner of an offshore bank in the Cayman Islands, John \nMathewson, who pleaded guilty in the United States to conspiracy to \ncommit money laundering and tax evasion and has spent the past 5 years \nhelping to prosecute his former clients for tax evasion and other \ncrimes. Mr. Mathewson testified that he had charged his bank clients \nabout $5,000 to set up an offshore shell corporation and another $3,000 \nfor an annual corporate management fee, before opening a bank account \nfor them in the name of the shell corporation. He noted that no one \nwould pay $8,000 for a bank account in the Cayman Islands when they \ncould have the same account for free in the United States, unless they \nwere willing to pay a premium for secrecy. He testified that 95 percent \nof his 2,000 clients were U.S. citizens, and he believed that 100 \npercent of his bank clients were engaged in tax evasion. He \ncharacterized his offshore bank as a ``run-of-the-mill'' operation. He \nalso said that the Achilles' heel of the offshore banking community is \nits dependence upon correspondent banks to do business and that was how \njurisdictions like the United States could take control of the \nsituation and stop abuses, if we had the political will to do so.\n  I think we do have that political will, and that's why we are \nintroducing this bill today. Let me describe some of its key \nprovisions.\n  The Money Laundering Abatement Act would add foreign corruption \noffenses such as bribery and theft of government funds to the list of \ncrimes that can trigger a U.S. money laundering prosecution. This \nprovision would make it clear that corrupt funds are not welcome here, \nand that corrupt leaders can expect criminal prosecutions if they try \nto stash dirty money in our banks. After all, America can't have it \nboth ways. We can't condemn corruption abroad, be it officials taking \nbribes or looting their treasuries, and then tolerate American banks \nprofiting off that corruption.\n  Second, the bill would require U.S. banks and U.S. branches of \nforeign banks to exercise enhanced due diligence before opening a \nprivate bank account of $1 million or more for a foreign person, and to \ntake particular care before opening accounts for foreign government \nofficials, their close relatives or associates to make sure the funds \nare not tainted by corruption. This due diligence provision targets the \ngreatest money laundering risks that the Subcommittee investigation \nidentified in the private banking field. While some U.S. banks are \nalready performing enhanced due diligence reviews, this provision would \nput\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\nthat requirement into law and bring U.S. law into alignment with most \nother countries engaged in the fight against money laundering.\n\n  The Money Laundering Abatement Act would also put an end to some of \nthe extreme secrecy practices at private banks. For example, if a U.S. \nbank or a U.S. branch of a foreign bank opened or managed an account in \nthe United States for a foreign accountholder, the bill would require \nthe bank to keep a record in the United States identifying that foreign \naccountholder. After all, U.S. banks already keep records of accounts \nheld by U.S. citizens, and there is no reason to allow U.S. banks to \nadminister offshore accounts for foreign accountholders with less \nopenness than other U.S. bank accounts. The bill would also put an end \nto the type of secret fund transfers that went on in the Salinas matter \nby prohibiting bank clients from independently directing funds to be \ndeposited into a bank's ``concentration account,'' an administrative \naccount which merges and processes funds from multiple accounts and \ntransactions, and by requiring banks to link client names to all client \nfunds passing through the bank's concentration accounts.\n  Our bill would also take a number of steps to close the door on money \nlaundering through U.S. correspondent accounts. First and most \nimportantly, our bill would bar any U.S. bank or U.S. branch of a \nforeign bank from opening a U.S. correspondent account for a foreign \noffshore shell bank, which the Subcommittee investigation found to pose \nthe highest money laundering risks of all foreign banks. Shell banks \nare banks that have no physical presence anywhere--no office where \ncustomers can go to conduct banking transactions or where regulators \ncan go to inspect records and observe bank operations. They also have \nno affiliation with any other bank and are not regulated through any \naffiliated bank.\n  The Subcommittee investigation examined four shell banks in detail. \nAll four were found to be operating far outside the parameters of \nnormal banking practice, often without paid staff, basic fiscal and \nadministrative controls, or anti-money laundering safeguards. All four \nalso largely escaped regulatory oversight. All four used U.S. bank \naccounts to transact business and move millions of dollars in suspect \nfunds associated with drug trafficking, financial fraud, bribe money or \nother misconduct.\n  Let me describe one example from the Subcommittee's investigation. \nM.A. Bank was an offshore bank that was licensed in the Cayman Islands, \nbut had no physical office of its own in any country. In 10 years of \noperation, M.A. Bank never underwent an examination by any bank \nregulator. Its owners have since admitted that the bank opened accounts \nin fictitious names, accepted deposits for unknown persons, allowed \nclients to authorize third parties to make large withdrawals, and \nmanufactured withdrawal slips or receipts on request.\n  Nevertheless, M.A. Bank was able to open a U.S. correspondent account \nat Citibank in New York. M.A. Bank used that account to move hundreds \nof millions of dollars for clients in Argentina, including $7.7 million \nin illegal drug money. After the Subcommittee staff began investigating \nthe account, Citibank closed it. After the staff report came out, the \nCayman Islands decided to close the bank, but since the bank had no \noffice, Cayman regulators at first didn't know where to go. They \neventually sent teams to Uruguay and Argentina to locate bank documents \nand take control of bank operations. The Cayman Islands finally closed \nthe bank a few months ago.\n  The four shell banks investigated by the Subcommittee are only the \ntip of the iceberg. There are hundreds in existence, operating through \ncorrespondent accounts in the United States and around the world.\n  By nature, shell banks operate in extreme secrecy and are resistant \nto regulatory oversight. No one really knows what they are up to other \nthan their owners. Some jurisdictions known for offshore businesses, \nsuch as Jersey and Guernsey, refuse to license shell banks. Others, \nsuch as the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas, stopped issuing shell bank \nlicenses several years ago. In addition, both the Cayman Islands and \nBahamas announced that by the end of this year, 2001, all of their \nexisting shell banks, which together number about 120, must establish a \nphysical office within their respective jurisdictions, or lose their \nlicense. But other offshore jurisdictions, such as Nauru, Vanuatu and \nMontenegro, are continuing to license shell banks. Nauru alone has \nlicensed about 400.\n  Here at home, many U.S. banks, such as Bank of America and Chase \nManhattan, will not open correspondent bank accounts for offshore shell \nbanks as a matter of policy. But other banks, such as Citibank, \ncontinue to do business with offshore shell banks and continue to \nexpose the U.S. banking system to the money laundering risks they \nbring. Our bill would close the door to these money laundering risks. \nForeign shell banks occupy the bottom rung of the banking world, and \nthey don't deserve a place in the U.S. banking system. It is time to \nshut the door to these rogue operators.\n  In addition to barring offshore shell banks, the bill would require \nU.S. banks to exercise enhanced due diligence before opening a \ncorrespondent account for an offshore bank or a bank licensed by a \njurisdiction known for poor anti-money laundering controls. These \nforeign banks also expose U.S. banks to high money laundering risks. \nRequiring U.S. banks to exercise enhanced due diligence prior to \nopening an account for one of these banks would not only help protect \nthe U.S. banking system from the money laundering risks posed by these \nforeign banks, but would also help bring U.S. law into parity with the \nanti-money laundering laws of other countries.\n  Another provision in the bill would address a key weakness in \nexisting U.S. forfeiture law as applied to correspondent banking, by \nmaking a depositor's funds in a foreign bank's U.S. correspondent \naccount subject to the same civil forfeiture rules that apply to \ndepositors' funds in all other U.S. bank accounts. Right now, due to a \nquirk in the law, U.S. law enforcement faces a significant and unusual \nlegal barrier to seizing funds from a correspondent account. Unlike a \nregular U.S. bank account, it is not enough for U.S. law enforcement to \nshow that criminal proceeds were deposited into the correspondent \naccount; the government must also show that the foreign bank holding \nthe deposits was somehow part of the wrongdoing.\n  That's not only a tough job, that can be an impossible job. In many \ncases, the foreign bank will not have been part of the wrongdoing, but \nthat's a strange reason for letting the foreign depositor who was \nengaged in the wrongdoing escape forfeiture. And in those cases where \nthe foreign bank may have been involved, no prosecutor will be able to \nallege it in a complaint without first getting the resources needed to \nchase the foreign bank abroad.\n\n  Take the example of a financial fraud committed by a Nigerian \nnational against a U.S. victim, a fraud pattern which the U.S. State \nDepartment has identified as affecting many U.S. citizens and \nbusinesses and which consumes U.S. law enforcement resources across the \ncountry. If the Nigerian fraudster deposits the fraud victim's funds in \na personal account at a U.S. bank, U.S. law enforcement can freeze the \nfunds and litigate the case in court. But if the fraudster instead \ndeposits the victim's funds in a U.S. correspondent account belonging \nto a Nigerian bank at which the Nigerian fraudster does business, U.S. \nlaw enforcement cannot freeze the funds unless it is prepared to show \nthat the Nigerian bank was involved in the fraud. And what prosecutor \nhas the resources to travel to Nigeria to investigate a Nigerian bank? \nEven when the victim is sitting in the prosecutor's office, and his \nfunds are still in the United States in a U.S. bank, the prosecutor's \nhands are tied unless he or she is willing to take on the Nigerian bank \nas well as the Nigerian fraudster. That is one reason so many Nigerian \nfraud cases are no longer being prosecuted in this country, because \nNigerian criminals are taking advantage of that quirk in U.S. \nforfeiture law to prevent law enforcement from seizing a victim's money \nbefore it is transferred out of the country.\n  Our bill would eliminate that quirk by placing civil forfeitures of \nfunds in correspondent accounts on the same footing as forfeitures of \nfunds in all\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\nother U.S. accounts. There is just no reason foreign banks should be \nshielded from forfeitures when U.S. banks would not be.\n  The Levin-Grassley bill has a number of other provisions that would \nhelp U.S. law enforcement in the battle against money laundering. They \ninclude giving U.S. courts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over foreign banks \nwith U.S. correspondent accounts; expanding the definition of money \nlaundering to include laundering funds through a foreign bank; \nauthorizing U.S. prosecutors to use a Federal receiver to find a \ncriminal defendant's assets, wherever located; and requiring foreign \nbanks to designate a U.S. resident for service of subpoenas.\n  These are realistic, practical provisions that could make a real \ndifference in the fight against money laundering. One state Attorney \nGeneral who has reviewed the bill has written that ``there is a serious \nneed for modernizing and refining the federal money laundering statutes \nto thwart the efforts of the criminal element and close the loopholes \nthey use to their advantage.'' He expresses ``strong support'' for the \nbill, explaining that it ``will greatly aid law enforcement'' and \n``provide new tools that will assist law enforcement in keeping pace \nwith the modern money laundering schemes.'' Another state Attorney \nGeneral has written that the bill ``would provide much needed relief \nfrom some of the most pressing problems in money laundering enforcement \nin the international arena.'' She predicts that the bill's ``effects on \nmoney laundering affecting victims of crime and illegal drug \ntrafficking would be dramatic.'' She also writes that the ``burdens it \nplaces on the financial institutions are well considered, closely \ntailored to the problems, and reasonable in light of the public \nbenefits involved.''\n  This country passed its first major anti-money laundering law in \n1970, when Congress made clear its desire to not allow U.S. banks to \nfunction as conduits for dirty money. Since then, the world has \nexperienced an enormous growth in the accumulation of wealth by \nindividuals around the world, and in the activities of private banks \nservicing these clients. At the same time there has been a rapid \nincrease in offshore activities, with the number of offshore \njurisdictions doubling from about 30 to about 60, and the number of \noffshore banks skyrocketing to an estimated worldwide total of 4,000, \nincluding more than 500 shell banks.\n  At the same time, the Subcommittee investigations have shown that \nprivate and correspondent accounts have become gateways for criminals \nto carry on money laundering and other criminal activity in the United \nStates and to benefit from the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking \nindustry. U.S. law enforcement needs stronger tools to detect, stop and \nprosecute money launderers attempting to use these gateways into the \nU.S. banking system. Enacting this legislation would help provide the \ntools needed to close those money laundering gateways and curb the \ndirty funds seeking entry into the U.S. banking industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters in support for the bill from the \ntwo State Attorneys General of the States of Massachusetts and Arizona, \nas well as a short summary of the bill, and the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Money Laundering Abatement \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) money laundering, the process by which proceeds from \n     criminal activity are disguised as legitimate money, is \n     contrary to the national interest of the United States, \n     because it finances crime, undermines the integrity of \n     international financial systems, impedes the international \n     fight against corruption and drug trafficking, distorts \n     economies, and weakens emerging democracies and international \n     stability;\n       (2) United States banks are frequently used to launder \n     dirty money, and private banking, which provides services to \n     individuals with large deposits, and correspondent banking, \n     which occurs when 1 bank provides financial services to \n     another bank, are specific banking sectors which are \n     particularly vulnerable to money laundering;\n       (3) private banking is particularly vulnerable to money \n     laundering by corrupt foreign government officials because \n     the services provided (offshore accounts, secrecy, and large \n     international wire transfers) are also key tools used to \n     launder money;\n       (4) correspondent banking is vulnerable to money laundering \n     because United States banks--\n       (A) often fail to screen and monitor the transactions of \n     their high-risk foreign bank clients; and\n       (B) enable the owners and clients of the foreign bank to \n     get indirect access to the United States banking system when \n     they would be unlikely to get access directly;\n       (5) the high-risk foreign bank that currently poses the \n     greatest money laundering risks in the United States \n     correspondent banking field is a shell bank, which has no \n     physical presence in any country, is not affiliated with any \n     other bank, and is able to evade day-to-day bank regulation; \n     and\n       (6) United States anti-money laundering efforts are \n     currently impeded by outmoded and inadequate statutory \n     provisions that make United States investigations, \n     prosecutions and forfeitures more difficult when money \n     laundering involves foreign persons, foreign banks, or \n     foreign countries.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to modernize and \n     strengthen existing Federal laws to combat money laundering, \n     particularly in the private banking and correspondent banking \n     fields when money laundering offenses involve foreign \n     persons, foreign banks, or foreign countries.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Requires U.S. banks \n     and U.S. branches of foreign banks opening or managing a bank \n     account in the United States for a foreign person to keep a \n     record in the United States identifying the account owner.\n       Foreign Shell Banks. Bars U.S. banks and U.S. branches of \n     foreign banks from providing direct or indirect banking \n     services to foreign shell banks that have no physical \n     presence in any country and no bank affiliation.\n       Foreign Private Bank and Correspondent Accounts. Requires \n     U.S. banks and U.S. branches of foreign banks that open a \n     private bank account with $1 million or more for a foreign \n     person, or a correspondent account for an offshore bank or \n     foreign bank in a country posing high money laundering risks, \n     to conduct enhanced due diligence reviews of those accounts \n     to guard against money laundering.\n       Foreign Bank Forfeitures. Modifies forfeiture rules for \n     foreign banks' correspondent accounts by making a depositor's \n     funds in a foreign bank's U.S. correspondent account subject \n     to the same civil forfeiture rules that apply to depositors' \n     funds in other U.S. bank accounts.\n       Additional Measures Targeting Foreign Money Laundering.\n       Gives U.S. courts ``long-arm'' jurisdiction over foreign \n     persons committing money laundering offenses in the United \n     States, over foreign banks opening U.S. bank accounts, and \n     over foreign persons seizing assets ordered forfeited by a \n     U.S. court.\n       Expands the definition of money laundering to include \n     laundering funds through a foreign bank.\n       Authorizes U.S. courts to order a convicted criminal to \n     return property located abroad and, in civil forfeiture \n     proceedings, to order a defendant to return such property \n     pending a civil trial on the merits. Authorizes U.S. \n     prosecutors to use a court-appointed Federal Receiver to find \n     a criminal defendant's assets, wherever located.\n       Authorizes Federal law enforcement to subpoena a foreign \n     bank with a U.S. correspondent account for account records, \n     and ask the U.S. correspondent bank to identify a U.S. \n     resident who can accept the subpoena. Requires the U.S. \n     correspondent bank, if it receives government notice that the \n     foreign bank refuses to comply or contest the subpoena in \n     court, to close the foreign bank's account.\n       Other measures would make it a Federal crime to knowingly \n     falsify a bank customer's true identity; bar bank clients \n     from anonymously directing funds through a bank's general \n     administrative or ``concentration'' accounts; extend the \n     statute of limitations for civil forfeiture proceedings; \n     simplify pleading requirements for money laundering \n     indictments; and require banks to provide prompt responses to \n     regulatory requests for anti-money laundering information.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Office of the Attorney \n           General,\n                                       Boston, MA, August 1, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This letter is to express my strong \n     support for the Money Laundering Abatement Act. As I am sure \n     you are aware, money laundering has become increasingly \n     prevalent in recent years. As law enforcement has worked to \n     curb the illegal laundering of funds, the criminal element \n     has become more sophisticated and focused in its efforts to \n     evade the grasp of the law. Specifically, money launderers \n     are taking advantage of foreign shell banks, and banks in \n     jurisdictions with weak money laundering controls to hide \n     their ill-gotten gains.\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\n       At this juncture, there is a serious need for modernizing \n     and redefining the Federal money laundering statutes to \n     thwart the efforts of the criminal element and close the \n     loopholes they use to their advantage. The money laundering \n     business has taken advantage of its ability under current law \n     to use foreign banks, largely without negative consequences. \n     This is an issue that must be addressed on the Federal level \n     because of its international element. Moreover, in the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts, there is no state level money \n     laundering legislation. As a result, we rely on Federal/State \n     law enforcement partnership to eradicate money laundering. \n     The only hope for eliminating international money laundering \n     ties within our State lies with the United States Congress. I \n     encourage the Congress to take the necessary steps to assist \n     State and Federal law enforcement in their continuing efforts \n     to control the illegal laundering of funds.\n       The Money Laundering Abatement Act is an important step in \n     that process. Among many useful provisions, the Act prohibits \n     United States banks from providing services to foreign shell \n     banks that have no physical presence in any country, and as a \n     result, are easily used in the laundering of illegal funds. \n     In addition, the legislation provides for enhanced due \n     diligence procedures by United States banks which will at the \n     very least detect money laundering, and will also undoubtedly \n     deter it in the first place. Further, the Act makes it a \n     federal crime to knowingly falsify a bank customer's true \n     identity, which will make tracing of funds immeasurably \n     easier. In addition to these few provisions that I have \n     mentioned, the Act contains many other measures that will \n     greatly aid law enforcement in its mission.\n       I strongly support your efforts to assist state and federal \n     law enforcement in their money laundering control efforts \n     through the Money Laundering Abatement Act. The legislation \n     strengthens the existing anti-money laundering structure and \n     provides new tools that will assist law enforcement in \n     keeping pace with the modern money laundering schemes. Good \n     luck in your efforts to pass this vital legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas F. Reilly.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 State of Arizona,\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                      Phoenix, AZ, August 2, 2001.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chuck Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Levin and Grassley: I write to express my \n     views on the Money Laundering Abatement Act you are planning \n     to introduce soon. This bill would provide much needed relief \n     from some of the most pressing problems in money laundering \n     enforcement in the internation arena. The burdens it places \n     on the financial institutions are well considered, closely \n     tailored to the problems, and reasonable in light of the \n     public benefits involved.\n       The bill focuses on the structural arrangements that allow \n     major money launderers to operate. These include the use of \n     shell banks and foreign accounts, abuse of private banking, \n     evasion of law enforcement efforts to acquire necessary \n     records, and of safe foreign havens for criminal proceeds. \n     The approach is very encouraging, because efforts to limit \n     the abuse of these international money laundering tools and \n     techniques must come from Congress rather than the state \n     legislatures, and because such measures attack money \n     laundering at a deeper and more lasting level than simpler \n     measures.\n       The focus on structural matters means that this bill's \n     effects on cases actually prosecuted by state attorneys \n     general are a relatively small part of the substantial \n     effects its passage would have on money laundering as a \n     whole. Nevertheless, its effects on money laundering \n     affecting victims of crime and illegal drug trafficking would \n     be dramatic. I will use two exmples from my Office's present \n     money lauderning efforts\n       My Office initiated a program to combat so-called ``prime \n     bank fraud'' in 1996, and continued to focus on these cases. \n     Some years ago, the International Chamber of Commerce \n     estimated that over $10 million per day is invested in this \n     wholly fraudulent investment scam. The ``PBI'' business has \n     grown substantially since then. To date, my Office has \n     recovered over $46 million in these cases, directly and in \n     concert with U.S. Attorneys and SEC. Prime bank fraudsters \n     rely heavily on the money movement and concealment techniques \n     that this bill would address, particularly foreign bank \n     accounts, shell banks, accounts in false identities, movement \n     of funds through ``concentration'' accounts, and impunity \n     from efforts to repatriate stolen funds. One of our targets \n     was sentenced recently in federal court to over eight years \n     in prison and ordered to make restitution of over $9 million, \n     but without the tools provided in this bill, there is little \n     hope that the victims will ever see anything that was not \n     seized for forfeiture in the early stages of the \n     investigation.\n       My Office is now engaged in a program to control the \n     laundering of funds through the money transmitters in \n     Arizona, as part of the much larger problem of illegal money \n     movement to and through the Southwest border region. This \n     mechanism is a major facilitator of the drug smuggling \n     operations. Foreign bank accounts and correspondence \n     accounts, immunity from U.S. forfeitures, and false ownership \n     are significant barriers to successful control of money \n     laundering in the Southwest.\n       Your bill is an example of the immense value of \n     institutions like the Permanent Subcommittee of \n     Investigations, because this type of bill requires a deeper \n     understanding of the issues that come from long term \n     inquiries by professional staff. We who are involved in state \n     level money laundering control efforts should be particularly \n     supportive of such long term strategies because they are most \n     important to the quality of life of our citizens.\n       I commend your efforts for introducing this important \n     legislation and will assist you in anyway I can to gain its \n     passage.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                 Janet Napolitano,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1374. A bill to provide for a study of the effects of hydraulic \nfracturing on underground drinking water sources; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I introduce, along with the senior \nSenator from Nevada, very important legislation to remedy an \nunnecessary impediment to natural gas production.\n  In 1997, the Eleventh Circuit ruled that hydraulic fracturing, a \nprocess for stimulating development in certain types of gas wells, \nconstituted as ``underground injection'' under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct. As such, the State of Alabama was required to establish standards \nby which all hydraulic fracturing operations associated with natural \ngas development would be required to obtain a permit under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. This is an expensive and time consuming process, \nand one that appears unnecessary for protection of underground sources \nof drinking water.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency argued before the Eleventh \nCircuit that hydraulic fracturing did not pose a threat to underground \nsources of drinking water, and should not be subject to regulation \nunder the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Eleventh Circuit did not find \nthat hydraulic fracturing in fact threatened underground sources of \ndrinking water. Instead, the Court found only that, as written, the \ndefinition of ``underground injection'' under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct included the process of hydraulic fracturing.\n  Natural gas, including gas from coalbed methane and other \nunconventional source, is becoming an increasingly important energy \nsource for the United States. It is a clean burning, domestically \nproduced resource, the increased production of which will both enhance \nour energy security and help us address the problem of global warming.\n  Protection of drinking water is also an issue of the highest \npriority. However, it appears that the situation created by the \nEleventh Circuit's decision is not one that addresses protection of \nunderground sources of drinking water, because the Court did not find \nany harm to drinking water associated with groundwater production. \nInstead, this appears to be a situation where a technical reading of a \nstatute creates expensive permitting requirements not associated with a \nreal on-the-ground need.\n  The legislation introduced by myself and Senator Reid will require \nthe EPA, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, the \nSecretary of Energy, the Groundwater Protection Council, affected \nStates, and other entities, as appropriate, to conduct a study on any \nimpacts from hydraulic fracturing on underground sources of drinking \nwater.\n  If the Administration determines that hydraulic fracturing endangers \nunderground sources of drinking water, the Administrator shall regulate \nit under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  If, however, the Administrator determines that hydraulic fracturing \nwill not endangered underground sources of drinking water, the \nAdministrator shall not regulate it under the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nIn that case, States, including the State of Alabama, shall likewise \nnot be required to regulate hydraulic fracturing as an underground \ninjection under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  Our bill addresses regulation under section 1421 of the Safe Drinking \nWater Act, 42 U.S.C. 300h. Under current law, States are entitled to \nmake a showing under section 1425 of the Safe Drinking Water Act, 42 \nU.S.C. 300H-4, that for certain oil and gas operations, the State \nregulations satisfy the statutory\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\nrequirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act and the State will \ntherefore not be required to promulgate regulations under section 1422 \nof the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  It is our intention that the provisions of Section 1425 apply to \nhydraulic fracturing operations, and it is our understanding that this \nis the status of current law. This issue is currently being litigated \nbefore the Eleventh Circuit. Should the Eleventh Circuit decide \notherwise, we will address the issue as appropriate at that time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part C of title XVIII of the Social Security \nAct to ensure that Medicare + Choice eligible individuals have \nsufficient time to consider information and to make an informed choice \nregarding enrollment in a Medicare + Choice plan; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nMedicare Beneficiary Information Act. It is vital that Medicare + \nChoice participants receive plan information in a timely, appropriate \nmanner.\n  Under the Social Security Act, HMOs participating in the Medicare + \nChoice program are required to submit all of their plan information, \nincluding the type, cost and scope of benefits they intend to offer, by \nJuly 1st of each year. Upon receiving this information, the Secretary \nof HHS is required to prepare a booklet that compares the benefits and \ncosts of each plan, and disseminate the information to seniors prior to \nthe open enrollment season. The enrollment season is November 1st \nthrough November 30th.\n  The July 1st deadline was imposed so that seniors would have ample \nopportunity to read the materials and to make an informed decision \nbefore selecting a health plan.\n  Last month, at the request of the HMO industry, Secretary Thompson \nextended the deadline until September 15th. As a result, Medicare \nbeneficiaries will have little time to review the comparative \ninformation before the enrollment period. In response to these \nconcerns, the Secretary indicated that the information would be posted \non the Internet by October 15th.\n  Senior citizens in many cases do not have access to the Internet. If \ninformation is not sent in a timely manner, it will be extremely \ndifficult for seniors, especially low income seniors, to make informed \nchoices about their health plan. As a result, they will have little \ntime to find new health care coverage if their HMO sharply raises \npremiums and fees, reduces benefits or pulls out of Medicare. \nConsequently, seniors may be forced to accept whatever changes the HMOs \nimpose or run the risk of having gaps in their coverage should they \nchoose to switch plans.\n  This bill states that, effective 2002, HMO's are required to submit, \ncomplete binding information to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. It also requires that the information be sent to \nbeneficiaries at least 45 days before the beginning of the open \nenrollment period. It further requires all comparative information to \nbe sent in mail, rather than only being posted on the Internet. This \nwill ensure that seniors are receiving the information necessary to \nmake educated informed decisions about their health plan.\n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 1377. A bill to require the Attorney General to establish an \noffice in the Department of Justice to monitor acts of international \nterrorism alleged to have been committed by Palestinian individuals or \nindividuals acting on behalf of Palestinian organizations and to carry \nout certain other related activities; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, almost everyday we hear about new \nPalestinian violence in Israel and all too often, American citizens are \namong the victims. Earlier this year, Mrs. Sarah Blaustein, of Long \nIsland, New York, was murdered in a drive-by shooting by Palestinian \nterrorists south of Jerusalem. A few weeks before\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n\nthat, a 13-year old boy from Maryland, Jacob ``Koby'' Mandell, was \nsavagely beaten and tortured to death by Palestinian terrorists. \nEighteen American citizens have been killed by Palestinian terrorists \nsince the signing of the Oslo accords in September 1993, and six of \nthem were killed during the current wave of violence that began last \nautumn.\n  Of course, Americans are occasionally the victims of terrorism all \nover the world, not just in Israel. But what makes the American victims \nin Israel unique is that while our government does everything it can to \ncapture the terrorists who harm Americans elsewhere around the world, \nit takes a completely different approach when it comes to Palestinian \nterrorists.\n  Our State Department offers multi-million dollar rewards for \ninformation leading to the capture of terrorists who have killed \nAmericans around the world--but it has never offered such a reward to \nhelp catch terrorists who are being sheltered by Arafat. The State \nDepartment maintains a web site www.dssrewards.net for its ``Heroes'' \nprogram, where it posts the rewards to help capture terrorists.\n  The time has come to take this vital issue out of the State \nDepartment's hands and put it back where it belongs, in the Department \nof Justice. This should not be a political issue. When a matter of \njustice is at stake, the decision should be made by the legal \nauthorities whose responsibility it is to pursue justice, not politics.\n  This is why today I rise to introduce the Koby Mandell Justice for \nAmerican Victims of Terrorism Act of 2000.'' This bill will establish a \nspecial office, within the Department of Justice, the sole purpose of \nwhich will be to facilitate the capture of Palestinian terrorists \ninvolved in attacks in which American Citizens were harmed. The bill \nwill: Collect evidence against suspected terrorists; offer rewards for \ninformation leading to the capture of these terrorists and maintain \ncontact with families of victims to update them on the progress of \nefforts to capture the terrorists.\n  In short, this legislation will help ensure that the killers of \nAmericans will have a sanctuary in the Palestinian Authority \nterritories. This legislation will advance the cause of justice and it \nwill put terrorists and their supporters on notice that the United \nStates government will not stand idly by when our citizens are harmed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Koby Mandell Justice for \n     American Victims of Terrorism Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 1948, many United States citizens have been \n     injured or killed in terrorist attacks committed by \n     Palestinian individuals and organizations in and outside of \n     the Middle East.\n       (2) Under United States law, individuals who commit acts of \n     international terrorism outside of the United States against \n     nationals of the United States may be prosecuted for such \n     acts in the United States.\n       (3) The United States has taken a special interest and \n     active role in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \n     including numerous diplomatic efforts to facilitate a \n     resolution of the conflict and the provision of financial \n     assistance to Palestinian organizations.\n       (4) However, despite these diplomatic efforts and financial \n     assistance, little has been done to apprehend, indict, \n     prosecute, and convict Palestinian individuals who have \n     committed terrorist attacks against nationals of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \n                   TO MONITOR TERRORIST ACTS BY PALESTINIAN \n                   INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS AND CARRY OUT \n                   RELATED ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Attorney General shall establish \n     within the Department of Justice an office to carry out the \n     following activities:\n       (1) Monitor acts of international terrorism alleged to have \n     been committed by Palestinian individuals or individuals \n     acting on behalf of Palestinian organizations.\n       (2) Collect information against individuals alleged to have \n     committed acts of international terrorism described in \n     paragraph (1).\n       (3) Offer rewards for information on individuals alleged to \n     have committed acts of international terrorism described in \n     paragraph (1), including the dissemination of information \n     relating to such rewards in the Arabic-language media.\n       (4) Negotiate with the Palestinian Authority or related \n     entities to obtain financial compensation for nationals of \n     the United States, or their families, injured or killed by \n     acts of terrorism described in paragraph (1).\n       (5) In conjunction with other appropriate Federal \n     departments and agencies, establish and implement alternative \n     methods to apprehend, indict, prosecute, and convict \n     individuals who commit acts of terrorism described in \n     paragraph (1).\n       (6) Contact the families of victims of acts of terrorism \n     described in paragraph (1) and provide updates on the \n     progress to apprehend, indict, prosecute, and convict the \n     individuals who commit such acts.\n       (7) In order to effectively carry out paragraphs (1) \n     through (6), provide for the permanent stationing of an \n     appropriate number of United States officials in Israel, in \n     territory administered by Israel, in territory administered \n     by the Palestinian Authority, and elsewhere, to the extent \n     practicable.\n       (b) Definition.--In this section, the term ``international \n     terrorism'' has the meaning given such term in section \n     2331(b) of title 18, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent fiscal year such \n     sums as may be necessary to carry out this Act.\n       (b) Availability.--Amounts appropriated pursuant to the \n     authorization of appropriations under subsection (a) are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Harkin Mr. Hatch, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 1378. A bill to allow patients access to drugs and medical devices \nrecommended and provided by health care practitioners under strict \nguidelines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Access to \nMedical Treatment Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Harkin, \nHatch, Inouye, Johnson, and Reid in this effort to increase \nindividuals' freedom of choice in health care.\n  Patient choice is a value often articulated in health care debates. \nYet patients often do not have the right to choose potentially life-\nsaving alternative treatments. I want to thank Berkley Bedell, who \nformerly represented the 6th District of Iowa, for making me aware of \nthe importance of this issue and for assisting in the development of \nthis bill. This has been a multi-year effort, and he has worked \ntirelessly on it. Berkley has experienced first-hand the life-saving \npotential of alternative treatments. His story convinced me that our \nhealth care system discourages the use of alternative medicine \ntreatment and thereby restricts the right of patients to choose.\n  American consumers have already voted for expanded access to \nalternative treatments with their feet and their wallets. A 1997 study \npublished in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, \nshows that 42 percent of Americans used some kind of alternative \ntherapy, spending more than $27 billion that year. Americans made more \nvisits to alternative practitioners than to primary care providers. \nAccording to a 1999 JAMA study, people sought complementary and \nalternative medicine not only because they were dissatisfied with \nconventional medicine but also because these therapies mirrored their \nown values, beliefs and philosophical orientation toward health and \nlife.\n  Alternative therapies are rapidly being incorporated into mainstream \nmedical programs, practice and research. Indeed, at least 75 out of 117 \nU.S. medical schools offer elective courses in alternative medicine or \ninclude alternative medicine topics in required courses. A 1994 study \nin the Journal of Family Practice revealed that more than 60 percent of \ndoctors from a wide range of specialties recommended alternative \ntherapies to their patients at least once. The National Institutes of \nHealth now has a Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine \nwhere research is underway to expand our knowledge of alternative \ntherapies and their safe and effective use.\n  Despite the growing demand for many types of alternative medicine, \nsome therapies remain unavailable because they have not yet been \napproved\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\nby the FDA. My bill would increase access to treatments that would \nnormally be regulated by the FDA, but have not yet undergone the \nexpansive and lengthy process currently required to gain FDA approval. \nGiven the popularity of alternative medicine among the American public \nand its growing acceptance among traditional medical practitioners, it \nwould seem logical to remove some of the access barriers that consumers \nface when seeking certain alternative therapies.\n  The Access to Medical Treatment Act supports patient choice while \nmaintaining important patient safeguards. It asserts that individuals, \nespecially those who face life-threatening afflictions for which \nconventional treatments have proven ineffective, should have the option \nof trying an alternative treatment. This is a choice rightly made by \nthe consumer, and not dictated by the Federal Government.\n\n  All treatments sanctioned by this Act must be prescribed by an \nauthorized health care practitioner who has personally examined the \npatient. The practitioner must fully disclose all available information \nabout the safety and effectiveness of any medical treatment, including \nquestions that remain unanswered because the necessary research has not \nbeen conducted.\n  The bill carefully restricts the ability of practitioners to \nadvertise or market unapproved drugs or devices or to profit \nfinancially from prescribing alternative treatment. This provision was \nincluded to ensure that practitioners keep the best interests of \npatients in mind and to retain incentives for seeking FDA approval. If \nan individual or a company wants to earn a profit from a product, they \nwould be wise to go through the standard FDA process.\n  I want to be absolutely clear that this legislation will not \ndismantle the FDA, undermine its authority, or appreciably change \ncurrent medical practices. It is not meant to attack the FDA or its \napproval process. It is meant to complement it. The FDA should, and \nwould under this legislation, remain solely responsible for protecting \nthe health of the Nation from unsafe and impure drugs. The heavy \ndemands and requirements placed upon treatments before they gain FDA \napproval are important, and I firmly believe that treatments receiving \nthe Federal Government's stamp of approval should be proven safe and \neffective.\n  The bill protects patients by requiring practitioners to report any \nadverse reaction that could potentially have been caused by an \nunapproved drug or medical device. If an adverse reaction is reported, \nmanufacture and distribution of the drug must cease pending an \ninvestigation. If it is determined that the adverse reaction was caused \nby the drug or medical device, as part of a total recall, the Secretary \nof the Department of Health and Human Services and the manufacturer \nhave the duty to inform all health care practitioners to whom the drug \nor medical device has been provided.\n  This legislation will help build a knowledge base regarding \nalternative medicine treatments by requiring practitioners to report on \neffectiveness. This is critical because current information available \nabout the effectiveness of many promising treatments is inadequate. The \ninformation generated through this Act will begin to reverse this \ninformation gap, as data are collected and analyzed by the Center for \nComplementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  The Access to Medical Treatment Act represents an honest attempt to \nfocus serious attention on the value of alternative treatments and \novercome current obstacles to their safe development and utilization. \nIn essence, this legislation addresses the fundamental balance between \ntwo seemingly irreconcilable interests: the protection of patients from \ndangerous and ineffective treatments and the preservation of consumers' \nfreedom to choose alternative therapies. The complexity of this policy \nchallenge should not discourage us from seeking to solve it. I am \nconvinced that the public good will be served by a serious attempt to \nreconcile these contradictory interests, and I am hopeful the \ndiscussion generated by this legislation will help point the way to its \nresolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1379. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nan Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Rare \nDiseases Act of 2001.\n  This legislation, in conjunction with companion legislation \nintroduced by Senator Hatch to amend the orphan drug tax credit, \npromises to greatly enhance the prospects for developing new treatments \nand diagnostics, and even cures for literally thousands of rare \ndiseases and disorders.\n  The Rare Diseases Act provides a statutory authorization for the \nexisting Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, \nNIH, and authorizes regional centers of excellence for rare disease \nresearch and training. The Act also increases the funding for the Food \nand Drug Administration's, FDA, Orphan Product Research Grant program, \nwhich has provided vital support for clinical research on new \ntreatments for rare diseases and disorders.\n  I am encouraged that, consistent with our legislation, the President \nhas proposed in fiscal year 2002 to create a network of centers of \nexcellence for rare diseases. This proposal originated with the NIH, in \nrecommendations of a Special Emphasis Panel convened to examine the \nstate of rare disease research. Because the Panel itself was convened \nin response to a request of the Senate Appropriations Committee in \n1966, it is appropriate that we are today introducing legislation which \nrepresents the fruition of a long, deliberative process involving both \nthe Congress and the NIH.\n  It is important to note that Congress has had a longstanding interest \nin rare diseases. In 1983, Congress enacted the Orphan Drug Act to \npromote the development of treatments for rare diseases and disorders. \nSuch diseases affect small patient populations, typically smaller than \n200,000 individuals in the United States, and include Huntington's \ndisease, myoclonus, ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, Tourette syndrome, and \nmuscular dystrophy. Although each disease may be rare, there are, in \nsum, 25 million Americans today who suffer from the six thousand known \nrare diseases and disorders.\n  As an original sponsor of the Orphan Drug Act, I am pleased it has \nbeen a great success, leading to the development of over 220 treatments \nfor rare diseases and disorders. But the greatest share of credit is \ndue to the original author of the Act, Congressman Henry Waxman of \nCalifornia, and to a woman named Abbey Meyers.\n  During the 1970s, an organization called the National Organization \nfor Rare Disorders, NORD, was founded by Abbey to provide services and \nto lobby on behalf of patients with rare diseases and disorders. It was \nAbbey and her organization which were instrumental in pressing Congress \nfor enactment of legislation to encourage the development of orphan \ndrugs.\n  In light of this important history, I am very pleased that the Rare \nDiseases Act of 2001 is supported by NORD. And I am also pleased to \njoin my colleague, Senator Hatch, a champion of research into rare \ndiseases, in introducing this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 1380. A bill to coordinate and expand United States and \ninternational programs for the conservation and protection of North \nAtlantic Whales; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Oceans, Atmosphere and \nFisheries Subcommittee, I rise today to introduce the North Atlantic \nRight Whale Recovery Act of 2001. I am pleased to be joined by our \nCommerce Committee Chairman, Senator Hollings in this effort. This bill \nis designed to improve the management and research activities for right \nwhales and increase the focus on reducing mortality caused by ship \ncollisions, entanglement in fishing gear, and other causes. The most \nendangered of the great whales, the northern Atlantic right whale has \nshown no evidence of recovery since the whaling days of the\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\n1900s despite full protection from hunting by a League of Nations \nagreement since 1935. Today the population of North Atlantic Right \nWhales remains at less than 350 animals, although 2001 was a banner \nyear for reproduction as over 30 calves were born.\n  The entire Nation has watched with great interest as a team of \nexperts from a number of organizations including the National Marine \nFisheries Service, the New England Aquarium and the Center for Coastal \nStudies has sought to remove the nylon rope that is imbedded in the jaw \nof a North Atlantic Right Whale, dubbed ``Churchill''. By all accounts, \nunless the rope is removed the whale is likely to die from infections \nthat are already discoloring the whale's skin. I would like to offer my \nsincere appreciation for all of these efforts to date and I hope that \nby offering this legislation today that we can refocus our attention on \nhow to protect these magnificent mammals.\n  Right whales are at risk of extinction from a number of sources. \nThese include, ship strikes, the number one source of known right whale \nfatalities, entanglement in fishing gear, coastal pollution, habitat \ndegradation, ocean noise and climate change. This legislation requires \nthe Secretary of Commerce to institute a North Atlantic Right Whale \nRecovery Program, in coordination with the Department of Transportation \nand other appropriate Federal agencies, States, the Southeast and \nNortheast Northern Atlantic Right Whale Recovery Plan Implementation \nTeam and the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Team, pursuant to the \nauthority provided under the Endangered Species Act, the Marine Mammal \nProtection Act, and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \nManagement Act.\n  This legislation would require the Secretary of Commerce within 6 \nmonths of enactment, to initiate demonstration projects designed to \nresult in the immediate reductions in North Atlantic right whale \ndeaths. There are 4 distinct areas that I believe we should be focusing \nour attention on. First, we should develop acoustic detection and \ntracking technologies to monitor the migration of right whales so that \nships at sea can avoid right whales. Second, we need to continue work \non individual satellite tags for right whales. This is yet another way \nthat we can track whale migration and alert ships at sea of the \npresence of whales and avoid ship strikes. Third, this legislation \nwould speed up the development of neutrally buoyant line and ``weak \nlink'' fishing gear, so that we can either avoid having whales become \nentangled in the first place or when they do the ``weak links'' break \nand they can more easily become disentangled. Finally this legislation \nsupports research and testing into developing innovative ways to \nincrease the success of disentanglement efforts.\n\n  This legislation allows for the government to provide fishermen \n``whale safe'' fishing gear in high use or critical habitat areas. This \nis crucial, because once we have developed this ``whale safe'' gear we \nneed to get it in the water as soon as possible. I believe an \nassistance program that is fair to fishermen will be needed and we are \nasking the agencies to tell us the potential costs so we can ensure \nthat the gear can be deployed where needed.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary of Transportation and \nCommerce to develop and implement a comprehensive ship strike avoidance \nplan for Right Whales. I am pleased that a draft plan has been issued \nthis week, but I want to make it clear that a plan must be implemented \nby January of 2003. I would like to stress to my colleagues, that by \nfar the number one source of know right whale mortalities is ship \nstrikes, and in my opinion we have not done nearly enough to prevent \nthese lethal ship strikes from happening.\n  This legislation establishes a right whale research grant program. \nThis program will establish a peer review process of all innovative \nbiological and technical projects designed to protect right whales. In \naddition to the scientific community, this peer review team will also \nbe comprised of representatives of the fishing industry and the \nmaritime transportation industry. It is important that from the very \nbeginning we have the input of the people who are on the water every \nday. Their knowledge and experience is absolutely necessary to \ndeveloping innovative practices and techniques to save right whales.\n  Congress has appropriated over $8 million dollars in the last two \nyears to protect right whales.

A bill to redesignate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located at 5472 Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles, \nCalifornia, as the ``Congressman Julian C. Dixon Post Office \nBuilding''; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto honor the late Julian Dixon, an esteemed Member of the House of \nRepresentatives from California for more than 20 years.\n  Julian Dixon lived a full life; highlighted by almost thirty years of \npublic service. He served in the Army from 1957 to 1960 and in the \nCalifornia Assembly from 1972 until 1978. Julian was first elected to \nthe House of Representatives in 1978.\n  As the representative for the Thirty-Second District of California, \nJulian consistently fought to maintain our Nation's commitment to civil \nrights and to increase the economic upward mobility of his \nconstituents. Julian was also chair of the Congressional Black Caucus \nand worked tirelessly to establish a memorial to Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. here in our Nation's capital.\n  Julian's legislative work covered myriad issues from intelligence to \ndefense to congressional ethics. He was the ranking member of the House \nIntelligence Committee and a member of the committee that determines \ndefense appropriations. He used his position on the appropriations \ncommittee to provide Federal aid for communities that were devastated \nby base closings and other defense cuts. He also helped secure \nemergency funding for damaged businesses after the Northridge \nearthquake and the Los Angeles riots.\n  Julian was not only a great legislator, but also a great human being. \nHe was a gentleman in every sense of the word who was willing to work \nacross partisan lines to improve the lives of his constituents and so \nmany Americans. I was privileged as a member of the Senate \nAppropriations committee to work with Mr. Dixon. In this role, Julian \nalways put California's needs first.\n  Julian served with passion and distinction. He was a man of the \nhighest integrity and credibility. I am sure his constituents will be \nproud to have a Post Office named in his honor.\n  Julian Dixon was a man of principle and fairness whose grace and \nhumility will be sorely missed. I am pleased to honor his memory by \nintroducing a bill to designate the Post Office at 5472 Crenshaw \nBoulevard in Los Angeles as the ``Congressman Julian C. Dixon Post \nOffice Building.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1382. A bill to amend title 11, District of Columbia Code, to \nredesignate the Family Division of the Superior Court of the District \nof Columbia as the Family Court of the Superior Court, to recruit and \nretain trained and experienced judges to serve in the Family Court, to \npromote consistency and efficiency in the assignment of judges to the \nFamily Court and in the consideration of actions and proceedings in the \nFamily Court, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nalong with my friends and colleagues Senator Landrieu and Senator \nLevin, that will have a vital impact on children and families in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Our bill, the ``District of Columbia Family Court \nAct of 2001'' is aimed at guiding the District, as the Superior Court \nstrives to reform its role in the child welfare system through its \ncreation of a Family Court.\n  This legislation takes a very important step forward in helping to \nensure that the best interest of children in contact with the DC child \nwelfare system are always paramount. In making\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\nsure that is the case, judges in the system play a key role. I learned \nthis first-hand nearly thirty years ago when I was serving as an \nassistant county prosecutor in Greene County, OH. One of my duties was \nto represent the Greene County Children Services in cases where \nchildren were going to be removed from their parents' custody.\n  I witnessed then that too many of these cases drag on endlessly, \nleaving children trapped in temporary foster care placements, which \noften entail multiple moves from foster home to foster home to foster \nhome, for years and years and years. Such multiple placements and lack \nof permanency for these kids is abuse in it's own right.\n  Since being appointed to the District of Columbia Appropriations \nCommittee, I have made it my personal mission to find financial \nsolutions for the problems facing DC's foster children. In March, \nRepresentative DeLay and I laid the groundwork for a DC Family Court \nBill that would be bipartisan and effective. In drafting this bill, we \nhave held numerous hearings, met with child welfare advocates from \nacross the District, and had countless meetings with the DC Superior \nCourt Judges.\n  In particular, I want to thank Chief Judge Rufus King for making \nhimself available to members of Congress and their staffs and for \nappearing before the DC Subcommittee on Appropriations. Judge King has \nmade reforming the Family Division of the DC Court his number one \npriority, and I look forward to working with him in the future to \nimplement the reforms established by our DC Family Court Bill.\n\n  Our legislation includes a number of important reforms that would \nensure that the judicial system protects the children of the District. \nFirst, it would increase the length of judicial terms for judges from \none year for judges already presiding over the Superior Court to three \nyears. New judges appointed to the Superior Court and then assigned to \nthe Family Court would have five-year terms. This change would enable \njudges to develop an expertise in Family Law.\n  Second, the bill would create magistrates so that the current backlog \nof 4500 permanency cases can be properly and adequately addressed. \nThese magistrates would be distributed among the judges according to a \ntransition plan, which must be submitted to Congress within 90 days of \npassage of this bill. We want to make sure the court has the \nflexibility to deal with these important child welfare issues.\n  Third, the bill provides the resources for an Integrated Judicial \nInformation System, IJIS. This would enable the court to track and \nproperly monitor family cases and would allow all judges and \nmagistrates to have access to the information necessary to make the \nbest decisions about placement and child safety.\n  Fourth, a reform in the bill that I find extremely important is the \nOne-Judge/One Family provision. This policy would ensure that the same \njudge, a judge who knows the history of a family and the child, would \nbe making the important permanency decisions. This provision is \nessential for those hard cases involving abuse and neglect. It ensures \nconsistency. It ensures safety. And, it just makes sense.\n  Ultimately, our bill would provide consistency through the One-Judge/\nOne-Family provision, it would provide safety and security, and it \nwould provide stability for the children of the District. We need to \ngive the children in the District's welfare system all of these things. \nIt is the right thing to do.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in support of this bill. We must never, \never lose sight of our responsibility to the children involved. Their \nneeds and their best interests must always come first. And today, I \nbelieve we are putting children first and taking a step forward on \ntheir behalf.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe treatment of incentive stock options and employee stock purchases; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill \nto support the efforts of the many companies in New York and elsewhere \nwho grant stock options to their employees. Over the past three \ndecades, companies have increasingly used stock options to attract and \nmotivate employees. These companies give their workers the right to \npurchase company stock, at a small discount from the listed price, \nthrough Employee Stock Purchase Plans, ESPP and Incentive Stock \nOptions, ISO. Employees stock ownership has been shown to motivate \nworkers and enhance relationship between management and workers. \nIndeed, for many workers, these plans are the only way to amass any \nassets.\n  For nearly thirty years, the Internal Revenue Service, IRS has taken \nthe position that income from these stock options is not subject to \nemployment taxes. However, recent audits and rulings on individual \ncompanies have raised the troubling prospect that the IRS may now \nreverse its policy.\n  ESPPs and ISOs were created by Congress to provide tools to build \nstrong companies through increased employee ownership of company stock. \nThe purpose of the bipartisan bill I am introducing today, with Senator \nRoberts, is to clarify that it was not the intent of Congress to dilute \nthese incentives by requiring employment tax withholding when the stock \nis purchased. While the IRS has in place a moratorium until January 1, \n2003 on assessing employment taxes on stock options, we must take \naction to eliminate any uncertainty for companies and workers as to \nwhether options are subject to withholding taxes.\n  Again, the legislation I am introducing would clarify that the \ndifference between the exercise price and the fair market value of \nstock offered by the ISO and ESPP is excluded from employment taxes. In \naddition, wage withholding is not required on disqualifying \ndispositions of ISO stock or on the fifteen percent discount offered to \nemployees by ESPPs.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 1384. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to expand the definition of the term ``Major \ndisaster'' to include an application of the Endangered Species Act of \n1973 that souses severe economic hardship; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, earlier this month I went to the \nSantiam Canyon community of Detroit. Along with my visit to Klamath \nFalls in May, it was probably one of the most emotional days I have had \nas a Senator.\n  This beautiful community, located on one of Oregon's most popular \nrecreational lakes, has been devastated by a combination of natural and \nman-made disasters. I stood next to one of the Detroit Lake marinas, \nwhich in past years had been the busiest spot on the lake, provided \nservices to hundreds of boaters. I was amazed to see this marina was \nhigh and dry. Now there are only tree stumps and mud flats in the \nreservoir. Again, a result of both natural and man-made disasters. I \nhosted a town hall where 350 community residents, nearly the entire \npopulation of the City of Detroit, came to share their desperate \nconcerns.\n  I need to tell you what brought the community of Detroit, OR, to this \npoint.\n  Over 50 years ago, the town was forced by the Federal Government to \nmove from its original location so that Detroit Dam & Reservoir could \nbe built. The original city site was buried under several feet of \nwater. Detroit was a hearty community of strong-willed men and women. \nInstead of giving up, they moved their community to higher ground, and \nthey survived. Years later, the Federal Government again came to \nDetroit. Like a number of other timber dependent communities in Santiam \nCanyon, the timber supply from the surrounding Federal land was cut off \nand the mills were forced to close. Again, the residents of Detroit \nrefused to be broken, and instead retooled their economy from timber to \ntourism.\n  Now, the Federal Government is visiting Detroit, Oregon again. This \ntime, as a result of drought and the government's decision to drain \nDetroit Reservoir, upon which that new economy was based, the community \nis once again facing extinction. Even with economic losses estimated at \n$1.75 million, the Small Business Administration and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency tell me that according to their \nregulations, there is no disaster in Detroit, OR, today.\n  I am here to tell you that there is a disaster in Detroit, it was \ncaused by the Federal Government, and it should be made right by the \nFederal Government.\n  The Corps of Engineers drained Detroit Lake this summer before it \never had a chance to fill. The Corps tells me that under a negotiated \nagreement with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, NMFS and \nother State and Federal agencies, it devised an operating plan to drain \nthe reservoir in order to meet far downstream needs for water quality \nunder the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, and even to \nmeet the power needs of California. Once again, the needs of rural \ncommunities were left out of the equation.\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n  I hope that the Senate will work with me to find more effective ways \nof addressing drought. Detroit Lake is the prime example of how Federal \nprograms fail to prepare and assist non-agricultural communities \nthrough drought disasters. This must change. The Federal Government \nmust engage the States in preparing comprehensive drought contingency \nplans that address all those who are affected, agricultural and non-\nagricultural communities alike.\n  Areas like Detroit Lake and the Klamath Basin also portray in bold \nproportion the Federal Government's failure to take responsibility for \nits own actions, actions it deems necessary to meet environmental \ngoals. I do not believe, however, that commitment to shared \nenvironmental values means leaving dustbowls, wastelands, and paralyzed \ncommunities in the wake of Federal actions. There must be a better way.\n  Therefore, I am introducing legislation today that would qualify \ngovernment-induced disasters for Disaster relief under the same \nguidelines as natural disasters. It seems only fitting that if the \nGovernment causes the disaster, it should provide the same relief as \nwhen nature causes the problem.\n  I understand our environmental ethic, and I believe in our \nenvironmental stewardship obligations. But I know that I am not alone \nwhen I say this Government of the people and by the people, must also \nbe for the people. Including those people hurting in Detroit, OR, \ntoday.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1385. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant \nto the provisions of the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study \nand Facilities Act to participate in the design, planning, and \nconstruction of the Lakehaven water reclamation project for the \nreclamation and reuse of water; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important \nlegislation to improving the capacity and reliability of wastewater \nsystems in the State of Washington.\n  I thank my friend, Washington state's senior Senator, Patty Murray, \nwho worked on this legislation in the last Congress and who has been a \nchampion of clean water as a member of this body. I look forward to \nworking with her as we build on those efforts in the years to come.\n  The United States economy, the strongest economy in the world, is \nbuilt on our human infrastructure and our physical infrastructure. We \nhave among the most comprehensive air traffic, public transit, highway, \nand navigable waterway transportation systems; perhaps the most \nsophisticated energy transmission grids and communication networks; and \nthe most effective drinking water and wastewater systems in the world.\n  However, in the face of the natural aging and deterioration of these \nresources, combined with significant population growth, our Nation has \na massive need for investment in the maintenance and improvement of our \nresources. Our Nation's economic health, and literally the physical \nhealth of our constituents, depends on that investment.\n  In March, the American Society of Civil Engineers released a ``Report \nCard for America's Infrastructure.'' After an extensive survey of the \nNation's infrastructure, the group of professionals perhaps most \nfamiliar with the technical capabilities of the roads, bridges, dams, \nrunways, and water treatment plants, gave our Nation a cumulative grade \nof D+. The group estimated that our Nation needs to invest $1.3 \ntrillion over the next five years to bring our infrastructure up to the \nstandards that keep our overall economy out of the gridlock that has \ngripped many of our metropolitan areas, that will keep our families \nsafe, and that simply befits the nature of this great Nation in \nstriving to be the best in the world.\n  The legislation that my colleague and I are introducing today \naddresses only a small piece of this infrastructure, but it is \nnonetheless important in addressing the growth of our region and the \nimpacts of that growth on the water systems of one part of Washington. \nThis legislation will authorize one project, in one area of our state, \nbut it is essential to maintaining water quality in the Puget Sound \nregion for fish habitat, for wetland restoration, and for meeting the \ngrowing demands for water in the many communities served by the \nLakehaven Utility District.\n  Since 1972 the Federal Government has spent about $73 billion on \nwastewater treatment programs. That's certainly no minor contribution, \nand we have made progress, the elimination of nearly 85 percent of \nwastewater. Unfortunately, with aging water collection and treatment \nsystems across the Nation, it is still estimated that between 35 \npercent and 45 percent of U.S. surface waters do not meet current \nwater-quality standards. Our Nation's 16,000 wastewater systems still \nface enormous infrastructure funding needs.\n  While last year Congress appropriated $1.35 billion for wastewater \ninfrastructure, and another $1.35 billion in the legislation for fiscal \nyear 2002 that this body passed yesterday, EPA has estimated that we \nwill need to spend $126 billion by 2016 to fully achieve secondary \ntreatment improvements of existing facilities. So we still have a long \nway to go, and I intend to keep working on increasing that Federal \ncommitment with my colleagues.\n  Again, the legislation that we are introducing today will take steps \ntoward solving some of these infrastructure needs in the Puget Sound \narea and I will take a moment to explain the legislation.\n  The Lakehaven Utility District is one of Washington State's largest \nwater and sewer utilities providing 10.5 million gallons of water a day \nto over 100,000 residents and numerous corporate facilities in south \nKing county and parts of Pierce county. The demand for water from these \nsources has increased to a point that the district may soon exceed safe \nwater production limits and has resulted in reduction of water levels \nin all local aquifers.\n  The District has two secondary wastewater treatment plants that \ncurrently discharge more than 6 million gallons of water a day to Puget \nSound and the district is certain that techniques successfully used in \nmany parts of this Nation to utilize reclaimed water to manage \ngroundwater levels could be used in this region. The district has \nprepared a plan to construct additional treatment systems at the two \nwastewater treatment plants in the district, to improve pipeline \ndistribution systems for transporting water to the reuse areas, and \nsystems to direct water back to the aquifer system. if we make these \nimprovements, the district will be able to better maintain stream \nlevels during droughts and recharge the aquifers without using \nadditional surface water.\n  The legislation authorizes the Bureau of Reclamation to assist in the \nplanning, land acquisition and construction of this important water \nreclamation project. The bill limits the Federal contribution to 25 \npercent and would comply with other limitations and obligations of the \nReclamation Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act.\n  This project would begin to meet the needs of improving the \nwastewater systems serving a large segment of the Northwest population, \nand will provide additional protection for vital natural resources, \nusing economically feasible and proven technologies. The Federal \nGovernment has a role in maintaining these systems and assisting in \nbuilding additional infrastructure to handle our nation's massive \nneeds.\n  Thus I urge my colleagues to join with us in support of this critical \nlegislation for the state of Washington and our Nation, I look forward \nto working with my colleagues to expeditiously take up and pass this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 1386.

A bill to conduct a demonstration program to show that \nphysician shortage, recruitment, and retention problems may be \nameliorated in rural States by developing comprehensive program that \nwill result in statewide physician population growth, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe ``Rural States Physician Recruitment and Retention Demonstration \nAct of 2001,'' with Senators Domenici and Rockefeller. This Act would \ncreate a demonstration program to show that physician shortage, \nrecruitment, and retention problems may be ameliorated in demonstration \nStates by developing a training program and loan repayment program that \nwill result in statewide physician population growth.\n  The problem of recruiting and retaining physicians, particularly in \nsome specialties, has reached crisis proportions in my State. There are \nvery few small town residents who don't have a story to tell about \nlosing a cherished doctor or traveling vast distances to see a \nspecialist. And even in New Mexico's most populous city, Albuquerque, \nthe number of practicing neurosurgeons can be counted on one hand. Not \nso long ago there were 11 of them practicing there. We know that the \nsurgeons in Santa Fe are struggling to recruit a new general surgeon, \nas are many other communities throughout the State. We know that the \nthought of having an additional psychiatrist in Las Cruces would be \nconsidered by many to be an unrealistic fantasy. I am certain that many \nSenators from States that are demographically more similar to New \nMexico than they are to Washington, D.C. can truly understand the \ndiscrepancy in physician recruitment and retention.\n  Anyone representing a rural State knows that a certain amount of \nphysician turn over is inevitable and understandable. It is very \nimportant, however, to anticipate how we can ensure an adequate supply \nof physicians in the future. Payment for Graduate Medical Education \nslots has been frozen at the number of physicians who were being \ntrained in 1996. Within the past six months we have been told that the \nfunding for training family physicians, general internists, \npediatricians, dentists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and \nother health professionals should be drastically cut because ``today a \nphysician shortage no longer exists''. Although aggregate data appears \nto support the notion that we need not be concerned about a physician \nshortage, this does not reflect what is happening at home.\n  Health professional shortages continue to exist in geographically \nisolated and economically disadvantaged areas. This maldistribution \nproblem is exacerbated by market forces that often entice physicians to \nurban or suburban areas where higher income levels can be achieved. The \nMedicare payment formula further contributes to the problem by \nassessing a lower cost of living adjustment in rural areas and, \naccordingly, decreasing the Medicare payment rate in the very area \nwhere the physician shortage exists in the first place. Fortunately we \nknow that economics is only one of the many factors that physicians \nconsider when they are choosing a place to practice. Family \nconsiderations and lifestyle issues also play a vital role in this \nimportant decision. One of the best predictors of where a physician \nwill practice is directly related to the location of their post-\ngraduate medical education--they are likely to stay within a sixty-mile \nradius of where they did their residency training. This fact, provides \nus with a focus for this demonstration project.\n\n  This particular piece of legislation creates a demonstration program \nin nine States that will correct the flaws in the system in two ways, \nand then will track health professionals in each demonstration State \nthrough a state-specific health professions database. Demonstration \nStates would be identified using three criteria including an uninsured \nrate above the U.S. average, lack of primary care access above the U.S. \naverage, and a combined Medicare and Medicaid population above 20 \npercent.\n  The first flaw in the system is the capitation limit placed on all \nresidency graduate medical education positions in 1996. Whereas this \naction may have been appropriate for some States, maybe even most \nStates, it has been extremely damaging to rural States where we know \nphysicians are in short supply. This bill allows a sponsoring \ninstitution to increase the number of residency and fellowship \npositions by up to 50 percent if the sponsoring institution agrees to \nrequire that each resident or fellow in the affected training programs \nwould spend an aggregate of 10 percent of their time during training \nproviding supervised specialty services to underserved and rural \ncommunity populations outside of their training institution. A waiver \nfrom this rural outreach requirement can be granted by the Secretary \nfor certain hospital-based subspecialists, like neurosurgeons, if the \ndemonstration State can demonstrate a shortage of physicians in that \nspecialty statewide.\n  The second flaw in the system revolves around the debt load carried \nby many physicians when they finish their training program. Currently \nthere are several Federal and State programs that will help repay \neducation loans. The problem lies in the fact that only primary care \nspecialties currently qualify for these loan repayment programs. This \nlegislation creates a similar loan repayment program for underserved \nspecialists who agree to practice for one year in the demonstration \nState for each year of education loans that are repaid.\n  Thus, this demonstration project does two critical things for \nrecruitment and retention in rural States. It exposes to underserved \nareas that they may never have otherwise been exposed to, which \nincreases the possibility that they will stay and practice there. It \nalso relieves some of their economic burden from loans which may help \nto moderate the effect of lower Medicare reimbursement rates in rural \nareas.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\n                                S. 1387\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This mine has been \nan important part of the economy in the Black Hills, and its closure \npresented South Dakota with a serious challenge.\n  New opportunities for Lead became possible, however, when we learned \nthat a group of prominent scientists had identified the mine as a \npotential site to establish a national underground science laboratory. \nComposed of some of the foremost researchers in the country, the \nNational Underground Science Laboratory Committee found that \nHomestake's unique combination of depth, geologic stability and \noutstanding infrastructure made it an ideal location for an underground \nlaboratory that could support groundbreaking new scientific research. \nIn just the last few months, a $281 million proposal to construct the \nlaboratory has been submitted to the National Science Foundation.\n  As I learned, tiny particles known as neutrinos hold the answer to \nfundamental questions about the nature of the universe. These particles \ncannot be detected on the surface of the Earth due to the immense \namount of interference coming in from outer space. However, research \nlaboratories located deep underground, where detectors are shielded by \nthousand of feet of rock, have been able to detect these particles and \nprovide important new information to scientists. Because the Homestake \nmine in Lead is over 8,000 feet deep, it offers outstanding \nopportunities for such research. In fact one neutrino experiment has \nbeen operating there since the 1960s.\n  I have never seen such excitement in Lead as I have seen in relation \nto this proposal. Banners welcoming visiting scientists to Lead have \nbeen hung over the streets. The local chamber of commerce held a \n``Neutrino Day'' in February and reported the highest attendance for \nany even in recent memory. Students, teachers, miners, business\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\nowners, people from every walk of life, have contacted me to express \ntheir excitement about the possibility of building a laboratory. The \nsupport for this proposal is overwhelming.\n  In order to make the mine available for research, it is necessary for \nthe facility to be transferred to the State of South Dakota and for the \nUnited States to assume a portion of the liability currently associated \nwith the property. The purpose of the legislation Senator Johnson and I \nare introducing today is to ensure that this transfer takes places in a \nway that is fair to taxpayers, that protects the environment, and that \nensures this facility can ultimately become available for research.\n  This legislation establishes a number of steps that must be taken to \nmeet these goals. First it requires that an independent inspection of \nthe property take place to identify any condition that could pose a \nthreat to human health or the environment. The Environmental Protection \nAgency must review the report accompanying this inspection and ensure \nthat any problematic conditions are mitigated before transfer may be \nallowed to take place. Second, it requires that the State of South \nDakota purchase environmental insurance to protect the taxpayers \nagainst any issue that may arise as a result of acquiring the mine. \nThird, it establishes a trust fund to provide a permanent source of \nrevenue to finance any clean-up that may be necessary. Finally, this \nbill would take effect only if the National Science Foundation approves \nthe construction of the laboratory.\n\n  To be clear, only a portion of Homestake's existing facilities that \nare required for the laboratory are being considered for transfer. \nThese include the underground portion of the mine and a small \n``footprint'' on the surface. The legislation specifically prohibits \nany tailings storage sites, waste rock dumps or other areas from being \ntransferred, as these sites must be reclaimed by Homestake Mining \nCompany.\n  The final point I want to make is that this legislation is time-\nsensitive. Homestake's current plan to reclaim the underground mine is \nto let it slowly flood with water once the mine closes in January of \n2001. If that happens, we will forever lose the opportunity to create \nthis laboratory.\n  This legislation has been developed over a period of months in close \nconsultation with Homestake Mining Company, the environmental \ncommunity, the scientific community, the State of South Dakota and the \nSouth Dakota School of Mines and Technology. I want to thank all the \nindividuals involved with this effort for their help. In particular, \nI'd like to thank Governor Bill Janklow, whose help and support is this \nprocess have been invaluable.\n  I believe the resulting legislation is fair to all involved, and that \nit will ensure the success of the laboratory while protecting the \nenvironment. Moreover, by enabling the construction of this laboratory, \nit ultimately will bring significant benefits to the United States and \nmake an important contribution to human knowledge. I look forward to \nworking with all interested parties to make additional improvements to \nthis legislation when we return in September, and I am personally \ncommitted to passing this legislation in a timely manner this fall.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this legislation their support. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1389\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homestake Mine Conveyance \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the United States is among the leading nations in the \n     world in conducting basic scientific research;\n       (2) that leadership position strengthens the economy and \n     national defense of the United States and provides other \n     important benefits;\n       (3) the Homestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota, owned by the \n     Homestake Mining Company of California, is approximately \n     8,000 feet deep and is situated in a unique physical setting \n     that is ideal for carrying out certain types of particle \n     physics and other research;\n       (4) the Mine has been selected by the National Underground \n     Science Laboratory Committee, an independent panel of \n     distinguished scientists, as the preferred site for the \n     construction of a national underground laboratory;\n       (5) such a laboratory would be used to conduct scientific \n     research that would be funded and recognized as significant \n     by the United States;\n       (6) the establishment of the laboratory is in the national \n     interest, and would substantially improve the capability of \n     the United States to conduct important scientific research;\n       (7) for economic reasons, Homestake intends to cease \n     operations and close the Mine in 2001;\n       (8) on cessation of operations of the Mine, Homestake \n     intends to implement reclamation actions that would preclude \n     the establishment of a laboratory at the Mine;\n       (9) Homestake has advised the State that, after cessation \n     of operations at the Mine, instead of carrying out those \n     reclamation actions, Homestake is willing to donate the \n     underground portion of the Mine and certain other real and \n     personal property of substantial value at the Mine for use as \n     the underground science laboratory;\n       (10) use of the Mine as the site for the laboratory, \n     instead of other locations under consideration, would result \n     in a savings of millions of dollars;\n       (11) if the National Science Foundation selects the Mine as \n     the site for the laboratory, it is essential that Homestake \n     not complete certain reclamation activities that would \n     preclude the location of the laboratory at the Mine;\n       (12) Homestake is unwilling to donate, and the State is \n     unwilling to accept, the property at the Mine for the \n     laboratory if Homestake and the State would continue to have \n     potential liability with respect to the transferred property; \n     and\n       (13) to secure the use of the Mine as the location for the \n     laboratory, and to realize the benefits of the proposed \n     laboratory, it is necessary for the United States to--\n       (A) assume a portion of any potential future liability of \n     Homestake concerning the Mine; and\n       (B) address potential liability associated with the \n     operation of the laboratory.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make grants to \npromote innovative outreach and enrollment efforts under the State \nchildren's health insurance program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the bipartisan legislation I am \nintroducing today with Senators Lugar, Torricelli, and Corzine entitled \nthe ``Children's Health Coverage Improvement Act of 2001'' would \nimprove outreach and enrollment efforts targeted at children to \ndramatically reduce the number of uninsured children in this country. \nThis legislation is a companion bill to S. 1016, the ``Start Healthy, \nStay Healthy Act of 2001,'' which would expand and improve coverage to \nchildren and pregnant women through Medicaid and the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, CHIP.\n  The legislation provides $100 million in grants annually from the \nunspent allocations in CHIP to community-based public or non-profit \norganizations, including community health centers, children's \nhospitals, disproportionate share hospitals, local and county \ngovernment, and public health departments, for the purposes of \nconducting innovative outreach and enrollment efforts.\n  The bill further clarifies that the outstationed workers requirement \nin Medicaid, which requires that eligibility workers be available in \nthe public in our nation's community health centers and safety net \nhospitals, shall also enroll children in CHIP if they are eligible for \ncoverage under that program as well.\n  As you are aware, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nwhich was passed as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, was the \nlargest expansion of health coverage since the enactment of Medicare \nand Medicaid in 1965. The program, designed to cover low-income \nchildren under age 18, provides on average $4 billion a year to the \nstates to either expand Medicaid, establish a separate state program \napart from Medicaid, or a combination of the two approaches.\n  Unfortunately, according to an Urban Institute report entitled How \nFamiliar Are Low-Income Parents with Medicaid and SCHIP?, it is \nestimated that up to 80 percent of the 11 million uninsured children in \nthe country are eligible for but unenrolled in Medicaid or SCHIP. Thus, \nineligibility for coverage is no longer a barrier for the vast majority \nof uninsured children. Instead, as the report notes, ``A major \nchallenge today is how to reach and enroll the millions of children who \nare eligible but who remain uninsured.''\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\n  The biggest problems are knowledge gaps, confusion about program \nrules, and problems created by bureaucratic barriers to coverage. \nAccording to the study, ``Only 38 percent of low-income uninsured \nchildren have parents who have heard of Medicaid or SCHIP programs and \nwho also understand the basic eligibility rules,'' Moreover, less than \nhalf of parents, 47 percent, of low income uninsured children were even \naware of the separate SCHIP program.\n\n  As the authors conclude, ``For SCHIP expansions to reduce uninsurance \namong children, it is critical that families know about the coverage \navailable through separate non-Medicaid SCHIP programs . . . .''\n  In addition, senior health researcher Peter J. Cunningham at the \nCenter for Studying Health System Change recently published an article \nin Health Affairs entitled ``Targeting Communities With High Rates of \nUninsured Children'' that highlights that the ``key to getting children \ninsured'' is improved ``enrollment outreach.''\n  As the article notes, ``Policymakers have understood from the \nbeginning that the key to the success of SCHIP is in getting eligible \nchildren to enroll . . . The results of this study suggest that \noutreach activities and other efforts to stimulate enrollment need to \nbe especially focused in high-uninsurance areas, both because they \ninclude a large concentration of the nation's uninsured children and \nbecause take-up rates of public and private coverage have historically \nbeen lower in these areas.''\n  Cunningham particularly notes that children in high-uninsured \ncommunities are disproportionately Hispanic. As he points out, \n``Hispanics typically have lower take-up rates for health insurance \nprograms for which they are eligible. This could be attributable to \nimmigration concerns, language barriers, lack of awareness of public \nprograms, or not understanding the roll that insurance coverage plays \nin the United States in securing access to high-quality health care.''\n  As a result, the legislation also contains a provision giving \npriority to community-based organizations in communities with high \nrates of eligible but unenrolled children and in areas with high rates \nof families for whom English is not their primary language. It is \ncertainly my desire for programs such as ``promotoras'' or community \nhealth advisors to receive these grants, as they have been incredibly \neffective in New Mexico in improving health insurance coverage to \nchildren.\n  An estimated 11 million children under age 19 were without health \ninsurance in 1999, including 129,000 in New Mexico, representing 15 \npercent of all children in the United States and 22 percent of children \nin New Mexico, the fourth highest rate of uninsured children in the \ncountry. An estimated 103,000 of those children are in families with \nincomes below 200 percent of poverty, so the majority of those children \nare already eligible for but unenrolled in Medicaid.\n  Why is this important? According to the American College of \nPhysicians-American Society of Internal Medicine, uninsured children, \ncompared to the insured, are: up to 6 times more likely to have gone \nwithout needed medical, dental or other health care; 2 times more \nlikely to have gone without a physician visit during the previous year; \nup to 4 times more likely to have delayed seeking medical care; up to \n10 times less likely to have a regular source of medical care; 1.7 \ntimes less likely to receive medical treatment for asthma; and, up to \n30 percent less likely to receive medical attention for any injury.\n  In fact, one study has ``estimated that the 15 percent rise in the \nnumber of children eligible for Medicaid between 1984 and 1992 \ndecreased child mortality by 5 percent.'' This expansion of coverage \nfor children occurred, I would add, during the Reagan and Bush \nAdministrations, so this is clearly a bipartisan issue that deserves \nfurther bipartisan action.\n  Mr. President, I urge this legislation's immediate passage. We can \nand must do better for our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the text of the bill to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1390\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a grant program for Sexual Assault \nForensic Examiners, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sexual \nAssault Forensic Examiners Act of 2001, which is being co-sponsored by \nSenator DeWine. This bill aims to vastly improve the care of victims of \nsexual assault and help see to it that their attackers end up behind \nbars.\n  Over 300,000 women are sexually assaulted each year in the United \nStates. Unlike all other violent crimes, rape is not declining in \nfrequency. When a woman suffers the horrific crime of sexual assault, \nthere are two minimal things our system owes her. First, we owe it to \nher to do everything in our power to find and put her assailants behind \nbars. Second, we owe her prompt and caring treatment when she's \nreported the crime, which in itself is often an act of great courage. \nYet, all too often, we fail in these basic obligations.\n  Most rape victims who seek treatment go to hospital emergency rooms, \nwhere they often wait hours in public waiting rooms. Some leave the \nhospital altogether rather than endure extended delay, decreasing the \nlikelihood the offense will ever be reported or prosecuted. Once \nvictims are finally attended to, most victims are treated by a series \nof rushed emergency room nurses, doctors and lab technicians who often \nlack specialized training in the particular physical and psychological \ncare rape victims need. Emergency room nurses and doctors also \ntypically have little training in collecting, correctly handling and \npreserving forensic evidence from rape victims. Moreover, many \nhospitals lack the last forensic tools, such as dye that reveals \nmicroscopic scratches, and colposcopes, which detect and photograph \notherwise invisible pelvic injuries. As a result, evidence is \nmishandled or never uncovered in the first place--jeopardizing \nprosecutions. Finally, emergency room personnel, already overworked, \nare sometimes reluctant to cooperate with police and prosecutors in \nsexual assault cases,\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\nknowing this entails time-consuming interviews, witness preparation and \ncourt appearances--to say nothing of unpleasant cross-examinations.\n  SAFE programs dramatically improve the situation. SAFE examiners are \nspecially trained in the latest techniques of forensic evidence \ngathering. They cooperate fully with police and prosecutors, and their \nspecialized training and experience makes them better witnesses in \ncourt. When defendants claim consent, physical evidence of force, which \ncan be difficult to uncover and explain to juries--can make all the \ndifference. Prosecutors support SAFE programs because they lead to more \nprosecutions and convictions.\n  SAFE programs also provide better care to victims. Rather than face a \nlong public wait and a revolving door of emergency room care-givers, \nvictims treated by SAFEs are seen immediately in private, tell their \nstory to and receive care from a single attendant, and are treated with \ngreater sensitivity by examiners with specialized psychological \ntraining.\n  There are now fewer than 750 SAFE programs in the United States, \nserving less than 5 percent of all victims. Our bill aims to expand \nSAFE programs by providing $10 million a year from 2002 to 2006 in \ngrants to new or existing SAFE programs. SAFE programs currently have \nto compete against a myriad of other law enforcement and victims' \nprograms for federal funding under the Violence Against Women Act and \nthe Victims of Crime Act; by contrast, the SAFE Grant Act of 2001 will \nprovide a unique and direct source of Federal funding for SAFEs. The \nDepartment of Justice, which is already responsible for developing \nnational standards for SAFE programs, will administer the grants, \nensure that recipients conform to the national standards, and give \npriority to SAFE programs in currently undeserved areas.\n  Being the victims of a sexual assault is bad enough. We have to see \nto it that the system doesn't exacerbate the problem with shoddy care \nand mishandled cases. This bill should provide some help and I'm proud \nto introduce it today.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I rise as a cosponsor of the Sexual \nAssault Forensic Examiners Act of 2001, sponsored by my colleague, \nSenator Charles Schumer, to whom I am grateful for introducing this \nimportant legislation. The purpose of this legislation is to \nappropriate $10 million annually for the support of programs that \nutilize Sexual Assault Forensic Nurses in the treatment and counseling \nof rape victims.\n  Somewhere in America, a woman is sexually assaulted every two \nminutes. In the past year alone, 307,000 women were sexually assaulted \nin this country, and unlike other violent crimes, rape is not \ndecreasing in frequency. Unfortunately, the treatment that many rape \nvictims presently receive is far from adequate. Most victims of sexual \nassault who report their crimes do so in a hospital emergency room, \nwhere they frequently wait hours for treatment only to see doctors \nwithout specialized training who lack the proper forensic tools for \nevidence collection. Many victims report that their post-traumatic \nexperiences in hospitals constitute another humiliating victimization. \nVictims of sexual assault should not be traumatized twice, especially \nwhen there are better programs in place that could help them.\n  A Sexual Assault Forensic Examiner, often referred to as a SAFE, is a \nregistered nurse who has received advanced training and clinical \npreparation in the forensic examination of sexual assault victims. As \nopposed to rape survivors seen by typical emergency room personnel, \npatients seen by these SAFEs rarely wait for treatment, see a single \nspecially trained examiner instead of any number of different doctors, \nand receive sensitive, specialized care. The intervention of SAFEs in a \nsex crimes case bolsters the odds of prosecution and conviction of \noffenders, as these nurses are trained in the proper methods to utilize \n``rape kits'' and collect forensic evidence. Furthermore, the expertise \nof SAFE nurses renders them better witnesses than most emergency room \npersonnel during trials, which can make the difference between a \nconviction and an acquittal. The Department of Justice reports that in \nareas where SAFE programs have been established for more than 10 years, \nthere is a 96 percent rape conviction rate, as opposed to the 4% \naverage conviction rate in areas without SAFE facilities.\n  Five hundred SAFE programs currently exist in the United States, but \nthese programs treat less than 5 percent of all sexual assault victims. \nFinancial hurdles hinder the growth of SAFE programs, which frequently \ncompete with other law enforcement and victims' programs to obtain the \nlimited Federal funds available from existing sources. By creating a \nspecific and substantial source of Federal funding for SAFE programs, \nmore SAFE programs will be established, improving both the quality of \ncare provided to victims and the conviction rate of their assailants.\n  In the short time that I have been speaking here, two women became \nvictims of sexual violence. By lending your support to the ``Sexual \nAssault Forensic Examiner Grant Act of 2001,'' you can help assure that \nthe hundreds of thousands of women who are raped each year receive the \nsensitive medical care that hey both require and deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1392. A bill to establish procedures for the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs of the Department of the Interior with respect to tribal \nrecognition; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1393. A bill to provide grants to ensure full and fair \nparticipation in certain decisionmaking processes at the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation intended to help reform and improve the process by which \nthe Federal Government acknowledges the sovereign rights of American \nIndian tribes and their Governments.\n  I offer these bills with a sense of hope and with the expectation \nthat they will contribute to the larger national conversation about how \nthe Federal Government can best fulfill its obligations to America's \nnative peoples. Senator Inouye and Senator Campbell have provided \ninvaluable leadership on this issue and I hope that the bills I am \nintroducing today will serve as a modest, but useful contribution that \nwill help move us toward a more speedy and more fair recognition \nprocess.\n  Currently there are more than 150 Indian groups that have petitions \nfor recognition as sovereign tribes pending before the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs, BIA. No fewer than nine of those petitions are from groups \nbased in Connecticut.\n  Several recent actions by the BIA have generated considerable debate \nabout the timeliness, accuracy, and fairness of the BIA's actions. I \nbelieve that careful reform of the recognition process can help prevent \nfuture doubts before they emerge.\n  As we consider how best to reform the process for tribal recognition, \nwe ought to be guided by several firm principles: fairness, openness, \nrespect, and a common interest in bettering the quality of life for all \nAmericans. The two bills that I am introducing today are based on these \nprinciples and I believe will bring us closer to our shared objectives.\n  Problems with the current recognition process have been well \ndocumented. It is widely recognized that the process is taking too long \nto resolve the claims of many Indian groups. It is also known that \ntowns and other interested parties often believe that their input is \nignored.\n  Last year, the then-Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs testified \nbefore the Senate Indian Affairs Committee on the BIA's tribal \nrecognition process. In a remarkable statement, he called for an \noverhaul of that process. I do not disagree. In fact, I believe that we \nhave an obligation to restore public confidence in the recognition \nprocess.\n  I have proposed a three-part legislative initiative to make the \nprocess more accurate, more fair, and more timely. Those parts are: \none, provide more money to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. I have \npreviously called for increases in the budget for the BIA so it can \nupgrade its recognition process. For several years, I have sought and \nsupported additional funding for the BIA's branch of acknowledgment and\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nresearch. The legislation that I am introducing today would \ndramatically increase the BIA's budget for this office. Right now, the \nBIA has about 150 recognition petitions pending. At the current pace, \nit takes an average of eight to ten years for a tribe's petition to be \ndecided upon. It seems to me that is an unacceptably long amount of \ntime. Indeed, I can think of no other area of law where Americans must \nwait as long to have their rights adjudicated and vindicated. Under any \nscenario for reform, the BIA should have more resources to get the job \ndone efficiently, thoroughly, and most importantly, accurately. The \ntribal recognition and Indian Bureau Enhancement Act, which I am \nintroducing would authorize $10 million to help BIA quickly address its \nbacklog. This funding increase is critical to help remedy deficiencies \nin the process by which Indian groups are evaluated and recommended for \nacknowledgment as sovereign legal entities.\n\n  Two, this legislation will provide assistance grants to local \ngovernments and tribes so that they can fully participate in the \nrecognition process and other BIA proceedings. Any government or tribe \nwould have to demonstrate financial need as a condition of receiving \nthese funds. And they would have to demonstrate that a grant would \npromote the interests of just administration at the BIA. My intention \nhere is to help improve the fact-finding process and ensure that the \nBureau's recognition decisions are based on the best available \ninformation.\n  Three, I propose that we make the recognition process more \ntransparent. It bears noting that there has never been an unambiguous \ngrant of authority from Congress to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to \nadminister a program for the recognition of Indian Tribes. I believe \nthat it is time for Congress to make such a clear grant of authority. \nThe legislation I am proposing would essentially codify many of the \nregulations that the BIA has been operating under for years. I believe \nthat it is in the interest of the general public and American's \nsovereign tribes to ensure that those parts of the BIA regulations that \nare working well will have the full force of statutory law. Relying on \nstatutory authority, rather than regulations, will afford the public \nand tribes with a measure of certainty and permanency that has \nheretofore been lacking. Anchoring the BIA's authority in legislation \nwill also restore Congress to an appropriate position where it can more \neffectively monitor and oversee execution of its law.\n  Let me stress something about these proposed reforms: We should seek \nnot to dictate an outcome, but to ensure a process that is fair, open, \nand respectful to all. That is the best guarantee of an outcome that is \njust whatever it may be.\n  In concluding, I appreciate that the steps I announced today may \nappear modest to some, excessive to others. I know they will not please \neveryone. But they do, I believe, outline a series of actions that can \nbring greater fairness, openness, and respect to this area of Federal \npolicy. That is my sincere hope, in any event.\n  I look forward to discussing these and other ideas with Chairman \nInouye, Senator Campbell, and their colleagues on the Indians Affairs \nCommittee. I submit these bills to them in humble recognition of their \nwealth of wisdom and understanding about these matters. I also look \nforward to discussing them with our other colleagues here in the Senate \nand with members of the communities that may be impacted by these \nproposals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of both bills be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1392\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has an obligation to recognize and \n     respect the sovereignty of Native American peoples who have \n     maintained their social, cultural, and political identity.\n       (2) All Native American tribal governments that represent \n     tribes that have maintained their social, cultural, and \n     political identity, to the extent possible within the context \n     of history, are entitled to establish government-to-\n     government relations with the United States and are entitled \n     to the rights appertaining to sovereign governments.\n       (3) The Bureau of Indian Affairs of the Department of the \n     Interior exercises responsibility for determining whether \n     Native American groups constitute ``Federal Tribes'' and are \n     therefore entitled to be recognized by the United States as \n     sovereign nations.\n       (4) In recent years, the decisionmaking process used by the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs to resolve claims of tribal \n     sovereignty has been widely criticized.\n       (5) In order to ensure continued public confidence in the \n     Federal Government's decisions pertaining to tribal \n     recognition, it is necessary to reform the recognition \n     process.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To establish administrative procedures to extend \n     Federal recognition to certain Indian groups.\n       (2) To extend to Indian groups that are determined to be \n     Indian tribes the protection, services, and benefits \n     available from the Federal Government pursuant to the Federal \n     trust responsibility with respect to Indian tribes.\n       (3) To extend to Indian groups that are determined to be \n     Indian tribes the immunities and privileges available to \n     other federally acknowledged Indian tribes by virtue of their \n     status as Indian tribes with a government-to-government \n     relationship with the United States.\n       (4) To ensure that when the Federal Government extends \n     acknowledgment to an Indian group, the Federal Government \n     does so based upon clear, factual evidence derived from an \n     open and objective administrative process.\n       (5) To provide clear and consistent standards of \n     administrative review of documented petitions for Federal \n     acknowledgment.\n       (6) To clarify evidentiary standards and expedite the \n     administrative review process by providing adequate resources \n     to process petitions.\n\n     SEC. 4.

EFFECT OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF TRIBAL EXISTENCE.\n\n       Acknowledgment of an Indian tribe under this Act--\n       (1) confers the protection, services, and benefits of the \n     Federal Government available to Indian tribes by virtue of \n     their status as tribes;\n       (2) means that the tribe is entitled to the immunities and \n     privileges available to other\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\n     federally acknowledged Indian tribes by virtue of their \n     government-to-government relationship with the United States;\n       (3) means that the United States recognizes that the tribe \n     has the responsibilities, powers, limitations, and \n     obligations of a federally acknowledged Indian tribe; and\n       (4) subjects the Indian tribe to the same authority of \n     Congress and the United States to which other federally \n     acknowledged tribes are subjected.\n\n     SEC. 6. SCOPE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act applies only to those Native \n     American Indian groups indigenous to the continental United \n     States which are not currently acknowledged as Indian tribes \n     by the Department. It is intended to apply only to groups \n     that can present evidence of a substantially continuous \n     tribal existence and which have functioned as autonomous \n     entities throughout history until the date of the submission \n     of the documented petition.\n       (b) Exclusions.--The procedures established under this Act \n     shall not apply to any of the following:\n       (1) Any Indian tribe, organized band, pueblo, Alaska Native \n     village, or community that, as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act, has been acknowledged as such and is receiving \n     services from the Bureau.\n       (2) An association, organization, corporation, or group of \n     any character that has been formed after December 31, 2002.\n       (3) Splinter groups, political factions, communities, or \n     groups of any character that separate from the main body of a \n     currently acknowledged tribe, except that any such group that \n     can establish clearly that the group has functioned \n     throughout history until the date of the submission of the \n     documented petition as an autonomous tribal entity may be \n     acknowledged under this Act, even though the group has been \n     regarded by some as part of or has been associated in some \n     manner with an acknowledged North American Indian tribe.\n       (4) Any group which is, or the members of which are, \n     subject to congressional legislation terminating or \n     forbidding the Federal relationship.\n       (5) Any group that previously petitioned and was denied \n     Federal acknowledgment under part 83 of title 25 of the Code \n     of Federal Regulations prior to the date of enactment of this \n     Act, including reorganized or reconstituted petitioners \n     previously denied, or splinter groups, spinoffs, or component \n     groups of any type that were once part of petitioners \n     previously denied.\n       (c) Pending Petitions.--Any Indian group whose documented \n     petition is under active consideration under the regulations \n     referred to in subsection (b)(5) as of the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and for which a determination is not final and \n     effective as of such date, may opt to have their petitioning \n     process completed in accordance with this Act. Any such group \n     may request a suspension of consideration in accordance with \n     the provisions of section 83.10(g) of title 25 of the Code of \n     Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act, of not more than 180 days in order to provide \n     additional information or argument.\n\n     SEC. 7. LETTER OF INTENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Any Indian group in the continental United \n     States that desires to be acknowledged as an Indian tribe and \n     that can satisfy the mandatory criteria set forth in section \n     10 may submit a letter of intent to the Secretary. A letter \n     of intent may be filed in advance of, or at the same time as, \n     a group's documented petition.\n       (b) Approval of Governing Body.--A letter of intent must be \n     produced, dated, and signed by the governing body of the \n     Indian group submitting the letter.\n\n     SEC. 8. DUTIES OF THE DEPARTMENT.\n\n       (a) Publication of List of Indian Tribes.--The Department \n     shall publish in the Federal Register, no less frequently \n     than every 3 years, a list of all Indian tribes entitled to \n     receive services from the Bureau by virtue of their status as \n     Indian tribes.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DOCUMENTED PETITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The documented petition may be in any \n     readable form that contains detailed, specific evidence in \n     support of a request to the Secretary to acknowledge tribal \n     existence.\n       (b) Approval of Governing Body.--The documented petition \n     must include a certification, signed and dated by members of \n     the group's governing body, stating that it is the group's \n     official documented petition.\n       (c) Satisfaction of Mandatory Criteria.--A petitioner must \n     satisfy all of the mandatory criteria set forth in section 10 \n     in order for tribal existence to be acknowledged. The \n     documented petition must include thorough explanations and \n     supporting documentation in response to all of such criteria.\n       (d) Standards for Denial.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a \n     petitioner shall not be acknowledged if the evidence \n     presented by the petitioner or others is insufficient to \n     demonstrate that the petitioner meets each of the mandatory \n     criteria in section 10.\n       (2) Reasonable likelihood of validity.--A criterion shall \n     be considered met if the Secretary finds that it is more \n     likely than not that the evidence presented demonstrates the \n     establishment of the criterion.\n       (3) Conclusive proof not required.--Conclusive proof of the \n     facts relating to a criterion shall not be required in order \n     for the criterion to be considered met.\n       (e) Consideration of Historical Situations.--Evaluation of \n     petitions shall take into account historical situations and \n     time periods for which evidence is demonstrably limited or \n     not available. The limitations inherent in demonstrating the \n     historical existence of community and political influence or \n     authority shall also be taken into account. Existence of \n     community and political influence or authority shall be \n     demonstrated on a substantially continuous basis, but such \n     demonstration does not require meeting these criteria at \n     every point in time. Fluctuations in tribal activity during \n     various years shall not in themselves be a cause for denial \n     of acknowledgment under these criteria.\n\n     SEC. 10. MANDATORY CRITERIA FOR FEDERAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT.\n\n       The mandatory criteria for Federal acknowledgment are the \n     following:\n       (1) Identification on a substantially continuous basis.--\n     The petitioner has been identified as an American Indian \n     entity on a substantially continuous basis since 1900. \n     Evidence that the group's character as an Indian entity has \n     from time to time been denied shall not be considered to be \n     conclusive evidence that this criterion has not been met. \n     Evidence to be relied upon in determining a group's Indian \n     identity may consist of any 1, or a combination, of the \n     following, as well as other evidence of identification by \n     other than the petitioner itself or its members:\n       (A) Identification as an Indian entity by Federal \n     authorities.\n       (B) Relationships with State governments based on \n     identification of the group as Indian.\n       (C) Dealings with a county, parish, or other local \n     government in a relationship based on the group's Indian \n     identity.\n       (D) Identification as an Indian entity by anthropologists, \n     historians, or other scholars.\n       (E) Identification as an Indian entity in newspapers and \n     books.\n       (F) Identification as an Indian entity in relationships \n     with Indian tribes or with national, regional, or State \n     Indian organizations.\n       (2) Distinct community.--\n       (A) In general.--A predominant portion of the petitioning \n     group comprises a distinct community and has existed as a \n     community from historical times until the date of the \n     submission of the documented petition. This criterion may be \n     demonstrated by some combination of the following evidence or \n     other evidence:\n       (i) Significant rates of marriage within the group, or, as \n     may be culturally required, patterned out-marriages with \n     other Indian populations.\n       (ii) Significant social relationships connecting individual \n     members.\n       (iii) Significant rates of informal social interaction \n     which exist broadly among the members of a group.\n       (iv) A significant degree of shared or cooperative labor or \n     other economic activity among the membership.\n       (v) Evidence of strong patterns of discrimination or other \n     social distinctions by nonmembers.\n       (vi) Shared sacred or secular ritual activity encompassing \n     most of the group.\n       (vii) Cultural patterns shared among a significant portion \n     of the group that are different from those of the non-Indian \n     populations with whom it interacts. Such patterns must \n     function as more than a symbolic identification of the group \n     as Indian, and may include language, kinship organization, or \n     religious beliefs and practices.\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\n       (viii) The persistence of a named, collective Indian \n     identity continuously over a period of more than 50 years, \n     notwithstanding changes in name.\n       (ix) A demonstration of historical political influence \n     under the criterion in paragraph (3) shall be evidence for \n     demonstrating historical community.\n       (B) Sufficient evidence.--A petitioner shall be considered \n     to have provided sufficient evidence of community at a given \n     point in time if evidence is provided to demonstrate any 1 of \n     the following:\n       (i) More than 50 percent of the members reside in a \n     geographical area exclusively or almost exclusively composed \n     of members of the group, and the balance of the group \n     maintains consistent interaction with some members of the \n     community.\n       (ii) At least 50 percent of the marriages in the group are \n     between members of the group.\n       (iii) At least 50 percent of the group members maintain \n     distinct cultural patterns such as language, kinship \n     organization, or religious beliefs and practices.\n       (iv) There are distinct community social institutions \n     encompassing most of the members, such as kinship \n     organizations, formal or informal economic cooperation, or \n     religious organizations.\n       (v) The group has met the criterion in paragraph (3) using \n     evidence described in paragraph (3)(A).\n       (3) Political influence or authority.--\n       (A) In general.--The petitioner has maintained political \n     influence or authority over its members as an autonomous \n     entity from historical times until the date of the submission \n     of the documented petition.

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 150\n\n       Whereas parents play an indispensable role in the rearing \n     of their children;\n       Whereas good-parenting is a time-consuming, emotionally \n     demanding task that is essential not only to the health of a \n     household but to the well-being of our Nation;\n       Whereas without question, the future of our Nation depends \n     largely upon the willingness of mothers and fathers, however \n     busy or distracted, to embrace their parental \n     responsibilities and to vigilantly watch over and guide the \n     lives of their children;\n       Whereas mothers and fathers must strive tirelessly to raise \n     children in an atmosphere of decency, discipline, and \n     devotion, where encouragement abounds and where kindness, \n     affection, and cooperation are in plentiful supply;\n       Whereas the journey into adulthood can be perilous and \n     lonely for a child without stability, direction, and \n     emotional support;\n       Whereas children benefit enormously from parents with whom \n     they feel safe, secure, and valued, and in an environment \n     where adult and child alike can help one another aspire to \n     joy and fulfillment on a variety of levels; and\n       Whereas such a domestic climate contributes significantly \n     to the development of healthy, well-adjusted adults, and it \n     is imperative that the general population not underestimate \n     the favorable impact that positive parenting can have on \n     society as a whole: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 23 through September \n     29, 2001, as ``National Parents Week''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to observe such \n     week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, to offer a resolution \ndesignating September 23 through September 29, 2001, as ``National \nparents Week.'' During this week, advocates would wear purple ribbons \nand communities all over would take time to reflect on how important \nparents are in our children's lives.\n  As proud parents of eight children and now six grandchildren, my \nwife, Fran, and I know that our Nation's future is in the hands of our \nchildren. They are the next doctors, firefighters, teachers, and \nparents, themselves. To quote Abraham Lincoln, ``a child is a person \nwho is going to carry-on what you have started . . . the fate of \nhumanity is in his hands.'' President Lincoln's worlds hold as true \ntoday as they did well over one hundred years ago.\n  To safeguard this future, parents must fulfill many demanding \nresponsibilities. They must guide their children, teach them right from \nwrong, share in their joy and comfort, and support them in times of \nneed. As any parent knows, this is not always easy. It takes a parent's \nconstant dedication, constant attention, and constant love. This \nresolution will serve as a giant ``thank you'' to all the parents who \nwork so hard every day to provide for their children.\n  With this resolution, we congratulate and adulate parents in order to \nassure them that we are behind them--100 percent. They must know how \nimportant it is to stay the course and continue to provide the values \nand lessons that will secure a bright and promising future for our \nchildren.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mike DeWine, to introduce legislation that will \nhighlight the week of September 23, 2001 as National Parent's Week.\n  Positive parenting is a task that is crucial to the future of our \nNation, yet the responsibilities and burdens that fall upon parents are \ntoo often undervalued. I believe it is essential that we highlight the \nimportance of parents in developing healthy and productive children in \nour society.\n  Children thrive in homes where parents take an active role in \nproviding\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nstability, safety and discipline. This, combined with unconditional \naffection and encouragement, provide children with the solid foundation \nto move ahead in life.\n  I was fortunate to have grown up in a household with such loving and \ndedicated parents. My mother and father strongly believed in the duty \nand responsibility they had to their six children, and worked \ntirelessly to ensure that my brothers and sisters and I would become \nhealthy, productive adults.\n  As a matter of fact, it is from my parents that I learned the \nimportance of using my God-given talents to serve others. My life in \npublic service has been a reflection of what they not only preached, \nbut on how they lived their lives. My siblings and I were taught early \non that part of earning and deserving our citizenship was giving back, \nnot only to our immediate family, but also to our community and our \ncountry.\n  Even as my mother entered her eighties, she still served as a model \nfor our family. Although, she was moving on in years, she would still \nvolunteer her time in the library of a Cleveland city school. I would \nask her, ``Mom--why are you still doing this? You've done enough! Why \ndon't you just rest and take it easy?''\n  Her answer was always the same: ``Because I'm needed.''\n  I was truly blessed to have two wonderful parents who were such \nloving and supportive role models. Too often, today's youth look \nelsewhere for guidance and comfort, not realizing that all the support \nand guidance they need is already there under their own roof. It is \nimperative that we bring the role of parents back to prominence, for \nthey are the front-line for instilling the values we cherish in all our \nnation's youth.\n  I encourage parents all over the nation to recognize and cherish the \nblessing and responsibility the have in raising God's gifts to them. It \nis my hope that through the establishment of ``National Parents Week,'' \nwe will raise awareness of just how important our parents are in \nmolding the next generation of Americans citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8973-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 151--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nWORLD CONFERENCE AGAINST RACISM, RACIAL DISCRIMINATION, XENOPHOBIA, AND \n  RELATED INTOLERANCE PRESENTS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS GLOBAL \n                             DISCRIMINATION\n\n  Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. \nClinton, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Corzine) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

The \nPresident recently signed into law the Veterans' Survivor Benefits \nImprovement Act. This Act, for the first time, provides the VA with a \nlegislative mandate to provide outreach and assistance to dependents of \nveterans. In addition to this legislation, several of my distinguished \ncolleagues in the Senate have introduced the Veterans' Right to Know \nAct. This Act would require the VA, once it received an application for \nany benefit, to inform a veteran or a dependent about ALL VA benefits. \nThe Veterans' Right to Know Act would also require the VA to develop an \nannual outreach plan by working with service organizations representing \nveterans.\n  However, I know that the VA is concerned that some of these \ninitiatives are bureaucratic requirements that would divert resources \nfrom programs that directly serve the veteran population. I understand \nthe concerns of the VA and let me make it clear that I am not here \ntoday to criticize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs or the employees \nof the VA. I consider the Secretary and his employees to be some of the \nmost dedicated public servants in the Nation.\n  Instead, I am here today to ask for the Secretary's help and to ask \nhim to consider our perspective as legislators. We have passed \nlegislation to provide health care and economic security to our \nNation's veterans and yet we often hear from constituents who are not \naware of the benefits and services the VA provides.\n  One of the most important benefits the VA provides is comprehensive \nhealth care, including low-cost prescription medications. \nUnfortunately, many veterans believe they have to be disabled or poor \nto enroll in the VA health care system. The reality is that any \nhonorably discharged veteran can enroll in VA health care.\n  Let me tell you about a message recently posted on the Web site of \nSeniors USA. The message is from Art Mazer, who is the Coordinator for \nthe Gray Panthers of Greater Boston, Mr. Mazer writes that he has just \nenrolled in the VA health care system and will now receive his \nmedications for just $2 per month from the VA pharmacy. Mr. Mazer, who \nhappened to find out about these pharmacy benefits through an email \nnewsletter of the Social Security Administration, refers to the \nprescription drug benefits provided by the VA as ``one of the best kept \nsecrets'' in the government. Although I applaud the Social Security \nAdministration for its informative newsletter and I am glad Mr. Mazer \nis sharing the information with other seniors, I am concerned that VA \nhealth care is being described on an Internet site for seniors as one \nof the best kept secrets of the government.\n  In some ways, it is appropriate that Mr. Mazer found out about VA \nbenefits from the Social Security Administration. Remarkably, two out \nof every five veterans receive Social Security. Today, more than nine \nmillion veterans are on the Social Security rolls. Over the next \nseveral years, we will see millions of Vietnam Era veterans being \nbrought into Social Security's disability and retirement programs.\n\n  The Social Security Administration has one of the most extensive \nsystems of public communication in our government. Each year, this \nAgency sends out tens of millions of notices to its beneficiaries. \nThese notices inform the public about Social Security, Medicare, and \nother vital government programs. Every workday, 100,000 citizens visit \nthe Social Security Administration's 1,300 field offices around the \ncountry. The primary role of field office employees is to administer \nthe Social Security programs, but we know from our disabled and elderly \nconstituents that it is often a Social Security employee who tells them \nabout a program to help pay their Medicare bills or a program to help \nthem meet their food expenses. Simply put, the Social Security \nAdministration is on the front lines in our battle to alleviate poverty \namong our disabled and elderly citizens.\n  The Resolution I am submitting today calls on the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to request assistance from the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity in fulfilling the Secretary's mandate to provide outreach to \nveterans and their dependents. The Resolution outlines four \ninitiatives, but let me talk briefly about just one.\n  Each year the Social Security Administration mails 45 million cost-\nof-living adjustment notices to its beneficiaries. The primary purpose \nof these COLA notices is to tell beneficiaries how much their benefits \nwill increase. However, the Social Security Administration has used a \nportion of these notices in the past to provide information on \ngovernment health care programs, such as Medicare. It is my hope that \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs will request that a portion of these \nCOLA notices include information on the VA health care system, \nincluding its provision of low-cost prescription drugs. The VA, to its \ncredit, has developed a Health Benefits Hotline, 1-877-222-VETS, so \nthat veterans can find out about and enroll in VA health care. The COLA \nnotices are an effective way to publicize this Hotline. We know that it \nrequires time to prepare for these outreach initiatives, but I am \nhopeful that this initiative could be implemented for the December 2002 \nCOLA notices. This gives the Secretary over a year to work with the \nSocial Security Administration to implement the initiative.\n  The initiatives outlined in this Resolution are not costly or \nintrusive because they build on the already-existing capabilities of \nthe Federal Government. And yet, these initiatives will inform millions \nof veterans and their dependents about VA programs.\n  The current Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Anthony J. Principi, is a \ncombat-decorated veteran. I know he is deeply committed to serving \nveterans and their families. So, today, through this Resolution, I am \nasking him to take some practical steps to ensure that our veterans and \ntheir families are fully informed about benefits and services provided \nby the VA. I feel sure that the Social Security Administration, an \nAgency with a well-earned reputation for serving the disabled and the \nelderly, will respond favorably to a request for assistance by \nSecretary Principi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8974-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8974-S8975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 153--RECOGNIZING THE ENDURING CONTRIBUTIONS, HEROIC \n       ACHIEVEMENTS, AND DEDICATED WORK OF SHIRLEY ANITA CHISHOLM\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON (for herself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nLevin, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Senator Lott has joined me in \nsponsoring this resolution renaming the Regional Humanities Initiative \nat the National Endowment for the Humanities, NEH, the Eudora Welty \nRegional Humanities Initiative.\n  One of the great themes of Miss Welty's writings is a sense of place. \nIt is fitting then that the Regional Humanities Initiative that honors \nthe places from which we come and will preserve our history and culture \nfor future generations be named for her.

Mr. President, it is an honor to be here today to \nsubmit a resolution to recognize the contributions of minority women to \nwomen's suffrage and to the history of our country. This resolution \nestablishes an Advisory Committee and directs the Architect of the \nCapitol to enter into a contract for the design and construction of a \nmonument commemorating the contributions of minority women.\n  I was so pleased when Congressman Davis introduced this resolution. \nHis decision was inspired by the observations of a young woman working \nin his office who noticed, as she toured the Capitol, that there are so \nfew women, and even fewer minority women, represented in these sacred \nhalls.\n  The under-representation of women and minorities does a disservice to \nthe thousands of schoolchildren who tour the Capitol every year. I \nbelieve the time has come, and is in fact long overdue, to create a \nstatute honoring the contributions of minority women who were \ninstrumental in building our country and leaders in extending equal \nrights to all people.\n  I can cite many examples of minority women who I would like to see \nconsidered for recognition. Women with New York roots such as Harriet \nTubman, Sojourner Truth and Maud Nathan have made considerable \ncontributions to our nation's history.\n  Harriet Tubman, whose home was in Auburn, NY, escaped slavery and \nthen risked her life again and again to return and lead so many others \nto freedom. Harriet Tubman's motto was, ``keep going.'' She would \nencourage escaped slaves in their journey by saying, ``Children if you \nare tired, keep going; if you are scared, keep going; if you are \nhungry, keep going; if you want to taste freedom, keep going.'' Harriet \nTubman went on to be an active leader in the women's movement, to work \nfor schools for freed slaves and to establish services for the elderly \nand destitute. Her actions were selfless and her courage is of heroic \nproportions.\n  Sojourner Truth was born enslaved in Upstate New York. After her \nrelease from slavery, she went on to work as an abolitionist and then \nas a leader in the women's movement. She was a highly effective \nspeaker, and used her voice to see that equal rights would be extended \nto all people regardless of the color of one's skin or one's gender. \nMaud Nathan is another example of a New Yorker who was influential in \nthe women's suffrage movement and served as an early and innovative \nconsumer advocate, organizing for better conditions for working women.\n  I often think of the courage and vision of these women and so many \nothers who put their lives on the line in the abolitionist, suffrage, \ncivil rights and women's movements, and it is a great sense of pride to \nme that so many women leaders were from New York.\n  It is our responsibility to make sure that the contributions of \nminority women with stories similar to Truth, Tubman, Nathan, and so \nmany others, are told in our schoolrooms, at our dinner tables and yes, \ncelebrated in the halls of Congress.\n  In 1997, after more than 75 years of storage in the crypt, a monument \nrecognizing suffragists Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and \nLucretia Mott was moved to a visible location in the Rotunda. This was \nthe right decision then, and no doubt has aroused the interest of so \nmany people who have had the opportunity to view it since the move.\n  Now we have an opportunity to make significant strides toward telling \na far more accurate story of our Nation's collective history by \ncelebrating the minority women who were behind so many of our nation's \nimportant social movements. Their commitment, resilience and courage \ncan be a great source of strength to the next generation of women who \nwill assume the struggles shaping our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8976-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8976-S8977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 65--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n           ALL AMERICANS SHOULD BE MORE INFORMED OF DYSPRAXIA\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself and Mr. Breaux) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, I rise today to say just a few words on \nthe resolution I have submitted concerning Dyspraxia, a developmental \ndisorder that affects five percent of American children each year. My \nintent is to increase the public's awareness of this disability and to \nencourage each of my colleagues to do the same.\n  Let me share with you a few facts. Dyspraxia is caused from the \nmalformation of the neurons of the brain, thus resulting in messages \nnot being properly transmitted to the body. Areas such as movement, \nlanguage, perception, and thought are affected. Dyspraxia children fail \nto achieve the expected levels of development. Due to difficulties, \nthese kids are often shunned from their peer groups because they do not \nfit in. One in twenty children suffers from Dyspraxia. Seventy percent \nof those affected are male, and in children suffering from extreme \nemotional and behavioral difficulties the incidence is likely to be \nmore than fifty percent. There is no cure for Dyspraxia, but the \nearlier a child is diagnosed the greater the chance of developmental \nmaturation. However, many times these children are dismissed as \n``clumsy'' and ``slow'' and are never given a chance to improve, \nfinding it hard to succeed under such harsh speculations. More than \nfifty percent of our educators are unaware that this disability even \nexists. With such alarming statistics, the number of children \nrecognized cannot be expected to increase.\n  One of my interns has a younger brother that suffers from this \ndisorder. Borden Wilson is actually a success story. At age 4, Borden's \nparents noted that he was not able to perform tasks appropriate for his \nage. He was not speaking much, even with encouragement. After going \nthrough a battery of tests performed by various specialists, the \nproblem was identified as Dyspraxia. Upon suggestion, Borden began \nspeech therapy, occupational therapy, and many activities, such as a \nmore structured kindergarten, T-ball, swim team, and karate. Borden's \nspeech is now improving with every day, but one would notice that it is \n``halted.'' He has to concentrate on all that he says. School was \ndefinitely a battle to be fought. Borden needs a lot of repetition to \nlearn, and learning is easier when all five senses are stimulated. \nSpelling lists are practiced the entire week in advance. As one can \nimagine, Borden needs constant encouragement. It is very discouraging \nto work twice as hard as everyone else and still not possibly be on a \nlevel to compete. Borden is 14 years old now. Through the hard work of \nteachers, therapists, and family, he has overcome many of his problems \nand is successful in both school and extracurricular activities. I am \npleased to announce that Borden now maintains a 4.0 grade point average \nand placed in the ninety-nine percentile on his California Achievement \nTest.\n  This is why it is so vital that we make people aware of Dyspraxia. \nWith proper diagnosis and treatment, all of these children can \nexperience the same level of success that Borden has been able to \nachieve. I hope that my colleagues will come together in support of \nthis important legislation to raise consciousness of this disability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8977-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1471.

Reg. \n     6976).\n        Sec. 429. Arsenic in Playground Equipment. (a)  \n     Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of Health and Human Services has \n     determined that arsenic is a known carcinogen, and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency has classified chromated \n     copper arsenate (CCA), which is 22 percent arsenic, as a \n     ``restricted use chemical''.\n       (2) CCA is often used as a preservative in pressure-treated \n     wood, and CCA-treated wood is widely used in constructing \n     playground equipment frequented by children.\n       (3) In 2001, many communities in Florida and elsewhere have \n     temporarily or permanently closed playgrounds in response to \n     elevated levels\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\n     of arsenic in soil surrounding CCA-treated wood playground \n     equipment.\n       (4) The State of Florida recently announced that its own \n     wood-treatment plant would cease using arsenic as a \n     preservative.\n       (5) PlayNation Play Systems, which manufactures playground \n     equipment, announced in June 2001 that it would no longer use \n     CCA as a preservative in its playground products.\n       (6) In May 2001, the Environmental Protection Agency \n     announced that it would expedite its ongoing review of the \n     health risks facing children playing near CCA-treated wood \n     playground equipment, and produce its findings in June 2001. \n     The EPA later postponed the release of its risk assessment \n     until the end of the summer of 2001, and announced that its \n     risk assessment would be reviewed by a Scientific Advisory \n     Panel in October 2001.\n       (7) The EPA also plans to expedite its risk assessment \n     regarding the re-registering of arsenic as a pesticide by \n     accelerating its release from 2003 to 2002.\n       (8) The Consumer Product Safety Commission, which has the \n     authority to ban hazardous and dangerous products, announced \n     in June 2001 that it would consider a petition seeking the \n     banning of CCA-treated wood from all playground equipment.\n       (9) Many viable alternatives to CCA-treated wood exist, \n     including cedar, plastic products, aluminum, and treated wood \n     without CCA. These products, alone or in combination, can \n     fully replace CCA-treated wood in playground equipment.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the potential health and safety risks to children \n     playing on and around CCA-treated wood playground equipment \n     is a matter of the highest priority, which demands immediate \n     attention from the Congress, the Executive Branch, State and \n     local governments, affected industries, and parents.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, in consultation with the Consumer Product \n     Safety Commission, shall submit a report to Congress which \n     shall include--\n       (1) the Environmental Protection Agency's most up-to-date \n     understanding of the potential health and safety risks to \n     children playing on and around CCA-treated wood playground \n     equipment;\n       (2) the Environmental Protection Agency's current \n     recommendations to State and local governments about the \n     continued use of CCA-treated wood playground equipment; and\n       (3) an assessment of whether consumers considering \n     purchases of CCA-treated wood playground equipment are \n     adequately informed concerning the health effects associated \n     with arsenic.\n       Sec. 430. Experimental Program To Stimulate Competitive \n     Research. From amounts available to the National Science \n     Foundation under this Act, a total of $115,000,000 may be \n     available to carry out the Experimental Program to Stimulate \n     Competitive Research (EPSCoR), which includes $25,000,000 in \n     co-funding.\n       Sec. 431. Sense of the Senate Concerning the State Water \n     Pollution Control Revolving Fund. (a) Findings.--Congress \n     finds that--\n       (1) funds from the drinking water State revolving fund \n     established under section 1452 of the Safe Drinking Water Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300j-12) are allocated on the basis of an \n     infrastructure needs survey conducted by the Administrator of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency, in accordance with the \n     Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 (Public Law 104-\n     182);\n       (2) the needs-based allocation of that fund was enacted by \n     Congress and is seen as a fair and reasonable basis for \n     allocation of funds under a revolving fund of this type;\n       (3) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency also conducts a wastewater infrastructure needs survey \n     that should serve as the basis for allocation of the State \n     water pollution control revolving fund established under \n     title VI of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1381 et seq.);\n       (4) the current allocation formula for the State water \n     pollution control revolving fund is so inequitable that it \n     results in some States receiving funding in an amount up to 7 \n     times as much as States with approximately similar \n     populations, in terms of percentage of need met; and\n       (5) the Senate has proven unwilling to address that \n     inequity in an appropriations bill, citing the necessity of \n     addressing new allocation formulas only in authorization \n     bills.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the \n     Senate should be prepared to enact authorizing legislation \n     (including an equitable, needs-based formula) for the State \n     water pollution control revolving fund as soon as practicable \n     after the Senate returns from recess in September.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2002''.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8993-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                              NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the presence of the distinguished \nRepublican leader, I want to announce that since July 9 the Senate will \nhave been able to confirm 168 civilian nominations. Today alone, we \nhave been able to do 58. This week we did 88. This does not take into \nconsideration the scores and scores of military nominations that have \nbeen confirmed by the Senate.\n  I think this speaks well of some of the progress we are making. We \nappreciate the cooperation of the Republican leader in allowing us to \nmove through some of this legislation. It has been very difficult the \nlast few days, but with his help we have been able to accomplish a \ngreat deal. I am glad it is Friday afternoon at 3:40 and we are getting \nready to close the Senate rather than trying to figure out who we can \nget to preside all night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again that I appreciate the \nnumber of nominees that have been confirmed. I think that will help our \noverall relationship. A lot of these civilian nominees to head agencies \nand Assistant Secretary positions clearly need to be moved through. So \nI am glad to see it is happening. I hope we can continue this pattern \nwhen we return in September. And I hope we will begin then to make \nsteady progress on the confirmation of judicial nominees both for the \ncircuit courts as well as the district courts, and also, as soon as \nthey are received, begin to move U.S. attorneys and U.S. marshals in \ndistricts throughout the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S8993-2", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 4\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Res. 62\n\n       Whereas August 24, 2001, marks the tenth anniversary of the \n     restoration of independence in Ukraine;\n       Whereas the United States, having recognized Ukraine as an \n     independent state on December 25, 1991, and having \n     established diplomatic relations with Ukraine on January 2, \n     1992, recognizes that fulfillment of the vision of a Europe \n     whole, free, and secure requires a strong, stable, democratic \n     Ukraine fully\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\n     integrated in the Euro-Atlantic community of democracies;\n       Whereas, during the fifth anniversary commemorating \n     Ukraine's independence, the United States established a \n     strategic partnership with Ukraine to promote the national \n     security interests of the United States in a free, sovereign, \n     and independent Ukrainian state;\n       Whereas Ukraine is an important European nation, having the \n     second largest territory and sixth largest population in \n     Europe;\n       Whereas Ukraine is a member of international organizations \n     such as the Council of Europe and the Organization on \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), as well as \n     international financial institutions such as the \n     International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the \n     European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD);\n       Whereas in July 1994, Ukraine's presidential elections \n     marked the first peaceful and democratic transfer of \n     executive power among the independent states of the former \n     Soviet Union;\n       Whereas five years ago, on June 28, 1996, Ukraine's \n     parliament voted to adopt a Ukrainian Constitution, which \n     upholds the values of freedom and democracy, ensures a \n     citizen's right to own private property, and outlines the \n     basis for the rule of law in Ukraine without regard for race, \n     religion, creed, or ethnicity;\n       Whereas Ukraine has been a paragon of inter-ethnic \n     cooperation and harmony as evidenced by the OSCE's and the \n     United States State Department's annual human rights reports \n     and the international community's commendation for Ukraine's \n     peaceful handling of the Crimean secession disputes in 1994;\n       Whereas Ukraine, through the efforts of its government, has \n     reversed the downward trend in its economy, experiencing the \n     first real economic growth since its independence in fiscal \n     year 2000 and the first quarter of 2001;\n       Whereas Ukraine furthered the privatization of its economy \n     through the privatization of agricultural land in 2001, when \n     the former collective farms were turned over to corporations, \n     private individuals, or cooperatives, thus creating an \n     environment that leads to greater economic independence and \n     prosperity;\n       Whereas Ukraine has taken major steps to stem world nuclear \n     proliferation by ratifying the START I Treaty on nuclear \n     disarmament and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \n     Nuclear Weapons, subsequently has turned over the last of its \n     Soviet-era nuclear warheads on June 1, 1996, and in 1998 \n     agreed not to assist Iran with the completion of a nuclear \n     power plant in Bushehr thought to be used for the possible \n     production of weapons of mass destruction;\n       Whereas Ukraine has found many methods to implement \n     military cooperation with its European neighbors, as well as \n     peacekeeping initiatives worldwide, as exhibited by Ukraine's \n     participation in the KFOR and IFOR missions in the former \n     Yugoslavia, and offering up its own forces to be part of the \n     greater United Nations border patrol missions in the Middle \n     East and the African continent;\n       Whereas Ukraine became a member of the North Atlantic \n     Cooperation Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance \n     (NATO), signed a NATO-Ukraine Charter at the Madrid Summit in \n     July 1997, and has been a participant in the Partnership for \n     Peace (PfP) program since 1994 with regular training \n     maneuvers at the Yavoriv military base in Ukraine and on \n     Ukraine's southern-most shores of the Black Sea;\n       Whereas on June 7, 2001, Ukraine signed a charter for the \n     GUUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, and Moldova) \n     alliance, in hopes of promoting regional interests, \n     increasing cooperation, and building economic stability; and\n       Whereas 15 years ago, the Soviet-induced nuclear tragedy of \n     Chornobyl gripped Ukrainian lands with insurmountable curies \n     of radiation which will affect generations of Ukraine's \n     inhabitants, and thus, now, Ukraine promotes safety for its \n     citizens and its neighboring countries, as well as concern \n     for the preservation of the environment by closing the last \n     Chornobyl nuclear reactor on December 15, 2000: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) as a leader of the democratic nations of the world, the \n     United States congratulates the people of Ukraine on their \n     tenth anniversary of independence and supports peace, \n     prosperity, and democracy in Ukraine;\n       (2) Ukraine has made significant progress in its political \n     reforms during the first ten years of its independence, as is \n     evident by the adoption of its Constitution five years ago;\n       (3) the territorial integrity, sovereignty, and \n     independence of Ukraine within its existing borders is an \n     important factor of peace and stability in Europe;\n       (4) the President, the Prime Minister, and Parliament of \n     Ukraine should continue to enact political reforms necessary \n     to ensure that the executive, legislative, and judicial \n     branches of the Government of Ukraine transparently represent \n     the interests of the Ukrainian people;\n       (5) the Government and President of Ukraine should promote \n     fundamental democratic principles of freedom of speech, \n     assembly, and a free press;\n       (6) the Government and President of Ukraine should actively \n     pursue in an open and transparent fashion investigations into \n     violence committed against journalists, including the murders \n     of Heorhiy Gongadze and Ihor Oleksandrov;\n       (7) the Government of Ukraine (including the President and \n     Parliament of Ukraine) should uphold international standards \n     and procedures of free and fair elections in preparation for \n     its upcoming parliamentary elections in March 2002;\n       (8) the Government of Ukraine (including the President and \n     Parliament of Ukraine) should continue to accelerate its \n     efforts to transform its economy into one founded upon free \n     market principles and governed by the rule of law;\n       (9) the United States supports all efforts to promote a \n     civil society in Ukraine that features a vibrant community of \n     nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and an active, \n     independent, and free press;\n       (10) the Government of Ukraine (including the President and \n     Parliament of Ukraine) should follow a westward-leaning \n     foreign policy whose priority is the integration of Ukraine \n     into Euro-Atlantic structures;\n       (11) the President of the United States should continue to \n     consider the interests and security of Ukraine in reviewing \n     or revising any European military and security arrangements, \n     understandings, or treaties; and\n       (12) the President of the United States should continue to \n     support and encourage Ukraine's role in NATO's Partnership \n     for Peace program and the deepening of Ukraine's relationship \n     with NATO.\n\n     SEC. 2.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) an important facet of the history of the United States \n     is the story of how the United States was populated;\n       (2) the migration, immigration, and settlement of the \n     population of the United States--\n       (A) is broadly termed the ``peopling of America''; and\n       (B) is characterized by--\n       (i) the movement of groups of people across external and \n     internal boundaries of the United States and territories of \n     the United States; and\n       (ii) the interactions of those groups with each other and \n     with other populations;\n       (3) each of those groups has made unique, important \n     contributions to American history, culture, art, and life;\n       (4) the spiritual, intellectual, cultural, political, and \n     economic vitality of the United States is a result of the \n     pluralism and diversity of the American population;\n       (5) the success of the United States in embracing and \n     accommodating diversity has strengthened the national fabric \n     and unified the United States in its values, institutions, \n     experiences, goals, and accomplishments;\n       (6)(A) the National Park Service's official thematic \n     framework, revised in 1996, responds to the requirement of \n     section 1209 of the Civil War Sites Study Act of 1990 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1a-5 note; title XII of Public Law 101-628), that \n     ``the Secretary shall ensure that the full diversity of \n     American history and prehistory are represented'' in the \n     identification and interpretation of historic properties by \n     the National Park Service; and\n       (B) the thematic framework recognizes that ``people are the \n     primary agents of change'' and establishes the theme of human \n     population movement and change--or ``peopling places''--as a \n     primary thematic category for interpretation and \n     preservation; and\n       (7) although there are approximately 70,000 listings on the \n     National Register of Historic Places, sites associated with \n     the exploration and settlement of the United States by a \n     broad range of cultures are not well represented.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to foster a much-needed understanding of the diversity \n     and contribution of the breadth of groups who have peopled \n     the United States; and\n       (2) to strengthen the ability of the National Park Service \n     to include groups and events otherwise not recognized in the \n     peopling of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (2) Theme study.--The term ``theme study'' means the \n     national historic landmark theme study required under section \n     4.\n       (3) Peopling of america.--The term ``peopling of America'' \n     means the migration, immigration, and settlement of the \n     population of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 93) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I applaud my colleagues for \npassing the Federal Firefighters Retirement Age Fairness Act. This \nlegislation raises the mandatory retirement age for Federal \nfirefighters from 55 to 57.\n  Federal firefighters are first on the scene to many types of \ndisasters in addition to fires. They respond to hazardous materials \nthreats and terrorist incidents such as the bombing of the World Trade \nCenter in 1993.\n  Due to an oversight, however, Federal firefighters are currently the \nonly Federal law enforcement employees required to retire at 55 years.\n  Because many Federal firefighters wish to continue providing their \nservices to the American people after the age of 55, they are \nfrequently hired back by the Federal Government as ``consultants.'' \nPrivate consultants charge a higher fee than Federal firefighters' \nsalaries. As a result, the Federal Government pays more money for the \nsame individuals' services, simply because they are over the age of 55.\n  This bill does not change the minimum age to retire with full \nbenefits. If an individual wishes to retire at 55, he or she may do so \nwithout penalty. The legislation gives firefighters the option of \nworking until the age of 57 if they wish.\n  The bill enjoys broad bipartisan support and the endorsement of key \nlabor\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\norganizations such as the American Federation of Government Employees, \nthe National Association of Government Employees, and the International \nAssociation of Fire Chiefs.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this legislation will \nsave taxpayers more than $4 million over the next four years. Federal \nfirefighting capabilities are being sorely tested; we need to make it \npossible for agencies to retain experienced, qualified firefighters.\n  ``The Federal Firefighters Retirement Age Fairness Act'' was the \nfirst bill the House of Representatives passed unanimously this year. I \nam pleased my colleagues here in the Senate chose to support this \nimportant legislation, as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S9002-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9002-S9004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMISSION ON THE BICENTENNIAL OF THE LOUISIANA PURCHASE\n\n  Mr. REID.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Louisiana Purchase \n     Bicentennial Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, today I rise to urge passage of the \nLouisiana Purchase Bicentennial Commission Act. This legislation \ncreates a commission to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the \nLouisiana Purchase. I am honored to have sponsored this legislation \nwith Senators Breaux, Lincoln, Hutchinson, Domenici, Baucus, and Hatch. \nThe passage of this legislation voices appropriate celebration on the \nvalue of the United States' peaceful expansion westward.\n  The Louisiana Purchase cost the United States $15 million but it \ndoubled the size of the country overnight and brought vast natural \nresources that had been as yet untapped. To quote Tallyrand, ``You have \nmade a noble bargain for yourselves and I suppose you will make the \nmost of it.'' For the United States, it was only the beginning of an \nexpansion that would stretch from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific \nOcean.\n  All or part of 15 States were created from the land acquired in this \npurchase. It made possible the travels of Lewis and Clark, whose \ninvaluable insight into the peoples and land beyond the Mississippi \nRiver emboldened many Americans to search for a new life out West. \nAround the world, the American Frontier became synonymous with the \nsearch for spiritual, economic, and political freedom. The Louisiana \nPurchase helped shape the American destiny. Commemoration of the \nLouisiana Purchase and the related opening of the West can enhance \npublic understanding of the impact of the democratic westward expansion \non American society.\n  This bill creates a Commission that will edify, publish, and display \nthe importance of the Louisiana Purchase to all Americans. This \nbipartisan commission is partially modeled after the celebration of the \nAmerican Bicentennial--striving to be inclusive of Americans. The \ncommission will include important officials from each state created \nfrom the Purchase, museum and education officials, as well as members \nof Native American Tribes originating on the lands included in the \nPurchase. These officials will work together to recommend, organize, \nand oversee the 200th anniversary of the Louisiana Purchase. Commission \ntasks include planning the issuance of coins, stamps, medals, and \ncertificates of recognition. Under a coordinated effort with libraries, \nmuseums, and historical sites, they will develop education programs for \nexhibit and display. The commission will produce and publish \neducational materials focusing on the history and the impact of the \nLouisiana Purchase. This is certainly not an exhaustive list, the \ncommission will be tasked with many efforts. but, it is an insight into \nthe important role that the commission will fulfill.\n  I thank the Judiciary Committee in their preparation and passage of \nthis bill. Together, the chairman and the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee were incredibly supportive. This was truly a \nbipartisan effort. I thank my colleagues for recognizing the great \nvalue of honoring this momentous occasion, and together, as Americans, \nwe can celebrate the breadth and distance of our Nation's vision.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no \nintervening action, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the several requests \nare agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 356), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/08/03/senate-section/article/S9004-1", "month": "08", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9004-S9005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ESTABLISHING A COMMISSION FOR COMMEMORATION OF 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF \n         SUPREME COURT DECISION IN BROWN V.

Mr. President, today I rise in support of S. 1046, the \nBrown v. Board of Education 50th Anniversary Commission bill, which \nSenator Brownback and I introduced. 2004 marks the 50th anniversary of \nthis landmark Supreme Court decision which found the doctrine of \n``separate but equal'' to be patently unconstitutional. In 2004, it \nwill have been half a century since Oliver Brown of Topeka, Kansas, on \nbehalf of his daughter, Linda, fought the menace of racism and won. \nThis watershed case is an important victory in the civil rights \nmovement, and this Congressional Commission will allow us to fully \ncelebrate and reflect on what this decision has meant to our nation.\n  On May 17, 1954, in the Brown v. the Board of Education decision, the \nhigh court issued a definitive interpretation of the 14th Amendment to \nthe United States Constitution. The Court stated that the \ndiscriminatory nature of racial segregation ``. . . violates the 14th \nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees all citizens equal \nprotection of the laws.'' This case brought relief not only to the \nfamilies from four states and the District of Columbia who were \ncombined under the Brown case, but to individuals throughout our \ncountry as it marked a turning point in our Nation's history.\n  This bill, S. 1046, allows for the establishment of a Congressional \nCommission to celebrate this historical occasion, by developing public \neducation initiatives and coordinating observances in conjunction with \nthe Brown Foundation for Educational Equality, Excellence and Research \nin Topeka. The Brown Foundation is concurrently working with the \nNational Park Service in order to convert Linda Brown's former all-\nblack elementary school into a historic site in time for the 50th \nanniversary.\n  I'd like to thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Hatch for their \nexpeditious consideration of this important legislation. I'd also like \nto thank the Kansas Congressional Delegation for all their work on this \nissue as well. Finally, I'd like to thank Cheryl Brown Henderson, \nLinda's sister, who is the Executive Director of the Brown Foundation. \nHer untiring work has furthered the legacy of the Brown decision and \nallowed the vision of a Congressional Commission to become closer to a \nreality.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to my \nSenate colleagues for passing S. 1046, a bill that creates a commission \nto commemorate the 40th anniversary of Brown v. Board. I would \nespecially like to thank Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas who introduced \nthis bill into the Senate and Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont for his \nleadership in helping me to move this legislation through his \ncommittee.\n  I thank Cheryl Brown Henderson of the Brown Foundation, whose father, \nOliver Brown brought the suit against the Topeka Board of Education on \nbehalf of his daughter, Linda Brown. Cheryl has been a steadfast leader \nin ensuring that the Brown decision and legacy continues not only in \nthe State of Kansas but throughout the nation, and she has been very \ninstrumental in creating this legislation that was passed in the Senate \ntoday.\n  I stand before the Senate today proud that Kansas has played an \nintricate role in shaping our Nation. From ``Bleeding Kansas'' to the \n``Exodus to Kansas'' to Brown v. Board, Kansas has been one State in \nthis nation that has led our country in addressing race relations in \nthis country. And I am very proud of that history and legacy.\n  As you know, the history of desegregating our public school system \nstarted before Brown v. Board with such cases as Murray v. Maryland and \nSweatt v. Painter. But it was Brown v. Board that set the fire of the \npublic outrage and changed the course of America's history and the way \nin which we view equality in the eyes of the law.\n  Before Brown, many States in the United States enforced racially \nsegregated laws--this was an atrocious practice. Many individuals \nclaimed that as a direct result of the 1896 Plessy v. Ferguson case, \nwhich sanctioned the separate but equal doctrine, school segregation \nwas, in fact, legal and culturally acceptable. Oliver Brown, a citizen \nof Topeka, Kansas joined with other individuals and filed a lawsuit \nagainst the Topeka School Board on behalf of his 7-year-old daughter, \nLinda.\n  Like other young African Americans, Linda had to cross a set of \nrailroad tracks and board a bus to take her to the ``colored'' school \non the other side of the city where she lived--even though a school for \nwhite children was located only a few blocks from her home. This was \nthe basis for the landmark case. There were many notable African \nAmericans who helped to bring this case to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, however, none so famous as Supreme Court Justice \nThurgood Marshall who valiantly defended the rights of not only Linda \nBrown, but of an entire race of individuals who were treated as second-\nclass citizens.\n  On May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court rendered its decision that ruled \nracial segregation in schools in unconstitutional, violating the 14th \nAmendment of the United States Constitution, which states among other \nthings that, ``no state shall make or enforce any law which shall \nabridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United \nStates.''\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\n  When the Court ruled in 1954 that school segregation laws were \nunconstitutional, the Supreme Court demolished the legal foundation on \nwhich racial segregation stood. The Court's opinion, written and \ndelivered by Chief Justice Earl Warren, also served as a stirring moral \nindictment of racial segregation, and an eloquent challenge to America \nto cast off its prejudices and extend its promises of life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness to all citizens, regardless of race or \ncolor.\n  This Commission will comprise individuals representing the states \nthat were involved in the Brown case originally filed, Delaware, \nKansas, South Carolina, and Virginia, and from the first legal \nchallenge, Massachusetts. The Commission will be charged with planning \nand coordinating public education activities and initiatives, including \npublic lectures, writing contests, and public awareness campaigns \nthroughout the nation.\n  In addition, the Commission will work with the Brown Foundation for \nEducational Equity, Excellence and Research (located in Topeka, Kansas) \nto plan, develop and coordinate observances of the anniversary of the \nBrown decision. And finally, the Commission will submit recommendations \nto the United States Congress relating to a joint session of Congress \nto commemorate the Brown v. Board anniversary.\n  I am proud that we were able to pass this legislation today that will \nhonor this historic case--one that set the pace for racial equality in \nthe 20th century, and caused a nation to rethink the meaning of racial \nequality and tolerance for the betterment of our country.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nseveral requests are agreed to en bloc.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1046), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                                S. 1046\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
