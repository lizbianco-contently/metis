I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur at 10:05 a.m. \nso as to provide for 30 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the time of the proponents of \nthe amendment be equally divided between Senator Schumer and Senator \nWyden.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Who yields time? If neither side yields time, time will be charged \nagainst both sides.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  This is a very important amendment. We have done a great deal in this \nbill to make it easier for people to vote and at the same time prevent \nvoter fraud.\n  I very much thank our colleague from Missouri for leading the charge \non voting fraud. There are lots of provisions in this bill that we have \nworked on that deal with that. However, in our efforts to prevent voter \nfraud, we cannot go so far that we actually create barriers to the \npolls for eligible voters. That would be the antithesis of what this \nbill is about.\n  The intent of this legislation is to take people, particularly those \nwho live in the corners of America who do not fly airplanes and use \ntheir credit cards all the time but rather people who may not have a \ndriver's license, who may not have a utility bill, and allow them to \nvote, our most sacred right. This amendment does that. It does it in a \nway that does not increase fraud at all. It does it in a way that rises \nto the real purpose of this bill. It is a crucial amendment.\n  If one believes in extending the right to vote and believes we have \nto allow people who need that right because that is all they have--\nperhaps their vote is equal to ours but they may need it even more than \nours--then he or she should vote for the Schumer-Wyden amendment. I \nwill have a little more to say later.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am glad we can begin this debate because \nthere is much to be said, but let me go to the heart of the matter. \nThis amendment simply guts the compromise, the key antifraud provision \nthat was carefully negotiated over 6 months as a part of the bipartisan \ncompromise. We asked for some protection against the widespread \npractice of loading up voter rolls with phony names and then voting \nthose names. It is something that every voter can comply with. It has \nbeen negotiated to make sure it did not have any unfavorable impact on \npeople we are trying to get to the polls.\n  After 6 months of negotiations, I feel like we are playing rope-a-\ndope. The Senator from Oregon gets up and says, why, this is a photo ID \nrequirement. Everybody knows a photo ID requirement is discriminatory.\n  Then the Senator from New York gets up and says these antifraud \nprovisions really do not prevent fraud absolutely either way.\n  I said we devised a compromise that recognized the concerns that \ntheir side had about making sure we did not impose any unreasonable \nrestrictions on voters who might not have a driver's license, for \nexample. That is why we said voters can use a bank statement, a \ngovernment check, utility bill, anything that has your name and address \non it, the first time you register.\n  No, it is not as strong as I would like, but that was part of the \ncompromise. No, it does not limit the identification that must be shown \nto a driver's license photo ID--which my colleagues on the other side \nand some of the groups that were supporting this compromise and are now \nagainst it are saying would be unfair. So we compromised. And now the \npeople who worked on the compromise say the compromise is not a good \none.\n  I have seen that game before. But the people of America are tired of \nhaving their votes diluted because someone in a drop house registers 8, \n10 people. Yes, we have had dogs registered. We have had dead aldermen \nregistered, mothers of dead aldermen registered, and dead neighbors \nregistered. Under the current Federal motor-voter registration law it \nis very difficult to stop the mail-in registration fraud.\n  We talked yesterday about 3,000 ballots being dropped off before the \nmayoral primary in St. Louis in 2001. Because of the attention we have \nbrought to this problem, they were reviewed. It was found that most of \nthose 3,000 were in the same handwriting and were for new registrants \non one or two city blocks. St. Louis did not have time to check \nthoroughly before the November 2000 election. There was a registration \nof 200,000 people, with 30,000 post card registrations that were \ndropped off in the final days, a more than 15 percent increase. Nobody \nchecked these, but initial suggestions are at least 15,000, half of \nthem, were phony.\n  One can conjure up all kinds of scenarios where maybe one person will \nnot have the kind of ID needed to vote under the provisions in the \nunderlying bill. We allow provisional voting; 39 States already provide \nit. We will take care of those people. One thing we have seen for \nsure--not just in Missouri, but across the country--is fraudulent \nvotes, by nonexistent people. They are diluting the votes of legitimate \nvoters.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there is a reason the American Association \nof Retired Persons so strongly supports this amendment. They and the \nsponsors feel strongly that the photo ID provision in effect is making \nit tougher for those who saved our democracy in World War II to \nparticipate in our democracy today.\n  Nursing home residents in this country are not asking to be taken to \na copy center. The Senate should not be telling them they should have \nto go to the copy center before they can vote by mail, which is clearly \none of the most popular ways to participate in our democracy today.\n  I am particularly troubled that the tough provisions to deter fraud \ndo not even kick in until 2004. I would like to work with colleagues to \naddress those issues. It seems to me various approaches that encourage \nvoting are not kicking in for quite some time.\n  Last night, the Senate voted wisely to call this the Martin Luther \nKing Voting Rights bill. If we put in place a photo ID for first time \nvoters, we step back, in my view, to the days when only the \nenfranchised had the opportunity to vote. That would be a mistake. I \nurge strongly this amendment be supported.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one of the pitiful results of motor \nvoter registration systems in America is that we have countless dogs \nregistered to vote. That is why Senator Bond's provision makes so much \nsense. There are countless examples of dead people voting, dogs voting, \nand people voting multiple times. Nearly all these instances of voter \nfraud have one thing in common: They were perpetrated through lax mail-\nin registration requirements.\n  Many of our colleagues were obviously not around last night when we \ndebated this amendment. Let me take a moment to show a copy of a \nphotograph that appeared in the Washington Post last summer, which I \ndiscussed last night. This is Mable Briscoe, 82, and Holly Briscoe, her \nterrier, both long-time registered voters in America. Both Mable and \nHolly have been registered to vote for quite some time in Maryland. \nThis is a photo of the long-time registered voters--as I said, Mable \nand her terrier, Holly. According to the article accompanying this \nphotograph, Mable says she registered her dog to prove a point about \nthe lax registration process that opens the door to fraud. Mable's \ncrime was finally detected when her dog, Holly, was called for jury \nduty. Holly got called for jury duty and then the game was up. Perhaps \nMable Briscoe said it best when she said: I just think the system is \nbroke and needs some fixing. Anybody can register. I can register a \ndog.\n  The system is broken. It invites fraud. Senator Bond's modest \nantifraud measure will do a great deal to help make voter fraud more \ndifficult. As he said, he wanted to go further. This underlying \nprovision that the Schumer amendment seeks to strike is quite modest. \nThe amendment of the Senator\n\n[[Page S1225]]\n\nfrom New York amounts to a fraud loophole. It actually undoes what \nSenator Bond and all five of the original cosponsors worked so hard to \nachieve, the underlying compromise. If this amendment is agreed to, it \nis completely stripped out.\n\n  This amendment needs to be tabled if we are serious about this \nlegislation. We will have that vote shortly.\n  How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I retain the balance.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon has 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I yield 3 minutes to our distinguished colleague from \nWashington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nSchumer-Wyden amendment because I believe it is a critical issue that \nwe must solve before we can pass this bill. Millions of people in my \nState, and I think across America, will be done a great disservice by \nmaking voting harder. If we do not pass this amendment, the bill as \ncurrently written forces States to rely on a photo identification as a \nmeans of making sure that first-time voters are who they say they are. \nWhile I believe we need to be vigilant about preventing fraud in our \nelections, the provision as currently written goes too far in mandating \na particular response and has the real potential to result in fewer \nlegitimate voters having their votes counted.\n  This bill requires voters who registered by mail to show a photo \nidentification or utility bill when they go to the polls for the first \ntime. This will create a disincentive for seniors, disabled, and those \nwho have a tough time getting that information.\n  In our State, 64 percent of the voters in the most recent election \nvoted by absentee ballot or mail-in ballot. Requiring a photo \nidentification or utility bill to be enclosed with their ballots is an \nincredible burden in order to prove they are who they say they are. In \nfact, in those cases where those copies were not provided, their votes \nwould not be counted.\n  It is very important we look at the underlying system. The underlying \nsystem, based on signature verification, makes sure that people who are \nattesting under the penalty of perjury are who they say they are and \nthat they are properly registered to vote in that jurisdiction. When \nthe ballot is received, the signature is carefully checked against the \nregistration rolls to make sure they are a match. Only then is the \nballot counted.\n  Unlike the signature, the election official receiving the photocopy \nhas nothing to compare it against, and it is of no use in verifying the \nauthenticity of the vote.\n  Although the photocopy has little use to officials, if it is not \nincluded, as I said, it disqualifies the ballot. That is correct--if \nthe voter fails to include a photocopy that is of no use to the \nelection official, the vote will still not be counted even though the \nsignature on the ballot matches the signature in the registration \nrolls. This is simply unacceptable.\n  This amendment fixes this problem by allowing states the option of \nrelying on other methods to make certain that votes are valid, \nincluding signature verification which is currently used in my state \nand other states.\n  While I am very concerned about passing this amendment to fix the \nproblems that photo ID requirements create for voters who vote by mail, \nI am also concerned that the requirements will lead to serious problems \nfor voters who go to the polls. The Secretary of State and other \nelection officials in my State are concerned that the requirements \nplace a huge burden on volunteer poll workers in the polling place, and \na Federal court has already ruled that this type of photo ID \nrequirement may present a disparate impact on minorities seeking to \nhave their votes counted. The right to vote is the most important right \nthat we have as citizens, and it is important that we do everything \nthat we can to make certain States can strike the proper balance \nbetween facilitating voting and preventing fraud. This amendment helps \nto do that.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment and I believe \nthat passage of this amendment is essential to making certain that our \nelectoral system is improved by this legislation.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have just heard some inaccurate \nstatements about the underlying amendment. Nobody says you have to go \nto a copy center. Any antifraud provisions do not hold off in this bill \nuntil 2004. They are effective upon the signing of the bill. The \nprovisional voting provision in this bill that says it will not take \neffect until 2004 was not something I wrote. I will be happy to take an \namendment to say it is effective right away as well, because 39 States \nhave provisional voting and we need to clean it up so it works for all \n50 States.\n  It is important to note that, believe it or not, the current system \noffers few protections to States that want to maintain clean rolls. The \nSenator from Oregon said we need to make sure registrations are \naccurate at the beginning. Believe it or not, motor voter actually \nprohibits States from requiring verification of the cards. Registration \nby mail makes it much easier to put fake names on voter lists and then \nvoting by mail makes it very easy to vote these names illegally.\n  The opponents of my anti-fraud provision claim the bill will \ndisenfranchise millions. At the same time, several States, including \nWest Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, Michigan, Illinois, Nevada, and \nLouisiana, have tougher standards--tougher than in this bill. I would \nlike to see them as tough as these States'. No one has come forward and \nshown that these States actually deprive voters of the right to vote on \nany level, much less on the level claimed here.\n  Furthermore, the way the amendment is drafted, the steps taken by \nthese States to protect themselves from fraud will be undercut. We will \nbe here, making it easier to cheat. This amendment makes it easier to \ncheat, not just easier to vote.\n  There are those who said recently that this will create an \nadministrative problem. Nonsense. The States I just named already keep \ntrack of first-time voters. The State of Michigan has offered to \nprovide its software to do this for free to any State that has a \nproblem. If free is not cheap enough, we provide funds in this bill to \nbuy the systems you want, to track the voters. This will not threaten \nmail-in States. It will actually make it better for them.\n  As I pointed out last night, when we hear about Oregon, the great \nState that has no problem with mail-in registration and balloting, \nPortland State Professor Melody Rose studied the Oregon system and \ndetermined that 5 percent of voters had someone else mark their ballot, \n2.5 percent had someone else sign their ballot, 4 percent had someone \nelse either sign or mark their ballot. In States with 1.6 million cast, \nclose to 200,000 of them could have had some sort of irregularity.\n  Carter-Ford noted that signature verification does not work. This is \nthe National Commission on Federal Election Reform, page 31:\n\n       Signature verification puts an extra burden upon \n     administrators, especially on often ill-trained poll workers \n     practicing a very subjective, often impossible task.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I rest my case. Signature verification does not work. I \nurge people to support the motion I will offer.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. At the beginning of the debate we worked with the \nSenators from Oregon and Washington to fix a provision their State \nelection officials thought threatened their system of voting. That has \nalready been accomplished. Obviously this provision threatens only one \nthing the way it is now, fraud. It could mean increased work for those \nwho administer elections, but that is a very small price to pay for \nfair and honest elections. Make no mistake about it, this amendment is \nthe poison pill of election reform.\n  The bill is a carefully crafted compromise agreed to by all 5 \ncosponsors, including the Senator from New York. There has been a lot \nof misinformation about this anti-fraud provision. It applies only to a \nsmall number of voters\n\n[[Page S1226]]\n\nwho register by mail and vote for the first time. As Senator Bond made \nclear, this is the prime area of voter fraud.\n  When we negotiated this compromise in December, none of us thought \nthat it was too much to ask that voters be real, live people.\n  Senator Bond had a bill that would have required first-time mail \nregistrants to vote in person and show a photo ID. He agreed to \ncompromise on that requirement, to reach the agreement we have before \nus today. Mail registrants who vote for the first time now have many \noptions to identify themselves. Photo ID is only one of them. A current \nutility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck or any other \ngovernment document would serve the purpose. This very broad universe \nof identification was advanced and advocated by Senator Schumer and was \neven suggested by advocacy groups who now claim it must be changed.\n  The same groups who originally suggested it now want to change it. \nThe very language of this amendment was also suggested by the advocacy \ngroups, notably in a November 6 document sent to ``interested \nparties.'' We spent well over a month discussing and debating the very \nlanguage of this amendment. We agreed on the language in our compromise \nbill instead.\n  The bill language does not require every voter to show \nidentification, be they rich, poor, disabled, young, or elderly. Let me \ntell you what the amendment of the Senator from New York would do.\n  First, not only does it not improve the current system, it could \nactually make it worse in many States. It creates new and improved \nopportunities for fraud in States with more restrictive requirements. \nSecond, this could become the most expensive mandate in this bill. Not \nonly will States have to buy new machines and data bases under this \nbill, but the 34 States that do not have signature verification will \nhave to buy technology to verify signature and marks.\n  Third and most important, all of the 1.4 million poll workers \nnationwide will have to become handwriting and personal mark experts. \nWhat a great idea. All of the 1.4 million poll workers nationwide will \nhave to become handwriting and personal mark experts. The shortage of \npoll workers is already a major problem, as reported by GAO. Now they \nwill have to be handwriting experts.\n  Finally, the poison pill amendment has already been discussed, \ndebated, and dismissed by the cosponsors of this bill. I urge the other \n95 Members of this body to support our joint resolution on the issue \nand vote against this amendment or vote to table it. Senator Bond will \nmake the tabling motion when all time has been yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the opposition has expired. Who \nyields time?\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Chair of the \ncommittee, Senator Dodd.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me thank Members here who have argued \nboth in favor and in opposition to this amendment. It has been a very \nworthwhile debate. Unfortunately, as my colleague from Kentucky pointed \nout, we didn't have enough Members around last night to hear the full \ndebate, but it was very worthwhile. I repeat what I said a week or so \nago. This is one of those issues that has come down and is a clear, \nalmost equal division, I think, in the Chamber about what ought to be \ndone about this particular issue.\n  I had hoped we would find some compromise to it. That is what you do \nin the legislative process. We did this on 35 amendments that have come \nalong here. I didn't like voting against Dick Durbin's amendment. I \nhappen to agree with it. I did not like having to accept amendments \nfrom my friend from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and other amendments \nthat we worked on to make this process reach the point it has today.\n  I am still hopeful. I don't know how this vote will come out. But my \nplea would be, to those on either side of this question, to see if we \ncan't find some common ground. That is not going to happen, obviously, \nin the next 5 minutes. So this vote will go forward. Then my hope is \nthat we can find some resolution here that will satisfy the concerns \nthat are raised--legitimately, in my view--by the proponents of the \namendment and the concerns raised by my friend from Missouri who has \nraised from the very beginning his concerns about this.\n  My desire has been to try to find some common ground and compromise \non this proposal. That has not happened yet, but I am prepared to try \nto work that out when the time arrives.\n  With that, I thank the Members for their time in debate. We still \nhave a few minutes left for the proponents of the amendment to make \nsome closing arguments, and then we will get to the vote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to explain my vote in favor of \ntabling the Senator Schumer/Wyden amendment to S. 565, election reform \nlegislation pending before the Senate.\n  For United States citizens, voting is a fundamental right guaranteed \nby the United States Constitution. In no way am I attempting to deny \nthat right by not supporting the Schumer/Wyden amendment. In fact, I \nbelieve that strong anti-fraud language strengthens the right to vote, \nand the integrity of the election system in our nation.\n  The Schumer/Wyden amendment would dissolve the carefully crafted \nbipartisan framework in this legislation--designed to ensure proper \nvoter identification methods exist to protect the validity of national \nelections. This framework allows for a person to use a current and \nvalid photo identification to validate their registration and vote. \nThose individuals who lack these forms of identification could also \npresent a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, government \ncheck, or other government document that shows the name and address of \nthe voter.\n  The Schumer/Wyden amendment would have gutted these protections by \nallowing individuals to simply use a signature or a personal mark.\n  It is important to note that if an individual fails to meet the \nrequired identification methods on election day they can still cast a \nballot. Provisional balloting protects an individuals' constitutional \nright to cast a ballot in an election. The validity of provision \nballots is determined later, thus ensuring that no eligible voter is \nturned away.\n  My fellow colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, recently spoke on \nthe floor of the Senate about some of the most egregious examples of \nvoter fraud in his home State. Senator Bond explained how the drop \nhouse and other scams have been used in St. Louis to register dead \nneighbors, deceased aldermen, ghosts, and dogs. Drop house scams occur \nwhen one person submits multiple mail-in registration forms using one \naddress. Then, as election day approaches, that one person requests \nabsentee ballots for each of his phantom voters, and then votes them \nall.\n  There are a number of other examples of voter fraud as well: Over \n30,000 illegitimate voters were added to voter registrations in the \n2000 presidential election in St. Louis, MO. Over 5,000 illegal ballots \nwere cast in the 2000 presidential election in Florida by individuals \nwho were not U.S. citizens and not permitted to vote. One individual in \nMissouri actually voted 47 times--and was not even prosecuted!\n  In fact, voter fraud can be easily traced back over a hundred and \nfifty years before the 2000 presidential election. In 1844, New York \nCity had 41,000 people in their voter pool. However, on election day, \n55,000 people cast ballots!\n  Clearly, voter fraud is not a new issue in elections. Congress passed \nThe National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (``Motor Voter'') allowing \nStates to require that individuals vote in person if they registered by \nmail and have never before voted in that jurisdiction.\n  The anti-fraud provisions of this legislation strengthen the \nprovisions from 1993. Under S. 565, any person who registers by mail \nmust, either when registering or voting in a Federal election, provide \nsome form of identification that connects the name on the registration \nform to a real, live, qualified citizen of voting age. The requirement \nis not onerous.\n  In the 2000 presidential election our country contained wide-spread \nvoter fraud and abuses by individuals who were clearly casting \nillegitimate ballots. This legislation works to prevent such fraud and \nrestore confidence in the election process. I will continue to work \ntowards strengthening voter\n\n[[Page S1227]]\n\nrights, but not the ability of individuals to cheat or manipulate the \nsystem.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Schumer-Wyden amendment to the election reform bill.\n  This important amendment would fix what I believe is a very \nproblematic provision in the bill. That provision requires first-time \nvoters who registered by mail to provide either a photo identification \nor a current utility bill, bank statement, government check, or other \ngovernment document establishing their identity.\n  I commend the sponsors of the bill for their focus on ensuring strong \nanti-fraud protection; but I believe this provision goes too far and \ncould end up disenfranchising significant numbers of voters. In \nparticular, the elderly, students, low-income voters, minorities, and \nthe disabled are examples of people who could have a difficult time \nmeeting the requirements of the Election Reform bill, as written.\n  In addition, the bill would impose a significant burden on many \nStates, including my own, that currently allow the use of signature \nverification and attestation to verify identity. If the bill is not \namended, my State would have to do away with that procedure altogether.\n  For these reasons, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Schumer-Wyden \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  This important amendment would add two alternative verifiers for \nfirst time voters who vote in person: (1) it would allow voters to \nattest to who they are by signing a sworn statement, falsification of \nwhich is punishable as perjury; or (2) it would allow voters to have \ntheir signatures verified by matching them to signatures on record with \nState or local election officials. First time voters who vote by mail \nalso would be given an alternative to a photo ID or other government \ndocument--they would be allowed to use signature matching to establish \ntheir identity.\n  I believe this is a sensible and necessary measure. And I'm pleased \nto report that it enjoys the support of the nation's leading civil \nrights organizations, including: MALDEF, the NAACP, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, LULAC, AARP, the Leadership Conference on Civil \nRights, and the League of Women Voters.\n  The intent of the Election Reform bill is to ensure that every vote \ncounts, but if we do not act now by passing the Schumer-Wyden \namendment, I fear that many tens of thousands of voters will once again \nface significant barriers to voting the next time they go to the polls.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing today, vote yes on the \nSchumer-Wyden amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to express \nmy strong support for the amendment offered by Senators Schumer and \nWyden.\n  History has shown that requiring photo identification or certain \nother documents most significantly impacts minority voters. It will be \ndifficult for some citizens to meet such requirements. For instance, a \nrural voter may have difficulty even finding a copy machine to make a \ncopy of his or her driver's license. Individuals living below the \npoverty level may not have drivers licenses or utility bills. Students \nwho live at home with their parents also may not have a utility bill \nwith their name on it.\n  Ironically, the current language in the bill puts an added burden on \nsome of the very people that we should be working to make it easier to \nvote. This is contrary to the purpose behind this legislation. We are \nnot trying to lower voter participation with this Election Reform bill; \nwe are trying to raise it, and make the voting process better for the \nAmerican people. The photo ID requirement would without a doubt have a \nchilling effect on voter participation. And while the provisional \nvoting system would address this problem to some extent, it will not be \nin place in time for the 2002 elections. The language in this amendment \nis a much fairer way of dealing with this problem, and that is why I \nwant to express my full support for the efforts of Senators Schumer and \nWyden.\n  I want to take one more minute just to go over briefly a couple of \ninitiatives that I proposed for this bill; amendments that I will no \nlonger be offering, but I want to mention nonetheless. My first \namendment would establish election day as a Federal holiday. Currently, \nthis bill contains provisions for the new Election Administration \nCommission to study the possibility of designating Election Day as a \nFederal holiday. And just yesterday Senator Hollings added language to \nthe bill calling for a six-month turnaround on this study.\n  I commend Senator Hollings for his amendment, as well as Senators \nDodd and McConnell for specifying the EAC study in the original bill. I \nlook forward to seeing the results of the study later this year, and I \nhope Congress will act quickly on the recommendations of the report.\n  The second measure I proposed would change the Federal match in this \nbill to be fair to all states regardless of economic circumstances. \nThis is an issue in which I have had a long-standing interest. While \nCongress often passes bills that provide a Federal match for States in \nvarious programs, it is rare that any effort is made to level the \nplaying field for states that have fewer resources. States like \nLouisiana, with high poverty a generally lower standard of living, \nreceive the same matching rate as other States.\n  My concern is that in this bill, as well as others, the matching \nrates for these States are the same. Despite the huge difference in \nresources in these States, the Federal matching rate remains the same. \nTo me, this is unfair and counterproductive.\n  In closing, let me state again that I fully support the efforts of \nSenators Dodd and McConnell, as well as my other colleagues who have \nworked so hard on this bill, to bring about election reform. In fact, \nbecause this bill is so important I have decided not to offer this \namendment today on this legislation, but will continue to press this \nimportant issue in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. How is that divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four for the Senator from New York, two for \nthe Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in Oregon, the penalty for registering dogs \nthat have become so famous, the monetary penalty is something like ten \ntimes the amount in this bill. When fraud happens with the vote-by-mail \nsystem, it is caught and it is stopped. Our penalties prove it. Any way \nyou slice it, making it harder to vote isn't the way to deter fraud.\n  I come back in closing to why the American Association of Retired \nPersons and senior citizens groups feel so strongly about this \namendment. They like voting by mail. It is convenient for them. They \nand millions of Americans are saying make it easier to vote. Congress \nshould do everything possible to make it easier to vote rather than to \nmake it harder. I don't think this body this morning should make it \ntough for those who saved our democracy in World War II to participate \nin our democracy in the days ahead.\n  I urge my colleagues to strongly support the amendment, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as we come to the conclusion of this \ndebate, I ask why so many groups--the AARP, the AFL-CIO, American \nAssociation of People With Disabilities, the Mexican-American Legal \nDefense Fund, the NAACP, La Raza, the National Hispanic Leadership \nCouncil, as well as the secretaries of State of so many States--are not \nopposed to this provision if it is as terrible as the opponents say. I \nwill tell you why--because they know what this bill is all about.\n  Let us go over the history of this bill for a minute.\n  There was a national outcry after what occurred in Florida. We \nrealized that millions of people are deprived of their right to vote \nbecause of the way we vote. I say to my friend from Kentucky that the \noutcry after Florida was not because dogs were voting. That argument to \nuse the fact that one fraudulent person might have registered a dog, or \nmaybe five of them,\n\n[[Page S1228]]\n\ncould deprive millions of people of their right to vote is sophistic, \nat best. I don't like it. It is not fair.\n  What are we talking about? What happened in Florida and what moved us \nto debate this issue is that thousands of people in every city in this \ncountry who had the right to vote couldn't.\n  What the Schumer-Wyden amendment does is very simple. It says we are \nallowing you to vote. We are not going to make you do things that in \nyour world are next to impossible. If you think of every voter as any \nmiddle class person with a lot of credit cards in his pocket and a \ncouple of cars in the garage and several cell phones, sure, there is no \nproblem. But think of the new immigrant who waited five years and has \njust became a voter, who doesn't have a car, who is just learning \nEnglish, and who is afraid of the government where that immigrant came \nfrom. You say, You have to do this, this, this, and this. When you show \nup at the polling place, you may not be allowed to vote. Yes. It is the \nfirst-time voters.\n  I say to my colleagues: I have seen the look on the faces of first-\ntime voters who waited in line with their eyes bright with the first \nchance to exercise their franchise and then were turned away. And they \nnever come back again.\n  We do plenty in this bill about fraud, but the key in this bill is \nbalance because every time you make it easier for people to vote, you \nmay make it a little easier for a nasty person to commit fraud; if you \nwant to eliminate fraud totally, eliminate the right to vote.\n  That is not the argument. The argument is do we take people who are \nelderly, who are new immigrants, who are poor, who are members of \nminority groups, and say, Yes, we welcome you into the American family, \nwe welcome you into the franchise of voting.\n  If you go through the process that 40 States have used, we are not \ngoing to create signature experts. We have them. Every bank teller is a \nsignature expert. In my State, we have used signatures for years with \nno signs of fraud.\n  We are saying to them, We welcome you into the American family. We \nare not going to put 17 laws in the way before you vote. Your right to \nvote is a right. It is not an obstacle course, which is what this \namendment creates.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Schumer-Wyden amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 1 minute remaining \nbefore the conclusion of the debate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are out of time on this side. Is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Does the Senator from Kentucky desire time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No. We will make a motion to table when the time is \nused up.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment undoes a carefully crafted \ncompromise and opens wide the door to fraud. Therefore, I move to table \nthe amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this vote I have a pair with the Senator \nfrom Nevada, Mr. Ensign. If he were present and voting, he would vote \n``aye.'' If I were permitted to vote, I would vote ``nay.'' I therefore \nwithdraw my vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) and \nthe Senator from Nevada (Mr. Ensign) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 51, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 38 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--51\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n       PRESENT AND GIVING A LIVE PAIR, AS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED--1\n\n       \n     Reid, nay\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Ensign\n     Hatch\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the amendment is still pending before \nthe Senate. We would like to continue discussing that matter. I know \nthe Senator from Missouri is going to talk on the subject. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague speaks--and I will be 30 \nseconds on this--I had hoped, and I say this to my two friends on the \nother side with whom I have worked very closely to put this bill \ntogether, I had hoped we could find compromise language on this last \nprovision. That is still my hope. We have worked very hard. We have \nconsidered around 35 amendments. Both sides have added to the bill with \naccepted amendments. We have modified some; some have been withdrawn.\n  We are very close to final consideration of this bill. We still have \nto go to conference--the White House, obviously, will get involved--\nwith the House-passed bill. We will not have completed this process \nwhen we vote this bill out of the Senate.\n  My hope is we can find some way to work on this amendment while we \nare considering other amendments--the energy bill is waiting to be \nconsidered--rather than have this now splintered off. Too much effort \nhas been made to get us to this point.\n  It is my fervent plea to my friends on the minority side to try and \nwork on some resolution of this issue. That is what we ought to be \ndoing as legislators. That is my plea to my colleague from Missouri and \nmy colleague from Kentucky.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the vote was not a good sign. It was \nalmost totally a partisan vote on a bill we had been advancing on a \nbipartisan basis. We had long and difficult negotiations across party \nlines to achieve the core agreement that was represented by the bill \nthat was brought up by the majority leader.\n  The vote that was just taken, should that amendment ultimately be \nsuccessful, strips out one of the core principles of the bill.\n  So I am not terribly optimistic, I must say, about the future of this \nbill. Maybe something can be worked out, but this was certainly a \ndramatic step in the wrong direction.\n  I know the Senator from Missouri seeks recognition. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2940 to Amendment No. 2937\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second degree amendment \nto the Schumer amendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2940 to amendment No. 2937.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to see a copy of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S1229]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, if I can see a copy of the \namendment so I can know what we are talking about. Maybe my colleague \nwould like to explain what we are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will continue to read the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment, as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SIGNATURE VERIFICATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a State \n     may use a signature verification or affirmation program to \n     meet the requirements of section 103(b) relating to the \n     verification of the identity of individuals who register to \n     vote by mail only if the Attorney General certifies that less \n     than one-half of 1 percent of votes cast in the 2 most recent \n     elections for Federal office were cast by voters who were not \n     eligible to vote under the law of such State.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as I think the Senator from Kentucky \nindicated, we were very disappointed that after working 6 months to \nestablish a very modified, watered-down provision to help prevent \nfraud, the other side chose, without objection, on a party line vote, \nto refuse to table a motion to strike an amendment that really guts the \ncompromise.\n  When we began this debate, I said I thought every American understood \nthe importance of the vote. There are two aspects to that which are \ninvolved in this bill. One is making it easier to vote for those who \nmay have had difficulty in the past. We worked on those items and many \nof them went further than I and some of my colleagues would like.\n  Coming from Missouri where we have seen significant vote fraud, which \nwe believe may have affected close elections in our State, I said we \nneeded to change some of the provisions of the motor voter law which \npermits mail-in registration and prevents the States from verifying the \nbone fides of the registrant.\n  As a part of the compromise we reached over 6 months, we said one \ndoes not have to show up with a photo ID with their address on it the \nfirst time they vote after they have registered by mail; we will let \nthem bring in or send in either a photo ID or any of a number of \ndocuments which would tend to show that they are a real person, such as \na utility bill, a government check, a paycheck, bank statements.\n  That would be supplanted under this amendment, if unamended, to say \nyou can sign your name. We have seen the wholesale fraud that signing \none's name can bring in Missouri: Drop houses, 3,000 almost assuredly \nphony registrations before a mayoral primary in 2001 in St. Louis; \n30,000 last-minute mail-in registrations prior to the November 2000 \ngeneral election in St. Louis. The guess is at least 15,000 of them \nwere phony. That was followed by an effort by the Gore-Lieberman team \nin St. Louis and Kansas City to continue fraudulent voting by getting \ncourts to keep open the ballot boxes in both cities on the theory--and \nI have to say the laughable theory--that the Democratically-controlled \nelection boards in St. Louis City and Kansas City were conspiring to \nkeep the Democratic voters in Kansas City and St. Louis from casting \ntheir votes in a general election for the Democratic candidates. Now \nthat does not compute.\n  So we are saying, number one, we stopped the effort to keep the polls \nopen in the Missouri Court of Appeals, pointing out that it is just as \nmuch a denial of civil rights to have one's vote deluded by an illegal \nvote as it is to be denied the opportunity to cast a vote yourself.\n  This amendment I proposed is the starting point to continue and \nreopen the negotiations. As I said, it is important that we balance \nthis bill, make it easier to vote but make it tougher to cheat. This is \none minor suggestion I am offering to avoid wholesale fraud through \nsignature verification and affirmation. Frankly, I think we have seen \nenough to know that signature verification and affirmation does not \nwork.\n  I ask my colleagues from New York if they know how many of the New \nYork City voters, 14,000 of them who are registered in South Florida, \nvoted only in one place in the 2000 election? I think that is something \nwe need to find out.\n  There are real problems with the amendment that is now pending. I \nurge my colleagues to consider my second degree amendment favorably. We \nwill look forward to continuing negotiations but, frankly, unless and \nuntil this is resolved this bill is a significant step in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this is the first time we have seen this \nproposal, but certainly on its face it raises a number of very \ntroubling issues. To start with, it seems it goes after the wrong end. \nOur view has been if the question of vote fraud is really going to be \ntackled, we have to go after the registration kind of process. That is \nwhat we have sought to do.\n  Once again, this goes to the process of signature verification, which \nis basically trying to deal with the problem after it is all out of the \nbarn and off to the races.\n  I think what really troubles me is that this would make a presumption \nthat in scores of States, the State and local officials are not doing \ntheir jobs. They are essentially bad guys. They would have to go \nthrough a very cumbersome, almost incomprehensible process, to try to \nprove they are good guys.\n\n  In our State, it has empowered thousands and thousands of people, \nwithout instances of fraud. We are running a system that has not been a \nsieve of fraud and abuse. To say they are now going to create a \npresumption that people who are running effective, efficient vote-by-\nmail systems are essentially bad guys and they should have to go \nthrough a process from Washington, DC, to prove they are good guys does \nnot make a whole lot of sense to me. Hopefully, there will be further \ndiscussion how this will work, how you would even go about determining \nwho these so-called abusers are in the two most recent elections.\n  I have great reservations about what I have seen at this point. \nFirst, it seems to go at the wrong end of the process. We ought to be \ntrying to address voter fraud questions at the registration level \nrather than essentially so late in the process. Second, I am very \ntroubled by the presumption that seems to underlie this amendment that \nall these State and local people are bad guys, they are doing an \ninefficient job, they are not up to the task of challenging fraud, so \nwhat we ought to do is create a presumption, in effect, that they are \nthe problem and that somehow they ought to have this convoluted process \nto convince the Federal Government they are not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I inquire of my colleague from Kentucky, I \ndon't know know if we can resolve the amendment at this moment, but \nthere are other matters we might consider on the bill. I don't know if \nthere is the appetite to temporarily lay these aside to consider the \nother matters, knowing nothing gets resolved until this issue gets \nresolved. I Know there are colloquies, including Senator Thomas, and \nSenator Smith had an amendment we can try and work on.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think we need to resolve the current pending matter. \nIt goes to the heart of the bill. I know even if I didn't object to \nlaying aside the amendment to go on to other matters, others would \nobject. We need to stay on the amendment, the second-degree amendment \nand continue to discuss how we might unravel the knot which we find \nourselves.\n  There would be an objection to laying the amendment aside and going \non to other matters.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the authors, the direct opponents of the \namendment are not here. I will make the case again, as I tried a week \nor so ago. I see where we are headed with this. We need to try and find \na compromise. Obviously, people feel strongly about this. The debate \nwent on for some time. When Members feel strongly, no matter how you \ntry and resolve\n\n[[Page S1230]]\n\nit, sometimes you have to go through the vote process to have some \nclarity. Then a compromise can emerge. That is how this works from time \nto time. We have all been in that situation at one time or another.\n  Certainly, that is where we find ourselves in this case. I have great \nrespect for how Senator Bond feels. We all bring a very strong local \nexperience to this national debate. He had a very strong, in his view, \nlocal experience which provoked his interest in the matter. I respect \nthat.\n  I respect very much the point of view of others that feel there are \nways, particularly with statewide voter registration efforts, that we \ncan take major steps to reduce the dangers of fraud or the realities of \nfraud. The establishment of our Election Commission in this bill will \nallow on a continuing basis examining the election structures of the \ncountry, rather than waiting for a crisis to occur, so we can continue \nto address matters like this and others we have not considered in this \nbill.\n  I had hoped that might occur. I think it will. We can find a way to \nget together. There are only 6 or 7 other amendments that I know of to \nconsider on the bill. There could be more out there. We were down to \neither amendments that could be accepted or modified to some degree and \nbecome acceptable. I am still hopeful that can be the case.\n  I know where some of the Members are now on this issue. Perhaps we \nwill go into a quorum call for a while and see if we can find some \nlanguage that could satisfy both sides.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are happy to have discussions. I \nassume there will be on this issue, sooner or later. Our view is sooner \nrather than later, which is why we are going to stay on this subject.\n  Therefore, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak in \nopposition to the underlying amendment offered by the Senator from New \nYork, Senator Schumer, which would permit people to vote by mail with \nonly an authentication of a signature. The amendment modifies the \nunderlying bill, which would require that there be either a photo \nidentification or a government check which would establish that the \nindividual is, in fact, in existence, not a false person; or a \npaycheck, again establishing the person is in existence; or a utility \nbill or a bank statement or some other governmental document.\n  There is no doubt that it is in the interests of democracy to have as \nmany people register to vote as possible so that people can express \nthemselves in the electoral process. That is very fundamental. It is \nalso fundamental that we ought to do whatever is reasonably possible to \navoid vote fraud. This is an issue which I faced to a very substantial \nextent when I was District Attorney of Philadelphia. Philadelphia is a \nrough, tough, political town.\n  When I was DA in the 1960s and 1970s it was a rougher, tougher \npolitical town. I had the responsibility to enforce the election laws. \nIn that capacity, on a bipartisan, nonpartisan basis, I prosecuted both \nRepublicans and Democrats alike for vote fraud, and there was a lot of \nit in the city of Philadelphia. We could only detect a relatively small \namount of it, but that was a real problem in our city elections.\n  When motor voter came up, I supported it, to try to broaden the \navailability of registration for the broadest number of people. \nHowever, there have been very substantial problems with people \npurporting to vote when those people are not in existence.\n  When I was DA of Philadelphia, we had a great many people purporting \nto vote where there was no such person. It is a difficult matter to \npolice and to enforce. The underlying bill has a minimal check, to see \nto it that there is, in fact, a person who is registered to vote. If \nyou have somebody who has a government check, that is a solid \nindication. It is not absolute proof that the person is in existence, \nbut they wouldn't be getting a government check or paycheck or utility \nbill or bank statement. The photo ID, of course, is the best, but the \nunderlying bill does not require that. It is a modest stand in seeing \nto it that somebody actually is in existence.\n  If we are to continue motor voter and to have the broad sweep of \navailability for people to register so you do not have to go down \nspecifically to the registration spot--which is the customary way, in \nmany, many jurisdictions--if we are to have these procedures which make \nit very, very easy for people to register, and they are to be \nmaintained and continue in existence, then we are going to have to take \nsteps to stop fraud.\n  It seems to me the provisions of the underlying bill are minimal. So, \nif you have an amendment which the Senator from New York has offered, \nthat says all you have to have is a signature, anybody can sign a \npurported signature. Anybody can sign a name. Then, if securing the \nright to vote simply requires putting that writing down again, it may \nbe the signature of someone other than the person which it purports to \nrepresent. So, I believe the underlying Schumer amendment is unwise. \nThat is why I voted to table it.\n  Now we have a second-degree amendment, offered by the Senator from \nMissouri, which would seek to limit the applicability of the underlying \nSchumer amendment. I think that would at least take some steps to \nsafeguard against voter fraud.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, does the Senator from Pennsylvania yield for \na question?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield, Mr. President.\n  I am reluctant to do so, knowing the cross-examination expertise of \nthe Senator from Missouri, but I will take my chances.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am not here to cross-examine. I am just \nhere to ask some experience from a Senator who is distinguished by his \ncareer as a prosecutor previously. Many people have said that if \nanybody votes fraudulently, they will be prosecuted.\n  I have looked long, far, and wide to see any consistent pattern of \nprosecution of vote fraud. I just do not know that there has been any \nsignificant effort. I wonder if the Senator from Pennsylvania can \ninform me to what extent vote fraud is even prosecuted and what are \nsome of the problems that are entailed in a prosecution for vote fraud?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, vote fraud is prosecuted. When I was District \nAttorney of Philadelphia, I prosecuted Republicans and Democrats. \nCustomarily, vote fraud is illegal assistance when somebody goes into \nthe polling place, and this happens, and pulls the lever. There you can \nhave a witness. You can identify the individual, and you can prosecute \nthem. If you are seeking to prosecute someone who has sent in a \npurported signature which matches the signature on record, and there is \nregistration by mail so that no one ever sees the person, you don't \nhave an identification of the voter in the first instance. If you do \nnot have an ongoing identification of that person's actual existence, \nit is not virtually impossible. It is impossible. How are you going to \nfind the person who signed their name, even if you ascertain that there \nis no such person as the purported signature? How are you going to find \nthem? It is not a needle in the haystack. It is a needle in a city of \nmore than a million people.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out \nprecisely the problem with motor voter making it impossible for States \nto require a positive identification with the registration. As the \nSenator from Oregon I think wisely said in his debate, we ought to be \nmaking sure the registration is legitimate and that there is a real \nperson behind it. Right now you can't do that under motor voter. The \nunderlying bill, section 103(b) provides that.\n  But the Senator from Pennsylvania is saying that if somebody \nregisters the name of a dead person, a non-existent person, or even a \ndog, sends in that registration, writes the name on a card, gets the \nabsentee ballot, and sends it back in, it is next to impossible from \nthe prosecutor's standpoint to prosecute the unknown person who has \ndone the registration and cast the vote.\n\n[[Page S1231]]\n\n  Is that a fair assessment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri articulates it \naccurately. It is impossible to prosecute an unknown person. That is a \nmatter of the fundamental definition. If you do not know the person, \nyou can't swear out a warrant for an arrest. You also can't take the \nunknown person into custody. Then you would have the problem of proving \nthat this unknown person committed the crime, and proving it beyond a \nreasonable doubt. It can't be done.\n  I am concerned about changing motor voter. There is a lot of \ncriticism of motor voter generally. When I supported motor voter, I got \na lot of criticism from many people who thought that it went too far. \nHowever, I was willing to support motor voter legislation with that \nbroad sweep to try to encourage people to be on the voter rolls to \nexpress themselves. Motor voter works against my interest as a \ncandidate in a city like Philadelphia. That happens to be the fact of \nlife. It works against my electoral interests as a U.S. Senator running \nin Pennsylvania. But notwithstanding that factor, I have supported it, \nand I continue to support it.\n  If fraud becomes so widespread--and I think it is reaching that \npoint--that we really do not know the level of fraud, it is impossible \nto determine. But, there is a lot of evidence that there are a lot of \npeople who are not in existence who are voting. We do know that, \nbecause there is a check back. There is a signature of John Jones at a \ngiven address, and you find out that there is no John Jones at that \naddress. Who signed the name? How can you tell? You cannot prove who \ndid it to have a criminal prosecution. It is about the easiest form of \nvoter fraud to perpetrate.\n  If you go into the polling booth in Philadelphia, as we had a lot of \npeople do, and walk behind the curtain with a registered voter and pull \nthe lever, or give illegal assistance--there are legal ways to do it, \nif the person can't pull the lever--there the person is taking a \nchance. You can identify them. You can get a witness. You can prosecute \nthem. You can convict them. But, that can't be done just on signature.\n  For the people who are urging the enactment of the Schumer amendment \nto broaden the opportunities to vote, let me say to them head on that \nthey are going to be defeating their cause, because motor voter is \ngoing to be in jeopardy unless we are able to work it out in a way so \nthere is not fraud in this manner. The underlying bill is a modest step \nforward to eliminate that fraud.\n  I compliment the Senator from Missouri for his diligence in pursuing \nit. I also compliment him for his diligence in pursuing it over the \nweekend. It is pretty hard to find most of us over the weekend. But he \nfound me and talked to me about this matter. I told him that my \nexperience supported the stand that he was taking, and that I was \nprepared to back him and come to the floor and make this argument.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for giving us some very practical insights on the \ndifficulties a prosecutor faces in prosecuting a phony mail-in \nregistration. It seems to be an almost impossible task, unless you are \nfortunate enough to get somebody's fingerprints or have some way-\nbeyond-the-normal way of identifying who sent it in.\n  Obviously, everybody laughs about dead people being registered and \nRitzy Mekler, the dog, being registered. We know they did not register, \nbut finding out who registered them is a problem. Ritzy Mekler's owner \nclaims he did not register her. Somebody else may have done so.\n  But there is a real problem with the phony registrations piled on to \nour voter rolls in Missouri, for sure--I know in St. Louis, and I would \nimagine in most parts of the country.\n  So since we have undone the compromise that we worked 6 months to \nachieve, I express, again, my willingness to come to a bipartisan \ncompromise on how we make sure, A, that everybody who is entitled to \nvote gets registered, and, B, gets to vote. But also how do we get \nthose phony people off of the rolls?\n  I mentioned, in my earlier debate on this amendment, we know that \n3,000 registration cards dumped on the St. Louis City Election Board \nprior to the mayoral primary in 2001 were mostly phony--most of them in \nthe same handwriting, most of them with addresses from one or two \nblocks of the city. So we actually got on those, and those have been \nturned over to the prosecuting authorities.\n  But there is a little matter of 30,000 voters who were added to the \nrolls in St. Louis City, MO, just prior to the November 2000 general \nelection. Nobody knows for sure who they came from. But let me tell \nyou, I have some suspicions. I have some suspicions that we are seeing \npeople who might benefit from those registrations opposing efforts to \npurge.\n\n  So I would like to see if we can't work out a way to change some of \nthe onerous provisions that the motor voter bill puts on States in \ntrying to ascertain whether the voters who have been registered by mail \nare legitimate.\n  I voted against an amendment offered by my good friend and colleague \nfrom Montana, Senator Burns. It was going to give some power to purge. \nI told him at the time I thought it was a good idea. I think it is an \neven better idea now.\n  So we would like to work on finding a way to make sure we can make it \neasier to vote but tougher to cheat. As I said, if the Schumer-Biden \namendment goes through as is, it makes it easier to cheat, not tougher \nto cheat.\n  I started, in my remarks prior to the vote on the tabling motion, to \nshare with some of my colleagues the wisdom from the National \nCommission on Federal Election Reform. They were talking about \naccountability. And they said: The question is whether to require \nvoters to display some proof of identification at the polls.\n  This is on page 31:\n\n       All states hope that precinct officials and poll watchers \n     will have at least some familiarity with the residents of \n     their precincts. Seven states, all but one of them rural, do \n     nothing more. In the rest, the most common practice now is to \n     require voters to sign their names in an official registry or \n     on a ballot application. About a third of the states require \n     poll workers to check signatures against those provided at \n     registration. Fourteen states insist that voters produce some \n     form of identification.\n       Most states that have histories of strong party rivalry or \n     election fraud require signature verification or voter \n     identification at the polls.\n\n  This is the key part:\n\n       Signature verification puts an extra burden upon \n     administrators, and especially on often ill-trained poll \n     workers practicing a very subjective, often impossible, task \n     while voter lines lengthen. Also, many polling places lack \n     the means to provide poll workers with accurate copies of the \n     voter's actual signature (the one the voter used in order to \n     register) and a signature may change over time.\n       One alternative, favored by several Commissioners, is to \n     require those who are registering to vote and those who are \n     casting their ballot to provide some form of official \n     identification, such as a photo ID issued by a government \n     agency, (e.g., a driver's license). A photo ID is already \n     required in many other transactions, such as check-cashing \n     and using airline tickets. These Commissioners point out that \n     those who register and vote should expect to identify \n     themselves. If they do not have photo identification, then \n     they should be issued such cards from the government or have \n     available alternative forms of official ID. They believe this \n     burden is reasonable, that voters will understand it, and \n     that most democratic nations recognize this act as a valid \n     means of protecting the sanctity of the franchise.\n\n  They then go on to talk about striking the right balance, and they \nconclude talking about whether a photo ID is too much. They talk about \nalternative forms. But they said on page 32:\n\n       We do believe, however, that States should be able to \n     verify a voter's identity.\n\n  That goes to the sum and substance of the Schumer amendment. The \nSchumer amendment is flatly contradicted by the National Commission on \nFederal Election Reform. That is why I have offered a modest amendment \nto say that verification and affirmation will only go into effect when \nand if the Attorney General of the United States certifies that a State \nhas had less than half a percent of illegal ballots cast in the last \ntwo Federal elections.\n  Frankly, I don't believe that signature affirmation or verification \nworks as well as my colleagues claim. There are not hundreds of \nthousands of people denied an opportunity to register because they \ndon't have any kind of photo ID or government check or bank\n\n[[Page S1232]]\n\nstatement or utility bill or any other kind of paycheck stubs with \ntheir name and address on it. Any of those people who do exist can vote \nprovisionally, and they should be able to vote provisionally. I think \nthere is a handful at most, and we will accommodate them through \nprovisional voting. But I am most worried, for future elections, that \nthere were 30,000 names that came in out of the blue, mail-in \nregistrations that had not been checked in the city of St. Louis. I \nwould like to believe they are all legitimate voters who all of a \nsudden got the real view that they ought to register in one two-day \nperiod. But 15 percent of the electorate? I don't think so.\n  Mr. President, I am not willing to give up on this process. But I am \nnot willing to see a bill go through that makes it easier to vote and \neasier to cheat. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague from \nMissouri for his expression of trying to find some common ground. We \nknow each other pretty well, and I would never question the motivations \nof my friend from Missouri. He brings a lot of passion to matters he \ncares about. I like people who do that.\n  As he knows, there has been a tireless effort to cobble together a \nproposal here that would enjoy the broad-based support of this \ninstitution. We are dealing with 98 other colleagues, and when you deal \nwith a matter like elections, everybody is an expert. We have all been \nthrough them and everybody has a point of view--unlike in other matters \nwhere members can defer to other colleagues. Here everybody has \nsomething to contribute to the discussion and debate. I accept his \nwords here to try to find some resolution of the situation we are in. \nThat is what I have tried to do for a couple of weeks. Sometimes you \nneed to have the votes, because then you know where; you are. Votes \nwill let you know.\n  This place is pretty equally divided on this issue. We have to try to \nfind something here where a center can gather and move the bill \nforward. We are hoping to do that.\n  On the second-degree amendment--and I appreciate him offering an \namendment that is substantive and that goes to the heart of this. It is \nnot a frivolous amendment. It is one not the least of which is--I \npresume the amendment refers to the U.S. Attorney General. My colleague \nindicates that is the case. The concern, I suppose, we hear from all \nStates is that in this bill they want to avoid to have the Justice \nDepartment all of a sudden be reaching into States. We are already \ntrying to become a better partner in the election process, and that \nattorneys general, regardless of party, can all of a sudden, under this \namendment, be engaged in some ``fishing expeditions'' on some of these \nmatters--I think we would all be concerned about that.\n  There may be something we can work on that may provide a means by \nwhich we can come to an agreement on the issue of signatures and \nattestations. Let me say to my friend as well--and he and I went \nthrough this a great deal, back an forth, on how we can resolve these \nissues. As I understand it--and it gets hard trying to identify exactly \nwhat each State does--there are 28 or 29 States that do an attestation \nor signature. I may be off by a State or 2. As I went down the list and \ntried to determine how many States do that, many of these States \nbelieve that is a very viable means by which to deal with the fraud \nissue.\n  I know my colleague from Missouri has had different experience in his \nState. I don't argue with that, except to say that around the country \nthere are different views on how best to achieve these results. There \nis nothing in here, obviously, that precludes the photo ID from being a \npart of that means of identification. The issue is whether or not we \nare going to, in some way, restrict these other means of verification \nthat a majority of States have been comfortable with over the years, \nand then if there is something else we might add to that to address the \nconcerns the Senator from Missouri raised.\n  Aside from these particular amendments that are pending, I will point \nout that, historically, the efforts of enforcement have to be in the \nStates; that is, where there is a problem of fraud, the States have to \npursue it. The Presiding Officer brings to this issue more than a \ncasual acquaintance with these issues having been--the Secretary of \nState in his State worked directly in these areas. I presume he could \nbring to this discussion some additional thoughts and ideas, and I am \ngrateful to him for that.\n  As I said, the attestation and signature have been used, and many \nStates are comfortable with that. I am hopeful we can find some \nmechanism which will allow us to get beyond this particular issue in \nsuch a way that while it would not do everything, as my colleague from \nMissouri might want, it certainly will do more than the present \nsituation.\n  What I suggest, because we have to resolve this one way or the other, \nis that we take some time and get our respective staffs together and \nsit down and skull on this and see if we can hammer out some ideas and \ncome back with some proposals on how we might deal with this.\n  My friend from Missouri is nodding in the affirmative. Rather than \ntalking, it seems to me we would be advised to sit down and see, over \nthe next half hour or hour, if we can come back with some ideas for \nconsideration. That is the path we will follow.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are about to finalize and pass on to \nthe President a bill on campaign finance reform. Anyone who has \nfollowed the proceedings during the years knows that I have been \nopposed to this since I first came into the Chamber back in 1993. I \nremember participating in an all-night filibuster against it, which \nSenator Mitchell forced us to go through. My hour, as I recall, was \nsomething between 1 and 2 in the morning because I didn't have enough \nseniority to have an hour that was more compatible with my sleeping \npatterns.\n  I have done everything to see to it that this bill does not become \nlaw, for one very fundamental reason: I believe it is clearly \nunconstitutional. It violates both the spirit and the letter of the \nwork of James Madison. I have quoted Madison on the floor, but I have \nbeen unsuccessful. It is clear to me now that the law is going to pass. \nIt is, in all probability, going to be signed.\n  I want to take a moment or two to outline, in the spirit of some \nprophecy, what I think is going to happen as a result of the bill. I \nhave tried to be as objective as possible and set aside my deeply felt \nconviction that this bill violates what Madison was telling us in the \ntenth Federalist about appropriate government. The first thing that is \nvery clear is that this bill will weaken--I won't go so far as to say \n``destroy,'' as some others have said--both political parties. Neither \nparty will be able to raise the money to pay the lights, run the \noverhead, keep the operation going and, at the same time, participate \nsignificantly in the campaigns of its members. By banning so-called \nsoft money, we guarantee that each party will have to raise hard money \nto keep its overhead going and, therefore, be unable to put as much \nmoney and as much muscle into individual campaigns. This means that \nspecial interest groups which can raise this money have raised this \nmoney and will continue to raise this money and will play an increasing \nrole in political campaigns. That is, the vacuum created by pushing \ndown the role of parties will be filled by special interest group \nmoney. We are already seeing this. I have seen it in my home State of \nUtah. The net effect of it will be that candidates will increasingly \nlose control of their own campaigns.\n\n  We saw an example in Utah, where candidate X was attacked by a \nspecial interest group over a particular issue. Candidate Y, who \nnormally would benefit from that kind of attack, in fact, was appalled \nat the attack and did everything she could to stop it because she felt, \ncorrectly, that it was reflecting on her. The voter could not \ndifferentiate between the source, whether it was from a special \ninterest group or the political campaign. All the voter knew was that \nthese ads were unnecessarily nasty, unnecessarily antagonistic, \nattacking candidate X. They took it out on candidate Y. They blamed her \nfor the attacks, and she was powerless to do anything about it because \nspecial interest groups have the right to run their own campaigns.\n  As a result of the passing of campaign finance reform, she would be \neven more powerless to defend herself against that kind of circumstance \nbecause she could not call on her national party for assistance. The \nparty will be prevented from providing the kind of help that is \ncurrently available. So, as I say, the net effect will be to increase \nthe power of special interest groups in campaigns and to decrease the \nabilities of a candidate to manage his or her own campaign.\n  The next thing I see coming out of this is, of course, a plethora of \nlawsuits, because the bill is very badly written, it is badly drafted, \nand it creates a whole series of vague references to the relationship \nbetween the national party and the State party, Federal money, State \nmoney, what can be done by a State party to try to advance its \ncandidates; and what happens if the State party spends money in a way \nthat somehow is deemed to advance a national candidate, or Federal \ncandidate? Let's have a lawsuit. Let's be in court. Let's have all \nkinds of disputes.\n  Once again, by limiting the amount of money that parties can raise, \nit will drain off party money to handle legal bills. So, once again, \nthe party will be less capable of defending its own candidates in the \npolitical arena.\n  Now, at the moment, my judgment is that there are more special \ninterest groups involved in issue advocacy campaigns who support \nDemocrats than there are who support Republicans. I have seen one \nstudy--I have no idea how accurate it is--that indicates that in the \nlast Presidential campaign there was about $300 million, total, spent \non both sides. If you take the money allocated to the parties, the \nRepublican Party outspent the Democratic Party. But when you add in the \nissue advocacy money spent by special interest groups, most of it was \non the Democratic side of the ledger, so the total, according to this \none study, suggested that you got to rough parity between the two sides \nin the election. Now, I think the initial effect will be--if it is true \nthere are more special interest groups supporting Democrats--you will \nsee a financial benefit for the Democrats through that special interest \ngroup, if indeed the money spent does benefit them. Once again, we come \nback to the example I described in Utah, where the money spent by the \nspecial interest group damaged the candidate it was supposed to help, \nbecause the candidate had no control, no input, and had lost control of \nher campaign.\n  Let's assume, for the moment, that all of the money spent by the \nspecial interest groups on behalf of Democratic candidates is well \nspent and produces a benefit for the Democratic candidates. There will \nbe an attempt--and I suspect overtime it will be successful--for \nRepublicans to create special interest groups to balance that.\n  We will, once again, get to the point of rough parity because money \nand politics abhor a vacuum. We will have just as much money spent on \npolitics as we have now. The difference is that it will be channeled \neither through existing special interest groups, most of which, as I \nsay, benefit the Democrats, or newly created special interest groups to \ncounter that, created to benefit the Republicans. Once again, the total \nimpact will be that candidates and parties will lose control over their \nelections.\n  I hope the time does not come, but I think it is possible, where \ncandidates and parties become almost insignificant in political \ncampaigns; where political campaigns are fought between major special \ninterest groups and candidates simply sign up with which interest group \nthey are going to endorse and then sit back, watch the money get spent, \nand watch the results come in, with our historic political parties \nsignificantly weakened, a candidate's ability to manage his own \ncampaign significantly degraded, and ultimately politics in this \ncountry the worst as a result of the passage of this legislation.\n  I lay that down, Madam President, as my view of what is going to \nhappen. The bill will be passed. If the bill is signed, then we can all \nwait and see. I hope I am wrong. I hope the reformers are right and we \nwill enter a new era of magnificent good feeling about politics.\n  My expectation is that, as has been the case with most reform efforts \nuntil now, we will see things get worse rather than better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have sought recognition to announce \nmy support for the nomination of District Court Judge Charles Pickering \nto the Court of Appeals and make some comments about the pending \nnomination of Judge D. Brooks Smith, now\n\n[[Page S1234]]\n\nChief Judge of the Western District of Pennsylvania for the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit, who had a hearing yesterday, and to \ncomment generally about the issues facing the Judiciary Committee on \npartisanship.\n  Judge Pickering appeared before the Judiciary Committee. Prior to \nthat time, I had an opportunity to read his opinions, to meet with him \npersonally, to go over the issues, to study his record, and it is my \nconclusion that if we were dealing with State Senator Charles Pickering \nfrom the early 1970s, we would not confirm him for the Court of \nAppeals. But dealing with Charles Pickering in the year 2002, based \nupon his record today, he is worthy of confirmation.\n  In the early 1960s, it was a different world, as we all know. Prior \nto the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, prior to the passage of \nthe Voting Rights Act and the early days following the decision of the \nSupreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education handed down in 1954, it \nwas a different world.\n  Judge Pickering has distinguished himself and has shown that he has a \nsensitivity to civil rights issues. He spoke out against the leader of \nthe Ku Klux Klan in a way which was a threat to his personal security. \nHe has demonstrated in his conduct a sensitivity to racial matters.\n  There has been quite a divergence in opinion about Judge Pickering \nbased upon people inside the beltway, in Washington, contrasted with \nthe African Americans who know Judge Charles Pickering from his \nhometown of Laurel, MS.\n\n  The pseudo-hearings which have been conducted on national television \nand the comments in the national press from those who know Judge \nPickering from Mississippi portray a very different man than those who \noppose his nomination within the beltway.\n  In making that comparison, I raise no objection to the opinions of \nthe positions taken by people who have spoken out against Judge \nPickering. That is their right. But I do make a sharp distinction in \nterms of the value of those opinions and the weight which ought to be \ngiven to those opinions when you have people who know him so much \nbetter on his home turf.\n  If we were to apply the standards which would have been applicable to \nState Senator Charles Pickering in the early 1970s, it would be very \ndifferent. I cannot help but think of Senator Thurmond who ran for \nPresident as a Dixiecrat in 1948 and who was a staunch opponent of many \nof the civil rights issues. Senator Thurmond, as so many others, like \nCharles Pickering, changed over the years and saw the evolution from \ndesegregation in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 to a very \ndifferent era.\n  Senator Thurmond has enormous support among African Americans. I \nmention him because he is someone known to everybody in the Senate, \nhaving been here since 1954 and having established himself as very \nsensitive and very pro-civil rights, but if he were to be judged on his \nrecord from the early 1960s, as some are trying to judge then-State \nSenator Charles Pickering on his record of the early 1970s, Senator \nThurmond would not be confirmed.\n  I can count the votes, Madam President, and it seems to me that, \nregrettably, the Judiciary Committee is going to vote along party lines \nand deny Judge Pickering an affirmative vote to bring his nomination to \nthe floor of the Senate. I may be wrong. I hope I am wrong. I do not \nthink I am wrong. It seems to me that whatever the vote for \nconfirmation is in the Judiciary Committee, Judge Pickering ought to \ncome to the full Senate.\n  Judge Bork and Judge Thomas--Judge Bork then a judge on the District \nof Columbia Circuit Court--received a negative vote in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee 9 to 5, but he was voted to the floor for full \nconsideration and ultimately did not prevail and was defeated 42 in \nfavor, 58 against.\n  Justice Thomas, then Judge Thomas, had a tie vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee but was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 13 \nto 1 to be considered by the full Senate.\n  In the old days, the Judiciary Committee used to bottle up a lot of \ncivil rights legislation. It is my view that this is a matter which \nought to be considered by the full Senate.\n  Yesterday, we had the confirmation hearing of United States District \nCourt Judge D. Brooks Smith, who was recommended by Senator Heinz and \nmyself in 1988, appointed by President Reagan, and has had a very \ndistinguished record on the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania where he now serves as chief judge.\n  Prior to that, he had been in the Court of Common Pleas in Blair \nCounty, PA, and prior to that had been assistant district attorney.\n  Judge Smith was challenged on a number of grounds. People raised \nquestions about his reversal rate, but when that was examined, we found \nthat of the approximately 5,300 cases that Judge Smith had, about 10 \npercent of them were appealed, about 530 cases, and that his reversal \nrate was right at 10 percent, which is right at the norm.\n  His reversal rate was higher in 1989, his first year as a federal \njudge, in excess of 35 percent. As the years passed and as he gained \nmore experience, he brought that reversal rate down very substantially. \nWith the total number of cases, about 5,300, and something around 50 \nreversals, it is right at the 1 percent mark.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of this presentation \nthe text of the record of Judge Smith on reversals be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Judge Smith was further challenged on the issue of \nconflict of interest when he sat on a case where a bank was a \ndepository, where he had stock or financial interest in the bank and \nhis wife was an employee but the bank was not a party. The trustee in \nthat case was Dick Thornburgh, formerly Governor of Pennsylvania and \nalso formerly Attorney General of the United States. Governor \nThornburgh wrote an op-ed piece for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nexonerating Judge Smith from any issue of conflict of interest, citing \nJustice Donetta Ambrose who succeeded Judge Smith to handle that case \nafter Judge Smith recused himself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of this statement the \nop-ed piece by Governor Thornburgh be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Judge Smith was questioned at some length about trips he \nhad made to seminars, that there might have been an effort to influence \nhis decisions and that they were, in effect, junkets.\n  There is a famous expression that it does not lie in the mouth of \nsomeone to say something, which really means that party has no standing \nto raise the question.\n  I do not think that the Senate, or Senators, have standing to raise \nquestions about travel. I say that in the context of traveling myself, \nand I think those travels are very worthwhile. And I have gone to \nseminars, and I make the appropriate disclosure on my financial \nstatements.\n  The seminars that Judge Smith attended were entirely appropriate, and \nhe was challenged because he had not listed the value of those trips to \nseminars. He stated that he thought he had complied with the law. Since \nstaff has checked out, it was found there was no requirement that the \nvalue be listed.\n  It may be when we are talking about Judge Pickering and perhaps about \nJudge Smith--and I feel confident Judge Smith will be acted upon \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee, but one never knows--but in \nlooking at the proceedings as to Judge Pickering, this may be a warm-up \nfor the next Supreme Court nomination.\n  When Attorney General John Ashcroft was up for a confirmation \nhearing, there was an undertone that where you have the issue of \nchoice, someone has to be willing to say they will support Roe v. Wade. \nIt really did not apply to the Attorney General's nomination itself but \nas to his pro-life position, which then-Senator Ashcroft had \narticulated, we knew his position. There was an undertone in the \nhearing, and some on the Judiciary Committee have articulated a view \nthat there ought to be a litmus test, that nobody ought to be confirmed \nunless that judicial nominee is prepared to say the nominee \nwould uphold Roe v. Wade.\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n  When those issues have been posed in the past, the nominees have been \naccorded standing to say they are not going to comment about cases \nwhich may come before the Court. But there is what at least appears to \nbe an effort to put Roe v. Wade on a par with Brown v. Board of \nEducation. Doubtless it is true that no one could be confirmed to the \nSupreme Court of the United States or to the Federal judiciary if they \nsaid they would favor reversing Brown v. Board of Education and \nintegration. It is going to be a hotly contested issue, I believe.\n  Again, I may be wrong, but I do not think so, that some in the Senate \nand some on the Judiciary Committee, and perhaps many others, are \ntrying to equate Roe v. Wade with Brown v. Board of Education.\n  We see the changing times on the issue of the death penalty for \npeople who have a mental impairment, with the Supreme Court saying they \nare looking for a national consensus before changing the law. On the \nevaluation of judicial decisions where the Court does look for an \nevolving national consensus to establish the moral temper ofttimes, \nwith the Court's interpretations being very different on the equal \nprotection clause of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 compared to the \nreversal of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.\n  I do believe it is time for a truce between Republicans and Democrats \non this issue of judicial confirmations. I think we ought to declare a \ntruce and sign an armistice agreement that we are not going to have a \nrepetition of what happened when we had a Democrat in the White House \nand Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee. That was the \nposition I took at the time in breaking party ranks and voting to \nconfirm Judge Paez and Judge Marcia Berzon and in voting to confirm \nJudge Roger Gregory for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, \nand in voting to confirm Bill Lan Lee for Assistant Attorney General of \nthe Civil Division. We ought to declare this truce and ought to sign \nthis armistice so we take partisan politics out of the confirmation \nprocess of Federal judges. It is high time we did that.\n  I hope the confirmation proceeding as to Judge Charles Pickering \nelevating him from the district court to the court of appeals will be a \ngood occasion for that truce, or that signing of an armistice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Brooks Smith--Case Statistics\n\n\n                            absolute numbers\n\n       Smith has closed 5,298 cases--of which 526 cases were \n     appealed to the Third Circuit.\n       Smith has been reversed 53 times over his 13 year career as \n     a federal judge (since 11/1/1988).\n       Note that in 12 of these 53 cases (i.e., about one-fourth \n     of the cases), Smith was affirmed in part and reversed in \n     part. And some of these were complex cases involving numerous \n     issues where he was affirmed on nearly all of the issues but \n     reversed on one ground or a few grounds.\n\n\n                              percentages\n\n       Smith has been reversed in 10% of appealed cases (i.e., 53 \n     of 526 cases).\n       He has been reversed in only 1% of closed cases (i.e., 53 \n     of 5,298 cases).\n\n\n                               comparison\n\n       Smith's 10% average reversal rate (in appealed cases) from \n     1989-2001 is similar to the average annual reversal rate for \n     the Third Circuit and for all circuits for appeals terminated \n     on the merits.\n\n                           [Amount in percent]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     Third        All\n                                         Smith      Circuit    circuits\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           29.16        12.4        13.4\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             C\n1990................................       15.38        11.3        11.8\n1991................................        3.7         10.4        11.7\n1992................................       12.5         10.4        11.0\n1993................................        6.66        10.3        10.0\n1994................................       11.9         11.8        10.0\n1995................................        6.55         9.4        11.0\n1996................................       10            9.9         9.4\n1997................................       16.66         9.9         9.1\n1998................................       13.51         9.0        10.2\n1999................................        0           10.4         9.1\n2000................................        9.3         12.0         9.7\n2001................................        5.88        11.7         9.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNotes: None of the cases closed by Smith in 1988 were appealed.

Brooks Smith\n\n                          (By Dick Thornburgh)\n\n       Washington.--Today the Senate Judiciary Committee will \n     consider President Bush's nomination of Chief U.S. District \n     Judge D. Brooks smith for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, headquartered in Philadelphia.\n       For 18 years, Judge Smith has served Pennsylvanians with \n     distinction. Judge Smith boasts first-rate credentials in \n     addition to his years of judicial experience, and the \n     American Bar Association unanimously gave him its highest \n     rating. Over 100 Democrats and Republicans alike have signed \n     letters of support to the Senate Judiciary Committee. These \n     letters from judges, public officials and leaders of civil \n     liberties, labor, and women's organizations all praise Judge \n     Smith's fairness and impartiality. The Post-Gazette has \n     detailed the campaign against Judge Smith by the Community \n     Rights Counsel and other extreme interest groups. Just as \n     night follows day, it seems the usual suspects are lining up \n     for another effort to ``Bork'' a distinguished judge. \n     Specifically, critics argue that Judge Smith should have \n     immediately recused himself from a 1997 municipal fraud case \n     involving an investment adviser later convicted of defrauding \n     several Pennsylvania school districts. Critics say recusal \n     was necessary as Judge Smith's wife worked at Mid-State Bank \n     where some of the defendants' assets were deposited, and the \n     Smiths held stock in Mid-State's parent company.\n       Please allow me to set the record straight. I served as the \n     trustee for the defrauded schools and bore a fiduciary duty \n     to safeguard their funds. And I can say with front-row, \n     firsthand knowledge that Judge Smith acted with absolute \n     integrity, independence and honor.\n       First, Mid-State Bank was not a party to the case, and \n     nothing at the outset suggested Mid-State was complicit in \n     any fraudulent scheme. It was therefore unlikely that Judge \n     Smith's wife, who worked in an unrelated part of the bank, \n     would become a material witness. Since the complint did not \n     allege any wrongdoing by the bank holding the defendants' \n     funds, any stock the Smiths owned in its parent company was \n     immaterial. As trustee, I had sole possession of and control \n     over the assets, and Judge Smith's initial order distributing \n     50 percent of frozen funds to defrauded school districts just \n     approved an interim plan proposed jointly by me and the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission while the case proceeded.\n       When Judge Smith later received information that Mid-State \n     could, in the future, conceivably play a role in the \n     litigation, out of an excess of caution he immediately \n     recused himself sua sponte, without being asked by either \n     party. The actions that Judge Smith took prior to his recusal \n     in the civil case did nothing to limit Mid--State's eventual \n     liability exposure or impact the victims' rights of recovery.\n       In fact, the attacks by interest groups ignore the fact \n     that no funds were even deposited at Mid-State at the time \n     Judge Smith granted his last orders. As trustee, I had \n     transferred the assets to another bank several days before \n     this order. Nothing that occurred between this order and \n     Judge Smith's recusal days later benefited Mid-State. \n     Judge Donetta Ambrose, who obtained the case after Judge \n     Smith's recusal, agreed. She wrote to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to say, ``There was never any suggestion by me \n     or the Court of Appeals that Judge Smith acted \n     inappropriately or unethically. Rather, he acted prudently \n     and cautiously. . . . The allegations of unethical conduct \n     in the context of this case are without foundation.''\n       Partisan critics also improperly fault Judge Smith for \n     temporarily handling a later criminal case against the \n     investment adviser. Nobody involved in the case has alleged \n     that Judge Smith issued any improper orders or took any \n     inappropriate action. The case was assigned to Judge Smith \n     only after lawyers in the case agreed that it was unrelated \n     to the SEC's civil case. Mid-State Bank was not a party. The \n     U.S. attorney's office never sought recusal, and defense \n     counsel did not seek recusal until four months later, when \n     Judge Smith immediately recused himself.\n       As governor of Pennsylvania in 1984, I had the honor of \n     originally nominating Brooks Smith to sit on the Court of \n     Common Pleas in Blair County. In 1988, while attorney general \n     of the United States, I had the honor of seeing the U.S. \n     Senate unanimously confirm Brooks Smith as a federal judge. \n     This year, I hope to see the same Senate set aside the recent \n     attacks of extreme interest groups and honor Judge Smith's \n     long record of judicial service with a swift and unanimous \n     approval to the 3rd Circuit.\n       By any measure of judicial merit, Brooks Smith is qualified \n     to serve. Like the president who nominated him, Brooks Smith \n     has rallied a broad coalition of support. It would be wrong \n     to allow extreme interest groups to delay his confirmation by \n     even one day. However, I am optimistic that this will not \n     occur. Judge Smith acquired his reputation for honesty, \n     uprightness and professionalism the old-fashioned way--he \n     earned it. And it will see him through.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1236]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1233-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1233-S1236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATIONS OF JUDGE CHARLES PICKERING AND JUDGE BROOKS SMITH\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

He spoke out against the leader of \nthe Ku Klux Klan in a way which was a threat to his personal security. \nHe has demonstrated in his conduct a sensitivity to racial matters.\n  There has been quite a divergence in opinion about Judge Pickering \nbased upon people inside the beltway, in Washington, contrasted with \nthe African Americans who know Judge Charles Pickering from his \nhometown of Laurel, MS.\n\n  The pseudo-hearings which have been conducted on national television \nand the comments in the national press from those who know Judge \nPickering from Mississippi portray a very different man than those who \noppose his nomination within the beltway.\n  In making that comparison, I raise no objection to the opinions of \nthe positions taken by people who have spoken out against Judge \nPickering. That is their right. But I do make a sharp distinction in \nterms of the value of those opinions and the weight which ought to be \ngiven to those opinions when you have people who know him so much \nbetter on his home turf.\n  If we were to apply the standards which would have been applicable to \nState Senator Charles Pickering in the early 1970s, it would be very \ndifferent. I cannot help but think of Senator Thurmond who ran for \nPresident as a Dixiecrat in 1948 and who was a staunch opponent of many \nof the civil rights issues. Senator Thurmond, as so many others, like \nCharles Pickering, changed over the years and saw the evolution from \ndesegregation in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 to a very \ndifferent era.\n  Senator Thurmond has enormous support among African Americans. I \nmention him because he is someone known to everybody in the Senate, \nhaving been here since 1954 and having established himself as very \nsensitive and very pro-civil rights, but if he were to be judged on his \nrecord from the early 1960s, as some are trying to judge then-State \nSenator Charles Pickering on his record of the early 1970s, Senator \nThurmond would not be confirmed.\n  I can count the votes, Madam President, and it seems to me that, \nregrettably, the Judiciary Committee is going to vote along party lines \nand deny Judge Pickering an affirmative vote to bring his nomination to \nthe floor of the Senate. I may be wrong. I hope I am wrong. I do not \nthink I am wrong. It seems to me that whatever the vote for \nconfirmation is in the Judiciary Committee, Judge Pickering ought to \ncome to the full Senate.\n  Judge Bork and Judge Thomas--Judge Bork then a judge on the District \nof Columbia Circuit Court--received a negative vote in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee 9 to 5, but he was voted to the floor for full \nconsideration and ultimately did not prevail and was defeated 42 in \nfavor, 58 against.\n  Justice Thomas, then Judge Thomas, had a tie vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee but was voted out of the Judiciary Committee by a vote of 13 \nto 1 to be considered by the full Senate.\n  In the old days, the Judiciary Committee used to bottle up a lot of \ncivil rights legislation. It is my view that this is a matter which \nought to be considered by the full Senate.\n  Yesterday, we had the confirmation hearing of United States District \nCourt Judge D. Brooks Smith, who was recommended by Senator Heinz and \nmyself in 1988, appointed by President Reagan, and has had a very \ndistinguished record on the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania where he now serves as chief judge.\n  Prior to that, he had been in the Court of Common Pleas in Blair \nCounty, PA, and prior to that had been assistant district attorney.\n  Judge Smith was challenged on a number of grounds. People raised \nquestions about his reversal rate, but when that was examined, we found \nthat of the approximately 5,300 cases that Judge Smith had, about 10 \npercent of them were appealed, about 530 cases, and that his reversal \nrate was right at 10 percent, which is right at the norm.\n  His reversal rate was higher in 1989, his first year as a federal \njudge, in excess of 35 percent. As the years passed and as he gained \nmore experience, he brought that reversal rate down very substantially. \nWith the total number of cases, about 5,300, and something around 50 \nreversals, it is right at the 1 percent mark.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of this presentation \nthe text of the record of Judge Smith on reversals be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Judge Smith was further challenged on the issue of \nconflict of interest when he sat on a case where a bank was a \ndepository, where he had stock or financial interest in the bank and \nhis wife was an employee but the bank was not a party. The trustee in \nthat case was Dick Thornburgh, formerly Governor of Pennsylvania and \nalso formerly Attorney General of the United States. Governor \nThornburgh wrote an op-ed piece for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nexonerating Judge Smith from any issue of conflict of interest, citing \nJustice Donetta Ambrose who succeeded Judge Smith to handle that case \nafter Judge Smith recused himself.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of this statement the \nop-ed piece by Governor Thornburgh be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 2.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Judge Smith was questioned at some length about trips he \nhad made to seminars, that there might have been an effort to influence \nhis decisions and that they were, in effect, junkets.\n  There is a famous expression that it does not lie in the mouth of \nsomeone to say something, which really means that party has no standing \nto raise the question.\n  I do not think that the Senate, or Senators, have standing to raise \nquestions about travel. I say that in the context of traveling myself, \nand I think those travels are very worthwhile. And I have gone to \nseminars, and I make the appropriate disclosure on my financial \nstatements.\n  The seminars that Judge Smith attended were entirely appropriate, and \nhe was challenged because he had not listed the value of those trips to \nseminars. He stated that he thought he had complied with the law. Since \nstaff has checked out, it was found there was no requirement that the \nvalue be listed.\n  It may be when we are talking about Judge Pickering and perhaps about \nJudge Smith--and I feel confident Judge Smith will be acted upon \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee, but one never knows--but in \nlooking at the proceedings as to Judge Pickering, this may be a warm-up \nfor the next Supreme Court nomination.\n  When Attorney General John Ashcroft was up for a confirmation \nhearing, there was an undertone that where you have the issue of \nchoice, someone has to be willing to say they will support Roe v. Wade. \nIt really did not apply to the Attorney General's nomination itself but \nas to his pro-life position, which then-Senator Ashcroft had \narticulated, we knew his position. There was an undertone in the \nhearing, and some on the Judiciary Committee have articulated a view \nthat there ought to be a litmus test, that nobody ought to be confirmed \nunless that judicial nominee is prepared to say the nominee \nwould uphold Roe v. Wade.\n\n[[Page S1235]]\n\n  When those issues have been posed in the past, the nominees have been \naccorded standing to say they are not going to comment about cases \nwhich may come before the Court. But there is what at least appears to \nbe an effort to put Roe v. Wade on a par with Brown v. Board of \nEducation. Doubtless it is true that no one could be confirmed to the \nSupreme Court of the United States or to the Federal judiciary if they \nsaid they would favor reversing Brown v. Board of Education and \nintegration. It is going to be a hotly contested issue, I believe.\n  Again, I may be wrong, but I do not think so, that some in the Senate \nand some on the Judiciary Committee, and perhaps many others, are \ntrying to equate Roe v. Wade with Brown v. Board of Education.\n  We see the changing times on the issue of the death penalty for \npeople who have a mental impairment, with the Supreme Court saying they \nare looking for a national consensus before changing the law. On the \nevaluation of judicial decisions where the Court does look for an \nevolving national consensus to establish the moral temper ofttimes, \nwith the Court's interpretations being very different on the equal \nprotection clause of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896 compared to the \nreversal of Brown v. Board of Education in 1954.\n  I do believe it is time for a truce between Republicans and Democrats \non this issue of judicial confirmations. I think we ought to declare a \ntruce and sign an armistice agreement that we are not going to have a \nrepetition of what happened when we had a Democrat in the White House \nand Republicans in control of the Judiciary Committee. That was the \nposition I took at the time in breaking party ranks and voting to \nconfirm Judge Paez and Judge Marcia Berzon and in voting to confirm \nJudge Roger Gregory for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, \nand in voting to confirm Bill Lan Lee for Assistant Attorney General of \nthe Civil Division. We ought to declare this truce and ought to sign \nthis armistice so we take partisan politics out of the confirmation \nprocess of Federal judges. It is high time we did that.\n  I hope the confirmation proceeding as to Judge Charles Pickering \nelevating him from the district court to the court of appeals will be a \ngood occasion for that truce, or that signing of an armistice.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     Brooks Smith--Case Statistics\n\n\n                            absolute numbers\n\n       Smith has closed 5,298 cases--of which 526 cases were \n     appealed to the Third Circuit.\n       Smith has been reversed 53 times over his 13 year career as \n     a federal judge (since 11/1/1988).\n       Note that in 12 of these 53 cases (i.e., about one-fourth \n     of the cases), Smith was affirmed in part and reversed in \n     part.

Brooks Smith\n\n                          (By Dick Thornburgh)\n\n       Washington.--Today the Senate Judiciary Committee will \n     consider President Bush's nomination of Chief U.S. District \n     Judge D. Brooks smith for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, headquartered in Philadelphia.\n       For 18 years, Judge Smith has served Pennsylvanians with \n     distinction. Judge Smith boasts first-rate credentials in \n     addition to his years of judicial experience, and the \n     American Bar Association unanimously gave him its highest \n     rating. Over 100 Democrats and Republicans alike have signed \n     letters of support to the Senate Judiciary Committee. These \n     letters from judges, public officials and leaders of civil \n     liberties, labor, and women's organizations all praise Judge \n     Smith's fairness and impartiality. The Post-Gazette has \n     detailed the campaign against Judge Smith by the Community \n     Rights Counsel and other extreme interest groups. Just as \n     night follows day, it seems the usual suspects are lining up \n     for another effort to ``Bork'' a distinguished judge. \n     Specifically, critics argue that Judge Smith should have \n     immediately recused himself from a 1997 municipal fraud case \n     involving an investment adviser later convicted of defrauding \n     several Pennsylvania school districts. Critics say recusal \n     was necessary as Judge Smith's wife worked at Mid-State Bank \n     where some of the defendants' assets were deposited, and the \n     Smiths held stock in Mid-State's parent company.\n       Please allow me to set the record straight. I served as the \n     trustee for the defrauded schools and bore a fiduciary duty \n     to safeguard their funds. And I can say with front-row, \n     firsthand knowledge that Judge Smith acted with absolute \n     integrity, independence and honor.\n       First, Mid-State Bank was not a party to the case, and \n     nothing at the outset suggested Mid-State was complicit in \n     any fraudulent scheme. It was therefore unlikely that Judge \n     Smith's wife, who worked in an unrelated part of the bank, \n     would become a material witness. Since the complint did not \n     allege any wrongdoing by the bank holding the defendants' \n     funds, any stock the Smiths owned in its parent company was \n     immaterial. As trustee, I had sole possession of and control \n     over the assets, and Judge Smith's initial order distributing \n     50 percent of frozen funds to defrauded school districts just \n     approved an interim plan proposed jointly by me and the \n     Securities and Exchange Commission while the case proceeded.\n       When Judge Smith later received information that Mid-State \n     could, in the future, conceivably play a role in the \n     litigation, out of an excess of caution he immediately \n     recused himself sua sponte, without being asked by either \n     party. The actions that Judge Smith took prior to his recusal \n     in the civil case did nothing to limit Mid--State's eventual \n     liability exposure or impact the victims' rights of recovery.\n       In fact, the attacks by interest groups ignore the fact \n     that no funds were even deposited at Mid-State at the time \n     Judge Smith granted his last orders. As trustee, I had \n     transferred the assets to another bank several days before \n     this order. Nothing that occurred between this order and \n     Judge Smith's recusal days later benefited Mid-State. \n     Judge Donetta Ambrose, who obtained the case after Judge \n     Smith's recusal, agreed. She wrote to the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to say, ``There was never any suggestion by me \n     or the Court of Appeals that Judge Smith acted \n     inappropriately or unethically. Rather, he acted prudently \n     and cautiously. . . . The allegations of unethical conduct \n     in the context of this case are without foundation.''\n       Partisan critics also improperly fault Judge Smith for \n     temporarily handling a later criminal case against the \n     investment adviser. Nobody involved in the case has alleged \n     that Judge Smith issued any improper orders or took any \n     inappropriate action. The case was assigned to Judge Smith \n     only after lawyers in the case agreed that it was unrelated \n     to the SEC's civil case. Mid-State Bank was not a party. The \n     U.S. attorney's office never sought recusal, and defense \n     counsel did not seek recusal until four months later, when \n     Judge Smith immediately recused himself.\n       As governor of Pennsylvania in 1984, I had the honor of \n     originally nominating Brooks Smith to sit on the Court of \n     Common Pleas in Blair County. In 1988, while attorney general \n     of the United States, I had the honor of seeing the U.S. \n     Senate unanimously confirm Brooks Smith as a federal judge. \n     This year, I hope to see the same Senate set aside the recent \n     attacks of extreme interest groups and honor Judge Smith's \n     long record of judicial service with a swift and unanimous \n     approval to the 3rd Circuit.\n       By any measure of judicial merit, Brooks Smith is qualified \n     to serve. Like the president who nominated him, Brooks Smith \n     has rallied a broad coalition of support. It would be wrong \n     to allow extreme interest groups to delay his confirmation by \n     even one day. However, I am optimistic that this will not \n     occur. Judge Smith acquired his reputation for honesty, \n     uprightness and professionalism the old-fashioned way--he \n     earned it. And it will see him through.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Madam President, I just want to give the Presiding Officer \na little bit of an update on where things are regarding negotiations on \nthe Schumer-Wyden-Bond issue involving the question of voter \nidentification.\n  Staffs are meeting. There has been no resolution, I am sad to report, \nat this juncture, but they are meeting and are working on this.\n  I thank Senator Schumer and Senator Wyden and their staffs, along \nwith Senator Bond and his staff, to see if they can come forward with a \ncompromise proposal. As I mentioned two or three times already today, I \nhoped that would have happened before we got to the vote today. I made \na pitch and appeal on numerous occasions, but there was not much of an \nappetite for a compromise until now.\n  My hope is we can come to this sooner rather than later. I apologize \nto my colleagues. I apologize to Senator Daschle, who has been \nabsolutely stellar in all of this. I am sure he is going to remind me \nfor years to come, when he asked me how long this bill might take, I \nsaid I thought we could do it in a day. I suspect I will hear that \nstory over and over again for many years to come.\n  We have been on it 2 days. We were on it for 2 days when we were not \nin session, a Friday and a Monday. We did get some work done then. On \nthe Thursday of the week before recess, we were here, and yesterday, \nnow today, so at least 2\\1/2\\ days.\n  My hope is that by later this afternoon, sooner rather than later, we \ncan report a compromise proposal, then the rest of the amendments we \ncan deal with fairly quickly. There will be votes on some. I don't \nanticipate that any one of them, regardless of the outcome, would \nprovoke the kind of situation we are in at this particular juncture.\n  Hope springs eternal, even in February. I am hopeful that before the \nafternoon is out, we can make a favorable report to the Chair and to \nour colleagues that the election reform bill is prepared to move \nforward and get to final passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, today I come to the Senate Chamber to \nstand up for steel. There is a crisis in America's steel industry. The \nnext few weeks will determine the fate and future of that industry and, \nI believe, the fate and future of our steelworkers today and our \nretired steelworkers.\n  I commend President Bush for initiating the section 201 investigation \non steel. That means an investigation by the International Trade \nCommission on whether or not we are facing unfair dumping. I am now \ncalling on the President to impose an effective remedy; that is, a \nremedy of 40-percent tariffs across the board on steel.\n  Since 1997, 31 steel companies have gone bankrupt, putting at risk \nover 62,000 jobs. Why is this? It is exactly what the International \nTrade Commission found: Subsidized foreign steel companies dump their \nexcess products on the United States market at below market prices. \nThey come into the United States and flood us with their imports at \nfire sale prices.\n  In response to this unprecedented crisis, President Bush did take an \nimportant step of initiating an investigation under section 201 of the \ntrade act. The ITC unanimously found that these imports have caused \nserious harm to the American steel industry. Now the President has to \nact before tens of thousands more jobs are lost and retirees face the \nthreat to their pensions and their health care. He must take meaningful \naction, not just some half measure that doesn't meet the challenge of \nthe crisis.\n  Steel is in crisis. Last year, 17 steel companies filed for \nbankruptcy protection, 14 steel mills shut down, and nearly 30,000 \nworkers lost their jobs.\n  Why does steel matter? This is not nostalgia for our industrial past. \nThis is about our national and our economic security.\n  If we are worried about dependence on foreign oil, we should \ncertainly be worried about dependence on foreign steel. We need steel \nto build America, whether it is our bridges or our automobiles, and \nalso for our national security. In my own home State of Maryland, \nBethlehem Steel made the steel plate to repair the U.S.S. Cole. It is \nAmerican steel that is building Navy ships, Navy subs, American planes, \nthe kind of steel we need for those bunker-buster bombs we need.\n  Are we going to rely upon Russia, China, and other countries and be \nsteel dependent? I don't think we should do that.\n  What about our steelworkers and our steelworker retirees? There are \nover 300,000 people currently working as steel and iron workers. There \nare now over 700,000 retirees and surviving spouses. All told, there \nare more than 1 million Americans, both retired and on the job now, who \ndepend on steel for their livelihood, their pension, and their health \ncare.\n  What caused this crisis? Is it because American steel was \ninefficient, because the unions wouldn't cooperate with management, \nbecause we didn't use new technologies or new processes? Absolutely \nnot. The reason American steel is in such dire straits is unfair trade. \nForeign steel companies, subsidized by their government, dump excess \nsteel in our market at those fire sale prices.\n  The United States of America does not have excess capacity. The \nUnited States and Canada have been net importers of steel. If you want \nto look at examples of these subsidies, let me give you one: Russia. \nThis comes from the Bloomberg Business Report. This does not come from \nBarb Mikulski. The Bloomberg Report last week talked about how the \nRussian Government keeps 1,000 unprofitable steel plants open through \nRussian subsidies. That is not 1,000 workers; that is 1,000 steel \nplants. Because of those subsidies, they are able to stay in operation.\n  How can we compete with Russian subsidies where they have comrade \nhealth care, all their health care is paid for, they get subsidies in \nsteel, and at the same time we are expected to compete?\n  What is the solution? We need a level playing field by reducing \nexcess steel capacity abroad.\n  The way we also send them a message to stop the dumping is by \nimposing a 40-percent tariff. That would level the playing field. Half \nmeasures will not do. We need that 40-percent tariff and we need it \nwithout exception. The effects will last much longer than the 3 or 4 \nyears because America's steel industry will have a chance to get back \non its feet.\n  America's steel industry is the best in the world and I can't \nemphasize how competitive we are. It is the most efficient, uses the \nfewest man-hours available per ton, thanks to our steelworkers making \nthe best use of technology and a willingness to cooperate with \nmanagement. It is also the most environmentally sound, producing less \nemissions on steel produced.\n  Do you think those 1,000 Russian steel mills are going to be \nenvironmentally sensitive and OSHA compliant? I don't think so. \nAmerican steel companies have invested over $20 billion in new \ntechnology to achieve these efficiencies. American steelworkers have \nmade painful concessions in wages and benefits so that the industry \nwould be efficient and competitive and would have a future.\n  Madam President, the President must act now. The next few weeks will\n\n[[Page S1237]]\n\ndetermine the fate and future of the steel industry. There is a March 6 \ndeadline for a remedying decision, the tariff decision. The President \nhas the authority. We want him now to have the will. We want him to \nimpose this 40-percent tariff, give American steel mills a future and, \nmost of all, protect the United States of America against dependence on \nforeign steel. Steel built our Nation; steel will continue to build our \nNation, and most of all, steel will help us protect our Nation. Steel \nbuilt America and it is now time that we stand up for steel. I hope we \ncan count on the President to do this, and we thank him for the work he \nhas already done.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to standing with the Presiding \nOfficer as we stand up for steel.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I \nwant to say that she is a leader on this issue. I told her privately \nyesterday that wherever she pointed me to help steel, I would be there. \nI also say it is not often that you find a Senator who works as hard \nprivately as publicly. I have been in a number of private meetings with \nthe Senator from Maryland, where she has been a staunch vocal advocate \nof doing something to help the steelworkers and the steel industry of \nthis country.\n  The people of Maryland should understand the advocacy of this giant \nfrom Maryland who is working so hard for the people who have been so \ngood to America--the steelworkers and the steel industry, generally.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for \nthose gracious and complimentary remarks. This is a man from \nSearchlight, NV. He knows what hard work is because of the way he \npulled himself up by the bootstraps, and he has given opportunity to \nother people. All those people working in the mines in Nevada, who \nevery day have those calloused hands in the end, have a very strong \nadvocate in him. We have to stand up for the ordinary people who do \nextraordinary things in our country. I look forward to working with the \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1237-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, about a week ago I spoke briefly on a \nsubject that falls under the jurisdiction of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and that is referred to as the extenders. This term does not \nmean much to people, but the extenders are tax provisions that expire \nat certain times. For example, at the end of last year one of the tax \nprovisions that expired was the wind energy production tax credit. It \nis a tax credit that was in law to stimulate the development of wind \nenergy in our country.\n  That tax credit expired on December 31 and, at that moment, the \ndevelopment pretty well stopped because the expectation was that the \ncredit would be extended, but it has not been extended. This credit is \none of a handful of extenders that should have been extended at the end \nof last year. The Congress did not do it, because it got connected to \nthe issue of the economic recovery package, and it went back and forth \nbetween the House and the Senate.\n  The fact is, at the end of the day, this tax provision expired and \nwind energy development has pretty well stopped around the country. By \n``wind energy development,'' I mean those developments that were on the \nbooks with plans underway, and ready to be financed and installed \nacross the country.\n  What does this wind energy mean? We are going to take up an energy \nbill as soon as we figure out what to do with the filibuster on the \nelection reform bill, and when we talk about the energy bill in this \ncountry we talk about the need to produce additional energy: more oil, \nmore natural gas, more coal. Yes, we are going to produce more by \ndigging and drilling, and do that in an environmentally acceptable way. \nBut limitless and renewable sources of energy such as ethanol, \nbiodiesel, wind energy, and others, are also a very important part of \nwhat we ought to be doing in this country.\n  Let me focus for a moment on wind energy, because I come from a State \nin which wind energy has great potential. The Department of Energy \nranks the States and their potential for wind energy, and North Dakota \nranks No. 1. We are called the Saudi Arabia of wind for its energy \npotential.\n  North Dakota is a lot of things. Most of all, it is wonderful. It \nranks 50th, dead last, in native forest lands. That means we have less \ntrees than anybody else. But we have a ranking of No. 1 in wind and the \nability to take the energy from the wind, put it in transmission lines, \nand move it around our country to extend America's energy supply.\n  I held a wind energy conference in Grand Forks, ND, last week. Over \n700 people came to the conference from all over the country. They had a \ndisplay of a couple of the types of blades used in the new, very large \nturbines. One of these blades weighs 18,000 pounds.\n  This new technology is highly efficient and, with the small \nproduction tax credit, is also very competitive. We have brought the \nprice of wind energy way down, and now if we extend this wind energy \ntax credit for 5 years, we will be able to unleash the opportunities in \nwind energy development.\n  A CEO of a company came to see me about 2 weeks ago and said his \ncompany has 150 megawatts of wind-generated electricity on the books \nand prepared to build in North Dakota. He told me the company has the \nmoney for it, $130 million to $150 million, the plans complete, but \nthat it cannot move forward until the company knows whether Congress is \ngoing to extend the wind energy production tax credit.\n\n  The fact is, the Congress is messing around back and forth, \nstuttering, and not getting it done. This back and forth between the \nHouse and the Senate means the extenders did not get finished.\n  What does that mean? It means companies that were preparing \ninvestments and were going to be able to build wind energy facilities \nacross this country have now put these plans on hold.\n  Does that make sense for the country? Is that a good energy strategy? \nI do not think so.\n  I am going to be asking unanimous consent, and I will not do it at \nthe moment because I wanted to provide notice to others in the Chamber \nas a matter of courtesy, but I will ask either later today or tomorrow, \nunanimous consent to take up the legislation that I have previously \nintroduced, S. 94. It provides a 5-year extension of the tax credit for \nelectricity produced from wind. I will ask that it be discharged from \nthe Senate Finance Committee and be brought to the floor and voted on.\n  This is not controversial. We have done this before. We should have \ndone it last December but did not. It does not require a big debate. We \nhave had debate after debate on this. It is widely supported by \nvirtually the entire Senate and the entire House, but it does not get \ndone. It is one of these things that runs off the ditch and gets stuck \nthere, and nobody thinks much about it.\n  The problem is we are not producing the energy we could be producing, \nbecause these projects are not being built. As we get people in the \nSenate who ring their hands and gnash their teeth and wipe their brow \nabout America's energy problems, I want everybody to understand that \npart of the solution--just part--to that problem is to build these \nprojects that are ready to go, that can produce and create these new \nhighly efficient wind energy turbines, that can put electricity in our \ntransmission lines and move it around the country.\n  Does anybody remember California and the price spikes, some of the \nother problems we have experienced with energy supply? The fact is, \nthis country needs this new form of energy.\n\n[[Page S1238]]\n\n  I would like to talk for an hour about ethanol, biodiesel, and other \nlimitless and renewable sources of energy. One of the big oil companies \nonce said that ethanol is no good, that it will not work. I saw it in a \nquarter-page ad in a daily newspaper, and I thought, well, if the big \noil companies say this is not any good, it must be something we ought \nto take a closer look at: Taking the alcohol from a kernel of corn--you \nget a drop of alcohol from a kernel of corn--and you still have the \nprotein feedstock left. One can use that alcohol to help contribute to \nAmerica's energy supply. That makes good sense to me. But taking energy \nfrom the wind and running it through a turbine, through blades that \nturn, and then moving the electricity to the transmission lines, makes \neminent good sense.\n  There is no excuse at all for this Congress to twiddle its thumbs \nwhen it ought to extend these production tax credits for wind energy. \nIt ought to be done not next week, not next month, not next year; it \nought to be done now. It ought to be done for 5 years. If we get people \nto come out and say first let's not do it, I say they are not thinking \nmuch about America's energy needs.\n  If they say let's do it for a year, I say it will not matter. It will \nnot mean a thing. That will not provide enough of an incentive for \nanybody to do anything. Let us give people an opportunity to plan, to \ndo the right thing. Let us give people the opportunity and the \nincentive to build, to extend America's energy supplies.\n  I am intending to offer that unanimous consent request either later \ntoday or tomorrow and would want to put people on notice of that.\n  Let me, if I might, read a couple of examples of what has happened \nbecause Congress did not do what it should do. Lonestar Transportation \nof Fort Worth, TX, is losing $1.5 million in revenue per month due to \nthe delay of this production tax credit. Trinity Industries of Dallas, \nTX, a builder of wind turbine towers, has furloughed 200 workers and \nprojects a revenue loss of $7 million a month. MFG, a builder of \nfiberglass turbine blades located in Gainesville, TX, laid off 138 \nskilled workers. Georgia and Texas: CAB, Inc. of Oakwood, GA, and also \nin Texas, that manufactures steel tower components, will see a 50-\npercent reduction in revenues because of failure to extend this. In \nOregon, investment will not be made in a multimillion-dollar wind \nturbine manufacturing facility for Portland. DMI Industries in my State \nof North Dakota, a tower manufacturer in West Fargo, will likely see a \n25-percent decrease in revenues. The company currently employs 165 \npeople and was planning to hire an additional 50. They will not be able \nto do that at this point. LM Glasfiber, a wind turbine blade \nmanufacturer in Grand Forks, has furloughed 30 percent of its 100 \nemployees because of failure to extend the tax credit. In Louisiana, \nBeaird Industries of Shreveport, LA, a builder of metal towers for wind \nturbines, furloughed 150 of its 500 employees just before Christmas. \nZond Wind Turbines in California near Bakersfield furloughed 85 skilled \nworkers. In West Virginia, Atlantic Renewable Energy Corporation will \nindefinitely delay a $65 million investment in its Backbone Mountain \nsite in Tucker County. That is 150 construction jobs. M.A. Mortenson \nCompany of Minneapolis, MN, that designs and builds wind tower projects \nthroughout the United States, will hold off creating 150 direct \nconstruction jobs and 450 subcontractor jobs without the extension.\n  The list goes on.

Madam President, I will respond briefly to my good \nfriend, Senator Dorgan. I totally agree with his concept that we should \npursue ethanol and wind and all alternative sources of energy. We will \nneed them. There is absolutely no question. We need all the energy we \ncan produce in this country.\n\n[[Page S1239]]\n\n  The good news is the energy bill has been laid down. I hope we can \nstart on this relatively soon. Clearly, we have to get the pending \nbusiness resolved. I will discuss the foundation we begin with. It is a \ndeparture from the traditions of this body. It is unfortunate the \nmajority leader has seen fit to mandate a procedure that is clearly \ncontrary to the traditions of the process associated with the \ncommittees of jurisdiction. I am referring specifically, as former \nchairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and now the \nranking member, to the manner in which the majority leader saw fit to \ncircumvent the responsibilities of the committee of jurisdiction.\n  My good friend, the chairman, Senator Bingaman, and I have worked \ntogether for some time. We have had a good relationship. Our theory was \nwe would attempt to develop from the committee process a comprehensive \nenergy bill. When I was chairman, we had hearings, we had input, and we \nintroduced a bill. However, as we all are aware, there was a change in \nJune. As a consequence, the Republicans lost control of the Senate and \nhence lost control of the agenda of the committee process.\n  Prior to the changeover, we had had several discussions in the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee on various issues associated with the \nproposed energy legislation. This came about as a consequence of our \nPresident laying down as one of his prerequisites a mandate that \nCongress address an energy bill and do it with dispatch. The House has \ndone its job in H.R. 4. So it became the responsibility of the Senate \nto take up a comprehensive energy bill.\n\n  What happened in the process deserves enlightenment. This is what I \nspecifically object to. On the issue of ANWR, we had enough bipartisan \nvotes to report out a bill containing ANWR. The leader knew this. As a \nconsequence, in order to circumvent this process, the terminology I \nthink that was used was to alleviate any differences of opinion in the \nprocess. However, that is what this body is all about, differences of \nopinion in coming together on a consensus. Nonetheless, the leader \nprevailed and ordered the chairman, Senator Bingaman, not to hold any \nmarkups on the bill. That precluded the committee from pursuing a \nprocess of taking up a bill, proceeding with amendments in the ordinary \nworkings of the committee process, and voting out and bringing to the \nfloor a comprehensive bill.\n  I can only assume the leader did this as a parliamentary maneuver to \nensure we would not get a vote in committee on ANWR, where he clearly \nknew we had the votes to get it out. I hope every Senator in this body \nconsiders the precedent this action sets, particularly those Senators \nwho value the traditions and open debate concept associated with this \nbody. This is a departure. This is almost a dictate from the majority \nleader who simply says we are not going to allow the committee of \njurisdiction to take up the bill and vote it out and bring it to the \nfloor.\n  That prevailed, and we have a situation where we are about to start \ndebate on a very complex bill that has not gone through the committee \nprocess. What does this mean? This means every Member will be subjected \nto some very complex issues, those particularly associated with the \nelectricity portion. They are not going to understand the terminology \nbecause it didn't go through the committee. There will be a lot of \ninterest on behalf of various lobbyists who have different points of \nview relative to certain aspects, aspects that have never had a \nhearing, never had an opportunity for Members to express their views, \nlet alone vote it out.\n  I am very irate as a consequence of this circumvention of our \nresponsibility, and I think every Senator should be. We should put \npolitics aside and reflect on the traditions of this body which dictate \nthis is not the way this body traditionally does business.\n  Sure, the majority leader can initiate an action and go around the \ncommittee process, but is that the tradition of the Senate? Is that the \ntradition to circumvent the committees and the amendment process by \nsubjecting this body now to a bill while it has not had hearings on \nmany of the portions that are very complex?\n  I know how the majority leader feels about ANWR, but I add one more \nobservation. He has indicated if ANWR stays in the bill, he will pull \nthe bill. That means regardless of how the Senate prevails in a \ndemocratic process, he will take the initiative to see that it will not \nhappen. He has circumvented the committee process which requires--\ninstead of 51 votes--60 votes, on cloture, which he would, of course, \nfile. Then he says if you get 60 votes, you are going to lose because \nhe is going to pull the bill.\n  I don't care what the issue is, but I suggest this is a poor way to \ndo business. The Senate should reflect on just what is happening and \nwhether we can support a leader who dictatorially initiates an action \nof this type. I know it makes many members of the committees feel \nsomewhat at a loss: What are we here for if we are not here to conduct \ncommittee business in the course of our responsibility?\n  As we start to consider this bill, we should continue to reflect on \nhow we got there. We got there without a committee process. We got \nthere as a consequence of the majority leader taking the authority away \nfrom the committee. We got a bill before the Senate that has not had a \nmarkup, it has not had individual hearings, and many of the portions of \nthe bill, we are told, if we prevail on one, particularly the lightning \nrod of ANWR, we will lose anyway because he will pull the bill. I just \nwant all parties to know that I object, and I know a number of my \ncolleagues do, to this type of procedure.\n\n  I want to refer to a couple of other points that I think are germane \nto the debate which is going to take place.\n  For some time now we have been dependent on imported oil from Iraq. \nAs a matter of fact, on September 11 we were importing a little over 1 \nmillion barrels a day from that nation. We are enforcing a no-fly zone \nover that nation. We are putting the lives of our young men and women \nat risk enforcing that no-fly zone. Yet we are buying oil. It is almost \nas if we take the oil, put it in our airplanes, and go take out his \ntargets.\n  What does he do with the money he receives from the United States? He \nkeeps his Republican Guard well fed. That keeps him alive. What else \ndoes he do? He develops a missile capability, a delivery capability, \nbiological capability, and perhaps aimed at our ally, Israel.\n  That is the fact associated with the vulnerability of this country as \nwe increase our dependence on imported oil. We are about 58 percent \ndependent, and it is increasing. The Department of Energy says it is \ngoing to be up to 63 percent or 64 percent in the year 2006. What does \nthat do to the vulnerability of the United States? It means we become \nmore dependent on Iraq.\n  What about Saudi Arabia? When we look at the terrorist activities in \nNew York, we find most of the passports are from Saudi Arabia. It is a \nvery unstable area, and we are becoming more and more dependent. Is it \nnot in our national interest to reduce our dependence? The answer is \nclearly yes.\n  Let me reflect on one more thing. We have not had an inspector in \nIraq in several years, under the U.N. agreement. We don't know what \nIraq is up to. But as we reflect on the terrors and tragedies that have \nalready occurred in this Nation, we recognize we should have acted \nsooner. We knew who bin Laden was. We knew about al-Qaida. Yet we did \nnot act, and we know the consequences. The consequences became evident \non September 11.\n  What day of reckoning is going to come when we have to face what \nSaddam Hussein has been up to? Will it be after the fact or will we \nmandate that our inspectors go in there and address this threat now? I \nknow what my recommendation would be. It is better sooner than later; \nsooner to take out the terrorism risks associated with Saddam Hussein.\n  I know this is something the administration is agonizing about and \nwill be critical if, indeed, there is some action and we will not have \ntaken action.\n  This is what this issue is all about. It is about the national \nsecurity of this country and our increased dependence. I do not know \nhow many of my colleagues remember 1973-1974, the Yom Kippur War. Some \nof us are old enough to remember we had gas lines around the block. The \npublic was outraged, they were inconvenienced.\n  What was the result of that? We were 37 percent dependent on imported \noil at\n\n[[Page S1240]]\n\nthat time. Now we are 58 percent dependent. You figure it out. It is \npretty easy. Our vulnerability has increased. Make no mistake about it, \nwith the unrest in the Mideast we are going to have a crisis. I can \ntell you, every Member of this body will be standing in line behind me \nto open up ANWR. They will say we have to increase our domestic \nproduction.\n  What is this bill anyway? Partially, as I have indicated, it is a \nbill in the national security interests of our country. I ask my \ncolleagues, are they going to stand behind the environmental lobby, \nthat has used this as a cash cow for membership and dollars? There is \nno evidence to suggest we can't open this area safely. This is my \nState. We support opening ANWR. We were there when the arguments in the \n1960s were prevailing against opening Prudhoe Bay and building an 800-\nmile pipeline.\n\n  Let me tell you what that has done. That has provided this Nation, \nfor several years--it has been operating 27 years--for several years \nwith 25 percent of the total crude oil produced in this country. That \nwas about 2 million barrels a day. Today it is a little over 1 million \nbarrels, a little over 20 percent.\n  Where was that issue in the 1960s? That issue was before the Senate. \nIt was a tie vote. The Vice President broke the tie, and it passed by \none vote. That is how close it was. Where would we have been if we had \nnot done that? Instead of 58 percent, we would probably be somewhere in \nthe area of 68 percent dependent on imported oil.\n  What were the arguments then? You are going to build an 800-mile \npipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. It is going to be like a fence \nacross Alaska, and the caribou and the moose are not going to cross it. \nIt is going to have a terrible effect on the environment. You are \nputting a hot pipeline in permafrost, and when the hot pipeline melts \nthe permafrost, it is going to break.\n  It has been there 27 years, one of the construction wonders of the \nworld. All the doomsayers' arguments then are the same arguments now: \nYou can't do it safely; you can't protect the caribou.\n  They are all false. Go up to Prudhoe Bay and you find the caribou \nherd is 27,000. It was 3,000 or 4,000 in the late 1960s.\n  Talk about polar bear habitat--you can't shoot a polar bear in the \nUnited States, and Alaska is part of the United States. You can in \nRussia. You can in Canada.\n  So as we reflect upon what we are about to embark, I encourage my \ncolleagues and you, Madam President, to reflect on the prevailing \narguments that were used 27 years ago and the prevailing arguments that \nwe are using now. As I indicated, the argument then was a hot pipeline \nthrough permafrost; it was a fence across Alaska; it was whether or not \nwe could do it safely; it was the caribou herd--all of which history \nhas proven we have been able to do. We have overcome the problems and \nresponsively addressed them.\n  One can go up to Prudhoe Bay and get off the airplane and walk over \nto where the pickups are. Do you know what you see under every single \npickup? You see a diaper. It is under the pan of the car. It is a big \ncotton thing to pick up a drop of oil that spills. As you know, in your \nown driveway you get drops of oil. That is the extent they go to, to \ntry to maintain the maximum environmental oversight.\n  As we address this ANWR issue, keep in mind the arguments of those \nopposed to it. They say it is a 6-month supply of oil. We all know that \nis only if you didn't have any oil produced in this country or any oil \nimported into this country. To what does it equate? We don't really \nknow, but the latest USGS reports say 5.6 billion to 16 billion \nbarrels. How does that compare with anything you and I can understand? \nYou can compare it with what Prudhoe Bay has produced in 27 years. \nPrudhoe Bay was supposed to produce 10 billion barrels. It is on its 13 \nbillionth barrel now. If you took half of the range of ANWR, 5.6 and \n16, and said it was 10, it would be as big as Prudhoe Bay.\n  The infrastructure is already in place. You have a pipeline 800 miles \nlong that is only half full. This is not a big issue, in the sense of \nreality. Yes, it is a significant amount of oil, if it is 10 billion \nbarrels. If it is 16, it is even better. But if it is 3.5, you will not \neven develop it because you have to have a major discovery in order to \ndevelop in the higher Arctic altitudes associated with drilling in that \npart of the world.\n  It is either there in abundance--and it has to be to make a \ndifference--or it isn't. They say it will take 10 years. Come on. If \nPresident Clinton had not vetoed the bill in 1995, it would be on line \nnow. He vetoed it. Why? Same response: The environmental community \npressured. The cash cow generates membership, it generates dollars. And \nthey are milking it for all it is worth, and will continue until we \nprevail. Then they will go on to another issue.\n  What about the Porcupine caribou? We have already addressed that with \nthe caribou comparison in Prudhoe Bay, where they have flourished. As I \nindicated before, it was a short break.\n  We don't shoot polar bear. You can't take trophy polar bear in \nAlaska. They are marine mammals, they are protected. If you want to \nprotect the animals, you don't shoot them; you don't take them for \nfood, or subsistence. There are very few taken for subsistence, I might \nadd.\n  These are some of the arguments we are going to be addressing.\n  Furthermore, this is a big jobs bill. Find an issue that employs \n250,000 people. These are high-paying jobs. That is why the unions \nsupport it. It will generate somewhere in the area of $2.5 billion in \nFederal lease sales because these are Federal leases that will come \nback into the Treasury. It won't cost the taxpayers one red cent. Find \na better stimulus.\n  What about the veterans in this country? They are for it because they \ndo not want to fight another war in a foreign country over oil.\n  I am always reminded of my good friend, Mark Hatfield. He is a \npacifist who said before this body time and time again, I will vote for \nopening this area any day rather than send a young man or woman \noverseas to fight in a war over oil in a foreign land.\n  We talk about alternative energy. I indicated that I support it. But \nlet me tell you about a little comparison. I have some graphs that will \nshow this. One of the largest wind farms in the United States is \nlocated outside of Palms Springs. It is between Palm Springs and \nBanning, CA. I think it is called San Jacinto. That farm has hundreds \nof windmills that move when the wind blows. They do not move all the \ntime. The footprint there is 1,500 acres. You see it and you say: Wow, \nthere are a lot of windmills there.\n  What is the equivalent of that in oil production? That would be \nequivalent to 1,350 barrels of oil a day from 1,500 acres. What is \nANWR? ANWR is 2,000 acres. The equivalent production is 1 million \nbarrels a day. I support wind power, but if you are looking for relief, \nyou had better put it in an equation that makes sense and that people \ncan understand. From 1,500 acres, the equivalent from that wind farm is \n1,350 barrels of oil. ANWR's footprint as authorized in the House bill \nis 2,000 acres. That is equivalent to 1 million barrels per day.\n  Let us remember the bottom line--our national security. What could \nthis do for the U.S. steel industry? When we built that 800-mile \npipeline, do you know what the U.S. steel industry did? This was the \nlargest order ever in the United States--800 miles of 48-inch pipe. \nThey did absolutely nothing. They said: We don't have the capacity for \nan order that big. Where did it come from? It came from Korea, it came \nfrom Japan, and it came from Italy. If the steel unions and the steel \nindustry want to get their act together, let us go after some domestic \nbusiness. You will have some more domestic business associated with \nopening up ANWR.\n  I encourage my colleagues again to reflect a little bit. I hope \neverybody's conscience bothers them about the manner in which this was \nlaid down, without a committee process and without the jurisdiction of \nthe Democratic chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nThe leadership pulled it out of the committee because he knew we had \nthe votes to get it to the floor and, furthermore, the dictatorial \nstatement that even if we prevail, he is going to pull the bill. Come \non. I have been around this place long enough to know what the \ndemocratic process is all about, the committee process is all about, \nand the traditions of the Senate are all about. This is the wrong way \nto start a bill.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S1241]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If Members have already submitted \namendments, then it is not necessary to resubmit an amendment.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend Senators Dodd, McConnell, Schumer, and Bond for their \ndedication and diligence in addressing what I believe to be an issue of \ncritical importance to our country--protecting voting rights and \nensuring the integrity of the electoral system in our nation. \nEspecially given the events in the world today, making certain that \neach citizen's vote is counted and promoting public trust and \nconfidence in our election process is crucial.\n  The State of Washington has a long and trusted history as a leader in \nelection administration. Through great efforts and cooperation, the \nstate has pioneered such programs as motor voter, provisional \nballoting, vote by mail, and absentee voting.\n  I thank Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Rules Committee for his \nsupport for an amendment that I offered with Senator Murray's support \nthat has been adopted. The amendment guarantees that States are able to \ncontinue using mail-in voting, while also providing new safeguards to \nmake mail-in voters aware of how to properly fill out their ballots, \nand how, if needed to obtain a replacement.\n  Voters in my State are proud of our system that offers voters the \noption of voting by mail or in the polling place, and they are \nextremely committed to seeing it continue. The mail-in ballot, in my \nopinion, offers voters several advantages. First, it allows voters to \ncast their ballots on their own time and at their own convenience. It \nalso allows voters to make more informed choices, as they are able to \nconsult literature sent by the state and by the campaigns in making \ntheir decisions. Because these votes are cast without the pressure of \nother voters waiting in line, or without the time crunch of being late \nto work or to pick up the kids, voters are also less likely to make \nmistakes that will disqualify their ballots.\n  In addition, the mail-in system is very secure. Each ballot that is \ncast by mail requires, that the voter sign the outer envelope. This \nsignature is then checked against the voters signature that is kept on \nfile and only when there is agreement that the signatures match is the \nballot counted. Washington State has consistently increased the number \nof voters choosing to vote by mail and through provisional voting \nwithout any allegations that these types of voting have involved fraud \nor other misconduct. In fact, the procedures in place have consistently \nensured the integrity and security of our elections and led to public \nconfidence in our system that is unparalleled anywhere in the country.\n  It has not always been this way. In the early 1990s, we had several \nclose elections that pointed out the vulnerabilities in our system. \nThese close elections led Washington to become one of the first states \nto adopt statewide guidelines that ensured that each jurisdiction \nfollowed the same rules in determining how ballots are verified and \ncounted. In addition, my State also adopted other requirements for \ntesting and procedural consistency. It is my hope that this legislation \nwill lead other States to follow our example and institute similar \nguidelines and procedures that will result in more people voting and \nmaking sure that all votes are properly cast and counted.\n  Our challenge, at the federal level, is to ensure that in passing \nlegislation that reduces hurdles to civic participation across in \ncountry, we respect the role of the States in selecting types of voting \nthat work well for their citizens and lead to maximum participation. I \nbelieve that this bill as amended does that, and I thank the chairman \nof the Rules Committee for his commitment to this bill and to ensuring \nthat States have the flexibility to keep their systems in place.\n  This bill, by setting minimum standards and by guaranteeing the \nFederal Government will provide the funds necessary to purchase new \nequipment, takes very important steps forward in guaranteeing to every \nAmerican that not only do they have the right to vote, but that when \nthey cast their vote it will be counted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1241-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I would like to report briefly on a trip \nto Latin America which I made last month before the Senate went into \nsession in January.\n  This trip took me to a number of Latin American countries to discuss \nissues of trade and drug control. The\n\n[[Page S1242]]\n\nfirst stop was in Havana, Cuba, where I had an opportunity to talk to \nPresident Fidel Castro about the serious situation in Cuba on the \ndeprivation of human rights, and about the failure in Cuba to have \ncontested elections. I urged President Castro to run in a contested \nelection.\n  I had the opportunity to meet with President Castro about 30 months \nearlier in June of the year of 1999 and made the same points to him. \nHowever, emphatically, again, when I challenged President Castro to run \nagainst someone in a contested election, he told me he did have an \nopponent. His opponent was the United States of America. He said this \nin more of a humorous way. The United States policy toward Cuba, I \nthink, has tended to make, if not quite a martyr, at least a \nsympathetic person in President Castro.\n  We talked about a great many things. With my background as assistant \ncounsel of the Warren Commission, I asked President Castro if there was \nany connection between Lee Harvey Oswald and Cuba. There had been \nrumors at the time that Castro and Cuban officials may have put Oswald \nup to the assassination of President Kennedy. Those rumors were based \nupon the CIA efforts to assassinate Castro in that era. Oswald was a \npart of the Fair Play for Cuba Committee, which had a rally in New \nOrleans. When I asked that of President Castro, he said he was not \nresponsible for Oswald. He was a Marxist, and not a madman. We talked \nin some detail about the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and why Castro \npermitted the Soviets to have missiles in Cuba. He tried to defend \nthat, I think unpersuasively, with the threats to himself from the Bay \nof Pigs invasion and the CIA assassination attempts.\n  Before going to see him 30 months ago, I checked with the records of \nthe Church Committee, and found, in fact, that there was evidence about \nefforts to assassinate Castro--maybe 8 or 9 such attempts. When I told \nCastro that number, he laughed, and said that there had been many, many \nmore attempts than that--something in the 300 range. I asked him how it \nfelt to be the subject of assassination attempts.\n  He said: Muy bien.\n  This is Spanish for ``very good.''\n  I said: No, no. How did it really feel when they were trying to \nassassinate you?\n  Again, he said: Muy bien.\n  I said: No. How did it really feel?\n  He said: Do you have a sport?\n  I said: Yes. My sport is squash.\n  He said, through the interpreter: Well, avoiding assassination is a \nsport for me.\n  I talked to Castro in some detail about his willingness to have Cuban \nairspace and Cuban waters used by the United States to detect drug \ntrafficking. Toward that end, I offered an amendment to the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations bill a year and a half ago, which was \ndefeated in conference. I offered a milder bill this year which was \naccepted, calling for a report from the State Department. However, when \nCastro makes an offer to allow Cuban waters and Cuban airspace to \ninterdict drug traffickers, that is an offer we ought to accept. Drugs \nare polluting a generation of Americans and they are a major cause of \nstreet crime in America, which is something that I fought against as \nDistrict Attorney of Philadelphia. If we can stop the flow of drugs \nwith Castro's assistance, we ought to take him up on that offer.\n  There have been some changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba. The House of \nRepresentatives submitted a bill with a provision to ease travel \nrestrictions, which was dropped in conference. It is my view that it is \na very small step which ought to be uncontested.\n  We then traveled to other Latin American countries. We were in \nArgentina, where it is well-known that there is a tremendous financial \ncrisis. Argentina has lived beyond its means. They have the inability \nto pay major suppliers, after having talked to major U.S. firms, such \nas Exxon-Mobil, IBM, and General Motors. They cannot withdraw money \nfrom their bank accounts to pay their suppliers. The International \nMonetary Fund is working on the matter.\n  It would be my hope that the United States would provide some \nleadership and some expertise to try to bring Argentina out of this \neconomic crisis. I think a good bit of the record from the United \nStates and the International Monetary Fund has been too harsh. I think \nwe can make our point without language which borders on arrogance or \nborders on insults because Argentina is a very important country in \nLatin America.\n  One of the problems with Latin America is the frequency of the \ndictatorships, such as Juan Peron in Argentina, as well as those in \nChile and Brazil. It is just a way of life there. Trade with the United \nStates, I think, is very important to promote democracy.\n  In Peru there was great concern regarding the trade agreement with \nthe United States that had lapsed in December. It is my hope that this \ntrade bill will be acted upon by the Congress at an early date.\n  In Chile they are waiting for a trade bill to be enacted, with some \nten rounds of negotiations. The President of Chile is willing to have \nan agreement, even if it is not fast tracked, and even if there would \nbe amendments offered on the floor of the Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In Uruguay we met with the distinguished President Jorge Batlle. We \nhave a very distinguished U.S. Ambassador there, Martin Silverstein, a \nPennsylvanian. We took a look at the coastline, with the attractive \napartment houses in Montevideo. Uruguay is quite a contrast to the \nbarren coastline of Havana, Cuba, showing what free enterprise and \ndemocracy can do if it is permitted to operate.\n  Mr. President, I would just like to add another comment or two about \nBrazil, where we met with the equivalent of our National Security \nAdviser. There is a little area where Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina \nmeet where there are supporters of Hezbollah posing quite a threat to \nthat area. In Buenos Aires, we met at the Jewish Community Center with \nleading Jewish officials there and were told, in detail, about the \nbombing of the Jewish Community Center in 1994 and the attack on the \nIsraeli Embassy. I was pleased to note that the Brazilian officials are \nlooking into this issue as to the potential terrorist activity arising \nout of this group in that little section where Paraguay, Brazil, and \nArgentina meet.\n  On January 2, 2002, we arrived in Havana, Cuba for two days of \nmeetings with human rights activists, religious leaders, medical \nresearchers, our U.S. country team, and President Fidel Castro. When we \narrived in Cuba, we were met by the U.S. country team, who briefed us \non the current situation in Cuba.\n  We began by meeting with a delegation of human rights activists, all \nof whom had been jailed during the Castro regime on various charges. \nWhen asked why he was jailed, one of the dissidents, Oswaldo Paya \nSardinas, President of the Christian Liberation Movement, expressed the \ngeneral sentiment of the group that he was jailed for the anti-Castro \nopinions he publicly expressed. When I asked them their opinion on the \nembargo, the group of Cuban dissidents was split on the advisability of \ncontinuing the U.S. embargo with Cuba.\n  Next we traveled to the Finlay Institute in Havana, a research center \ndedicated to the development and testing of vaccines. Our briefing on \nthe Finlay Institute's work was conducted by a team of researchers \nincluding Dr. Concepcion Campa, Director of the Institute and leader of \nthe team that developed the vaccine for meningitis B. Supported \nentirely by the Cuban government, the Finlay Institute, which I had \npreviously visited in June 1999, is one of the forty-five biotechnology \nfacilities supported by government funds. The Cuban government has \ndemonstrated a commitment to medical research and cooperative \nagreements, such as the one the Finlay Institute entered into with \nGlaxoSmithKline in 1999, licensed by the U.S. Treasury Department. This \nagreement represents a positive and productive relationship with this \nostracized nation.\n  The next morning we met with a delegation of Cuban officials, \nincluding the Minister of Justice Roberto Sotolongo and Oliverio \nMontalvo, the Drug Enforcement Chief. Minister Sotolongo responded to \nmy question regarding the advisability of cooperation between the U.S. \nand Cuba on the drug issues with his hope that the issue not be \npoliticized. He further stated that exchanges of information between \nthe U.S. and Cuba could net real results in preventing drugs from \nentering\n\n[[Page S1243]]\n\nthe U.S. through this region. The Ministers wanted us to know that Cuba \nis actively involved in intercepting and destroying contraband found in \nCuban waters en route to the U.S. and elsewhere.\n  Minister Sotolongo detailed the 1996 incident involving the Limerick, \na successful joint U.S.-Cuba drug interdiction operation. The Limerick, \ncarrying 6.5 tons of cocaine drifted into Cuban waters and was \nimpounded. All the evidence was turned over to the United States, and \nthose involved were tried and convicted in a court with the \nparticipation of Cuban officials.\n  Our time in Cuba concluded with a meeting with President Fidel \nCastro, which lasted six and one-half hours. Many issues were \ndiscussed, including our earlier meeting with the dissidents. President \nCastro did not directly respond to the merits of the dissidents' \nissues, but chose instead to reprimand our congressional delegation for \nholding meetings independent of the schedule that his functionaries had \nin mind for us. We flatly rejected his objection.\n  Our conversation with President Castro began with a wide-ranging \ndiscussion on drug interdiction. President Castro suggested a formal \nrelationship with the U.S. in order to make progress on drug \ninterdiction efforts in the area. This was a suggestion made to me by \nGeneral Barry McCaffrey, former head of U.S. drug policy in the \nprevious administration. When asked if he wanted the embargo against \nCuba lifted, President Castro responded, ``Can you doubt that?''\n  We spoke of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks on America and \nPresident Castro was asked to condemn Osama bin Laden. While making \ngeneral statements against terrorism, President Castro would not \ncondemn bin Laden, feigning a lack of evidence in his possession to \nmake such a condemnation. The President also offered that he had not \nheard of Osama bin Laden prior to September 11, 2001 incidents and \nclosed our meeting with a call for a bilateral agreement with Cuba to \nfight terrorism.\n  As we arrived in Cuba, the United States' decision to transfer \ndetainees from Afghanistan to Guantanamo Bay was being announced \npublicly. President Castro had issued a press release saying that the \nGovernment of Cuba had too little information to comment on the U.S. \nplan to use Guantanamo Bay for Afghan detainees. At the news conference \non January 4, 2002, before our departure, I was asked about the issue \nand said that my apprisal was that President Castro was not going to \nobject to the U.S. plan to use Guantanamo Bay because if he had an \nobjection, he would have already expressed it. My meetings with \nPresident Castro, religious leaders, human rights activists, and \nmedical researchers lead me to believe that we must continue to support \nand expand our people-to-people relationships with Cuba. There are many \nareas of mutual concern between our two countries, including drug \ninterdiction and medical research.\n  On January 4, 2002, Senator Chafee and I traveled to Lima, Peru and \nwere met by Ambassador John Hamilton. Our meeting with President \nAlejandro Toledo included Foreign Minister Diego Garcia Sayan, First \nVice President and Minister of Industry and Trade Raul Diez Canseco, \nTrade Vice Minister Alfredo Ferrero, and drug czar Ricardo Vega Llona. \nWe first exchanged welcoming statements and our expressions of sympathy \nto Peru for the tragedy that took place just a week before our arrival \nin downtown Lima. A fire, stemming from fireworks, had set ablaze a \nshopping district and killed over 250, according to reports at that \ntime.\n\n  The President made clear his desire for a renewed and expanded Andean \nTrade Preference Act (ATPA) and for continued assistance in combating \nthe drug trade. President Toledo expressed concern that the trade \nagreement between the United States and Peru had lapsed on December 4, \n2001, and urged that the Congress give it prompt consideration. He said \nthat Peruvian farmers would be tempted to grow products for drug \nproduction instead of textile production, if the agreement was not \nextended. I told him I would urge prompt consideration by the Congress. \nThe President and Ministers made the case that eliminating the coca \ntrade in Peru is essential to combat terrorism, and spoke strongly to \nthe elimination of the narco-terrorism as a ``matter of national \nsecurity.'' With regards to the general state of the Peruvian economy, \nthe President reported that they were coming off of three years of \nlittle or no growth, further reporting that the Peruvian economy is \naffected by the overall world economy. Senator Chafee and I were \nfurther debriefed on the state of the Peruvian economy by the Minister \nof Economy and Finance Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.\n  The President further described his ``full commitment'' to reform of \nthe Peruvian judicial system. In a separate meeting, I queried the drug \nczar and his colleagues further on the progress of the drug war in Peru \nand the region. There was general agreement with my point that progress \nis difficult without a reduction in the demand for drugs. Meeting \nparticipants reiterated the need for the Andean anti-drug plan, which \noffers increased intelligence sharing, regional air coverage, and \nmaritime cooperation among the Andean nations. Further, it was \nemphasized that an alternative crop or industry to drug crops was \nessential for local farmers.\n  From Lima, Peru, Senator Chafee and I traveled to Santiago, Chile on \nJanuary 6, 2002. After our meeting with President Ricardo Lagos, I \nwrote a letter to President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill \nexpressing President Lagos' strong support for the U.S.-Chile Bilateral \nFree Trade Agreement (FTA) without linkage to passage by the U.S. \nCongress of trade promotion authority. President Lagos expressed his \nconcern that ongoing congressional negotiations with the White House \nregarding trade promotion authority may further delay consideration of \nthe Bilateral FTA with Chile. The President further stated that Chile \nwants ``trade not aid.''\n  Additional topics discussed included the potential F-16 sale to \nChile, as well as the Pinochet and Letelier/Moffit cases. On December \n27, 2000, the Chilean Ministry of Defense announced that the Government \nof Chile had authorized the Chilean Air Force to initiate discussions \non the purchase of ten Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcons, Block 50, \nfrom the United States. The F-16 was chosen over the French Mirage and \nthe Swedish Gripen on its merits in a competitive, transparent \nselection process.\n  Regarding the Letelier/Moffit case, which involved the 1976 car bomb \nmurder in Washington, D.C. of former Chilean Ambassador the U.S. \nOrlando Letelier and his American citizen assistant, Ronnie Moffit. I \ntold the President that the jail sentences of six, seven, and eight \nyears, which were given to those involved in this terrorist act on U.S. \nsoil, were not sufficient in my opinion and asked his opinion on the \nextradition of those individuals to the U.S. for trial. President Lagos \nresponded that he cannot take a position that would appear to pressure \nthe Court, but that his impression was such that the Court, on its own, \nmight well order extradition.\n  Concerning counter-terrorism and the events of September 11, 2001, \nthe President expressed strong condemnation of the terrorist attacks. \nThis expression is in keeping the Lagos Administration's action \nimmediately following the terrorist attacks in the U.S. As head of the \nRIO Group of Latin American countries in 2001, Chile leads the \ncoordinated counter-terrorism efforts for the Group.\n  On January 8, 2002, Senator Chafee and I arrived in Buenos Aires, \nArgentina, just one week after the latest President was installed \nduring this tumultuous time in that country. Newly-installed President \nEduardo Duhalde, the fifth president in thirteen days, is confronted \nwith a bankrupt government and a citizenry deeply dispirited after four \nyears of a worsening economy and recent political instability. It is \nunclear at this time if this administration is capable, or willing, to \nput together a viable long-term economic plan to pull Argentina out of \nits very serious economic situation.\n  President Duhalde told us that his administration would have a new \nbudget passed within fifteen days with a plan to retire his country's \nindustrial debt, which could then justify further aid from the \nInternational Monetary Fund. Corporate representatives from Bank of \nBoston, General Motors, IBM, and ESSO detailed the extremely difficult \nbusiness environment, including\n\n[[Page S1244]]\n\na freeze of all bank that precluded the paying of suppliers and \nsubcontractors. This issue, along with the ongoing currency crises, \nmade for an extremely precarious business environment as described by \nthe executives.\n\n  Senator Chafee and I visited the Jewish Community Center and the site \nof a 1994 terrorist attack that killed eighty-four people. Upon our \narrival to the Community Center, it was explained to us that the line \nin front of the building was persons visiting the visa office applying \nfor travel to Israel as an escape from the Argentine economic \nsituation.\n  On January 10, 2002, Senator Chafee and I proceeded next to \nMontevideo, Uruguay for meetings with President Jorge Batlle and the \nChief of Staff and National Drug and Anti-Terrorism Coordinator \nLeonardo Costa. We were accompanied by Ambassador Martin Silverstein, a \nPennsylvanian, who is serving with distinction.\n  We met with President Batlle for over one and one-half hours \ndiscussing Argentina, International Patent Rights (IPR), free trade \nissues, and narcotics. Regarding the Argentine economic crisis, the \nPresident was generally optimistic, providing that the new government \nfollows the programs of the newly-installed Economic Minister Jorge \nLenikov. President Batlle stated that President Duhalde appeared to \nhave a strong majority within the Parliament.\n  On International Patent Rights, the President expressed disagreement \nwith the U.S. Government's approach to IPR legislation. While he favors \ndrug legalization, he would not implement such a policy without an \ninternational consensus. I took the opportunity to praise the \nPresident's support for Free Trade Area of the Americas and free trade, \npointing out that this seemed to contrast with the government's \nunwillingness to enact a strong copyright bill, which is an essential \ntool for attracting investment.\n  On January 11, 2001, we traveled to Brasilia, Brazil where our first \nmeeting was with representatives from the Brazilian Ministry of Health \nto discuss the government's response to HIV and AIDS. A comprehensive \npresentation by Claudio Duarte da Fonseca and Rosemeire Munhoz with the \nHealth Ministry detailed Brazil's national response to their growing \nnumbers of HIV and AIDS cases. Governmental lead efforts include \nprevention campaigns, mass media campaigns, behavioral interventions, \ncondom distribution, and a policy of universal and free-of-charge \naccess to ARV drugs.\n  Our meeting with General Alberto Cardoso, the counterpart to our \nNational Security Adviser, provided assurances of cooperation from his \ncountry with the U.S. and Israel efforts to oppose financing of \nHezbollah terrorism from an enclave at the border of Paraguay, \nArgentina, and Brazil. There was no reason to believe that support has \ncome from residents of that area for the bombing of the Israeli Embassy \nin Argentina in 1992 and the Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires in \n1994. With the worldwide focus on cutting off terrorist funding, the \ntri-border area is under international scrutiny.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, as we near the end of Black \nHistory Month, to focus attention on the widening gap between those \nAmericans who use or have access to telecommunications technologies, \nlike computers and the Internet, and those who do not. Surprisingly, \nthere are those naysayers who suggest that the ``digital divide'' does \nnot exist, that it is a myth or fabrication of consumer and civil \nrights advocates. Perhaps it is because the term ``digital divide'' has \nbeen so over-used and, in some instances, mis-used that it causes some \nto doubt its existence. Perhaps the term has so thoroughly infiltrated \nour everyday discourse that it causes skeptics to under-estimate its \nvery real and powerful consequences.\n  No matter the reason for these naysayers' doubt, the unequivocal \nanswer to their question ``is there really a digital divide'' is a \nresounding ``YES.'' A series of reports issued by the U.S. Department \nof Commerce not only confirms that the ``digital divide'' exists; it \nsuggests that, while the number of Americans accessing the Internet has \ngrown rapidly in recent years, the technology gap between poor and \nminority communities, on one hand, and other Americans, on the other, \nis actually widening.\n  Take this seemingly encouraging example: from December 1998 to August \n2000, the percentage of African-American households with Internet \naccess more than doubled, from 11.2 percent to 23.5 percent--an \nencouraging development, by any measure. But during that same time \nperiod, the percentage of total households nationally with Internet \naccess soared to 41.5 percent. And the access rates for White Americans \nand Asian-Americans/Pacific Islanders--46.1 percent and 56.8 percent, \nrespectively--significantly outpaced that national average. As a \nconsequence, the already substantial gap between African-American \nInternet usage and national usage grew 3 percentage points. The gap was \neven greater when comparing African-American usage with that of White \nAmericans or Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. Similarly, during \nthat same 20-month period, the gap between Hispanic households with \nInternet access and the national average grew 4 percentage points.\n  The effect: What was once a gap is now swelling into a chasm. Just \nthis morning, the Wall Street Journal reported that, in 1997, ten \npercent of Americans earning less than $25,000 a year used the \nInternet, compared with 45 percent of those earning more than $75,000. \nBy 2001, despite increased usage by both groups, the ``gap'' had grown \nto 50 percentage points.\n  Yes, the ``digital divide'' exists, and that fact should concern us \ngreatly. In today's information age, unequal access to the national \ninformation infrastructure affects nearly every part of our lives. \nAccess to these networks increasingly dictates the ease with which we \ncan pursue education, conduct our financial affairs, apply for a job, \nor participate in the political process. Lack of access will only \nreinforce and magnify already existing inequalities in these important \nareas of life.\n  Against that backdrop, I am shocked by the Bush administration's \napparent efforts to dismantle many programs designed to eliminate the \ninequality of access to technology. These programs, including the \npopular E-Rate Program, have a demonstrated record of success \nconnecting roughly 1 million public school classrooms and 13,000 \ncommunity libraries to modern telecommunications networks. Moreover, \nthe vast majority of the funding is dedicated to low-income \ncommunities, and significant dollars flow to schools under the Bureau \nof Indian Affairs. By all accounts, these initiatives are working, yet \nthe Administration is maneuvering to eliminate them one by one.\n  Don't be fooled: This is a not a debate about electronic gadgets or \ncomputer megabytes. It is a debate about who gets to speak and who gets \nto listen. At its heart, it implicates the very nature of our \ndemocracy.\n  It is a debate about who among us, as the information revolution \ntakes off, will be left behind. Electronic commerce has become a \ncritical factor in determining future economic development and \nprosperity. Communities and individuals without access to the Internet \nwill be excluded from that growth.\n\n[[Page S1245]]\n\n The sadness, however, is that, by leaving some behind, we impoverish \nnot only those individuals, we also impoverish ourselves. None of us \nwill enjoy sustained economic growth unless we expand the information \nrevolution to all parts of our society.\n  With that in mind, we cannot afford to make technology decisions \nbased on dated and ill-conceived perceptions about the interest or \nability of minorities and poor people to purchase certain ``high-end'' \ntechnology. Nor can we simply bypass low-income and minority \ncommunities, where the telecommunications and electronic network \ninfrastructure may be older and, therefore, less able to provide more \nsophisticated services. To the extent that technology, including the \nInternet and telecommunications services, is deployed in a way that \navoids poor and minority communities, we must do all that we can to \ndeter this form of redlining.\n  Toward this end, the administration should keep its promise to invest \n$400 million to create and maintain more than 2,000 community \ntechnology centers in low-income neighborhoods by 2002. The role that \ncommunity technology centers plays in helping to bridge the digital \ndivide cannot be overstated. Community technology centers are \ninstrumental in closing the information technology divide, and, by \ntapping demand for these services, supporters of community technology \ninitiatives can open up new markets for companies that serve the \nInternet economy.\n  The development of information technology holds great potential to \nstrengthen and invigorate American society. That potential cannot be \nfully realized, however, unless we pay attention to the hundreds of \nthousands of individuals, many of whom reside in largely minority and/\nor low-income communities, who have no, or limited, access to our \nburgeoning national information infrastructure. We can, and must, \ninform decisionmakers about the true value of minority markets \nreceptive to advanced services. We must provide private industry with \nincentives to deploy in these markets. And, perhaps most important, we \nmust continue to make public investments in underserved communities. \nOur failure will only dampen private sector and philanthropic efforts, \nand, more tragically, handicap a generation of Americans for years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1245-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1245-S1246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TESTIMONY OF RICHARD PERLE BEFORE THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS \n                               COMMITTEE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Mr. Richard Perle is currently Resident \nFellow at American Enterprise Institute and chairman of the Defense \nPolicy Board of the Department of Defense, and served as Assistant \nSecretary of Defense for International Security Policy in the Reagan \nadministration. He gave this testimony at a Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee hearing this morning on the subject of ``How do We Promote \nDemocratization, Poverty Alleviation, and Human Rights To Build A More \nSecure Future?'' Mr. Perle's testimony was superb, and I commend it to \nall.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement by Richard \nPerle be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement of Richard Perle, Fellow, American Enterprise Institute, \n    Before the Committee on Foreign Relations, United States Senate\n\n       Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your invitation to participate \n     in the Committee's hearing which poses the question ``How do \n     we promote democratization, poverty alleviation and human \n     rights to build a more secure world?'' These three ideas, \n     poverty, democracy and human rights that are often linked as \n     we try to think our way through the vexing problems of \n     national and international security.\n       The phrase ``a more secure world'' is almost certainly \n     prompted by the discovery, on September 11, of how insecure \n     we turned out to be on that day. In any case, hardly any \n     discussion takes place these days that is not somehow related \n     to terrorism and the war against it. For my part, this \n     morning will be no exception.\n       Let me say, at the outset, that the idea that poverty is a \n     cause of terrorism, although widely believed and frequently \n     argued, remains essentially unproven. That poverty is not \n     merely a cause, but a ``root cause,'' which implies that it \n     is an essential source of terrorist violence, is an almost \n     certainly false, and even a dangerous idea, often invoked to \n     absolve terrorists of responsibility or mitigate their \n     culpability. It is a liberal conceit which, if heeded, may \n     channel the war against terror into the cul de sac of grand \n     development schemes in the third world and the elevation of \n     do-good/feel-good NGO's to a role they cannot and should not \n     play.\n       What we know of the September 11 terrorists suggests they \n     were neither impoverished themselves nor motivated by \n     concerns about the poverty of others. After all, their avowed \n     aim, the destruction of the United States, would, if \n     successful, deal a terrible blow to the growth potential of \n     the world economy. Their devotion to Afghanistan's Taliban \n     regime, which excluded half the Afghan work force from the \n     economy and aimed to keep them illiterate as well as poor, \n     casts conclusive doubt on their interest in alleviating \n     poverty.\n       Poverty--or poverty and despair--is the most commonly \n     adumbrated explanation for terrorism abroad--and crime at \n     home. Identifying poverty as a source of conduct invariably \n     confuses the matter. We will never know what went through the \n     mind of Mohammed Atta as he plotted the death of thousands of \n     innocent men, women and children, including a number of \n     Moslems. We do know that he lived in relative comfort as did \n     most, perhaps all, of the 19 terrorists--15 of them from \n     affluent Saudi Arabia.\n       If we accept poverty as an explanation we will stop \n     searching for a true, and useful, explanation. We may not \n     notice the poisonous extremist doctrine propagated, often \n     with Saudi oil money, in mosques and religious institutions \n     around the world.\n       If we attribute terrorism to poverty, we may fail to demand \n     that President Mubarak of Egypt silence the sermons, from \n     mosques throughout Egypt, preaching hatred of the United \n     States. As you authorize $2 billion a year for Egypt, please \n     remember that these same clerics are employees of the \n     Egyptian government. It is not a stretch to say that U.S. \n     taxpayer dollars are helping to pay for the most inflammatory \n     anti-American ranting.\n       So when you hear about poverty as the root cause of \n     terrorism, I urge you to examine the manipulation of young \n     Muslim men sent on suicidal missions by wealthy fanatics, \n     like Osama bin Laden, whose motives are religious and \n     ideological in nature and have nothing to do with poverty or \n     privation.\n       Mr. Chairman, this hearing is about building a more secure \n     future; and I know it will come as no surprise if I argue \n     that doing that in the near term will require an effective \n     military establishment to take the war on terrorism to the \n     terrorists, to fight them over there because they are well on \n     the way to achieving their murderous objectives when we are \n     forced to fight them over here. For once those who wish to \n     destroy Americans gain entry to the United States and exploit \n     the institutions of our open society, the likelihood that we \n     will stop them is greatly diminished.\n       This is why President Bush was right to declare on \n     September 11 that ``We will make no distinction between the \n     terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor \n     them.'' This was not the policy of the last Democratic \n     administration or the Republican one before it. It is not a \n     policy universally applauded by our allies. But it is a right \n     and bold and courageous policy and the only policy that has a \n     reasonable prospect of protecting the American people from \n     further terrorist acts.\n       Dealing effectively with the states that support or condone \n     terrorism against us (or even remain indifferent to it) is \n     the only way to deprive terrorists of the sanctuary from \n     which they operate, whether that sanctuary is in Afghanistan \n     or North Korea or Iran or Iraq or elsewhere. The regimes \n     in control of these ``rogue'' states--a term used widely \n     before the last administration substituted the flaccid \n     term ``states of concern''--pose an immediate threat to \n     the United States. The first priority of American policy \n     must be to transform or destroy rogue regimes.\n       And while some states will observe the destruction of the \n     Taliban regime in Afghanistan and decide to end their support \n     for terrorism rather than risk a similar fate, others will \n     not.\n       It is with respect to those regimes that persist in \n     supporting and harboring terrorists that the question of the \n     role of democratization and human rights is particularly \n     salient. And foremost among these regimes is Saddam Hussein's \n     Iraq.\n       The transformation of Iraq from a brutal dictatorship, in \n     which human rights are unknown, to a democratic state \n     protecting the rights of individuals would not only make the \n     world more secure, it would bring immediate benefits to all \n     the people of Iraq (except the small number of corrupt \n     officials who surround Saddam Hussein).\n       I believe that this is well understood in the Congress, \n     which has repeatedly called on the administration to support \n     the Iraqi National Congress, an umbrella group made up of \n     organizations opposed to Saddam's dictatorship. The INC is \n     pledged to institute democratic political institutions, \n     protect human rights and renounce weapons of mass \n     destruction. As we think through the best way to change the \n     regime in Iraq, it is precisely the proponents of democracy \n     who deserve our support, not the disaffected officer who \n     simply wishes to substitute his dictatorship for that of \n     Saddam Hussein.\n       I hope, Mr. Chairman, that the Congress, which has been \n     well ahead of the executive\n\n[[Page S1246]]\n\n     branch in recognizing this, will succeed in persuading this \n     administration, although it failed to persuade the last one, \n     that our objective in removing Saddam's murderous regime must \n     be its replacement by democratic forces in Iraq and the way \n     to do that is work with the Iraqi National Congress.\n       Mr. Chairman, it goes without saying that democracies that \n     respect human rights, and especially the right to speak and \n     publish and organize freely, are far less likely to make war \n     or countenance terrorism than dictatorships in which power is \n     concentrated in the hands of a few men whose control of the \n     instruments of war and violence is unopposed. As a general \n     rule, democracies do not initiate wars or undertake campaigns \n     of terror. Indeed, democracies are generally loath to build \n     the instruments of war, to finance large military budgets or \n     keep large numbers of their citizens in military \n     establishments. Nations that embrace fundamental human rights \n     will not be found planning the destruction of innocent \n     civilians. I can't think of a single example of a democracy \n     planning acts of terror like those of September 11.\n       We could discuss at length why democratic political \n     institutions and a belief in the rights of individuals \n     militate against war and terror and violence. But the more \n     difficult questions have to do with how effectively we oppose \n     those regimes that are not democratic and deny their citizens \n     those fundamental human rights, the exercise of which \n     constitutes a major restraint on the use of force and \n     violence.\n       Here the issue is frequently one of whether we ``engage'' \n     them in the hope that our engagement will lead to reform and \n     liberalization, or whether we oppose and isolate them. I know \n     of no general prescription. Each case, it seems to me, must \n     be treated individually because no two cases are alike. Take \n     the three cases of the ``axis of evil.''\n       In the case of Iraq, I believe engagement is pointless. \n     Saddam Hussein is a murderous thug and it makes no more sense \n     to think of engaging his regime than it would a mafia family.\n       In the case of Iran, I doubt that the goals of \n     democratization and human rights would be advanced by \n     engaging the current regime in Teheran. There is sufficient \n     disaffection with the mullahs, impressive in its breadth and \n     depth, to commend continued isolation--and patience. The \n     spontaneous demonstrations of sympathy with the United States \n     are brave and moving. We owe those who have marched in \n     sympathy with us the support that comes from refusing to \n     collaborate with the regime in power. The people of Iran may \n     well throw off the tyrannical and ineffective dictatorship \n     that oppresses them. We should encourage them and give them \n     time.\n       In the case of North Korea end the policy of bribing them. \n     Such a policy invites blackmail, by them or others who \n     observe their manipulation of us--and it certainly moves them \n     no closer to democracy or respect for human rights. We must \n     watch them closely and remain ready to move against any \n     installation that may place weapons of mass destruction or \n     long-range delivery within their reach.\n       Mr. Chairman, I have only one recommendation for the \n     Committee and it is this: to support enthusiastically, and \n     specifically with substantially larger budgets, the National \n     Endowment for Democracy. On a shoestring it has been a source \n     of innovative, creative programs for the building of \n     democratic institutions, often working in places where \n     democracy and respect for human rights is only a distant \n     dream. It may well be the most cost-effective program in the \n     entire arsenal of weapons in the war against terror and for a \n     more secure world.

Mr. President, I rise today to publicly thank my good \nfriend Jorge Castaneda, Mexican Secretary of Foreign Relations, for \ntaking the time out of his busy schedule to address the U.S.-Spain \nCouncil last weekend.\n  I have had the pleasure of chairing the U.S.-Spain Council for two \nyears now, and each year our annual meetings have been informative and \nthought-provoking. At these meetings American and Spanish members of \nthe Council discuss U.S.-Spain bilateral relations, but we also focus \non the unique triangular relationship between the U.S., Spain, and \nLatin America, particularly Mexico. Our meetings are always candid, \nconstructive, and informative, and I believe that they are particularly \nvaluable for our membership. Part of what makes our annual meetings so \nsuccessful is the high quality of the speakers that attend our \nconferences. This was truly evident when Secretary Castaneda delivered \nthe address at our closing dinner last Friday in the Senate Caucus \nRoom.\n  Having been an elected public servant for over 25 years, I have \nattended numerous dinners and receptions, and have heard countless \ndinner speeches. I can honestly say that Secretary Castaneda's speech \nranks among the best I have ever heard. In his insightful remarks, \nSecretary Castaneda detailed his analysis of Mexican political history, \nand outlined his vision for the future of democracy in Mexico while \ndrawing several parallels between Mexican political liberalization and \nthe democratization of Spain after the fall of Franco. Secretary \nCastaneda's remarks were astute, thought-provoking, and engaging. \nIndeed, they are among the most comprehensive analyses of modern Mexico \nto date. I think that my colleagues, especially those with an interest \nin the Western Hemisphere, would have enjoyed and greatly benefited \nfrom the substance of these remarks had they been present at the \ndinner.\n  Dr. Jorge Castaneda is uniquely qualified to speak about Mexico's \npolitical situation. He is a man of enormous talent and experience, a \nleading intellectual, and now an important diplomat. He has thought and \nwritten extensively about international relations, and particularly \nMexico's role in the global community. He was a world renowned academic \nbefore joining the Fox Administration, and has taught at the National \nAutonomous University of Mexico and at New York University. He is the \nauthor of twelve books, published in English and Spanish, and he has \nbeen a frequent contributor to noted publications such as Newsweek \nmagazine, El Pais, and Reforma.\n  As Secretary of Foreign Relations, Secretary Castaneda has worked to \nbuild the image of a safe, honest, and peaceful Mexico that respects \nhuman rights and engages in political and social reform. He has also \nsought very successfully to strengthen his government's involvement on \nthe global stage, both in this Hemisphere and in Europe.\n  In light of the fact that my colleagues were not able to be present \nto hear Secretary Castaneda speak, I ask unanimous consent that his \nremarks be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to take the time \nto read them. I know that they will enjoy and be better informed having \ndone so.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Ladies and gentlemen: I want to thank the U.S.-Spanish \n     Council and my good friend Senator Chris Dodd for inviting me \n     to join you here this evening. I am grateful for this \n     opportunity to share with you some thoughts on Mexico's \n     foreign policy.\n       As a result of Mexico's far-reaching process of reform and \n     renewal, the government of President Vicente Fox has acquired \n     a legitimacy that is almost without precedent in our country. \n     This has had a profound impact on President Fox's domestic \n     agenda. It has also forced us to rethink and retool our \n     foreign policy so that it responds to the needs and \n     priorities of a new democratic Mexico. Times have changed. \n     Things have changed. And, Lampedusa not withstanding, let me \n     assure you that not everything will remain the same.\n       This process of reform and renewal is uncharted territory \n     for us in Mexico, but it should not be unfamiliar to those \n     who have lived through or have studied democratic transitions \n     in other countries. In the past few decades, many \n     authoritarian regimes have come to an end not as result of \n     violence, but through a peaceful and orderly process of \n     democratization. Several factors came into play to make these \n     transitions possible. One of the most significant among them \n     was the growing role of civil society as a source of moral \n     and political pressure, both at home and abroad. Also \n     prominent was the influence of the media, both national and \n     international, constantly challenging and undermining \n     authoritarian regimes through public exposure. And obviously, \n     the most significant factor was the balance of political \n     forces within each nation and their willingness to enter into \n     agreements that would facilitate the transition to a \n     democratic regime.\n       All these factors have also been at play in Mexico, and \n     they deserve a detailed examination in order to fully \n     understand the country's recent democratic transition and its \n     prospects for consolidation. However, I wish to focus my \n     remarks here today on another crucial issue that does not \n     often receive the attention it merits, in spite of the \n     potentially decisive role that it can play in the \n     consolidation of a democratic regime: the influence of \n     international affairs and foreign policy in strengthening \n     democracy.\n       There is often a positive correlation between democracy and \n     international engagement or conversely between \n     authoritarianism and isolation. That is why undemocratic \n     governments tend to be defensive in their engagement with \n     others. The less democratic a country is, the more likely \n     that it will view the outside world with suspicion and will \n     interpret any criticism as an affront to its sovereignty and \n     to the rule of\n\n[[Page S1247]]\n\n     the few. Undemocratic governments today may pay utmost \n     attention to domestic issues, while they regard international \n     matters with mistrust, at best, or with fear and hostility, \n     at worst.\n       The end of authoritarianism has a two-fold effect: it means \n     building and consolidating democratic institutions and, at \n     the same time, leaving behind the defensive and inward-\n     looking attitude that had kept our country at a distance from \n     the world community. This complex interplay between foreign \n     policy and democracy has been part of other transitions, and \n     I believe that Mexico can draw some important lessons from \n     those experiences.\n       Perhaps the most relevant case for Mexico is the Spanish \n     transition. In a recent book, aptly entitled ``The Future is \n     No Longer what it Used to Be,'' former President Felipe \n     Gonzalez and journalist Juan Luis Cebrian provide a brilliant \n     account of the political transition that allowed Spain to \n     overcome its authoritarian legacy and consolidate a \n     democratic regime. Some of the agonizingly complex issues \n     that Spanish society had to resolve in this process are \n     also pertinent, mutatis mutandis, to other countries: How \n     to ensure that age-old authoritarian temptations would be \n     effectively resisted and eventually eliminated? How to \n     prevent new conflicts and long standing fractures within \n     society from derailing the democratic process?\n       The Spanish transition to democracy boldly and creatively \n     addressed these questions. The remarkably successful outcome \n     of this process owed much to the responsible, stabilizing \n     leadership of Spain's politica elites and media. This was \n     most singularly achieved through the 1977 Constitution and \n     the celebrated ``Pactos de la Moncloa'', which brought all \n     major Spanish political forces together to agree on a basic \n     framework for the Spanish State and for economic and social \n     policy. But equally important was the role played by Spanish \n     foreign policy in deepening and strengthening democracy, as \n     well as, change across the board.\n       They keyb to this process was Spain's decisive shift \n     towards European integration, which contributed enormously to \n     democratic stability. The first crucial step in this \n     direction was the country's decision to become a full fledged \n     Party to the NATO, which Spain joined on May 1982, submitting \n     its continued membership to a national referendum in 1986. \n     This effectively put an end to its relative isolation and \n     promoted the modernization and democratization of the armed \n     forces, which henceforth were obliged to adhere to the same \n     professional standards in place throughout the NATO's member \n     nations.\n       The most significant foreign policy measure as far as the \n     consolidation of democracy is concerned, however, was the \n     decision to join the European Economic Community, as the \n     European Union was known then. There was wide consensus among \n     Social political leaders about the need to bind Madrid to \n     Brussels, that is to say, to bring Spain into close \n     association with the EEC nations, anchoring the modernization \n     and democratization of the country within the regional \n     institutions of a democratic Europe. Spain's request for \n     entry had been submitted as early as 1977. But, it was \n     President Felipe Gonzalez and the Partido Socialista Obrero \n     Espanol, who explicitly linked foreign policy and democratic \n     consolidation as a State goal. They understood that the move \n     towards Europe and the move towards democracy were \n     complementary processes: if Spain was to be part of the \n     European Economic Community and enjoy the benefits that this \n     membership afforded in terms of trade and finance, it also \n     had to maintain social policies and political institutions \n     that were consistent with those of the EEC as a whole.\n       In assuming these responsibilities within the framework of \n     NATO and the EEC, Spain was acting freely and on the basis of \n     its own sovereign interests. The new demands placed on Spain \n     by European membership were unquestionably binding, but were \n     also the result of an internal and public debate and, as \n     such, a deliberate choice by the Spanish people. It is in \n     this sense that the importance of the foreign factor in the \n     Spanish transition can contribute to understand the current \n     process of change in Mexico.\n       The fact that foreign policy is a key element of Mexico's \n     transition is neither a whim nor a fluke. Its source is the \n     presidential election of 2000, which stands as a milestone in \n     Mexico's recent political development. But it is also a \n     purposeful response to the changes that have occurred in the \n     international arena over the past decade, not least of which \n     is the emergence of a growing international consensus \n     regarding both the legitimacy of democratic institutions \n     above all others and the respect for fundamental human \n     rights, including basic civil and political rights, and the \n     rule of law.\n       Under these new conditions, it is imperative to bring \n     Mexico's relations with the rest of the world up to date. and \n     in order to do so, President Fox established a two-pronged \n     strategy. Firstly, it was necessary to provide greater depth \n     to our long term relationship with the United States, which \n     for historical as well as geopolitical reasons remains--and \n     will continue to be in the foreseeable future--Mexico's most \n     important and closest foreign partner. And secondly, given \n     the hegemonic position of the US in the world area and the \n     asymmetry of our bilateral relationship, Mexico needed to \n     develop an additional major policy axis that would bring \n     greater balance to our international agenda. This is the \n     reasoning behind the country's more active engagement in \n     regional and multilateral fora, such as the UN, the OAS, and \n     other international mechanisms over the past year or so. But \n     in addition to their own intrinsic merits and justifications \n     these two external guidelines include fundamental domestic \n     policy policy connotations.\n       They obviously face a series of constraints. Admittedly, \n     our country today cannot rely, as Spain did, on an already \n     existing institutional framework such as the one provided by \n     the European Economic Community. There are no established \n     supranational North American or regional institutions which \n     may serve as an anchor for the process of democratization and \n     modernization that we have undertaken; nor are there \n     structural or cohesion funds through which financial \n     assistance could be channeled to reduce inequalities between \n     different countries and regions and foster socioeconomic \n     convergence among European nations, as was the case within \n     the EEC. In the absence of this framework, we need \n     to actively and creatively develop new institutions that \n     will promote North American prosperity and, in the \n     process, help Mexico achieve a successful and definitive \n     transition to democracy.\n       That is why we have, first, re-launched our bilateral \n     relationship with the United States, introducing new issues, \n     such as migration and energy seeking consistently and \n     systematically to engage all actors across the spectrum of US \n     society; and, most importantly, it explains why we are trying \n     to establish a new conceptual framework for our relationship. \n     What we envision is a new set of standing institutions that \n     would allow for the free movement of capital, goods and \n     services, and also people, so that we may gradually bring \n     about a greater degree of uniformity in the levels of \n     economic and social development within North America. This \n     will require designing creative mechanisms to transfer \n     resources for social cohesion and infrastructure, opening up \n     our borders, and North American institution building to \n     regulate and oversee this process of integration between the \n     three countries. This may sound overtly ambitious and even \n     far-fetched. But it should be doable and, more importantly, \n     it is a right step in the same direction that was chosen over \n     a decade ago for not entirely the right reasons.\n       Indeed, NAFTA was meant--and largely sold--as a means to \n     lock into place economic convergence and macroeconomic \n     policies. This was done, however, in a typically \n     authoritarian fashion in Mexico, without authentic debate, \n     transparency or consensus and some of the Treaty's most \n     obvious shortcomings may be attributed directly to this.\n       Playing a more active role in the multilateral arena is the \n     other road we have chosen abroad to consolidate democracy \n     domestically. We are convinced that it is in Mexico's best \n     interest to adapt itself to the new rules-based international \n     system that is gradually emerging and we therefore now \n     subscribe to the argument that certain principles are \n     universal and enforceable above and beyond the sovereignty of \n     the State. In this regard, also, there are important \n     precedents in Mexico's recent past. The so-called \n     ``democratic clause'' that was part and parcel of Mexico's \n     Free Trade Agreement signed with the European Union in 1999 \n     is evidence that, even before the full onset of democracy in \n     Mexico, the country was being compelled to adhere to certain \n     basic international standards if it wanted to have a more \n     active international profile.\n       This is why Mexico has recently taken a more proactive role \n     in international fora fighting racial discrimination and \n     promoting the rights of indigenous peoples in the World \n     Conference held in Durban last year; or strengthening \n     democratic values and institutions in the Americas though the \n     Interamerican Democratic Charter and throughout the world by \n     joining the Community of Democracies; or adopting a more \n     consistent stance in the proceedings of the UN Human Rights \n     Commission; or actively working to increase transparency and \n     combat corruption during the recent International Anti-\n     Corruption Conference held in Prague; or hosting the UN \n     sponsored International Conference on Financing for \n     Development to be held next month in Monterrey; or hosting \n     the forthcoming Ministerial Conference of the World Trade \n     Organization in 2003.\n       These actions and the commitments not only promote key \n     foreign policy interests, but they also, and most crucially, \n     help to anchor Mexico's emerging democracy and process of \n     change. They will contribute to prevent a future dislocation \n     of the democratic process or the temptation to return to the \n     authoritarianism of previous decades.\n       Let me give you an example. The government of President Fox \n     has radically altered the country's traditional international \n     stance on human rights, and has recently taken a number of \n     important steps to guarantee their full observance within the \n     country. Prominent prisoners, such as activists Teodor \n     Cabrera and Rodolfo Montiel, fishermen Leocadio Ascencio and \n     Aurelio Guzman, and Mr. Jose Gallardo, a former member of the \n     Mexican armed forces, were released from jail as a result of \n     the President's decision to review their cases and find \n     adequate solutions that fully respect the rule of law. They \n     are part of an ambitious agenda for reform that has already \n     allowed for the liberation of nearly a hundred other \n     prisoners who had been detained because of their activities \n     during the Chiapas uprising; the appointment of a Special \n     Prosecutor to investigate past human rights violations, the \n     subscription or ratification of 13 international treaties on \n     issues such as discrimination against\n\n[[Page S1248]]\n\n     women, the exploitation of children or crimes against \n     humanity or asking the Mexican Congress to ratify the Statute \n     of Rome creating the International Criminal Court; and an \n     agreement for the establishment of a regional delegation of \n     the International Committee of the Red Cross in Mexico. But \n     they are also, first and foremost, actions that seek to \n     guarantee that international surveillance on these issues \n     will strengthen democracy and human rights at home.\n       Ladies and Gentlemen: By overcoming authoritarian rule, \n     Mexico is leaving behind its former defensive attitude and \n     reaching out to the world in search for a new identity, just \n     as Spain did more than 25 years ago. But while the \n     similarities between the Spanish and the Mexican transitions \n     are significant, the differences are equally revealing.\n       Whereas Spaniards were able to come to terms with their \n     authoritarian past, Mexicans have yet to achieve \n     reconciliation and a common sense of purpose of its real and \n     longstanding democratic institutions by addressing the \n     grievances of recent past history. Whereas the Spanish people \n     immediately experienced the tangible benefits afforded by EEC \n     membership, through infrastructure and cohesion funds aimed \n     at overcoming backwardness and establishing a level playing \n     field within the Community, Mexican society has yet to fully \n     realize the enormous advantages to be gained by establishing \n     similar mechanisms to boost economic and social development \n     in Mexico and by embracing the idea of a North American \n     community. Whereas Spain was able to anchor its democratic \n     transition in an existing European Community, Mexico must \n     strive to build the institutions of true North American \n     Community. And whereas Spain's entry in the EEC impinged upon \n     Spanish sovereignty, as indeed it affected the sovereignty of \n     all other EEC members, NAFTA, a truly Anglo-Saxon \n     institution, left domestic politics and social policy, two \n     fundamental attributes of sovereignty, largely untouched.\n       This latter point is crucial. Mexico, today, as Spain \n     purposefully did back in the eighties, seeks supranational \n     rules and regulations that bind and ensure its democratic \n     transition and enhance its prosperity and ensure its \n     democratic stability. This seems to me a more than fair trade \n     off.\n       The jury is still out on Mexico's democratic consolidation. \n     If we are to succeed, the leaders of all major political \n     parties in Mexico must have the courage to put some of their \n     differences aside and work together for a common purpose. But \n     our North American partners must also show themselves willing \n     to take on the challenge of developing a new vision for our \n     region, one that can radically change for the better the \n     lives of millions of people throughout Mexico, the U.S. and \n     Canada.\n       If there has been a clear and consistent trait throughout \n     the world in recent decades, it is the tendency towards \n     integration, which in turn has resulted in stronger \n     democratic institutions and the adherence to basic universal \n     standards of behavior. This is not a spontaneous or natural \n     process, even though there may be historical forces at play. \n     Rather, it must be complemented by deliberate action. This is \n     exactly what the government of President Fox has set out to \n     achieve: to use foreign policy as a crowbar to open up our \n     country and help consolidate democracy and change human \n     rights in Mexico. Succeeding in this endeavor is not only \n     critical for Mexico; it is an issue of central importance to \n     the future of North America, to our hemisphere and to the \n     rest of the international community.\n       Let me conclude by quoting the Spanish-British historian \n     Charles Powell, who ends his splendid work on the history of \n     Spain after Franco by stating--not without some British \n     reserve and understatement--that ``it would be unfair not to \n     acknowledge that what was achieved [by this transition] \n     undoubtedly constitutes a cause for collective pride''.\n       I sincerely hope that, 26 years from now, a future \n     historian of Mexico can express similar feelings about our \n     transition to democracy. It is this hope that spurs many of \n     us in government, and throughout society at large, to do \n     everything we can to ensure that our country lives up to its \n     present challenge. And I am sure that all of you will \n     understand why we in Mexico wholeheartedly believe that it is \n     a cause that our partners should also embrace.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1248-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1248]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE PENSION SECURITY ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the spectacular collapse of the Enron \nCorporation has broken lives, shattered dreams and shaken confidence in \nour financial markets and in several professions. From what we know so \nfar, it appears that the fall of Enron involves malfeasance, \nmisfeasance and nonfeasance on the part of very many people. There may \nultimately be criminal prosecutions, civil fines, and partial \nrestitution. It may take years to sort out all of the problems and for \nCongress to enact appropriate solutions.\n  Although the Enron investigations and lawsuits are ongoing, we have \nlearned several lessons in the area of employee retirement security \nthat can be addressed swiftly and responsibly. I am pleased to join my \ncolleagues Senators Tim Hutchinson and Trent Lott in introducing the \nPension Security Act of 2002. This legislation creates important new \nprotections and rights for working Americans that give them the tools \nto enhance their own retirement planning and security.\n  The measure includes new safeguards and options to help workers \npreserve and enhance their retirement security, and insists on greater \naccountability from companies and senior corporate executives during \n``blackout'' periods when rank-and-file workers are unable to make \nchanges to their retirement accounts.\n  Under the Pension Security Act, workers would have more freedom to \ndiversify their investments, much greater access to high quality \ninvestment advice, advance notice before blackout periods, more \ninformation about their pensions, and other tools they can use to \nmaximize the potential of their 401(k) plans and ensure a secure \nretirement future.\n  The bill also clarifies that employers have a fiduciary \nresponsibility for the security of workers' investments during \n``blackout'' periods and bars senior corporate executives from selling \ntheir own stock at times when rank-and-file workers cannot make changes \nto their 401(k) accounts.\n  The bill strikes an important balance between preserving employee \nfree choice and opportunity in the voluntary retirement savings system \nand protecting individuals from the wrongful acts of others. I look \nforward to working with all of my colleagues to join with us in \nenacting these important reforms.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1248-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1248-S1249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATOR TED KENNEDY'S 70TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I am most honored to express my \ncongratulations to my dear friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, as he \ncelebrates his 70th birthday. He and I joined the Senate chamber 40 \nyears ago, and it has been my privilege to serve alongside this great \nman over the years.\n  Senator Kennedy has championed health insurance and education reform, \ndefended the rights of the elderly and workers, strengthened civil \nrights, and protected our natural resources. He has proudly and ably \ncarried on his family's legacy of public service.\n  I wish to thank Senator Kennedy for his outstanding service to his \nhome State of Massachusetts and to our Nation. I extend my best wishes \nto him for many more years of good health, memorable experiences, and \ncontinued success.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle who have taken to the Senate floor to offer \nheartfelt tributes and best wishes to our esteemed colleague and \nfriend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) as he \ncelebrates his 70th birthday. While prior commitments precluded my \nparticipation in yesterday's bipartisan tribute, I wanted to take a \nmoment to offer my congratulations to Senator Kennedy.\n  For 40 of his 70 years, Ted Kennedy has worked for the people of \nMassachusetts and America in the United States Senate. During that \ntime, through hard work, consensus building and perseverance, with \ngreat wit and charm, and, on many memorable occasions, passionate \noratory, Ted Kennedy has established himself as one of the most \neffective legislators of the 20th century and a champion for equality, \nopportunity, and justice for all Americans.\n  When I was appointed to the Senate in 1990, we were considering the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, one of the many landmark civil rights \nbills that Ted Kennedy has helped to inspire and craft, guide through \nCongress, and become law. For as long as I have been in public service, \nTed Kennedy has been a powerful voice and an advocate for those who are \nmost vulnerable in our Nation. On issues ranging from civil rights, \nvoting rights, equal rights for women, equal protection for all \nAmericans regardless gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation, \nAmericans with disabilities, access to health care, quality education \nfor all children, workers' rights, patients' rights, a decent minimum \nwage, food stamps, or equal justice for all Americans, Ted Kennedy has \nbeen at the forefront of the battles for equal opportunity for all \nAmericans, for fairness, for justice.\n  In 1963, speaking on civil rights for African Americans, President \nKennedy\n\n[[Page S1249]]\n\nsaid that ``every American ought to have the right to be treated as he \nwould wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated. \nThis is not the case.'' Throughout his illustrious career, Ted Kennedy \nhas worked to ensure that all Americans are treated fairly, are treated \nwith respect and dignity. His work in the Senate has helped us move \nforward as a people and Nation toward the vision of America that \nPresident Kennedy and Senator Robert F. Kennedy spoke about with such \neloquence. His effectiveness in forging bipartisan partnerships to \nadvance the causes and issues he cares so much about is legendary. As \nthe Majority Leader said, Ted Kennedy is the master of the principled \ncompromise. In doing so, Ted inspires those of us lucky enough to serve \nwith him with his dedication, persistence and hard work, and he has \nearned the admiration, respect, and love of people across America.\n  As both a colleague and friend, no one is more generous with his time \nor considerate than Ted Kennedy. The senior Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nDurbin) and some of my colleagues mentioned that in some parts of their \nstates being accused of voting too much like Ted Kennedy is a standard \npolitical reproach. In Hawaii, a comparison to Ted Kennedy is a badge \nof honor. In 1990, I was appointed to the Senate in May, and was \ncampaigning for election in November. My race was extremely close, and \nthe Senate was in session until the last week of October working on the \nFederal budget. Then President George H.W. Bush and other national \nleaders had come to the islands to campaign for my opponent. Ted \nKennedy agreed to campaign with me in Hawaii right before the election. \nHis appearance energized the voters, and sparked a surge in the polls \nthat broke open a close race. In fact, on election night, Ted Kennedy \nwas the first person to call with congratulations based on exit poll \nprojections he had received.\n  In the history of the Senate, there have been few Senators whose \nrecord of accomplishments, whose hard work, whose contributions to \nbuilding a more perfect Union, equals that of the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. I am proud to serve with him in the Senate and fortunate \nto call him a friend. It is with the deepest admiration and profound \naloha that I wish Ted, hau'oli la hanau, a most Happy Birthday. May you \nhave many more. God bless you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1249-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred May 16, 1993 \nin Rehoboth Beach, DE.

Mr. President, this week marks the 90th anniversary of \nHadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America. With over \n300,000 members and 1,500 chapters across the country, Hadassah is the \nlargest women's and largest Jewish membership organization in the \nUnited States. Over the last nine decades, its devoted members have \nexhibited the best of the American philanthropic and volunteer spirit \nin pursuing the organization's mission of a peaceful and secure Israel, \na vital Jewish culture, and the Jewish imperative for social justice.\n  Today in Israel, Hadassah continues to add to a well-established \nhumanitarian record that has fostered peace, understanding, and \nprosperity for all Israeli citizens. The Hadassah Medical Organization \n(HMO) operates two hospitals, ninety outpatient clinics, and numerous \ncommunity health centers that provide state of the art health care to \n600,000 patients a year--regardless of race, religion, or creed. These \nmedical facilities often treat the most critically wounded in the \nregion's on-going conflicts and the support they receive from Hadassah \nmembers allows them to save lives. The HMO reaches out beyond Israel, \nproviding medical personnel and training during international health \ncrises, enhancing the welfare of communities around the globe.\n  Here in United States, Hadassah's women's health and education \ninitiatives have enhanced the health and well being of the American \nJewish community and our Nation. Its informative awareness campaigns on \nbreast cancer, osteoporosis, and eating disorders have empowered women \nof all ages to make healthy lifestyle decisions. Hadassah has \nstrengthened American Jewish culture through sponsorship of Jewish and \nHebrew educational classes and study groups.\n  Mr. President, for ninety years Hadassah has brought Jewish-American \nwomen together to explore their shared faith and connection to Israel. \nOn this week of their 90th anniversary, I commend their good work and \nwish them many more years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1249-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ERIC BERGOUST APPRECIATION\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Eric Bergoust, a \ndistinguished freestyle skier from Missoula MT. At the age of 31, Eric \nhas attained nearly every milestone that inspires athletes to achieve \ntheir dreams. He is an Olympic champion, a world champion, and has held \nnumerous world records throughout his career. As impressive as his \naccomplishments are, the passion Eric has for his sport is truly \nremarkable. Passion shines brightest through innovations, and Eric has \nmade many. He has landed unprecedented jumps throughout his career, and \nhas developed a one-armed take off style that has opened up new \npossibilities to all freestyle skiers.\n  Like so many of his fellow Montanans, Eric has achieved great things \nthrough both his appreciation of the virtues of a will-do attitude and \nthe determination to follow through on a task. These assets led Eric \ndown the seemingly improbable path from a boy jumping off the roof of \nhis house into a matress pile, to a young man driving alone from \nMontana to Lake Placid with only makeshift skis and ten dollars in his \npocket, to an Olympic and world champion. It has been exciting to see \nEric accomplish so many things. But when I consider the determination \nand passion that have pushed Eric along, it has become clear that maybe \nhis path really wasn't so improbable after all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1249-4", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1249-S1250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        2002 BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Black History \nMonth, a 76-year tradition recognizing and celebrating the \ncontributions of African-Americans throughout our history.\n  Dr. Carter G. Woodson, the son of former slaves, earned his \nbachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Chicago in my \nhome State of Illinois, before continuing his studies at Harvard \nUniversity and the Sorbonne in Paris. Since African-American history \nhad barely begun to be studied or even documented, Dr. Woodson \nestablished what is now called the Association for the Study of Afro-\nAmerican Life and History and founded the Journal of Negro History. In \n1926, he started Negro History Week and chose the second week of \nFebruary because it marks the birthdays of two men who have had a great \nimpact on African-Americans: Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. \nThanks to the efforts of Dr. Woodson and those who have followed him, \nwe now celebrate the outstanding achievements of African-Americans past \nand present during the entire month of February.\n  Illinois has a rich African-American legacy. Gwendolyn Brooks was the \nfirst African-American poet to win the Pulitzer Prize, and in 1968, she \nwas named the poet laureate of Illinois. In 1985-86, she was the Poet \nLaureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress and focused \nher efforts on encouraging elementary school students to write poetry.\n\n[[Page S1250]]\n\n  Black History Month is also a celebration of lesser-known African-\nAmericans, and I would like to recognize the far-reaching contributions \nof Illinoisan Lloyd Augustus Hall. Mr. Hall was a chemist who earned \nmore than 100 patents in the United States, Great Britain, and Canada. \nHis work revolutionized the meatpacking industry, and his method for \nsterilizing spices is used today to sterilize medicine, medical \nsupplies, and cosmetics. He was the first African-American elected to \nthe National Board of Directors of the American Institute of Chemists, \nand President John F. Kennedy appointed him to the American Food for \nPeace Council in 1962.\n  Today, Illinoisans continue to build upon Dr. Woodson's legacy of \npreserving and celebrating African-American history. Last month, Jewish \nleaders at the Beth Emet synagogue in Evanston, Illinois, released a \nrestored recording of a speech Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., gave there \n44 years ago. It took months of digital forensic audio techniques to \nclean background noise and to convert the reel-to-reel tape to compact \ndisc, but the effort was well worth it, and Dr. King's words then are \nstill instructive today.\n  Dr. King observed that there had been three distinct periods in our \nnation's history of race relations: slavery, segregation, and \ndesegregation. He also declared that the issue of civil rights is ``an \neternal moral issue which may well determine the destiny of our \nnation'' and looked toward a fourth period--a period of real \nintegration.\n  This month, we honor the great strides made by African-Americans in \novercoming obstacles and color barriers. But I am afraid we have not \nyet reached Dr. King's goal of real integration. The unemployment rate \nfor African-Americans has jumped to 9.8 percent, over four percentage \npoints higher than the rate for all workers. The 2000 Presidential \nelection illustrated the disenfranchisement of thousands of African-\nAmerican voters nationwide, whose votes did not count. There is \ndisturbing evidence that some law enforcement agencies and agents \n``profile,'' or make pre-determinations about, people based on their \nrace.\n  Dr. King noted the important role that we in the Federal Government \nmust play in addressing issues such as these. In his 1958 speech at \nBeth Emet, he said, ``As we look to Washington, so often it seems that \nthe judicial branch of the government is fighting the battle alone. The \nexecutive and legislative branches of the government have been all too \nslow and stagnant and silent, and even apathetic, at points. The hour \nhas come now for the Federal Government to use its power, its \nconstitutional power, to enforce the law of the land.''\n  The time indeed has come for Congress to show that it is no longer \nslow and certainly not apathetic. I have been working for several \nmonths to try to extend unemployment benefits and to help unemployed \nworkers continue their health benefits. I proposed an amendment that \nwould have increased weekly unemployment benefits by $25 or fifteen \npercent, whichever is greater. It also would have expanded coverage to \npart-time and low-wage workers, helping nearly 80 percent of the laid-\noff workers who currently are not receiving benefits.\n  In addition, I am an original cosponsor of the bipartisan election \nreform measure and introduced an amendment to eliminate the unnecessary \nspecial treatment of punchcard voting systems. The overwhelming \nmajority of African-American and Hispanic voters use the punchcard \nsystem, which loses at least 50 percent more votes than optically-\nscanned paper ballots. My amendment would have reduced the number of \nthese discarded votes by permitting a voter to verify the votes he or \nshe selected on the ballot and notifying the voter if more than one \ncandidate had been selected for a single office. The voter also would \nhave had the opportunity to change the ballot or correct any error \nbefore the ballot was cast and counted.\n  I am also an original cosponsor of the End Racial Profiling Act of \n2001, which prohibits law enforcement agencies and agents from engaging \nin racial profiling and provides for enforcement in civil court. This \nlegislation would also require Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement agencies receiving Federal grants to maintain adequate \npolicies and procedures designed to eliminate racial profiling. \nFurthermore, I have introduced the Reasonable Search Standards Act to \nprohibit U.S. Customs Service personnel from searching or detaining \nindividuals based on racial and other discriminatory profiling \ncriteria.\n  The official theme for this year's Black History Month is ``The Color \nLine Revisited: Is Racism Dead?'' This month, and every month, we must \npush forward until the answer to this question is a resounding ``Yes.'' \nWe must continue to fight for economic opportunity, equal justice, and \nequity in education and health care. While we celebrate the \naccomplishments of African-Americans throughout our history, we must \nbuild upon those achievements, until we can finally reach Dr. King's \nvision of real integration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1250-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    IN REMEMBRANCE OF LOUIS M. LAINO\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory \nof one of my constituents, Mr. Louis M. Laino, a man who gave his life \nin defense of his country.\n  I would like to call attention to a tragic accident which occurred on \nJanuary 15, 1961, and which took the lives of 28 brave Americans, one \nof whom, Louis M. Laino, was a resident of the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania. Mr. Laino was a crew member aboard Texas Tower 4.\n  Texas Tower 4 was one of three Department of the Air Force radar \nsites installed in the North Atlantic Ocean in the 1950s whose purpose \nwas to provide early warning in the event of an enemy missile or bomber \nstrike against the United States. Texas Tower 4 was located \napproximately 85 miles southeast of New York City in 185 feet of water. \nPrior to the accident in 1961, Tower 4 had earned a reputation for \nbeing unstable and had been nicknamed ``Old Shaky'' by the crew members \nwho served aboard the structure.\n  On September 12, 1960, Texas Tower 4 was struck by Hurricane \n``Donna.'' The storm's 130-mile per hour winds and 50-foot waves \nexceeded Tower 4's design specifications and caused structural damage \nto the platform. The Air Force decided that extensive repair work would \nneed to be performed on Tower 4 the following spring. February 1, 1961, \nwas established as the date for complete evacuation of the platform. In \nthe meantime, a maintenance crew of 28 persons was stationed aboard \nTower 4 to perform immediate repair work prior to more rigorous repairs \nbeing performed. Mr. Laino was among this group of workers, and \ntragically lost his life when a second storm struck Tower 4. This storm \npossessed 85-mile per hour winds, 35-foot waves, and proved to be too \nmuch for the already weakened Tower 4 to withstand. At 7:20 pm on the \nevening of January 15, 1961, Texas Tower 4's structure failed, and the \nplatform, with all hands on board, sank to the bottom of the Atlantic.\n  In closing, I would again like to call attention to the sacrifice \nmade by Louis M. Laino in defense of his country. Mr. Laino made the \nultimate sacrifice, that of his life. On behalf of the people of \nPennsylvania, I salute Mr. Laino for his courage and bravery in \nperforming a dangerous duty. Mr. Laino died so that all of us might be \nsafer, and for that, he should be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1250-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1250-S1251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING SENATOR HARRY F.

Byrd Jr.\n\n                             (By Bob Lewis)\n\n       Richmond, Va. (AP).--Former U.S. Sen. Harry F. Byrd Jr. \n     returned to the state Senate chamber to prolonged standing \n     applause Thursday to receive a proclamation in his honor and \n     recall his own Senate service.\n       The 87-year-old heir to the political dynasty that ruled \n     Virginia for much of the 20th century noted his first days in \n     the Senate in 1948, when he was pressured into hastily \n     signing onto a bill.\n       ``The next day, all hell broke loose. It was interpreted as \n     an effort to keep the president off the ballot that year,'' \n     Byrd said with a chuckle. ``I learned never to sign a bill \n     without reading it.''\n       The bill was the state's unsuccessful effort to snub \n     President Harry S. Truman.\n       Then, in a soft voice, Byrd looked to his right to the desk \n     he occupied in his 18 years in the state Senate and recalled \n     old days and old friends.\n       ``I find it hard to believe it was 54 years ago that I \n     first came here,'' he said. ``I love the Senate. I love the \n     U.S. Senate, too, but this Senate is my favorite. It's \n     smaller and you can make friends here to a greater degree \n     than you can in Washington.''\n       Among his closest friends in that freshman Senate class \n     were Albertis Harrison and Mills E. Godwin, who later became \n     Virginia governors. ``And we remained friends until Albertis \n     and Mills died,'' Byrd said.\n       Byrd served 18 years in the Virginia Senate as a Democrat, \n     the party his father, Harry F. Byrd Sr., built into a \n     political machine. In 1966, after Byrd Sr. retired from his \n     U.S. Senate seat in poor health, Byrd Jr. won a special \n     election to fill the four years that remained on his father's \n     term. He left the party and won re-election in 1970 and 1976 \n     as an independent, then retired from public life in 1982 to \n     return to his hometown, Winchester, and run his family's \n     newspapers.\n       Byrd was a former director and a second vice president of \n     The Associated Press.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1251-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1251-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1251-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1251]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGES\n\n  The following presidential messages were laid before the Senate, \ntogether with accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were \nreferred as indicated:\n\n       PM-71.

A bill to designate the facility of the United states Postal \nService located at 2829 Commercial Way in Rock Springs, Wyoming, as the \n``Teno Roncalio Post Office Building''; to the Committee on Government \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to designate the \nfacility of the United states Postal Service located at 2829 Commercial \nWay, Rock Springs, WY, as the ``Teno Roncalio Post Office Building.'' I \nam joined by my distinguished colleague from Wyoming, Senator Thomas in \nthe introduction of this bill.\n  Mr. Roncalio has served the great State of Wyoming and this Nation \nwith honor and integrity throughout his public and private career. The \nWyoming native was Wyoming's first five-term Representative to the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives during the 1960s and 1970s, and served as a \ndelegate to four democratic National Conventions. He was also selected \nto serve for two years as a national Democratic committeeman.\n  Mr. Roncalio was named to the U.S. Army Officer Candidates Hall of \nFame after having served in World War II and participating in beachhead \ninvasions in Sicily and Normandy. Mr. Roncalio also received the Silver \nStar for gallantry in action for his service in North Africa, Italy, \nFrance, Central Europe, and Germany.\n\n[[Page S1253]]\n\n  Mr. Roncalio and I have worked on some projects together, and just \nthe friendships he has made over the years almost guarantees success. \nOn several occasions, I have been pleased with his willingness to share \nhis opinions with me based on his vast experience, common sense, and \ndesire to see the ``right thing'' done. He has been a model and mentor \nto many.\n  Mr. Roncalio has committed his lifetime to public service, and I \nstrongly encourage my colleagues to support naming the Federal post \noffice building in Rock springs, WY after Mr. Teno Roncalio in \nrecognition of his long, distinguished career in Wyoming and national \npolitics.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 1971. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to protect the \nretirement security of American workers by ensuring that pension assets \nare adequately diversified and by providing workers with adequate \naccess to, and information about, their pension plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, there has been a flurry of activity \nsurrounding the bankruptcy of the Enron Corporation. Part of the \nattention has focused on the company's questionable accounting \npractices and tax havens. Another spotlight has been focused on the \nEnron retirement plans, particularly its 401(k) plan.\n  These are legitimate areas of inquiry. The same fact pattern in the \ncase of Enron applies to Global Crossings, a company that was founded \nin 1997, went public in 1998, sold shares worth $734 million before the \ncompany collapsed just this year, pauperizing its workforce and \ninvestors. In both companies, executives were lining their pockets with \ngold while they were duping investors and pillaging workers' retirement \nplans. The difference between Enron and Global Crossing is merely one \nof scale. Enron was the seventh largest company on the Fortune 500. \nGlobal Crossings was smaller but there are eerie similarities, both \nbetween these two bankruptcies, and the effect they have had on the way \nwe now view pension plan security.\n  Any company bankruptcy will inevitably harm workers, retirees and \ninvestors. Some Enron employees, and some of those at Global Crossing, \ninvested large amounts of their own money in company stock. In \naddition, both plans matched contributions made by the workers with \nthe, now worthless, company stock. Had the company's financial \nstatements correctly reflected the value of its stock, neither the \nworkers, nor the investors would have purchased the shares. \nUnfortunately, the financial statements of those two companies were at \nleast, highly misleading and very possibly fraudulent.\n  The losses by retirement plan participants are of concern to the \nSenate Finance Committee because it is the Committee with jurisdiction \nover both the Internal Revenue Code, IRC, and parts of ERISA. The Code \nprovides generous tax benefits to retirement plan sponsors. In return \nfor those tax preferences, plans must be established and maintained in \naccordance with the rules set out in the Internal Revenue Code and in \nthe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, ERISA.\n  The losses in the plans sponsored by recently bankrupted companies \nhave prompted us to reconsider some of the laws that govern retirement \nprograms. In particular, many have questioned whether plan participants \nshould be permitted to hold any company stock in their accounts, or \nonly a limited amount of stock. Other questions have been raised about \nfiduciary obligations, so-called ``blackouts'' and about information \nprovided to workers.\n  For those in the business community who are alarmed about the large \nnumber of proposals, including mine, making changes to this area of the \nlaw, I would urge caution. This bill is not written in stone. Further \nrefinements will be made to it. I am introducing it today because the \nFinance Committee will be holding a hearing on this issue tomorrow. \nBarely three weeks thereafter, Congress will be entering another recess \nperiod. If the introduction of this bill is delayed, interested parties \nwill not have the time they need to examine this proposal and give me \ntheir views.\n  This bill gives workers new diversification rights on holdings of \ncompany stock in their accounts. Some legislative proposals have called \nfor caps on the amount of stock that can be dedicated by employers to \nworkers' 401(k) accounts through matching contributions or through \ngains on the value of company stock. I believe such an approach will \ndiscourage employers from giving stock to workers through their plan \nand could not be administered except through the application of benefit \nwear-aways. During the cash balance pension plan debate, Congress found \nout just how unpopular benefit wear-aways are with plan participants.\n  Some have also suggested that employees should not be permitted to \npurchase employer stock in their plans. They argue the need for a \npaternalistic government to save employees from the ``temptation'' of \ninvesting in employer stock in their 401(k) plans. I do not believe the \ngovernment should treat workers like children. American workers are \nintelligent, and when armed with the right information, they will \nexercise foresight and make decisions for the best interest of \nthemselves and their families.\n  My approach does not discourage employer matching contributions in \ncompany stock. Nor would it restrict a worker choice to invest in \ncompany stock. However, once the worker has three years of service with \nthe employer, he or she should be permitted to change investments out \nof the company stock and into any other investment offered by the plan. \nThis change gives maximum flexibility to the worker and will prevent \nthe long holding periods that some companies impose on matching \ncontributions in their own stock.\n  An important exception to this rule will apply to closely held \ncorporations. Because of the difficulty of valuing stock in closely \nheld corporations, under my bill, these rules will not apply to \nclosely-held companies. This bill also provides that a pure, ``stand-\nalone'' ESOP, one consisting solely of now-elective contributions is \nnot subject to the new rule.\n  The current draft of the bill does not include a long phase-in of the \neffective date for company stock currently allocated to workers \nretirement accounts. Such a delayed effective date has been proposed in \nother legislation. However, I am open to such a recommendation, if \nnecessary. I encourage plan sponsors and practitioners to give me their \nthoughts on that issue.\n  This legislation also provides new disclosure requirements. At the \nend of 2001, Enron stopped participants from trading their investments \nwhile they changed plan administrators. Its stock was declining in \nvalue at this time, and for a long period prior to the so-called \n``blackout''. It is no surprise that while the plan was closed to \ntrading, all indications are that the value of the stock continued to \ndecline. It appears that Enron employees did receive a notice prior to \nthe transaction suspension period. But concerns have been raised that a \nstatutory requirement for a notice will help to protect participants in \nother plans from missing an opportunity to change investments prior to \na transaction suspension period. I am inclined to agree.\n  Consequently, this bill will also impose a requirement that plans \nprovide 30-days advance notice of transaction suspension periods, the \nso-called ``blackouts''. These are periods when participants are unable \nto change their investments. This change in law is needed so that \nemployees have the opportunity to trade out of company stock, or for \nthat matter, any other investment, before the beginning of a blackout \nperiod. The bill does not limit the duration of a transaction \nsuspension period. Some companies to a remarkable job in shortening the \ntime during which a plan is closed to transactions, however, \npractitioners have convinced me that it would be impractical to limit \nthese transaction suspension periods given the number of variables \ninvolved in reconciling accounts.\n  New disclosure requirements for so-called blackouts will be \nsupplemented by better information regarding the value of plan \nbenefits. I have long been concerned that participants need better \ninformation regarding their retirement. In the 105th Congress, I \nintroduced a bill with Senator Breaux that would impose a requirement \nfor periodic pension benefit statements.\n\n[[Page S1254]]\n\n  Language on periodic benefit statements was included again in a bill \nthat Senator Baucus and I introduced early last year. While most of \nthat bill was enacted as the Economic Growth and Revenue Reconciliation \nAct of 2001, EGTRRA, Public Law 107-16, the requirement for periodic \nbenefit statements was ``Byrded out''. In other words, it was dropped \nfrom the bill because it was revenue neutral and as such did not meet \nthe rules governing a reconciliation measure.\n  Because we did not enact that provision in EGTRRA, the benefit \nstatements language has been replicated here. Under this bill, \nparticipants will be entitled to a quarterly statement from their \ndefined contribution plan, such as a section 401(k) plan. If the \nworkers also have a defined benefit plan, they would be entitled to an \nestimated benefit statement once every three years.\n  Included in the periodic benefit statements will be language designed \nto alert workers to how much employer stock they hold in their \naccounts. Also included will be information regarding the importance to \nlong-term retirement security of participants of a well-balanced an \ndiversified portfolio. This information will encourage workers to avoid \nover-concentration in employer securities and to periodically re-\nbalance their portfolio.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na technical explanation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1971\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A \n     participant must be provided with the immediate right to \n     reinvest elective deferrals that are invested in employer \n     securities. In addition, the participant must be provided \n     with the right to invest employer contributions that are \n     invested in employer securities once the participant has 3 or \n     more years of service.\n       The participant must be permitted to reinvest employer \n     securities allocated to the participant's account in any \n     other investment option currently available to employees, and \n     the plan must provide at least 3 alternative investment \n     options. These diversification rights are also extended to \n     any beneficiary of a participant.\n       A plan will fail to comply with this requirement if the \n     ability of participants to diversify their investment in \n     employer securities is restricted under the plan or in \n     practice. For example, a plan will not comply with this \n     requirement if it provides for diversification of investment \n     in employer securities, but also provides for a reduced \n     matching contribution for any participant who invests any \n     employer securities in another investment option. The bill \n     also amends ERISA by adding this diversification requirement \n     to section 204.\n       These diversification requirements do not apply to an ESOP \n     that provides only for nonelective employer contributions and \n     is separate from any other qualified plan maintained by the \n     same employer. These ESOPs continue to be subject to the \n     diversification requirements in effect under section \n     401(a)(28) of the Code.\n\n\n  protection of employees during pension plan transaction suspension \n                                periods\n\n     Notice of transaction suspension periods\n       The bill requires that participants and beneficiaries who \n     are permitted to direct the investment of their accounts in a \n     qualified defined contribution plan must be notified by the \n     plan administrator of any ``transaction suspension period'' \n     no later than 30 days before the transaction suspension \n     period begins.\n       A transaction suspension period is any temporary or \n     indefinite period of 2 or more business days during which \n     there is a substantial reduction in the rights of participant \n     or beneficiaries to direct investments (other than by reason \n     of the application of securities laws). The notice must \n     provide sufficient information to allow affected participants \n     and beneficiaries to understand the timing and effect of the \n     transaction suspension period and must be written in a manner \n     calculated to be understood by the average plan participant.\n       The notice may be provided in writing or through an \n     electronic or other form reasonably accessible to the \n     affected participants and beneficiaries. These requirements \n     are not violated if 30-days notice could not be provided \n     because of events outside of the control of the plan sponsor \n     or administrator, provided that notice is provided as soon as \n     is reasonably possible under the circumstances. This \n     exception to the 30-day requirement also applies, to the \n     extent permitted in guidance by the Secretary, in other \n     appropriate situations such as acquisitions or dispositions.\n       The bill also imposes an excise tax of $100 a day on the \n     failure of a qualified defined contribution plan to provide \n     notice to a participant or beneficiary. The excise tax is \n     imposed on the employer or, in the case of a multiemployer \n     plan, on the plan. No excise tax is imposed during any period \n     during which any person subject to liability for the tax did \n     not know that the failure existed and exercised reasonable \n     diligence to meet the notice requirement.\n       In addition, no excise tax is imposed to the extent that a \n     person subject to liability for the tax exercised reasonable \n     diligence and actually provided notice as soon as reasonably \n     practicable after the first date such person knew, or \n     exercising reasonable diligence should have known, that such \n     failure existed. For a person who exercised reasonable \n     diligence, the tax is limited to no more than $500,000 for \n     the failures during a taxable year. Finally, the Secretary \n     may waive all or part of any tax that would otherwise be \n     imposed to the extent that payment of the tax would be \n     excessive or otherwise inequitable.\n     Inapplicability of relief from fiduciary liability during \n         transaction suspension period\n       The provisions of ERISA that limit fiduciary liability \n     during periods when a participant or beneficiary exercises \n     control over assets in his account would be amended to \n     clarify that this limit does not apply during any transaction \n     suspension period.\n     Trading in company stock by corporate insiders subject to \n         excise tax\n       Under the bill, a corporate insider is subject to a 20% \n     excise tax on any acquisition, disposition, or similar \n     transaction involving any employer securities during any \n     transaction suspension period that affects investment in \n     employer securities with respect to which notice must be \n     provided to any plan participant or beneficiary.\n       The excise tax is calculated based on the amount realized \n     by the insider in any sale or other disposition or the fair \n     market value of securities acquired by the insider during the \n     transaction suspension period. For this purpose, ``corporate \n     insiders'' are individuals subject to the requirements of \n     section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with \n     respect to the corporation.\n\n\n            Providing of Information to Assist Participants\n\n     Periodic pension benefit statements\n       The bill amends ERISA to require the plan administrator of \n     a qualified defined contribution plan to provide participants \n     with benefit statements at least annually, except that \n     benefit statements must be provided at least quarterly to \n     participants who have the ability to direct the investment of \n     their account in the plan. These statements must provide \n     information on (i) the fair market value of assets in the \n     participant's account, (ii) the portion of the assets which \n     are nonforfeitable and the earliest date on which assets not \n     nonforfeitable become so, (iii) the percentage (if any) which \n     the fair market value of employer securities bears to the \n     fair market value of assets in the account, and (iv) a \n     reminder of the importance of having diversified investments \n     of assets in the plan and other plans of the employer in \n     which the individual is also a participant. In addition, \n     statements must be provided to plan beneficiaries at least \n     annually, if requested in writing.\n       The bill also amends ERISA to require that the \n     administrator of a qualified defined benefit plan provide a \n     benefit statement at least every 3 years to a participant \n     with a nonforfeitable accrued benefit who is employed by the \n     employer maintaining the plan at the time the statement is \n     furnished. A statement is also required to be provided to any \n     participant or beneficiary upon written request.\n       This benefit statement must provide information on the \n     total benefits accrued, the\n\n[[Page S1258]]\n\n     nonforfeitable pension benefits, if any, which have accrued, \n     or the earliest date on which benefits will become \n     nonforfeitable. The statement must be written in a manner \n     calculated to be understood by the average plan participant \n     and may be provided in writing or in electronic or other form \n     reasonably accessible by the participant.\n       The information provided in a defined benefit plan \n     statement, other than a statement requested by a plan \n     participant, may be based on reasonable estimates. The \n     requirement to provide a defined benefit plan statement is \n     met if the plan notifies participants annually of the \n     availability of a statement and information on how the \n     participant can obtain a statement.\n       The bill also imposes an excise tax of $100 a day during a \n     period of noncompliance with the requirement that quarterly \n     benefit statements be provided to participants who have the \n     right to direct investment of their account. The excise tax \n     is imposed on the employer or, in the case of a multiemployer \n     plan, on the plan. No excise tax is imposed during any period \n     during which any person subject to liability for the tax did \n     not know that the failure existed and exercised reasonable \n     diligence to meet the notice requirement.\n       In addition, no excise tax is imposed to the extent that a \n     person subject to liability for the tax exercised reasonable \n     diligence and actually provided notice as soon as reasonably \n     practicable after the first date such person knew, or \n     exercising reasonable diligence should have known, that such \n     failure existed. For a person who exercised reasonable \n     diligence, the tax is limited to no more than $500,000 for \n     the failures during a taxable year. Finally, the Secretary \n     may waive all or part of any tax that would otherwise be \n     imposed to the extent that payment of the tax would be \n     excessive or otherwise inequitable.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provisions of the bill would be effective for plan \n     years beginning on or after January 1, 2003, except that the \n     provisions related to the provision of benefit statements \n     would be effective for plan years beginning after December \n     31, 2003. The bill provides a transition period for \n     compliance with the diversification requirements for plans \n     maintained pursuant to collective bargaining agreements.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER:\n  S. 1972. A bill to amend the charter of the AMVETS organization; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation on \nbehalf of American Veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam, \nAMVETS, a nonprofit veterans service organization chartered by Congress \nin 1947, which boasts approximately 250,000 members. Formed in the \nyears immediately following World War II, AMVETS has served America's \nveterans for more than 50 years.\n  This bill would amend the AMVETS' congressional charter in three \nways. First, it would change AMVETS' official name from ``American \nVeterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam'' to simply ``American \nVeterans,'' in order to more accurately reflect the group's membership; \nsecond, it would amend the charter to reflect long-standing \norganizational changes; and finally, it would recognize the change of \naddress for AMVETS' headquarters from Washington, DC, to Lanham, MD.\n  These amendments are important to allowing AMVETS to continue its \nstrong tradition of serving veterans. I am proud to offer them my \nassistance, and I ask that my colleagues act quickly to accommodate \nthese small changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRercord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, perhaps one of the most moving anthems \nof this Nation was written by Katharine Lee Bates, ``America The \nBeautiful.'' In the fourth verse, Ms. Bates wrote:\n\n     O beautiful for patriot dream that sees beyond the years,\n     Thine alabaster cities gleam undimmed by human tears!\n\n  From the inception of our Nation, many Americans have given their \nlives in order that we may enjoy the freedom and prosperity of American \nsociety. Now where is that more apparent than in our military history.\n  As we celebrate Black History Month, it is fitting that we take time \nto remember those Americans who, undaunted by the confines of slavery, \noppression, and segregation, fought valiantly to preserve our great \nNation.\n  During the struggle for national independence during the \nRevolutionary War, approximately 8,000 to 10,000 African-American \nsoldiers served the cause for freedom. Of that number, 5,000 African \nAmericans served in combat roles. These brave soldiers fought or \nprovided labor in virtually every major action of the war, from the \nfirst exchange of fire at Lexington and Concord to the decisive victory \nat Yorktown.\n  When the war of 1812 broke out between the United States and Great \nBritain, once again African Americans offered their services to protect \nthis country. For example, New York raised two 1,000-man African-\nAmerican regiments and many White units included African-American \nsoldiers.\n  In Philadelphia, 2,500 African Americans volunteered to erect \nfortifications on the outskirts of the city, and an estimated 10 \npercent of those serving on U.S. Navy ships in the Great Lakes were \nAfrican Americans, who took part as seamen in Capt. Oliver Hazard \nPerry's victory over the British on Lake Erie in 1813. During the \nbattle, an African-American soldier, Cytus Tiffany, used his body as a \nshield to protect Captain Perry during the battle.\n  Captain Perry later wrote:\n\n       I have yet to learn that the colour of a man's skin * * * \n     can affect a man's qualifications or usefulness.\n\n  Similarly, many African Americans quickly volunteered their military \nservices during the Civil War. In fact, many slaves escaped persecution \nto join the Union forces in order to end slavery in this country.\n  One such brave individual was Robert Smalls. Smalls, who was born \ninto slavery, was ``hired out'' by his Master for various jobs, \nincluding that of sailor. While serving on a ship called the Planter, \nSmalls coordinated and carried out an escape with the Confederate \nvessel into Federal lines on May 13, 1862.\n  Following this heroic deed, Robert eventually was made captain of the \nvessel. Robert's courage and intelligence in delivering the Planter to \nthe Union forces helped invalidate the theory that Blacks were inferior \nto whites and greatly influenced the 1862 debates over slavery and the \nUnion's use of African American soldiers.\n  One of the most distinguished and revered African-American military \nregiments in our Nation's history was the Buffalo Soldiers.\n  After the Civil war, the future of African Americans in the U.S. Army \nwas in question. However, in July 1866, Congress passed legislation \nestablishing two cavalry and four infantry regiments that were to be \nsolely comprised of African Americans. The mounted regiments were the \n9th and 10th Cavalries, soon nicknamed ``Buffalo Soldiers'' by the \nCheyenne and Comanche Tribes.\n  Until the early 1890s, they constituted 20 percent of all cavalry \nforces on the American frontier. Their invaluable service on the \nWestern frontier still remains one of the most exemplary services \npreformed by a regiment in the U.S. Army.\n\n[[Page S1262]]\n\n  As a Kansan and an American, I am very proud of the Buffalo Soldiers. \nIn fact, this is a picture of the late Elmer Robinson, Sergeant 1st \nClass, 10th Cavalry. Mr. Robinson served his country valiantly from \n1935 to 1955. After he retired from the military, he resided in \nLeavenworth, KS until his death in July 2000. Over the years African-\nAmericans continued to serve valiantly for our country such as with the \nTuskegee Airmen in World War II and subsequent wars following. In 1948, \nPresident Harry Truman issued an Executive Order that paved the way for \nour Armed Forces to end segregation.\n  Over the years, the military produced many distinguished African-\nAmericans such as, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., who was the first African-\nAmerican general in the regular Armed Forces and his son, Benjamin O. \nDavis, Jr., who became the second African-American general in the \nregular Armed Forces and in the Air Force.\n  Finally, one of the most distinguished and recognized African-\nAmerican military leaders in our Nation is Secretary of State, General \nColin Powell. Secretary Powell has served and continues to serve this \ncountry with distinction. He dedicated the monument we have, a statue \nof a Buffalo soldier on horseback in Leavenworth, KS.\n  During the late 1980s, former President George Bush nominated \nSecretary Powell as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--becoming the \nfirst African-American to serve in this capacity. This would not be his \nlast ``African-American first'' accomplishment however. After the \nelection of President George W. Bush, the President nominated Secretary \nPowell to the position of Secretary of State where he serves currently \nwith distinction.\n  This American history is just a glimpse of what I hope will be \nshowcased on a national level. As you know, we recently passed \nlegislation that creates a Presidential Commission charged with \nrecommending a legislative plan of action to establish a National \nAfrican-American history and culture museum in Washington, DC. It had \nbeen 70 years people had fought for this museum. We passed it last \nyear.\n  This is the first concrete step we have taken to properly honor the \nmany contributions of African-Americans in this society. Currently, we \nare in the process of nominating the presidential commission and I am \nlooking forward to the commission's recommendations regarding \nestablishing this museum on the National Mall--where it belongs.\n  Indeed, this country has been richly blessed by the contributions and \nsacrifices of African-Americans.\n  Cytus Tiffany, Robert Smalls, the Buffalo Soldiers, and the Tuskegee \nAirmen only make up a fraction of Americans who believed in the ideals \nof America and were willing to ``see beyond'' the years of their \noppression to a society that was fully inclusive of all citizens \ndespite race.\n  Because of their sacrifices, our Nation has prospered and grown into \nthe symbol of freedom around the world. As we continue to ensure our \nnational freedom, we encourage you to join us and celebrate this \nmagnificent American history; a history of a group of individuals who \nwere brought to our shores in shackles, yet, helped remove ``shackles'' \nfrom our society to ensure that we live together in peace and \nprosperity.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1262-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1262-S1320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--AMENDMENT NO. 2917, AS MODIFIED\n\n  Mr. REID.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON GLOBAL WARMING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the Earth's \n     average temperature can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years''.\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years, the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) The Environmental Protection Agency has found that \n     global warming may harm the United States by altering crop \n     yields, accelerating sea level rise, and increasing the \n     spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention of Climate Change, done at New York on \n     May 9, 1992, the ultimate objective of which is the \n     ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system'', and \n     which stated in part ``the Parties to the Convention are to \n     implement policies with the aim of returning . . . to their \n     1990 levels anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and \n     other greenhouse gases.''\n       (7) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (8) The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change further states that ``developed country Parties should \n     take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse \n     effects thereof'', as these nations are the largest historic \n     and current emitters of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) Senate Resolution 98 of July 1997, which expressed that \n     developing nations, especially the largest emitters, must \n     also be included in any future, binding climate change treaty \n     and such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the \n     United States economy, should not cause the United States to \n     abandon its shared responsibility to help find a solution to \n     the global climate change dilemma.\n       (10) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will respond to the threat of global warming.\n       (11) The United States has benefitted and will continue to \n     benefit from investments in the research, development and \n     deployment of a range of clean energy and efficiency \n     technologies that can mitigate global warming and that can \n     make the United States economy more productive, bolster \n     energy security, create jobs, and protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the United \n     States Congress that the United States should demonstrate \n     international leadership and responsibility in mitigating the \n     health, environmental, and economic threats posed by global \n     warming by--\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors;\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, emissions trading and carbon sequestration \n     projects that will reduce, avoid, and sequester greenhouse \n     gas emissions; and\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal at the next meeting of the \n     Conference of the Parties, with the objective of securing \n     United States' participation in a revised Kyoto Protocol or \n     other future binding climate change agreements in a manner \n     that is consistent with the environmental objectives of the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, that protects the \n     economic interests of the United States, and recognizes the \n     shared international responsibility for addressing climate \n     change, including developing country participation.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Climate Change Strategy\n\n     SEC. 1011.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change;\n       (2) in 1992, the Senate ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York on \n     May 9, 1992, the ultimate objective of which is the \n     ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system'';\n       (3) although science currently cannot determine precisely \n     what atmospheric concentrations are ``dangerous'', the \n     current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a \n     continued rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere, not stabilization;\n       (4) the remaining scientific uncertainties call for \n     temperance of human actions, but not inaction;\n       (5) greenhouse gases are associated with a wide range of \n     human activities, including energy production, \n     transportation, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, \n     buildings, and other activities;\n       (6) the economic consequences of poorly designed climate \n     change response strategies, or of inaction, may cost the \n     global economy trillions of dollars;\n       (7) a large share of this economic burden would be borne by \n     the United States;\n       (8) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere will require transformational change in the global \n     energy system and other emitting sectors at an almost \n     unimaginable level--a veritable industrial revolution is \n     required;\n       (9) such a revolution can occur only if the revolution is \n     preceded by research and development that leads to bold \n     technological breakthroughs;\n       (10) over the decade preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act--\n       (A) energy research and development budgets in the public \n     and private sectors have declined precipitously and have not \n     been focused on the climate change response challenge; and\n       (B) the investments that have been made have not been \n     guided by a comprehensive strategy;\n       (11) the negative trends in research and development \n     funding described in paragraph (10) must be reversed with a \n     focus on not only traditional energy research and \n     development, but also bolder, breakthrough research;\n       (12) much more progress could be made on the issue of \n     climate change if the United States were to adopt a new \n     approach for addressing climate change that included, as an \n     ultimate long-term goal--\n       (A) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system; and\n       (B) a response strategy with 4 key elements consisting of--\n       (i) definition of interim emission mitigation levels, that, \n     coupled with specific mitigation approaches and after taking \n     into account actions by other nations (if any), would result \n     in stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations;\n       (ii) technology development, including--\n\n       (I) a national commitment to double energy research and \n     development by the United States public and private sectors; \n     and\n       (II) in carrying out such research and development, a \n     national commitment to provide a high degree of emphasis on \n     bold, breakthrough technologies that will make possible a \n     profound transformation of the energy, transportation, \n     industrial, agricultural, and building sectors of the United \n     States;\n\n       (iii) climate adaptation research that--\n\n       (I) focuses on response actions necessary to adapt to \n     climate change that may have already occurred; and\n       (II) focuses on response actions necessary to adapt to \n     climate change that may occur under any future climate change \n     scenario; and\n\n       (iv) climate science research that--\n\n       (I) builds on the substantial scientific understanding of \n     climate change that exists as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act; and\n       (II) focuses on resolving the remaining scientific, \n     technical, and economic uncertainties to aid in the \n     development of sound response strategies; and\n\n       (13) inherent in each of the 4 key elements of the response \n     strategy is consideration of the international nature of the \n     challenge, which will require--\n       (A) establishment of joint climate response strategies and \n     joint research programs;\n       (B) assistance to developing countries and countries in \n     transition for building technical and institutional \n     capacities and incentives for addressing the challenge; and\n       (C) promotion of public awareness of the issue.\n\n     SEC. 1013.

Where there is more than one OCS Production \n     State within 200 miles of a leased tract, the amount of each \n     OCS Production State's payment under paragraph (d)(2) for \n     such leased tract shall be inversely proportional to the \n     distance between the nearest point on the coastline of such \n     State and the geographic center of each leased tract or \n     portion of the leased tract (to the nearest whole mile) that \n     is within 200 miles of that coastline, as determined by the \n     Secretary. A leased tract or portion of a leased tract shall \n     be excluded if the tract or portion is located in a \n     geographic area where a moratorium on new leasing was in \n     effect on January 1, 2001, unless the lease was issued prior \n     to the establishment of the moratorium and was in production \n     on January 1, 2001.\n       (f) Payments to OCS Political Subdivisions.--Thirty-five \n     percent of each OCS Production State's allocable share as \n     determined under subsection (e) shall be paid directly to the \n     OCS political subdivisions by the Secretary based on the \n     following formula:\n       (1) 25 percent shall be allocated based on the ratio of \n     such OCS political subdivision's population to the population \n     of all OCS political subdivisions in the OCS Production \n     State.\n       (2) 25 percent shall be allocated based on the ratio of \n     such OCS political subdivision's coastline miles to the \n     coastline miles of all OCS political subdivisions in the OCS \n     Production State. For purposes of this subsection, those OCS \n     political subdivisions without coastlines shall be considered \n     to have a coastline that is the average length of the \n     coastlines of all political subdivisions in the state.\n       (3) 50 percent shall be allocated based on the relative \n     distance of such OCS political subdivision from any leased \n     tract used to calculate that OCS Production State's \n     allocation using ratios that are inversely proportional to \n     the distance between the point in the coastal political \n     subdivision closest to the geographic center of each leased \n     tract or portion, as determined by the Secretary. For \n     purposes of the calculations under this subparagraph, a \n     leased tract or portion of a leased tract shall be excluded \n     if the leased tract or portion is located in a geographic \n     area where a moratorium on new leasing was in effect on \n     January 1, 2001, unless the lease was issued prior to the \n     establishment of the moratorium and was in production on \n     January 1, 2001.\n       (g) Failure To Have Plan Approved.--Any amount allocated to \n     an OCS Production State or OCS political subdivision but not \n     disbursed because of a failure to have an approved Plan under \n     this section shall be allocated equally by the Secretary \n     among all other OCS Production States in a manner consistent \n     with this subsection except that the Secretary shall hold in \n     escrow such amount until the final resolution of any appeal \n     regarding the disapproval of a plan submitted under this \n     section. The Secretary may waive the provisions of this \n     paragraph and hold an OCS Production State's allocable share \n     in escrow if the Secretary determines that such State is \n     making a good faith effort to develop and submit, or update, \n     a Plan.\n       (h) Use of Amounts Allocated by the Secretary.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts allocated by the Secretary under \n     subsection (d) may be used\n\n[[Page S1320]]\n\n     only in accordance with a plan approved pursuant to \n     subsection (c) for--\n       (A) activities to secure critical OCS energy infrastructure \n     facilities from human or natural threats; and\n       (B) support of any necessary public service or \n     transportation activities that are needed to maintain the \n     safety and operation of critical OCS energy infrastructure \n     facilities.\n       (2) Restoration of coastal wetland.--For the purpose of \n     subparagraph (1)(A), restoration of any coastal wetland shall \n     be considered to be an activity that secures critical OCS \n     energy infrastructure facilities from a natural threat.\n       (i) Failure To Have Use.--Any amount allocated to an OCS \n     political subdivision but not disbursed because of a failure \n     to have a qualifying use as described in subsection (h) shall \n     be allocated by the Secretary to the OCS Production State in \n     which the OCS political subdivision is located except that \n     the Secretary shall hold in escrow such amount until the \n     final resolution of any appeal regarding the use of the \n     funds.\n       (j) Compliance With Authorized Uses.--If the Secretary \n     determines that any expenditure made by an OCS Production \n     State or an OCS political subdivision is not consistent with \n     the uses authorized in subsection (h), the Secretary shall \n     not disburse any further amounts under this section to that \n     OCS Production State or OCS political subdivision until the \n     amounts used for the inconsistent expenditure have been \n     repaid or obligated for authorized uses.\n       (k) Rulemaking.--The Secretary may promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes \n     of this section, including rules and regulations setting \n     forth an appropriate process for appeals.\n       (l) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are hereby \n     authorized to be appropriated $450,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 2003 through 2008 to carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/27/senate-section/article/S1320-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
