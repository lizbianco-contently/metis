Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, Mr. Corzine, is recognized to read George Washington's \nFarewell Address.\n  Mr. CORZINE. In September 1796, worn out by burdens of the presidency \nand attacks of political foes, George Washington announced his decision \nnot to seek a third term. With the assistance of Alexander Hamilton and \nJames Madison, Washington composed in a ``Farewell Address'' his \npolitical testament to the nation. Designed to inspire and guide future \ngenerations, the address also set forth Washington's defense of his \nadministration's record and embodied a classic statement of Federalist \ndoctrine.\n  Washington's principal concern was for the safety of the eight-year-\nold Constitution. He believed that the stability of the Republic was \nthreatened by the forces of geographical sectionalism, political \nfactionalism, and interference by foreign powers in the nation's \ndomestic affairs. He urged Americans to subordinate sectional \njealousies to common national interests. Writing at a time before \npolitical parties had become accepted as vital extraconstitutional, \nopinion-focusing agencies, Washington feared that they carried the \nseeds of the nation's destruction through petty factionalism. Although \nWashington was in no sense the father of American isolationism, since \nhe recognized the necessity of temporary associations for \n``extraordinary emergencies,'' he did counsel against the establishment \nof ``permanent alliances with other countries,'' connections that he \nwarned would inevitably be subversive of America's national interest.\n  Washington did not publicly deliver his Farewell Address. It first \nappeared on September 19, 1796, in the Philadelphia Daily American \nAdvertiser and then in papers around the country.\n  In January 1862, with the Constitution endangered by civil war, a \nthousand citizens of Philadelphia petitioned Congress to commemorate \nthe forthcoming 130th anniversary of George Washington's birth by \nproviding that ``the Farewell Address of Washington be read aloud on \nthe morning of that day in one or the other of the Houses of \nCongress.'' Both houses agreed and assembled in the House of \nRepresentatives' chamber on February 22, 1862, where Secretary of the \nSenate John W. Forney ``rendered `The Farewell Address' very \neffectively,'' as one observer recalled.\n  The practice of reading the Farewell Address did not immediately \nbecome a tradition. The address was first read in regular legislative \nsessions of the Senate in 1888 and the House in 1899. (The House \ncontinued the practice until\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\n1984.) Since 1893 the Senate has observed Washington's birthday by \nselecting one of its members to read the Farewell Address. The \nassignment alternates between members of each political party. At the \nconclusion of each reading, the appointed senator inscribes his or her \nname and brief remarks in a black, leather-bound book maintained by the \nsecretary of the Senate.\n  The version of the address printed here is taken from the original of \nthe final manuscript in the New York Public Library provided courtesy \nof The Papers of George Washington. The only changes have been to \nmodernize spelling, capitalization, and punctuation.\n  Mr. CORZINE, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\nTo the people of the United States.\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, \npatriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto\n\n[[Page S981]]\n\nyour sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who in any quarter may endeavor to \nweaken its hands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\nwill impair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot \nbe directly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary purpose. And there \nbeing constant danger of excess, the effort ought to be by force of \npublic opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, \nit demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into a flame, \nlest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\ngreat nation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example \nof a people always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who \ncan doubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a \nplan would richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by \na steady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected \nthe permanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful must be impartial; else it becomes the \ninstrument of the very influence to be avoided, instead of a defense \nagainst it. Excessive partiality for one foreign nation and excessive \ndislike for another cause those whom they actuate to see danger only on \none side, and serve to veil and even second the arts of influence on \nthe other. Real patriots, who may resist the intrigues of the favorite, \nare liable to become suspected and odious, while its tools and dupes \nusurp the applause and confidence of the people to surrender their \ninterests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfuenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                  GEO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. GREGG. I seek recognition under morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to speak about an issue that I \nhave spoken about a number of times on the floor in my term of office, \nand that is the issue of Social Security and how we reform it and how \nwe make it solvent. I would make it a system that continues to support \nour senior citizens as they retire. And more importantly, it \naddresses--or equally importantly, it addresses the needs of the next \ngeneration, a very large generation, as it heads into retirement and \ndoes so in a solvent way, a way that doesn't bankrupt either our Nation \nor leave our senior citizens without adequate resources to live a good \nlife once they retire.\n  I was extraordinarily disappointed, extraordinarily disappointed, to \nread an article in the Washington Post which was picked up, I guess, in \na variety of different ways by different news sources, so it was not \nunique to the Post's view. It was entitled ``Democrats View Social \nSecurity as Election Issue'' and it went on to talk about a letter that \nhad been sent jointly by the minority leader of the House, Congressman \nGephardt, and the majority leader of the Senate, Senator Daschle, which \nessentially raised the red shirt of Social Security, and basically laid \nout a political agenda versus a substantive issue for correcting the \nproblems which we face in Social Security. It is extraordinarily ironic \nbut unfortunately consistent with the policies of some Members of the \nother side of the aisle that they would use Social Security as a \npolitical club for the purposes of attacking Members of my side of the \naisle.\n  This is now unique. It is not new. In fact, when I served in the \nHouse of Representatives, I had the good fortune to serve under a very \nstrong leader of the House, Congressman ``Tip'' O'Neill from \nMassachusetts, and I got to know him personally while we didn't \nnecessarily agree on everything. But I got to know him very well, and \nhe was from neighboring states. I once asked what was going to be the \nissues that we would hear about as Republicans running in the next \nelection. I think this was in 1986, 1985. And he told me, we were going \nto hear about three issues from his folks. No. 1, we were going to hear \nabout Social Security. No. 2, we were going to hear about Social \nSecurity. And No. 3, we were going to hear about Social Security.\n  And, unfortunately, that's the way it proceeded. But that's not \nconstructive to resolving the issue of Social Security. In this \nCongress, in the Senate especially, we have had a number of people who \nhave attempted from both sides of the aisle to be positive and \nconstructive forces on resolving issues of Social Security, but \npoliticizing it certainly doesn't accomplish that.\n  In fact, the recent commission which it appears this letter was built \naround as a purpose of attack, was headed by the former Senator from \nthis body, Senator Moynihan, who was an extremely positive force for \ngood governing in this country. I again didn't always agree with \nSenator Moynihan but I admired him as a Senator and as a thoughtful \nperson on public policy. The commission which was headed by Senator \nMoynihan appears--and which put forward a series of proposals as to how \nwe could address the Social Security issue--appears to be the focal \npoint which is going to be used to try to leapfrog into an issue of \npolitics on the question of Social Security.\n  This is unfortunate because that commission attempted in a sincere \nand aggressive way to be a positive force for a discussion on the issue \nof how to make Social Security solvent.\n  Let's return to the fundamental underlying problems involved in the \nSocial Security debate, and how we address them. To begin with, there \nis the question of the Social Security trust fund. It is a concept \nwhich has been created over the years, under which citizens who pay \ninto Social Security have a right to put a claim against. As a \npractical matter, there is no trust fund. We all know that. What senior \ncitizens have in our country is a right to claim on younger citizens, \nworking citizens of our country the right to a certain amount of their \ntax dollars to support them, the senior citizens in retirement.\n  That is the basic agreement that has been reached under the terms of \nSocial Security. What you pay into the Social Security system has \nabsolutely no relationship to what you get out of the\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nSocial Security system in the long run. For example, if you were a \nsenior citizen today who retired in the mid-1960s or late 1970s, or \nlate 1960s or late 1970s or even into the 1980s, you essentially paid \ninto the system only a fraction, a fraction of what you have received \nback from the system in the form of benefits. Ironically, if you happen \nto be a young person working today, say you're in your 20s, especially \nif you're an African American, what you are going to pay into the \nsystem for what you're going to get back from the system is going to be \nmore, actually more in the terms of taxes than what you will receive in \nbenefits.\n  So it really doesn't depend on how much you paid into the system as \nto what you received in the system. It depends more on when you were \nborn and when you started contributing to the system and when you \nretire. And that's why the system rather than being a fully funded \nsystem, essentially is a system which says to one generation, you shall \nsupport the older generation.\n  To put it another way, rather than owning assets, what the Social \nSecurity system owes is the right to raise and take taxes from working \nAmericans. And to use those taxes to pay for the benefits of people who \nare retired. That is what the Social Security system essentially owns.\n\n  Throughout the 1990s and even today or most of the 1990s, beginning \nthe early part of the 1990s, the Social Security system began taking in \na lot more money than it was paying out. So you might say, well, where \ndid that money go? Isn't that money sitting there as an asset which a \nsenior citizen down the road can take advantage of? Actually, no, it is \nnot.\n  Where that money went was to operate the Federal Government. For \nyears the Social Security excess payments were used to pay for the day-\nto-day operation of the government. And in exchange for that, the \nSocial Security system received a note, a debt from the Federal \nGovernment. What did that mean? That debt essentially meant that when \nthe Social Security system needed money, they could come to the General \nTreasury or the taxpayers of America, and say, pay us on this note. But \nwhen the notes weren't there during that period from about 1975 to \nabout 1987 when the Social Security system was running a deficit--in \nother words, it was taking in less money in taxes than it was paying \nout--during that period when the Social Security system had no notes to \ntheoretically repossess or reclaim or get back, the benefit payments \ncontinued to be made.\n  And it was tied not to the fact that there was a note but it was tied \nto the fact that the American public believed that there was a standard \nof living and a standard of benefit which should be maintained for \npeople who are retired. And so the younger generation paid additional \ntaxes to support the older generation.\n  And now, of course, we are, as I mentioned, in a period of surplus, \nso there is enough money there to pay the older generation the benefits \nit needs. But beginning--and this is where the problem starts--in the \nyear 2008 when the baby-boom generation starts to retire and accelerate \nrather dramatically as the full baby-boom generation retires by the \nyear 2015, we will see the actual cash flow into the Social Security \nsystem not meeting the demands of the system.\n  In other words, we have a higher cost for benefits than we have \npayments coming in under the Social Security taxes. And so once again \nwe will be in a situation as we were in the mid-1970s and mid-1980s \nwhere the American worker, younger Americans will be asked to pay \nadditional taxes in order to support people who have retired in order \nto maintain their benefit level.\n  This will be a significant issue for us as a country. And this is the \nissue that the Moynihan Commission tried to address, the fact that \nbeginning in the year 2008, we will be back into a negative cash flow \nfrom a standpoint of Social Security taxes, and we have got to do \nsomething in order to maintain the benefits to senior citizens and give \nthem and assure them the promise that we have made to them. And the \nMoynihan Commission pointed out that this is not going to be like the \n1970 and 1980 period. This is going to be a much more severe stress on \nthe system because ironically, the size of the retiring generation will \nbe the largest in the history of our country.\n  To try to put it in perspective, in 1940, there were 100 people \npaying into the system to support one retiree. In 1950, there were 16 \npeople working and paying taxes into the system for every person who \nwas retired and taking benefits out of it. By 1990, we were down to 3.5 \npeople paying into the system. For every one person taking out. So we \nhave gone to a pyramid to almost a rectangle. Well, by the year 2020, \nbetween 2015 and 2020, we're essentially going to be at a rectangle. \nThere are only going to be two people paying into the system for every \none person taking out because this huge population boom that came after \nthe end of World War II, the post-war baby boom of which I am a member, \nPresident Clinton is a member. This generation is so large that it \nsimply is overwhelming the system.\n  The point that the Moynihan Commission was trying to make is we have \ngot to start planning for this. As a government and as a culture or we \nare going to suffer an extremely severe situation. And so they put \nforward three or four fairly reasonable proposals dealing with a very \nnarrow part of the resolution of the problem. Specifically, whether or \nnot today when we are running a surplus in the system--in other words, \nwhen people are paying in more taxes than are necessary to support the \nbenefits, should those taxes be used to support the general government, \nor should we allow people to keep some small percentage of the taxes \nthey are paying in today and allow them to take that money and put it \ninto some investment vehicle which would be controlled by the Social \nSecurity Administration. It would be much like the--what we as \ngovernment employees have, a Federal thrift savings plan. It would be a \nmarket basket of some sort of securities, very risk averse securities, \nsecurities that don't have a lot of risk. You would have three or four \nor maybe five choices.\n  Allow people to take a small percentage of their Social Security tax \nwhich they are paying in today which is not being used to support the \nSocial Security benefit but is instead being used today to operate the \ngeneral government and take that small percentage, 2 percent in most \ncases is what has been talked about out after 12.5 percent tax burden, \ntake that small percentage and put it into an asset which you, the wage \nearner, the working American, would actually own. It would be yours. \nYou wouldn't have to depend on the Federal Government, the largess of \nthe Federal Government to exist; you wouldn't have to depend on the \ngoodness of a bunch of folks here in the Senate to exist. It would \nphysically be your money. And if you happen to die before you reached \nage 59 or 60, that would go to your children, or to your family or to \nwhoever else you wanted it to go to. Under today's law, of course, if \nyou happen to work all your life and you have the misfortune of getting \nhit by a truck when you are 59, you get absolutely nothing out of the \nSocial Security system and your wife gets very little on top of that. \nThis would allow you to actually own that asset. It would allow all \nAmericans to actually realize wealth because every American would have \na savings account with real assets in it that could be used for their \nretirement.\n\n  But what does the rear of the other side of the aisle do? When a very \nresponsible former Senator of this body puts out talking points, simply \ntalking points as part of a commission resolution for how we might \naddress one small part of what is going to be the most severe fiscal \nand cultural issue we face as a country, particularly as we head into \nthe next decade? They start waving the red shirt. They start accusing \neverybody of trying to steal from senior citizens or trying to \nmanipulate the system to wipe out the benefits of senior citizens. They \nstart scaring people. How totally irresponsible can you be?\n  And then they say this is going to be their policy as a party. They \nsay the Democrats have used Social Security as the election issue. \nWell, we probably should debate Social Security as an election issue. \nWe ought to debate it responsibly. We ought to talk about ideas like \nthose that Senator Moynihan has proposed, like Senator Bob Kerrey \nproposed from the other side of the aisle, like Senator Breaux has \nproposed from the other side of the aisle,\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nlike former Senator Robb proposed on the other side of the aisle.\n  Those are the exact same ideas that Senator Moynihan proposed and yet \nwhen Senator Moynihan's commission proposes them, they suddenly become \nan issue of partisan nature that should be driven as a political issue \nand we will once again see those envelopes come out that are made to \nlook like Social Security checks which say urgent, open quickly, and \nwhen you open them, there will be a form from the Democratic National \nCommittee telling us, you are about to lose you Social Security because \nthe evil President and his commission headed up by Senator Pat \nMoynihan--they may not mention that--has suggested that a percentage of \nthe money that is being paid today, not by you the recipient but by \nworkers which is not only for you, the recipient to get your benefits \nbut is also important for those workers to get theirs when they retire, \nand that a percentage might be used as a savings account owned by \nindividuals in America, owned by the people who are paying excess taxes \nand Social Security today. We will get those letters. And you will get \nthe phone calls at dinner time saying your Social Security is going to \nbe lost if you're a senior citizen.\n  And once again, we will have an approach to Social Security which \ndoes absolutely nothing to address this critical public policy question \nbut does a great deal to poison the well so that it can't be addressed \nconstructively. This is such a crucial issue of public policy. It is \nabsolutely inexcusable that it is being promoted and addressed in such \na smear manner--cavalier manner. Listen to this language. The dangers \nof Social Security privatization has been tragically illustrated in \nrecent months by the fate of the Enron employees who lost their savings \nwhen Enron collapsed. How outrageously demagogic can you be to make \nthat type of a statement as an attack on the Moynihan proposal?\n  The Moynihan proposal didn't suggest investing in a single company. \nJust the opposite in fact. It suggested that a basket be used, a basket \nwhich would be under the supervision most likely of the Social Security \nAdministration. But because Enron has become the classic poster boy and \nappropriately so for fraudulent activity in the marketplace, there is \nan attempt here to merge the issue of Social Security and making it \nsolvent for the next generation with Enron. Pure despicable, political \ndemagoguery which makes one wonder if there is anybody in the \nleadership of the Democratic Party, at the National Committee or in the \nCongress who actually wants to solve the problem. I suspect there are \nvery few.\n  It appears most of the Senators on that side who did want to solve \nthe problem have decided to leave the Senate, unfortunately, and nobody \nhas stepped forward other than Senator Breaux, to pick up the flag. But \nwhat is very clear is that a number have stepped forward to pick up the \nflag of Tip O'Neill and the National Democratic Party, as they try to \npolarize the American public on this issue. At the expense of a \nresolution of the issue, and one wonders what we're going to say to \nsenior citizens who retire in the years 2015 and 2017, when we will be \nin a crisis. One wonders what we are going to say to our children who \nare working today and are coming into the working place and will have \nto have their taxes increased radically in order to meet the \nobligations of Social Security. One wonders what you're going to say to \nthe person, especially the African-American who's in their 20s today, \nwho has a likelihood that they will get less back from Social Security \nthan what they paid into it. What are you going to say to the person \ncoming into the work place who will have essentially no assets when \nthey retire?\n  Senator Moynihan and his commission has suggested you say to them, \nlet them start to build a nest egg that is in addition to the Social \nSecurity benefit, a guaranteed Social Security benefit. But even as \nmoderate a proposal as that, which was not even put out in the form of \nlegislative language, is attacked in the most flagrantly partisan \nmanner by the leadership of the House and the Senate. It is going to be \nhard to make substantive progress on the issue of Social Security if \nthis is going to be the reaction of Senator Daschle and Congressman \nGephardt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nbipartisan election reform legislation. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Jeffords, Burns, Leahy, Roberts, Brownback, Lincoln, Presiding \nOfficer Ben Nelson, and Senators Nickles, Dorgan, Johnson, and Enzi in \noffering this commonsense addition to the Voting Rights Act.\n  First, let me commend Senators Dodd, McConnell, Bond, and Schumer for \nworking together to find common ground on what could have very easily \nturned out to be an issue that foundered on partisan politics. They \nrefused to allow partisan politics to stand in the way of the \nfundamental and much-needed safeguards included in this election reform \nbill. I applaud their efforts, and I believe the amendment I am putting \nforward is consistent with their efforts and will pose a modest \nimprovement to their legislation.\n  This legislation makes substantial improvements that will help \nimprove the voting system in every single State in America, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of it. The bill asks States to make major \nstrides toward assurance that all people who are eligible to vote are \nallowed to vote, that voting locations are accessible to our citizens \nwho are disabled, that a person is notified if his or her vote is \nincorrectly cast and given the opportunity to correct the error, and \nthat each person's vote is counted.\n  These voting safeguards are fundamental. They deserve Federal \nsupport. And since all States will be required to implement these new \nvoting standards, no State should be denied Federal financial \nassistance in complying with these new requirements.\n  The election reform bill authorizes $3.5 billion in grants to States \nand localities to help cover the costs associated with meeting the new \nstandards. While the grant amounts are generous, there is a flaw. There \nis no guarantee in the bill that each State will receive a meaningful \nportion of the total allocation, even though each and every State must \nmeet the same voting system requirements. Indeed, for a smaller State \nsuch as Nebraska or Maine, it may well be more burdensome to meet those \nvoting requirements because those States may well have fewer resources \nto do so.\n  For that matter, there is no guarantee that Congress will appropriate \nall or even a substantial portion of the authorized funds. Election \nofficials in my home State of Maine, including our secretary of state, \nare concerned that the nature of the grant program would make it \ndifficult for Maine to compete for funds with larger States, as well as \npotentially thousands of local governments. Maine currently has its \nhands full addressing a structural budget shortfall of approximately \n$160 million. Its financial difficulties would be exacerbated if it did \nnot receive a meaningful portion of the grant funds included in this \nbill but nevertheless were required to comply with the statutory \nrequirements for improving voting systems, preparing the statewide \nvoting lists, and making voting places accessible to our disabled \ncitizens--all very worthy but costly goals.\n  Formula grant programs guarantee States a certain share of \nappropriated funds, but the grant program created by this bill does \nnot. Rather, the legislation creates three different project grant \nprograms to which States and local governments can apply for \nassistance. The grant programs are somewhat unusual in that once an \napplication is approved, the Attorney General is required to award the \napplicant funds covering the ``cost of the activities described in that \napplication.'' In other words, the legislation authorizes a specific \nsum of money to cover an unknown and perhaps unknowable amount of \ncosts. Thus, no State is guaranteed the funds necessary to make \nprogress toward this bill's voting system requirements.\n  Again, let me emphasize that I think the voting requirements set \nforth in this compromise legislation are reasonable, are fundamental, \nare worthwhile. But I am concerned that some States may not receive any \nFederal funds to assist them in meeting these worthwhile new standards, \nand that does not strike me as fair. Conceivably, moreover, the funds \ncould run out before a State has a chance to even complete and submit \nits application.\n  My amendment addresses these concerns in a straightforward way. It \nwould guarantee each State that submits the required application a fair \nportion of the funds that are eventually appropriated for election \nreform. My amendment would guarantee each State one-half of 1 percent \nof the total grant funds. These State minimums would only account for \nabout 25 percent of the total appropriated grant funds, thus leaving 75 \npercent of the funds to be allocated through the application process \noriginally set forth by this legislation. It would, however, remedy the \nproblem of a State, particularly a small State, receiving no funds \nwhatsoever. If we are going to mandate these requirements, we should \nensure that each and every State receives some Federal assistance to \ncomply with them.\n  My amendment is both fair and consistent with similar grant programs \ncreated by Congress. For example, the National Flood Insurance Program \nadministered by FEMA provides each State with a base funding amount of \none-half of 1 percent of appropriated\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\nfunds. The remaining 75 percent of the Flood Mitigation Assistance \nfunds is allocated by FEMA on the basis of applications. I could give \nmany other examples of Federal grant programs that include minimum \nState allocations so that every State can be helped in achieving the \nFederal goals set forth by the programs.\n  The Equal Protection of Voting Rights Act makes changes that will \nimprove the integrity of our State voting systems. All States will be \npartners in this effort, which is why no State should be denied a share \nof Federal funds. The amendment I offer ensures that just and fair \nresult. It will help each and every State meet the goals and the \nrequirements of this important reform legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague from Maine for \noffering this amendment. We talked about it. I think I offered the \namendment on behalf of my colleague from Maine when the Senate was not \nvoting, but we were in session and considering amendments at that time.\n  I think this is a good amendment. It is one that we probably should \nhave written into the bill initially. It is not unprecedented for us to \ntry to do this. Coming from a small State myself, I know what can \nhappen in this area.\n  I want to ask, if I could, my colleague only one question. She is \ntalking here about States and not localities. There are thousands of \nlocalities, obviously, in the 50 States, and we want to keep this \nfocused on the States themselves.\n  So my question is: The language of this amendment, the one-half of 1 \npercent, would apply to the respective States because there may be \napplications coming from localities for grants, and to that extent you \nwould have to accommodate that in terms of the total amount for that \nState?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, if I may respond to my colleague, his \ninterpretation is correct. The minimum amount applies just to the \nState.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for that clarification. \nAgain, I think this is one way of getting the resources out.\n  I point out, one of the issues raised is whether or not there will be \nan adequate amount in the authorization to meet all of the demands not \nonly of grants but also the minimum requirements in the bill. I inform \nmy colleagues that number is not selected out of thin air. We went and \nasked the Congressional Budget Office and others to give us an analysis \nof what would be needed if every single State in the country wanted to \ncompletely change their voting systems, what would be the ballpark \nfigure if that would occur--not that anyone would believe that is going \nto be the case. Many people are very satisfied with the election \nequipment they have and feel no need to change it at all.\n  But the number we have incorporated in the bill works on the maximum \nextent; that is, all jurisdictions in every single State wanting to \nreplace every voting system. If that were to occur, we would reach the \nnumber that is in the authorization of this bill. So we are more than \nsatisfied that the number we have identified as an authorizing figure \nwould accommodate virtually every jurisdiction in the country should \nthey so desire to exchange their present equipment. Nothing in this \nbill mandates that to occur at all, as we have repeated over and over.\n  Again, we believe very strongly that States ought to be allowed to \ndecide what works best for them. Many jurisdictions have come up with \nunique means of casting ballots, modernizing their systems completely. \nWe know about the States of Oregon and Washington, for instance, with \nmail-in voting. We took into consideration a week or so ago what \nSenator Cantwell, Senator Wyden, Senator Murray, and Senator Smith were \nall interested in: making sure that we do nothing in this bill that in \nany way impinges upon those two States being able to continue their \npresent voting system. Of course, we never intended to eliminate \nabsentee mail-in voting systems, and the language is as clear as it \ncould be here that would not be the case.\n  So, again, I state for the Record I think what the Senator from Maine \nhas offered is a very sound proposal. It would ensure that no State \nwould receive any less than $17.5 million. There may be an occasion, \nactually, when a State might not need that amount of money. And we are \nnot encouraging them necessarily to apply for $17.5 million unless they \nactually need it. But certainly it would guarantee, at the very least, \nthey would get that amount with respect to expenditures under the \nincentive grants.\n  So I commend the Senator from Maine for her proposal.\n  I see the arrival in the Chamber of my colleague from Kentucky. I \nwill listen to his comments on this amendment. We might even be able to \naccept this amendment today.\n  I prefer to clear up as many amendments as we could, to move them \nthrough the process so we can limit, to the maximum extent possible, \nthe number of rollcall votes we would ask our colleagues to cast \ntomorrow.\n  So with that, I thank my colleague from Maine for her proposal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Maine. I \nthink it is an excellent amendment that ensures that smaller States are \nable to obtain grant funds to improve their voting systems.\n  This amendment secures truly minimal amounts for each and every \nState, obligating only 25 percent of the overall amount authorized. So \nevery State, it seems to me, wins under this amendment.\n  I commend the Senator from Maine for her suggestion. It certainly is, \nas far as I know, agreeable on this side of the aisle.\n  I say to the Senator from Connecticut, I support the amendment and \nhope maybe we can accept it.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. I urge we accept the amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 2915.\n  The amendment (No. 2915) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut and \nthe Senator from Kentucky for agreeing to the amendment and working so \nclosely with us in its drafting. I very much appreciate their support \nas well as the tremendous work they have done on the underlying bill. I \nthank them both.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2922\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2922.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To clarify that the criminal penalties retain the current \n     specific intent standard contained in the underlying statutes)\n\n       On page 68, strike lines 5 through 13, and insert the \n     following:\n       (a) Conspiracy To Deprive Voters of a Fair Election.--Any \n     individual who knowingly and willfully gives false \n     information in registering or voting in violation of section \n     11(c) of the National Voting Rights Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. \n     1973i(c)), or conspires with another to violate such section, \n     shall be fined or imprisoned, or both, in accordance with \n     such section.\n       (b) False Information in Registering and Voting.--Any \n     individual who knowingly commits fraud or knowingly makes a \n     false\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\n     statement with respect to the naturalization, citizenry, or \n     alien registry of such individual in violation of section \n     1015 of title 18, United States Code, shall be fined or \n     imprisoned, or both, in accordance with such section.\n\n  Mr. DODD. This is the amendment we raised earlier. I thought it was \ngoing to be accepted. This is the one that references the criminal \nstatutes in the bill specifically and repeats the words ``knowing'' and \n``willful.'' I talked about this earlier as a way of reemphasizing the \npoint that there is a standard used on existing criminal statutes that \nis applicable here, to which we had agreed. It should be accepted.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, pending the arrival of one of our colleagues \nwho wants to look at the amendment, let me address the status of play \nas to where we are, coming back from the Presidents Day recess.\n  It is my privilege once again to be managing the pending matter \nbefore the Senate, the Equal Protection Voting Rights Act, as amended \nby the bipartisan compromise substitute. Let me advise colleagues and \nothers where we stand.\n  Last Thursday, the Senate entered into a unanimous consent agreement \ngoverning the remaining amendments to this measure. That agreement \nprovides for a finite list of first-degree amendments which can be \noffered to this bill; relevant second-degree amendments are in order. \nUpon the disposition of the ordered amendments, the Senate would \nproceed to third reading of the bill and final passage. That was done, \nmy colleagues may recall, to expedite matters for Members who wanted to \nget back for the Presidents Day break to their respective States. \nRather than carry votes on into Friday and Saturday to finish the bill, \nwe agreed to that unanimous consent request that the distinguished \nmajority leader and the Republican leader worked out.\n  We adopted an amendment by Senator Gregg of New Hampshire that was \nincorporated as part of the bill and then agreed to this unanimous \nconsent request to have a finite list of amendments and then go to \nthird reading of the bill to complete the matter.\n  My hope is we can complete consideration of this bill by tomorrow \nafternoon or tomorrow evening. It may go into Wednesday, depending upon \nthe schedule. My hope is we can get it done soon.\n  Let me tell my colleagues where we stand with the number \nof amendments. Having said we will get through by tomorrow, when I tell \nthem how many amendments have been introduced, they may wonder what I \ncould possibly be thinking of to suggest we might get through by then. \nThere are 105 amendments. This is one of the dangers of asking for a \nfinite list. All of a sudden you get a finite list.\n\n  One hundred five amendments are in order under the unanimous consent \nagreement. I don't expect all of these to be offered. In fact, many are \nduplicative amendments or issues we had already resolved with previews \namendments that were adopted or rejected in the debate a week and a \nhalf ago. It is my hope we can complete action by tomorrow evening or, \nat the very latest, on Wednesday.\n  There will be no rollcall votes today, as the distinguished majority \nleader indicated. I expect tomorrow to be a busy day if we are unable \nto resolve some of these outstanding amendments.\n  There are six amendments pending at this time. In the week of our \ndeparture, we disposed of 15 amendments in 1 day. Nine amendments were \nadopted; four amendments were debated, subject to rollcall votes--all \nrejected--and two amendments were offered and withdrawn. All in all, \nthat is not a bad work effort for a day and a half.\n  The majority and minority Rules Committee staff worked over the \nweekend to try to clear those amendments for which we have language, \nand there are about 40 amendments--about half the 105 I mentioned--that \nare unknown. They are called relevant amendments. That could be any \nsubject matter, other than being relevant to elections. So to the \nextent those relevant amendments may have some text to them, I urge the \nauthors to let us know as soon as possible what those relevant \namendments are. Some we may actually be able to clear today; others, we \nmay not. I suspect many of them may just be placeholders, so that the \n105 number is substantially less. And when we get down to the number \nthat actually require some votes, we may be talking about 10 or 12. My \nhope is that there are far fewer than that.\n  If there are authors of relevant amendments who want them to be \nconsidered, they should let us know today. I hope we can also clear the \nsix pending amendments. These are amendments that we could hopefully \nadopt or modify in some way, if they require such for acceptance to \nboth sides. That would leave tomorrow with only those matters that \nrequire some debate.\n  That is where we stand. Again, I thank the majority leader and \nminority leader, my colleague from Kentucky, and others for getting us \nto this point.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a lead editorial of the New York Times \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 25, 2002]\n\n                         Electoral Repair Work\n\n       In the next few days, senators will have a chance to \n     greatly strengthen America's democracy. Beyond approving the \n     House version of the campaign finance reform bill and sending \n     it directly to the White House, the Senate should hasten to \n     pass the election reform legislation it is scheduled to \n     consider. Overwhelming support for these twin moves would \n     send a strong signal that cleansing democracy is not a \n     partisan issue, and would counter public cynicism about \n     Washington's priorities.\n       The Senate's election reform bill is a fitting federal \n     response to the public's widespread outrage at the breakdown \n     of the electoral machinery in the 2000 presidential election. \n     The closeness of the vote in Florida and elsewhere revealed \n     an array of deficiencies in how local officials administer \n     elections. While many were stunned by this, minority voters \n     and those with disabilities were not. They have long been \n     marginalized by arbitrary rules, less reliable equipment and \n     voting booths that are inaccessible.\n       The legislation would establish mandatory federal standards \n     for voting procedures and technologies that state and local \n     election officials would have to meet when administering \n     national elections. All voting systems would have to conform \n     to a set error rate, be accessible to people with \n     disabilities and allow voters a chance to correct ballots \n     improperly marked. States would have to establish a \n     computerized voter registration list and offer people whose \n     registration is questioned at the polls a provisional ballot \n     pending a clarification of their status. The bill makes \n     available $3.5 billion in grants over five years for states \n     to meet these federal mandates.\n       The franchise is the primary right by which all other \n     rights are protected, as Thomas Paine wisely said. A ballot \n     cast for president anywhere in Florida ought to be recorded \n     and counted as rigorously as one cast in Alaska, not to \n     mention in an adjacent county. Democracy is diminished when \n     millions of ballots are discarded due to faulty technology or \n     a lack of clear voting guidelines.\n       Senators should not lose sight to these guiding principles \n     in any last-minute wrangling over amendments. If is \n     refreshing that a number of Republican senators, including \n     John McCain and Mitch McConnell, have joined with Democrats \n     to support the notion that to protect the franchise, the \n     federal government must encroach on the states' traditional \n     prerogative of running elections.\n       There is cause to be hopeful that states will start \n     receiving federal assistance this year to upgrade their \n     voting systems. The Senate's election reform bill is \n     preferable to one passed by the House last December, which \n     does not impose strong enough national standards, but their \n     differences can be bridged at a House-Senate conference. \n     House Speaker Dennis Hastert has indicated his willingness to \n     seek supplemental funds for election reform, and President \n     Bush's budget includes $400 million in each of the next three \n     years. That won't be enough, but it is a clear indication \n     that the White House is counting on reform legislation. So \n     too are the American people.\n\n  Mr. DODD. This lead editorial captured what we are trying to do. I \nnote that the editorial writers specifically commended the Senator from \nKentucky and point out the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from \nArizona are together on this bill and talked about the bipartisanship \nof this proposal.\n\n[[Page S991]]\n\n  Many thought we could never actually come to the floor of the Senate \nwith a proposal on election reform that would enjoy the cosponsorship \nof Democrats and Republicans, particularly when you consider what a \npartisan division there was in the country a year ago at this time \ncoming off the November 2000 general election. So it is no small \nachievement.\n  I know a lot of attention is being paid to campaign finance reform \nand the upcoming energy bill and other matters. Memories do fade, and \ncertainly they have with regard to the emotions that ran so deeply and \nso passionately a year or so ago on one of the closest elections, if \nnot the closest, in American history.\n  Certainly there was the revelation that our system was in desperate \nneed of repair. We are responding to that call a year later. But it \ntook that long to sit down and work out differences and bring a product \nto the floor of the Senate. We could have come up here earlier with a \npartisan bill. I could have laid down a proposal that was just a \nDemocratic proposal. In fact, I had one, with every single member of \nthe Democratic side having cosponsored the bill, without a single \nRepublican. My friends on the Republican side could have had their \nbill, and we would have been able to have a screaming match about \npartisan politics, and nothing would have happened. So it took a real \neffort to try to meld these ideas together to bring us to this point.\n  We are not without controversy in this bill, and there will be some \ncontroversy in the remaining hours. We still have to go to conference \nwith the House of Representatives and their proposal and then present \nit to the President for his signature. It is my hope that we can do \nthat fairly quickly.\n  This bill has $400 million in it for immediate authorization. The \nPresident, to his credit, put $1.2 billion in his budget for the next 2 \nor 3 years for election reform. If we can get this bill done and signed \nby the President, there is a supplemental appropriations bill coming up \nquickly, and we can actually make moneys available to the States right \naway for them to modernize their election systems so they will be in \nplace to work by the November elections of this year. That will be a \nsingular achievement, in my view, if we are able to do that.\n  I am hopeful that for the remainder of today, and tomorrow, we will \nbe able to resolve these differences. I urge my colleagues to \nunderstand that I embrace some of their ideas. But we are interested in \nputting together a bipartisan bill. If I were writing it myself, it \nwould look different than this bill looks. I know, without asking my \nfriend from Kentucky to comment, if he could write the bill, it would \nlook very different than it does today as well. But that is not how \nmatters get resolved in a democracy and in an institution such as the \nSenate. You have to listen to the views of each Senator and try to \naccommodate them so you can put together a proposal that satisfies all \nof our needs and improves the American election system, regardless of \nparty. That is what we have tried to do with this proposal.\n  So I am very hopeful that that will be done in the next 24 hours and \nthat we can then sit down with the other body and resolve the \ndifferences. Maybe this will not attract the same degree of attention \nas campaign finance reform, but this will establish permanent election \ncommissions in this country--the idea of the Senator from Kentucky--\nwhich will deal with the issue of fraud in the country. We will say to \nmillions of Americans who have never been able to vote in private or \nindependently, for the first time they will be able to do so, setting \nminimal standards for provisional voting and statewide registration. My \nhope is that in the next few days we can resolve that. This will not \nattract the attention that some other matters do, but it will be one of \nthe singular achievements of the 107th Congress.\n\n  My colleague from Arizona is on his way to the floor and will speak \non an unrelated matter. When he does, I will be glad to yield to him. \nLet me make some points on this pending amendment so Members understand \nwhat I am suggesting here.\n  I pointed out that in the compromise bill, the substitute, we wanted \nto keep the same criminal intent standard provisions that are in \nexisting law when it comes to the fraud provisions. That language \nspecifically refers to ``knowing and willful'' as the standard. What we \nhave done is referenced those provisions very explicitly in the bill. \nThis amendment is purely a technical amendment in that it clarifies the \nstandard for criminal penalties in the same manner it was done in \nearlier legislation. It is accomplished under the cross-reference \nstatute that we cite in the bill.\n  Our stated intent under this compromise was to ensure that with \nregard to any false statements made under this bill, the provisions of \ntitles 18 and 42 of the U.S. Code would apply. The standard for review \nunder title 18 is a ``knowing'' standard. This amendment merely adds \nthat word to ensure that the intent is clear. Similarly, with regard to \npotential allegations of conspiracy, the compromise references of title \n42 provide for criminal penalties and the standard for review under \nthat act is ``knowingly and willfully.'' So this amendment merely adds \nthe current legal standard of review to the existing provisions in 401 \nand 402 of this bill.\n  This is not a substantive amendment but merely restates what we have \nstated in the bill. That is the reason I proposed it this afternoon--to \nmake that technical clarification.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S991-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S991-S993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HAPPY BIRTHDAY SENATOR EDWARD KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on February 22, 1962, the youngest of Joseph \nand Rose Kennedy's nine children, Edward, was standing in front of the \nBerlin Wall listening to a speech by his brother, Attorney General \nRobert Kennedy. It was Edward Kennedy's birthday. He was turning 30 \nyears of age. Later that year, he ran for the Senate. On November 6, \n1962, he was elected to that very historic Senate seat--a seat that had \nbeen held not only by his brother, but also by John Quincy Adams, by \nCharles Sumner, by Henry Cabot Lodge, and by the great Daniel Webster.\n  Now, I relate that story not only to bring notice to this milestone \nyear in the career of Senator Ted Kennedy, but also to bring notice \nthat February 22, 2002, was a very special day in the life of the \nsenior--perhaps I should now say the ``very'' senior--Senator from \nMassachusetts. This year marks 40 years since Edward Kennedy won the \nelection to begin his distinguished career as a United States Senator, \nwhile last Friday marked the 70th anniversary of his birth. Oh, to be \n70 again. It makes me pause, to be 70 again. I still cannot believe \nthis young, 28-year-old fellow who was running around West Virginia \ncampaigning for his brother during the crucial 1960 West Virginia \nprimary is now 70 years old.\n\n  The Psalmist says:\n\n       The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if \n     by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their \n     strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we \n     fly away.\n\n  Seventy years.\n  Yes, there he was, 28 years old, chubby cheeks, black hair, running \naround West Virginia campaigning for his brother. But he is 70 years \nold, and I want to wish him the happiest of birthdays.\n  I also wish to congratulate him for his very remarkable service in \nthe Senate. Forty years in the Senate means that Senator Kennedy is \nthird in seniority in the Senate. It means he has spent more than half \nof his life in the Senate. He is the fifth longest serving Senator in \nU.S. history. He has seen a Senate career marked by quality as well as \nlength of service. Millions of Americans are healthier today because of \nhis efforts for health reform. Many more Americans are better off \nbecause of his efforts to increase the minimum wage.\n  Ted Kennedy has dedicated his life to public service. He is a man of \nremarkable compassion and tenacity. He loves his country, and he has \nlabored mightily on behalf of his fellow citizens.\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\n  For four decades now he has served in this Senate and provided a \npowerful voice for the protection and the promotion of workers' rights, \nfor the protection of our environment, and for his stronger social \nsafety net for America's disadvantaged people.\n  For four decades he has provided a strong, eloquent voice for the \npoor, the oppressed, the downtrodden, the dispossessed.\n  For these and a host of other reasons, history will be good to \nSenator Kennedy. He has endured great tragedy in his own life; yet he \nhas dedicated himself toward improving the lives of others.\n  I consider myself to be privileged to serve with Senator Kennedy and \nto have him as my friend. I wish for him many more years of service.\n\n       ``How far away is the temple of fame?''\n       Said a youth at the dawn of the day.\n       He toiled and strove for a deathless name;\n       The hours went by and the evening came,\n       Leaving him old and feeble and lame,\n       To plod on his cheerless way.\n\n       ``How far away is the temple of good?''\n       Said another youth at the dawn of the day.\n       He toiled in the spirit of brotherhood,\n       To help and succor as best he could\n       The poor and unfortunate multitude,\n       In its hard and cheerless way.\n\n       He was careless alike of praise or blame,\n       But after his work was done,\n       An angel of glory from heaven came\n       To write on high his immortal name,\n       And to proclaim the truth that the temple of fame\n       And the temple of good are one.\n\n       For this is the lesson that history\n       Has taught since the world began;\n       That those whose memories never die,\n       But shine like stars in the human sky,\n       And brighter glow as the years go by,\n       Are the men who live for man.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before the distinguished leader leaves the \nChamber, I know at the appropriate time the Senator from Massachusetts \nwill want to respond to the wonderful comments of our colleague from \nWest Virginia.\n  I know the Senator from Massachusetts has received a lot of well-\ndeserved recognition over the last number of days, having achieved the \nmilestone of his 70th birthday. He will not receive any more gracious, \nmore thoughtful a gift than the one he has just received from his \nfriend from West Virginia, the person with whom he has served over \nthese 40 years and with whom he has been a partner on so many of the \nissues about which the Senator from West Virginia has talked.\n  When the annals of the latter part of the 20th century are written, \nthere will be those in coming generations--as I have been privileged to \ndo most recently with my colleague from Kentucky to fill out the \nportals in the reception room--going back in our history and \nidentifying those who served with unique distinction this wonderful \nbody over the plus-200 years of its existence.\n  I cannot say with any certainty what future generations will do, but \nI am quite certain that when they are debating and discussing what \nnames, what profiles ought to inhabit those eternal spots on the \nreception room wall the name of the Senator from West Virginia and the \nname of the Senator from Massachusetts will be on those lists.\n  My commendations to both Senators for their wonderful friendship \nwhich has been an example of people who had some differences when they \nbegan their careers. In fact, at times they disagreed on issues and \nmany more times they worked together. This country is a richer and \nbetter place because of their service.\n  I will have more remarks tomorrow about the service of our wonderful \nfriend from Massachusetts. I commend the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me add to the comments of my friend \nfrom Connecticut. It is interesting that the Senator from Connecticut \nmentioned the portraits outside the Senate and those who have been \nselected to have their likenesses there because of their great \ncontributions to the Senate.\n  I remember actually introducing the Senator from West Virginia at an \nevent in my State in which I made that very point: That in the future, \nwhen they are determining which great Senators of the current period to \nadd, the Senator from West Virginia will certainly be among them. In my \nview, he is the greatest orator in the Senate today and certainly in my \n18 years here, I have had a chance to listen to them all.\n  The Senator from West Virginia is without peer in this body. To \nlisten to his skills applied to our friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts is a treat on a Monday afternoon, and I thank him for his \ncontribution.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may regain the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank both of my colleagues for their thoughtful remarks.\n  May I say to my friend from Connecticut, the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and I had our differences in the early days \nof our careers. I came to find in Ted Kennedy one of the strongest \nsupporters when I became the Democratic leader of the Senate in 1977. \nHe was always one who stood alongside me and my work as the leader. I \ncould count on his support. We did not always vote alike, but he was \nvery supportive, and I treasured that support.\n  As time went on, Ted Kennedy, with whom I did not see eye to eye in \nthe early days, became one of my most loyal and dedicated friends in \nthe Senate. I am not saying we socialized together. I do not socialize \nwith very many people, if any, outside my own family, but as a friend \nhe proved himself to me one of the staunchest.\n  I remember that on my 80th birthday--Senator Kennedy just celebrated \nhis 70th--I was in West Virginia. I was dining on that birthday at the \nGovernor's mansion with a Republican Governor whom I had served in the \nState legislature in 1947. This was his second time to be Governor. He \nwas the youngest Governor of the State in the early 1950s, and then he \nwas the oldest Governor of the State up until a little under 2 years \nago. He was having me over at the mansion for lunch on that day with \nhim. I received a call from my chief of staff, Barbara Videnieks, \nsaying: Senator, guess who is here. Senator Kennedy is in your office.\n  I was in West Virginia, and he was in my office. She said: You know \nwhat. He has 80 red roses.\n  He brought 80 red roses to my office on that day. I thought that was \na unique moment in my life, unique perhaps in most lives, to have a \nfriend come by and bring 80 roses. It is unique to become 80 years old, \nfor one thing, but he was in my office with 80 roses.\n  Not only that but a couple of years ago, on my 63rd wedding \nanniversary, I was at the Greenbrier in West Virginia with my wife \nErma, and 63 red roses arrived to my room at the Greenbrier. Ted \nKennedy sent the roses. That is a very remarkable display of friendship \nin anybody's life. Not many people live to be married 63 years, but to \nlive to be married 63 years and then have a friend send 63 red roses is \nworthy of comment.\n  So that is the way it was--as Walter Cronkite used to say--on my \nbirthday, and then again on my wife's and my wedding anniversary. So I \nam grateful for the friendship of Ted Kennedy.\n  This earthly span of ours, even though the psalmist promised us 70 \nyears, is quite short after all.\n\n       The gay will laugh when thou art gone, the solemn brood of \n     care plod on, and each one as before will chase his favorite \n     phantom.\n\n  I believe those words are in William Cullen Bryant's ``Thanatopsis.''\n  That is about the way it is. So I take immense pleasure today in \ncoming to this Chamber and congratulating Ted Kennedy on his birthday \nand expressing my very best wishes to him and his lovely wife and to \nher father who contacts me almost every time I make a speech. Judge \nReggie calls my office and says he has been listening to my speeches. I \nbelieve he must have heard these remarks today.\n  Let me thank again my friend Chris Dodd and my friend Mitch \nMcConnell--one Democrat and one Republican--for their friendship as \nwell. I shall always treasure it. Senator Dodd is my seatmate, and very \noften he stops by my door and bids me good afternoon and offers some \nwell chosen words and comfort and cheer. I prize him as a treasured \nfriend. He is the chairman of the Rules Committee on which I serve with \nMitch McConnell, and I am all the richer for it.\n  I also thank Senator McConnell. He had me down in Kentucky. I say \ndown because it is south of West Virginia on\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\nthe map. He had me visit Kentucky a couple of years ago, a major \nuniversity there, and had me speak to a fine group of young people. He \ntreated me royally while I was there.\n  I thank both Senator McConnell and Senator Dodd for their service to \nthe Senate and to their country, and I thank them for their friendship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

After the 2000 election, the Census Bureau \n     asked thousands of non-voters why they did not vote. The top \n     reason for not voting, given by 22.6 percent of the \n     respondents, was that they were too busy or had a conflicting \n     work or school schedule.\n       (2) One of the recommendations of the National Commission \n     on Election Reform led by former Presidents Carter and Ford \n     is ``Congress should enact legislation to hold presidential \n     and congressional elections on a national holiday''. Holding \n     elections on the legal public holiday of Veterans Day, as \n     proclaimed by the President and observed by the Federal \n     government, may allow election day to be a national holiday \n     without adding the cost and administrative burden of an \n     additional holiday.\n       (3) Holding elections on a holiday or weekend could allow \n     more working people to vote more easily, potentially \n     increasing voter turnout. It could increase the pool of \n     available poll workers and make public buildings more \n     available for use as polling places. Holding elections over a \n     weekend could provide flexibility needed for uniform polling \n     hours.\n       (4) Several proposals to make election day a holiday or to \n     shift election day to a weekend have been offered in the \n     107th Congress. Any new voting day options should be \n     sensitive to the religious observances of voters of all \n     faiths and to our nation's veterans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2926\n\n(Purpose: To improve State recount and contest procedures in elections \n                          for Federal office)\n\n       On page 54, strike lines 22 and 23, and insert the \n     following:\n     necessary to provide such assistance;\n       (I)(i) the laws and procedures used by each State that \n     govern--\n       (I) recounts of ballots cast in elections for Federal \n     office;\n       (II) contests of determinations regarding whether votes are \n     counted in such elections; and\n       (III) standards that define what will constitute a vote on \n     each type of voting equipment used in the State to conduct \n     elections for Federal office;\n       (ii) the best practices (as identified by the Commission) \n     that are used by States with respect to the recounts and \n     contests described in clause (i); and\n       (iii) whether or not there is a need for more consistency \n     among State recount and contest procedures used with respect \n     to elections for Federal office; and\n       (J) such other matters as the Commission\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Madam President, I rise today with my good friend and \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, to encourage parents and \nschools throughout our country to celebrate National Read Across \nAmerica Day by reading to children. The resolution we submitted on \nFebruary 15th asks parents to read to their children for at least 30 \nminutes on March 2, the birthday of Dr. Seuss. The resolution also \nhonors Dr. Seuss for his success in helping to open children to the \njoys of reading.\n  Five years ago, the National Education Association conducted the \nfirst Read Across America Day by providing teachers with resources to \ncelebrate reading. The day was intended to promote reading activities \nnot just on the day of the celebration, but throughout the year. Dr. \nSeuss' birthday was chosen for the celebration because, in the words of \nthe NEA, ``he epitomizes a love of learning and his use of rhyme makes \nhis books an effective tool for teaching young children the basic \nskills they need to be successful.''\n  In the last 5 years, more than 40 national education and reading \nassociations have joined the NEA in making Read Across America the \nlargest celebration of reading in the world. Groups such as the \nAmerican Library Association, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, the \nInternational Reading Association, Reading is Fundamental, and the \nScreen Actors Guild all have assisted in raising the profile of reading \neducation and making this day a tremendous success.\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\n  The importance of this day and this resolution is underscored by the \nchallenge it addresses. Our Nation's early literacy problem is well \ndocumented. According to the National Institutes of Health, \napproximately 20 million school-age children have difficulty reading. \nOnly approximately 2.3 million of these children are served in special \neducation under the category of learning disabilities. The remaining \n17.7 million children who are poor readers do not meet the eligibility \nrequirements for the learning disability category. Some are provided \nassistance in the form of compensatory education, but others are \noverlooked altogether.\n  Often it is only after a child develops a significant problem that \nany intervention at all occurs. Typically, a child has reached the \nthird or fourth grade before reading failure is diagnosed. At that \npoint, what might have been a slight lag in learning had it been caught \nearly has developed into a more serious and challenging learning \ndisability. For students that have reached the third grade without the \nability to read, every paragraph, every assignment, every day in the \nclassroom is a struggle. They constantly battle embarrassment and \nfeelings of inadequacy, fearing that their classmates, their friends, \nwill discover they cannot read. It is no wonder so many children \nwithout basic reading skills lose their natural curiosity and \nexcitement for learning, for reading is the gateway to academic \nsuccess.\n  Last year, the President and Congress worked together to complete a \nmajor reform of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. With the \nenactment of the No Child Left Behind Act, two new programs, Reading \nFirst and Early Reading First, will bring new federal resources for \nreading instruction and early reading intervention. I am delighted that \nmy Reading First proposal was incorporated into the final education \nreform package, and even more excited that nearly $1 billion in Federal \nfunding has been allocated to this initiative in the first year. It is \nmy hope the new services will reach children before a problem develops \nand before they fall too far behind their peers.\n  Although I have great faith that these new programs will effectively \nreduce the rate of reading failure throughout our country, nothing can \nreplace the learning that takes place between parents and their \nchildren. Much of the learning and preparation that make reading \npossible occurs long before a child ever sets foot in a classroom. \nAccording to the National Center for Education Statistics, children who \nwere read to three or more times in a week by their parents are almost \ntwice as likely to be able to identify every letter of the alphabet. \nThey are also more likely to be able to count to 20, write their own \nnames, and read or pretend to read. It delights me to see the 2-year-\nold daughter of my chief of staff read to her stuffed animals. She \ntakes a book, sits with them on the couch, and pretends to read them a \nstory. When a child enters kindergarten already recognizing letters and \nfamiliar with books, she or he is better prepared to learn and less \nlikely to encounter difficulty in learning to read.\n  This year, the Maine Education Association is hosting festivities \nthroughout the State on Read Across America Day, and I hope to attend \nEliot Elementary School in York County this Friday to join in their \ncelebration of reading. I encourage my colleagues not only to support \nthis resolution, but also to make time to visit a classroom and help \nchildren discover the joys of reading. I can tell from first-hand \nexperience that taking the time to read to children is not only a \nworthwhile investment but also a wonderful experience, and I know the \nPresiding Officer reads often to her twin sons and experiences that \nsome joy. I have read to children in more than 70 schools across the \nState of Maine and never tire of the joy and satisfaction such \nexperiences bring.\n  I often read books by Maine authors, such as ``Blueberries for Sal,'' \nor ``Miss Rumphias'' to show children that they, too, can grow up to \nauthor books. I never tire of the joy and satisfaction of going into a \nclassroom and reading to children. Indeed, Madam President, the last \nschool I visited was the Edna Libby School in Standish, ME, a wonderful \nelementary school. I read to the students and I answered their \nquestions. Then the reading coordinator presented me with a pin that I \nam wearing today. It is the ``Read Across America'' pin. It pictures \nthe United States as well as Dr. Seuss's famous cat. That should be the \ninspiration for all of us.\n  The NEA has graciously agreed to donate one dozen Dr. Seuss books to \nany school visited by a Senator on Friday, March 1. I congratulate the \nNEA for the success of its Read Across America Program, and I applaud \nall of our schoolteachers, librarians, and most of all, our parents, \nfor their commitment for teaching reading.\n  I hope we can pass this resolution this week in time for Reading \nAcross America Day and bring even more attention to the benefits of \nparental involvement and reading to our children.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nCollins, in support of a resolution to declare March 2nd Read Across \nAmerica Day. We submitted this resolution, S. Res. 211, on February 15.\n  Read Across America Day is an annual reading motivation and awareness \nprogram begun by the National Education Association, and supported by \nmore than 40 national non-profit and association partners, including \nthe American Library Association, American Association of School \nLibrarians, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Girl Scouts of the USA, \nInternational Reading Association, Learning First Alliance, the Library \nof Congress--Center for the Book National Institute for Literacy, \nNational PTA, Reading Is Fundamental, and YMCA of the USA. The \ncelebration includes activities in schools, libraries, and communities \nacross the nation that bring reading excitement to children of all \nages.\n  March 2nd is a fitting day for such a celebration of reading, since \nit is the birthday of Theodore Geisel, otherwise known as Dr. Seuss, \nthe beloved children's author and illustrator. His books have inspired, \nand continue to inspire, generations of children to discover the joy of \nreading. Moreover, Dr. Seuss' inventive use of rhyme make his books an \nenormously effective tool for teaching basic reading skills to \nchildren.\n  According to the latest results of the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress (NAEP), from 1992 to 2000 the reading scores of \nfourth graders remained flat. What is most alarming is that the gap \nbetween the highest and lowest achieving students is widening--the \naverage score for top students increased, while the average score for \nbottom students declined even more significantly.\n  These results indicate that our students need a great deal of help to \nlearn to read and achieve. Addressing the reading deficiency of our \nNation's students is essential, and clearly an area where Federal \nresources and support can bring about positive change.\n  This is why I was pleased to join Senator Collins in supporting the \ninclusion of the Reading First and Early Reading First programs in the \nNo Child Left Behind Act signed into law earlier this year. These \nprograms provide professional development for teachers to improve \nreading instruction and support reading initiatives for younger \nchildren. Coupled with resources for up-to-date and engaging school \nlibrary books through the Improving Literacy Through School Libraries \nprogram, which I authored and offered with Senator Collins as an \namendment to the No Child Left Behind Act, we are taking steps to boost \nchildren's reading skills and love for reading.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this resolution in \norder to show our commitment to the importance of literacy and to \ncelebrate the joy of reading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S995-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S995-S996]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the communications bill by Congressmen \nTauzin and Dingell that the House will vote on this week is blasphemy. \nHailed as a way to enhance competition, it eliminates it. Touted as a \nway to enhance broadband communications, it merely allows the Bell \ncompanies to extend their local monopoly into broadband.\n  I know the Bells' tricks, based on past performance. In 1984 when \nJudge Harold Green broke up AT's monopoly in long distance, he \nrequired AT\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nto sell long distance services at wholesale. This resulted in brisk new \ncompetition among MCI, Sprint, and GTE that lowered prices for \nconsumers. AT's local business was split into seven Bell companies. \nBut they retained their monopoly in local service, guaranteeing no \ncompetition, but a guaranteed profit for them.\n  In the early 1990s the Bells decided they, too, wanted to compete in \nlong distance. Congress agreed in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, but \nfirst we employed the Judge Green approach by requiring access to the \nBell network by competitors. For one full year, the Bell lawyers \nhammered out a step-by-step process how to open their networks. They \ncame up with a 14-point checklist, and once they complied, the Bells \ncould offer long distance in their region. They were so eager, they \ntold us they would comply within a year. Thus, the 1996 Act passed in \nthe Senate by a vote of 91 to 5 and in the House by a vote of 414 to \n16.\n  But instead of moving into long distance, the Bells immediately \nlaunched a 6-year stonewalling in the courts against competition. \nFirst, they claimed unconstitutional what their lawyers had just \nwritten. They lost at the Supreme Court. And instead of competing, they \nextended their monopoly by combining: Southwest Bell bought Pacific \nBell and Ameritech calling it SBC; Qwest bought US West, Bell Atlantic \nbought NYNEX and GTE calling it Verizon; and BellSouth joined in \nholding off competition.\n  Time and again the FCC and State commissions fined the Bells for \nviolating the checklist they wrote. So far they have been fined upwards \nof $1.8 billion. But what do they care? The Bells merely write off \nthese fines in their rates and continue their monopolistic conduct.\n  To their credit, Verizon and SBC moved to qualify for long distance \nin a few States, but today the Bells control roughly 93 percent of the \nlast lines for communication into every home and business in America. \nThey contend that they are forced to provide access to their network \nwhile cable is not. But the move should be toward competition, not \nmonopolization; and the Bells should simply comply with the law they \nwrote.\n  Now comes the Bells' grand maneuver--Tauzin-Dingell. It veritably \nrepeals access requirements and the roadmap for opening the Bell \nmarkets to competition. Worse, the FCC and all State commissions' \nsafeguards as to pricing and service by the Bell companies are \nrepealed, further strengthening their monopoly control.\n  Pass Tauzin-Dingell and long distance companies will have to either \nsubmit or sell to the local Bell monopoly. The competitors spawned by \nthe 1996 Act are already on the ropes. Just the threat of enactment of \nTauzin-Dingell has caused the capital markets to freeze their \nfinancing, and some 200 companies have dropped like flies. Passage of \nTauzin-Dingell will squash them totally and the country will return to \nan AT monopoly control of communications.\n  At present, there is no legal restriction upon the Bells or anyone \nfrom providing broadband. The problem is not availability, but demand. \nIn fact, broadband is already available to 80 percent of Americans.\n  But only one in four Americans who have Internet in their homes are \nsigned up for broadband. Who wants to pay $50 a month for faster access \nto their e-mail? Content providers are awaiting copyright protection \nlegislation before they render more content for broadband users, and \nthe lack of legislation protecting privacy on the Internet keeps users \naway.\n  Where there is an availability problem, of course Congress should \nassist in extending broadband to rural and economically depressed \nareas. Bills for rural subsidies and tax credits are now pending in \nCongress. But the first order of business is to defeat the monopoly \ngrab of Tauzin-Dingell, and then enforce the intent of the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S996-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S996-S997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   KEEPING AMERICA'S PROMISE: EXERCISING VIGILANCE AND LEADERSHIP IN \n                        SUPPORT OF CIVIL RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, each year, we pause in February--Black \nHistory Month--to celebrate the outstanding achievements of African-\nAmericans past and present, and the extraordinary contributions they \nhave made to American history. When the annual tradition originated \nmore than 75 years ago, ``black history'' was barely studied. African-\nAmericans had been in this country at least as far back as colonial \ntimes, but the history books largely ignored the black American \npopulation and the experiences that sprang from it.\n  However, prodded by the vision and ambition of Dr. Carter G. \nWoodson--one of this country's great historians and the son of former \nslaves--all of that began to change in 1926. In that year, we first \nrecognized ``Negro History Week'' and later, in 1976, expanded the \ncelebration to span a full month. Now, Black History Month is \ncelebrated all over North America.\n  Our Nation is far different today from the nation that existed when \nwe started this annual tradition. Racial discrimination--once \nbuttressed by our legal system--is no longer sanctioned by law. \nSegregated lunch counters and water fountains--commonplace only a few \ndecades ago--are now relics of the past. Barriers like poll taxes and \nother shams--once tolerated--are no longer permitted to bar African-\nAmericans from voting.\n  Yes, America is a far better and much richer country today because of \nthe enlightenment delivered, in no small part, by the leaders and foot \nsoldiers of the movement for civil rights. They awakened a nation to \nthe cause of equality and justice for all--and, because of their \ncourage and foresight, America is stronger. We are undoubtedly better \nthinkers because of it . . . and better citizens because of it.\n  Yet, it is that sense of accomplishment that is, perhaps, our \ngreatest enemy. Having survived the civil rights movement and then \nreaped the benefits that struggle produced, we are inclined to believe \nthat our work is done, that racial disparities don't exist. But that \nsimply is not true.\n  While we may no longer tolerate legal discrimination and \nsegregation--more than ever before--we live segregated lives in \nsegregated neighborhoods. We worship in segregated churches, synagogues \nand mosques. And nearly a half century after the landmark desegregation \ncase Brown v. Board of Education, our kids still attend largely \nsegregated schools.\n  Now is no time to rest on the accomplishments of yesteryear. We must \nremain vigilant in our efforts and true to the vision of legends like \nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Shirley Chisholm and Thurgood Marshall \nand Barbara Jordan--all of whom knew what we now know--namely, that \nAmerica can only be great when all her citizens are afforded an equal \nopportunity to grow and learn and, themselves, be great.\n  I was called to the U.S. Senate 30 years ago, inspired largely by \nthis promise of equal opportunity and by the legions of civil rights \nworkers who risked life and limb to ensure that America kept that \npromise.\n  When I commenced my service in 1972, we were living in tumultuous \ntimes--only a few years before, this country had witnessed the \nassassination of her bravest sons; we had survived a war abroad; and \nour security at home threatened, then, by unfriendly foreign powers and \na deeply divided public--was uncertain. I thought then, as I do now, \nthat vigilance and strong, outspoken leadership could usher in the \nhealing and transformation we so desperately needed.\n  Today, as America commemorates Black History Month, we are again \nfacing troubled times. The tragic events of September 11th have tested \nour commitment to keeping America's promise to all her citizens. We \nhonor the nearly 3,000 innocents who died in New York, at the Pentagon \nand in that field in western Pennsylvania not by cowering in fear or by \nabandoning our guarantee of traditional civil rights. Rather, we honor \ntheir lives by, again, remaining vigilant and by exercising strong \nleadership in opposition to intolerance and prejudice in our society. \nWe honor them by remaining true to our democratic principles and sense \nof justice. We honor them by seeking opportunities to speak out against \nhatred and unfairness and inequality.\n  During this Black History Month and every month, we must remind \nourselves of the great road we've traveled\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\nbut, at the same time, renew our commitment to the basic truths and \nobjectives that inspired the journey in the first place. This month and \nevery month, we must re-dedicate ourselves to keeping America's \npromise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S997-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S997]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, in honor of Black History \nMonth, I have come to the floor twice this month to discuss some of the \nearly contributions of black Americans to my home state of Oregon. \nToday, I come to the floor for a third time to discuss some of the \nchanges to Oregon civil rights that occurred during the middle part of \nthe 20th Century, at the same time similar changes were sweeping across \nour entire nation.\n  In the early 1900's, Oregon was not home to many black Americans. \nEighty-five percent of Oregonians were born in the state, and the rest \ngenerally came from Canada and northern Europe. This was no accident \nOregon, which had joined the Union as a ``free state'' had, in its \nconstitution, technically barred black Americans from moving to the \nstate until 1926. While it may not have been uniformly and vigorously \nenforced across the state, Article I, Section 35 of the Constitution of \nthe State of Oregon read:\n\n       No free negro, or mulatto, not residing in this State at \n     the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall come, \n     reside, or be within this State, or hold any real estate, or \n     make any contracts, or maintain any suit therein; and the \n     Legislative Assembly shall provide by penal laws, for the \n     removal, by public officers, of all such negroes, and \n     mulattoes, and for their effectual exclusion from the State, \n     and for the punishment of persons who shall bring them into \n     the state, or employ, or harbor them.\n\n  Thus, during the first decades of the 20th Century, Oregon was \nprobably home to no more than 2500 black citizens, a population only \none-tenth the size of Oregon's then politically active Ku Klux Klan.\n  The nature of race relations in Oregon changed for the better, \nhowever, when World War II created an explosion of jobs in Portland's \nshipyards and other defense-related industries. A large influx of black \nlaborers immigrated to the region--primarily from Oklahoma, Texas, \nArkansas, and Louisiana--and, almost overnight, ballooned Oregon's \nblack population to more than 21,000. These new citizens forced \nOregonians to reckon with the civil rights issues they had ignored for \ndecades.\n  These new Oregonians immediately faced widespread discrimination in \nlocal businesses, public parks and playgrounds, and on the job. Black \nworkers were routinely denied membership in local unions, and members \nof the Portland NAACP and Urban League worked diligently to organize \nblack workers and integrate them fully into the workplace. In \nexplaining the refusal of Harry Mills, a black longshoreman, into the \nInternational Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union, Local 8, a union \nvice-president stated that ``We are not opposed to Harry Mills. We are \nfighting the Negro race! We cannot open our doors to the Negro people \nafter having kept them closed all this time.''\n  The doors which had always been closed to black Oregonians were \nslowly opened after the end of the war. In 1947, a Fair Employment \nPractices bill was introduced in the state legislature in Salem. While \nsoundly defeated initially, the bill was immediately resurrected by \nthen State Representative Mark Hatfield, whose tireless efforts led to \nthe bill's passage in 1949. In 1953, the State Public Accommodations \nAct was passed, guaranteeing black Oregonians access to the restaurants \nand public parks which had for so long denied them service.\n  Those two bills changed the civil rights landscape in a state which \nhad only years before explicitly excluded black Americans in its \nconstitution. World War II, and events across the country, served as a \ncatalyst to that change. Oregon, which had never had a large population \nof black Americans, was suddenly forced to confront the civil rights \ndemands of a growing group of citizens, and responded slowly through \nits laws and practices. Positive change occurred during the middle part \nof the last century, and more positive change, which I will discuss \nlater in the week, was still to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S997-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S997-S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO THE HEROES\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, in the past year, America witnessed \nthe extremes of both tragedy and humanity. On September 11, 2001, we \nendured the most atrocious and devastating attacks on our soil. After \nsuch tragic events, we searched for answers and solace and found \nleaders and hope. Amidst the rubble and ashes, have arisen tales of \nheroism, courage and compassion and we, as a nation, have emerged \nstronger and more united. Indeed, African Americans have contributed \nenormously to this outcome. As we celebrate Black History Month and \nhonor those outstanding heroes of the past, we should also take this \ntime to recognize the leaders of the present and their outstanding \nefforts.\n  In the political arena, leadership among African Americans has \ntranscended political and racial lines. One need look no further than \nto Colin Powell, our Secretary of State and Condoleezza Rice, the \nNational Security Adviser to the President. Both have served the \ncountry ardently and tirelessly during our war against terrorism.\n  In times of economic uncertainty, we can look to Kenneth Chenault, \nthe Chief Executive Officer of American Express; E. Stanley O'Neal, \npoised to become CEO at Merrill Lynch; and Richard Parsons, soon to \nbecome CEO at AOL Time Warner, all models of successful economic \nachievement and leadership.\n  From Washington, D.C. to Wall Street, African Americans have left an \nindelible impression on the face of American recovery and strength. Yet \nwhile these leaders have played their tremendous roles on the national \nstage, African Americans in communities across the country have made \ncontributions of innumerable value. Let us not forget that the strength \nof our Nation is inextricably linked to the fabric of our communities.\n  In my hometown of San Francisco, Reverend Cecil Williams has served \nfor 35 years as the Pastor of the Glide Memorial United Methodist \nChurch. Rev. Williams was one of five students to break the race \nbarrier at Southern Methodist University in the 1950s and accompanied \nRev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the 1963 civil rights march. Under \nhis leadership, the Glide Church has over 9,000 members and has become \nthe most comprehensive nonprofit provider of human services in the \ncity. The church maintains a wide variety of community outreach and \nassistance programs, such as providing people with three meals a day, \n365 days a year, substance abuse treatment, support against domestic \nviolence, job re-entry help and a free health clinic.\n  In Los Angeles, one can find the headquarters of Operation HOPE, \nInc., America's first non-profit social investment banking \norganization, founded by John Bryant. John is also the chairman of the \nboard and CEO of the community-based banking organization, which \nstrives to bring economic self-sufficiency and revitalization to inner \ncity communities. In 1994, John was selected by Time magazine as ``One \nof America's 50 Most Promising Leaders of the Future'' and just last \nyear he was the recipient of Oprah Winfrey's Angel Network ``Use Your \nLife'' Award. As a result of his hard work and ingenuity, Operation \nHOPE, Inc. has indeed become a symbol of hope to many.\n  Miriam Shipp-Tolliver-El has helped educate an estimated 1,200 \nstudents during her 36 years as a teacher of children from kindergarten \nthrough eighth grade in the Oceanside Unified School District and 25 \nyears as an adjunct professor at Palomar College in Oceanside, CA. \nMiriam encountered many racial barriers during her childhood in North \nCarolina. While in high school in the 1940s, she hoped to become a \nRoman Catholic nun, but no convents would accept an African American \nwoman. Her next choice of becoming a civil rights lawyer was also \nunfulfilled because law schools in her area would not admit African \nAmerican students. So Miriam became a teacher and a very accomplished \none at that. She was a co-founder of the North County NAACP chapter in \nOceanside. She also created a multicultural program in Oceanside \nschools and started black studies classes at the college. Just last \nyear, at the age of 73, Miriam was the recipient of the Lifetime \nAchievement Award from the NAACP chapter and a commendation from the \ncity of Oceanside for her endeavors and achievements.\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n  These are but simply a few of the African American leaders that serve \nas wonderful role models present in our communities. Countless others \nserve each day in several capacities such as doctors, counselors, \npolice officers and municipal workers and their constant contributions \nhave helped make our country as strong as it has ever been.\n  As Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro \nWomen, stated:\n\n       If we accept and acquiesce in the face of discrimination, \n     we accept the responsibility ourselves and allow those \n     responsible to salve their conscience by believing that they \n     have our acceptance and concurrence.\n\n  If the events of September 11 have proven anything, it is that we \nmust not harbor hatred nor tolerate discrimination. Now more than ever, \nwe must embrace our differences and learn from one another. We have \nproven that we can stand together, united against the face of terror \nand threat of evil, and overcome. That determination, spirit and \nresolve would not be possible without the many contributions of African \nAmericans at both national and local levels. I applaud their \nachievements and encourage my fellow Californians to do the same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S998-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in October \n1999 in Houston, TX. A man was beaten and partially blinded by an \nattacker who believed the victim to be gay. The assailant, Roderick \nBrenneman, 59, was convicted of assault and sentenced to a year in jail \nin connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S998-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO HILDA LEGG\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to honor a fine \nbusinesswoman, mother, and all-around great Kentuckian, Hilda Legg. On \nSeptember 26, 2001, this body confirmed Hilda's nomination to be \nAdministrator of the Rural Utilities Service in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture. Hilda is doing a fantastic job at that post and I wish her \nmany years of continued success.\n  I have been privileged to know Hilda Legg for many years. She is a \nnative Kentuckian who has worked very hard to improve the lives of the \npeople of the Commonwealth. Hilda is one of those unique individuals \nwho exudes the kind of enthusiasm and spunk that everybody wants to \npossess. Her energy and drive have allowed her to lead a storied life \nthat is full of family, friends, and accomplishments. Hilda truly is \none of a kind.\n  Hilda began her professional career as a teacher in Adair County, KY, \nand went on from there to work at the U.S. Department of Education \nduring President Reagan's first term. In 1984, she jumped headfirst \ninto the world of politics and worked on the successful Reagan-Bush \npresidential campaign. That same year she also helped me achieve \nvictory in my very first Senate campaign. From 1985-1987 she proudly \nserved the people of western Kentucky as a Field Representative in my \nBowling Green office.\n  Hilda is most widely known and praised for her service and dedication \nto the people of rural Kentucky and America. Raised without running \nwater, the difficulties facing rural Americans is something Hilda \nexperienced firsthand as a child. As the Executive Director and CEO of \nthe Center for Rural Development in Somerset, Kentucky, Hilda strongly \npromoted economic development in eastern and southern Kentucky. Her \nleadership at this state-of-the-art facility helped make the Center a \nnational model for economic development in rural areas and for related \neducational, cultural, and recreational purposes.\n  Now, as Administrator of the Rural Utilities Service, Hilda is \nworking on behalf of millions of people throughout the United States. \nSpecifically, her Agency is responsible for helping rural Americans \nfinance electric, telecommunications, and water projects. The RUS also \nprovides valuable loans and grants for rural distance learning and \ntelemedicine projects. President Bush was wise to choose Hilda for this \nimportant position and I am confident she will prove to be as good a \nfriend to rural America as she has been to rural Kentucky.\n  Hilda, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your \ncontributions to Kentucky and this great nation. I wish you and your \nfamily the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S998-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       AMERICAN GOLD STAR MOTHERS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nAmericans who embody the extraordinary service and sacrifice that make \nour country great: the American Gold Star Mothers.\n  Formed shortly after World War I, this organization has brought \ntogether mothers who lost children during World War I, World War II, \nthe Korean War, the Vietnam War, Beirut, Grenada, Panama, the Persian \nGulf, Somalia, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia and in other times and places where \nsoldiers' lives were lost in service of our country. The American Gold \nStar Mothers work to promote the noble ideals for which their children \nfought and died. The gold star they wear is a source of pride for their \nfamilies and a symbol of the sacrifice they have endured so that our \nNation might remain free.\n  All of us who are parents know what it is like to live with the fear \nof losing a child, but only those who have suffered through such a loss \ncan know just how very painful it is. Gold Star Mothers have endured \nsuch a burden and transformed their grief into an organization that \nserves not only the families of all who have lost loved ones in the \nmilitary, but veterans everywhere, as well as our Nation as a whole. \nTheir grace, dignity and patriotism represent the very best of America.\n  I have had the honor of meeting with representatives of this \nwonderful organization to discuss their history and their work. Words \nalone cannot describe how much I admire their courage and resolve. We \nas a Nation have an obligation to them: not only to recognize their \nprofound sacrifice and the bravery of their lost loved ones, but to \ngive them support as they meet the challenges of life, challenges that \nI am sure would be easier to bear if their children were with them \ntoday.\n  During this extraordinary time in our history when, once again, \nAmerican forces are overseas in battle, it is fitting that we pay \ntribute to the soldiers who fought for the cause of freedom and \ndemocracy in earlier conflicts and to the families who have given up so \nmuch in the name of these ideals.\n  We must memorialize the losses that we, as a Nation, have suffered \nand make clear that what counts in the long run is the quality and \nendurance of human spirit. Nowhere has it been given fuller flower than \nin our country. And in no organization can the power of the human \nspirit be seen more clearly than in the American Gold Star Mothers.\n  Although we can never alleviate the pain of losing a son or daughter, \nwe can recognize the sacrifices these families have made and ensure \nthat they suffer no economic hardship. That is why I am proud to \ncosponsor S. 129, ``Gold Star Parents Annuity Act,'' which was \nintroduced by my colleague, and an America hero, Senator Max Cleland of \nGeorgia. This legislation would provide a monthly stipend to Gold Star \nParents. It can make a big difference in the lives of families who are \nstruggling to make ends meet. But, more important, it can itself be a \npowerful symbol of our Nation's respect for the service and sacrifice \nof those who fought and died so that we might be free. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important bill, and in paying \ntribute to the American Gold Star Mothers.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S999-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S999]]\n                      TRIBUTE TO ROBERT L. TAYLOR\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na good friend, successful scholar, and respected community leader, \nRobert L. Taylor. Bob recently announced that he will retire from his \nposition as Dean of the College of Business and Public Administration \nat the University of Louisville. I want to thank Bob for his many years \nof service to the State of Kentucky and to the Nation.\n  Since Bob first came to UofL in 1984, the Business School has soared \nto new heights. Under Bob's leadership, the School has grown to include \nnew undergraduate programs, as well as a masters of business \nadministration, the masters of public administration, and a doctoral \nprogram in urban affairs. Thanks to Bob's vision, the School has also \ndeveloped a top notch entrepreneurship program which has garnered \nnational attention and has been recognized by Success Magazine as one \nof the best programs in America.\n  As much as he is recognized for his professional success, Bob is also \na widely respected leader in the Louisville business community. Never \none to seek the spotlight, Bob has repeatedly worked behind the scenes \nto facilitate communication among diverse groups in the community. He \nhas helped bring people together time and time again such as with his \nwork in helping develop Greater Louisville, Inc., and Leadership \nLouisville. Bob has played a critical role in the economic development \nof the Louisville area and his many contributions are greatly \nappreciated.\n  Prior to coming to the University of Louisville, Bob led a \ndistinguished 20-year career in the United States Air Force. His \nmilitary service began in 1961 when he was commissioned through the Air \nForce ROTC program. During his last ten years in the military, Bob was \na professor at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, \nColorado. In 1981 he retired from the Air Force with the rank of \nlieutenant colonel.\n  Although he will be retiring from his full time position as Dean of \nthe Business School, Bob will continue to remain very active. In 2003, \nhe has plans to spend time conducting research, studying and teaching. \nUltimately, Bob intends to return to UofL in 2004 to teach at the \nBusiness School.\n  Bob Taylor's time as Dean of the College of Business and Public \nAdministration at the University of Louisville may be coming to an end \nbut his record of unwavering service will continue on for many years. \nOn behalf of this body, I thank him for his dedication and \ncontributions to Kentucky and this nation, and sincerely wish him and \nthe entire Taylor family the very best as he moves into this next phase \nof life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S999-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S999]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO 26 YEARS OF MILITARY SERVICE\n\n Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I rise to recognize Colonel \nPhillip R. Hutcherson, United States Marine Corps, on the occasion of \nhis retirement from active duty. Colonel Hutcherson has served our \ngreat Nation and the Marine Corps for more than 26 years.\n  Prior to being commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the United States \nMarine Corps, Colonel Hutcherson attended the United States Naval \nAcademy at Annapolis, MD.\n  Colonel Hutcherson's Military Occupational Specailty was that of a \nMarine ``Cobra'' pilot. The AH-1 attack helicopter provides the Marine \ninfantry with close air support. It also serves as an armed escort and \nperforms reconnaissance in support of the Marine Air Ground Task Force.\n  Colonel Hutcherson recently concluded his Marine Corps career working \nin the Marine Corps' Legislative Affairs Office of Headquarters, Marine \nCorps. For more than four years, he has interacted with the U.S. \nCongress in order to explain funding requirements to congressional \nMembers and their staffs. His efforts in this capacity were enormously \nimportant to educating the Congress on the importance of Marine Corps' \naviation in particular.\n  Colonel Hutcherson has performed his weighty and challenging duties \nwith steadfast commitment and unrivaled professionalism. The U.S. \nSenate has been fortunate to have a Marine Officer of his caliber \nperform liaison duties with us. The Congress and the Marine Corps have \nbenefited immensely from Colonel Hutcherson's wise counsel and candid \nnature.\n  I wish him and his lovely wife, Marney, all the best as they enter a \nnew chapter of their lives and pursue interests outside of the Marine \nCorps. Semper Fidelis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S999-3", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S999-S1000]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING AMERICAN HEART MONTH\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, February is American Heart \nMonth. This is the 38th year that the President and the Congress have \nacknowledged the need to continue the fight against heart disease. Let \nme describe my interest in this condition and why I have a special \ndesire to promote practices that will lead to healthier hearts for all \nAmericans.\n  It is important to recognize that heart disease is this country's \nnumber one killer and the leading cause of disability and death in our \ncountry. It is estimated that if all forms of cardiovascular disease \nwere eliminated, life expectancy would rise by almost 7 years.\n  We need all of our citizens to become more knowledgeable about this \ncondition and what can be done to identify and control it. Too often, \nwe think of heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases as \n``men's diseases.'' But we need to get the message out that these \nconditions actually kill more American women than men, and that \ncardiovascular diseases kill more females each year than the next 9 \ncauses of death combined.\n  More deaths occur due to cardiac defects than to any other birth \ndefect. Which leads me to one of the reasons I have a special passion \nto do what I can to promote healthy hearts. I lost a beautiful young \ndaughter to heart disease some years ago, and I have another daughter \nwho has a heart defect. So I have spent a lot of time visiting with \ncardiologists about the human heart and have first hand knowledge of \nthe devastation of this disease.\n  How can Members of Congress help fight heart disease? For one thing, \nwe should continue on our course to increase funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health. We have made a lot of progress and I hope that in \n2003 we will have met our goal of doubled the funding of the NIH to $24 \nbillion in only five years. I have visited the researchers at NIH and \nwhat is going on there is remarkable.\n  I am pleased to have been one of those who stimulated this increase \nin research not only of heart disease, but also, of a variety of other \nconditions such as cancer and diabetes. Yet even with this increase in \nfunding we must focus our eyes, and those of the Nation, on the many \nareas of research yet to be pursued. Even with the significant \nincreases in funding, NIH still only has the ability to fund a fraction \nof meritorious applications. That means many missed opportunities for \nscientific advancement.\n  Much of what we know about the causes of cardiovascular disease has \nbeen discovered as the result of research sponsored by NIH and has lead \nto much improved treatment. For example, 50 years ago heart attack \npatients faced a long ordeal of six weeks or more in the hospital and \nsix months before they could sit up in a chair. Now most patients \nreturn to normal activities within weeks of a heart attack.\n  One of the top priorities at NIH is to support studies to facilitate \nreduction of the epidemic of obesity in American children and adults. \nObesity is an important factor leading to diabetes, hypertension and \nlipid imbalances, all of which are implicated in cardiovascular \ndisease.\n  I urge my colleagues to join the Congressional Heart and Stroke \nCoalition that we founded in 1996. I am a co-chairman in the Senate of \nthis bicameral, bipartisan Coalition with Senator Frist, who is a \nformer heart transplant surgeon. The purpose of the Coalition, which \nhas grown to over 210 Members, is to raise awareness among Congress and \nthe public about cardiovascular diseases and to support public policies \nto prevent, treat, and ultimately cure these diseases.\n  The theme for this year's Heart Month is ``Be Prepared for Cardiac \nEmergencies.'' Although more than 600 Americans die every day of sudden \ncardiac arrest, the good news is that normal heart rhythm can be \nrestored in many cases using an electric shock\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\nfrom an automated external defibrillator, or AED.\n  Thanks to modern technology, AEDs are now portable, the size of a \nbriefcase, user friendly, and quite affordable, less than $3500. I was \nin Fargo, ND, with an ambulance crew who showed me how to hook it up \nand use it. Believe me, if I can be trained to use it, I am sure any of \nmy colleagues here in the Senate can as well!\n  Congress has taken several steps to make AEDs more readily available. \nIt passed the Cardiac Arrest Survival Act, which I cosponsored. This \nnew law facilities the placement of AEDs in Federal buildings and other \npublic places which are visited each day by countless visitors, and \nwhere more than 1 million federal workers are employed. It also \nextended ``Good Samaritan\" protection from legal liability for people \nwho use an AED to provide emergency medical care and for those who \nacquire AEDs.\n  As the Chairman of the Treasury-General Government Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I provided $2 million to place AEDs in Federal buildings \nin FY2002. The Senate earlier this month passed the Community Access to \nEmergency Defibrillation Act of 2002, that I cosponsored, which will \nprovide grants for public access defibrillation programs and \ndemonstration projects.\n  Programs to place defibrillators in public places are already paying \noff. For instance, a retired professor in my part of the country, Roger \nSpiled, suffered cardiac arrest while playing basketball. Due to the \nquick action of an ordinary person with no medical training, who had \nready access to an automatic defibrillator that had been put in place \njust one month earlier, Mr. Spiled was shocked back to life.\n  Finally, Congress can help to encourage cholesterol screening, which \nis one of the best ways to quickly gauge the risk for developing \ncardiovascular diseases. Although cardiovascular diseases account for \none-third of all of Medicare's spending for hospitalizations, \nremarkably, the identification of one of the major, changeable risk \nfactors for cardiovascular disease, high levels of cholesterol is not \ncovered by Medicare.\n  The most recent guidelines from the National Heart, Lung and Blood \nInstitute recommend that all Americans over the age of 20 be screened \nfor high cholesterol, but when an American turns 65 and enters the \nMedicare program, they are not eligible for cholesterol screening. This \nmakes no sense.\n  In recent years, Congress in its wisdom has acted to improve \nMedicare's coverage of preventive services. Medicare now covers \nscreening for breast, cervical, colorectal and prostate cancer, testing \nfor loss of bone mass, diabetes monitoring, and vaccinations for flu, \npneumonia, and Hepatitis B.\n  Now we must act to provide Medicare coverage of cholesterol \nscreening. I urge you to cosponsor the Medicare Cholesterol Screening \nCoverage Act that I have introduced, along with Senators Campbell and \nBingaman, which adds this important benefit to the menu of preventive \nservices already covered by Medicare.\n  My family and every family is touched by, and is acquainted in some \nway with, heart disease. The American Heart Association is a wonderful \norganization of volunteers that does extraordinary work. I will \ncontinue to work with them and with the Heart and Stroke Coalition in \nthe Congress to continue to make progress in battling this dreaded \ndisease that kills, and reduces the quality of life of, so many \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S1000-1", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1000-S1004]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5396.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING AGRICULTURAL TRADE.\n\n       (a) Agriculture Trade Negotiating Objectives.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that the principal negotiating objective of \n     the United States with respect to agricultural trade in all \n     multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations is to \n     obtain competitive opportunities for the export of United \n     States agricultural commodities in foreign markets \n     substantially equivalent to the competitive opportunities \n     afforded foreign exports in United States markets and to \n     achieve fairer and more open conditions of agricultural trade \n     in bulk and value-added commodities by--\n       (1) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease market opportunities for the \n     export of United States agricultural commodities, giving \n     priority to United States agricultural commodities that are \n     subject to significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of \n     major producing countries;\n       (2) immediately eliminating all export subsidies on \n     agricultural commodities worldwide while maintaining bona \n     fide food aid and preserving United States agricultural \n     market development and export credit programs that allow the \n     United States to compete with other foreign export promotion \n     efforts;\n       (3) leveling the playing field for United States \n     agricultural producers by disciplining domestic supports such \n     that no other country can provide greater support, measured \n     as a percentage of total agricultural production value, than \n     the United States does while preserving existing green box \n     category to support conservation activities, family farms, \n     and rural communities;\n       (4) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules and \n     effective dispute settlement mechanisms to eliminate \n     practices that unfairly decrease United States market access \n     opportunities for United States agricultural commodities or \n     distort agricultural markets to the detriment of the United \n     States, including--\n       (A) unfair or trade-distorting activities of state trading \n     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with \n     emphasis on--\n       (i) requiring price transparency in the operation of state \n     trading enterprises and such other mechanisms; and\n       (ii) ending discriminatory pricing practices for \n     agricultural commodities that amount to de facto export \n     subsidies so that the enterprises or other mechanisms do not \n     (except in cases of bona fide food aid) sell agricultural \n     commodities in foreign markets at prices below domestic \n     market prices or prices below the full costs of acquiring and \n     delivering agricultural commodities to the foreign markets;\n       (B) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements affecting new agricultural technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (C) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions that are not based on scientific \n     principles, in contravention of the Agreement on the \n     Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (as \n     described in section 101(d)(3) of the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (D) other unjustified technical barriers to agricultural \n     trade; and\n       (E) restrictive and nontransparent rules in the \n     administration of tariff rate quotas;\n       (5) improving import relief mechanisms to recognize the \n     unique characteristics of perishable agricultural \n     commodities;\n       (6) taking into account whether a party to negotiations \n     with respect to trading in an agricultural commodity has--\n       (A) failed to adhere to the provisions of an existing \n     bilateral trade agreement with the United States;\n       (B) circumvented obligations under a multilateral trade \n     agreement to which the United States is a signatory; or\n       (C) manipulated its currency value to the detriment of \n     United States agricultural producers or exporters; and\n       (7) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization--\n       (A) have made meaningful market liberalization commitments \n     in agriculture; and\n       (B) make progress in fulfilling those commitments over \n     time.\n       (b) Priority for Agriculture Trade.--It is the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) reaching a successful agreement on agriculture should \n     be the top priority of United States negotiators in World \n     Trade Organization talks; and\n       (2) if the primary export competitors of the United States \n     fail to reduce their trade distorting domestic supports and \n     eliminate export subsidies in accordance with the negotiating \n     objectives expressed in this section, the United States \n     should take steps to increase the leverage of United States \n     negotiators and level the playing field for United States \n     producers, within existing World Trade Organization \n     commitments.\n       (c) Consultation with Congressional Committees.--It is the \n     sense of Congress that--\n       (1) before the United States Trade Representative \n     negotiates a trade agreement that would reduce tariffs on \n     agricultural commodities or require a change in United States \n     agricultural law, the United States Trade Representative \n     should consult with the Committee on Agriculture and the \n     Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives \n     and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and \n     the Committee on Finance of the Senate;\n\n[[Page S1053]]\n\n       (2) not less than 48 hours before initialing an agreement \n     relating to agricultural trade negotiated under the auspices \n     of the World Trade Organization, the United States Trade \n     Representative should consult closely with the committees \n     referred to in paragraph (1) regarding--\n       (A) the details of the agreement;\n       (B) the potential impact of the agreement on United States \n     agricultural producers; and\n       (C) any changes in United States law necessary to implement \n     the agreement; and\n       (3) any agreement or other understanding (whether verbal or \n     in writing) that relates to agricultural trade that is not \n     disclosed to Congress before legislation implementing a trade \n     agreement is introduced in either the Senate or the House of \n     Representatives should not be considered to be part of the \n     agreement approved by Congress and should have no force and \n     effect under Unites States law or in any dispute settlement \n     body.\n\n     SEC. 337.

SUSTAINABLE FOREST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings and Purposes.--\n       (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (A) the United States is becoming increasingly dependent on \n     nonindustrial private forest land to supply necessary market \n     commodities and nonmarket conservation values;\n       (B) there is a strong demand for expanded assistance \n     programs for owners of nonindustrial private forest land \n     because the majority of the wood supply of the United States \n     comes from nonindustrial private forest land;\n       (C) soil, water, and air quality, fish and wildlife \n     habitat, aesthetic values, and opportunities for outdoor \n     recreation in the United States would be maintained and \n     improved through good stewardship of nonindustrial private \n     forest land;\n       (D) the products and services resulting from stewardship of \n     nonindustrial private forest land contribute to the economic, \n     social, and ecological health and diversity of rural \n     communities;\n       (E) catastrophic wildfires threaten human lives, property, \n     forests, and other resources;\n       (F) Federal and State cooperation in forest fire prevention \n     and control has proven effective and valuable because \n     properly managed forest stands are less susceptible to \n     catastrophic fire, as demonstrated by the catastrophic fire \n     seasons of 1998 and 2000;\n       (G) owners of nonindustrial private forest land face \n     increased pressure to make that land available for \n     development and other uses, resulting in forest land loss and \n     fragmentation that reduces the ability of private forest land \n     to provide a full range of societal benefits;\n       (H) complex investments in the management of long-rotation \n     forest stands, including sustainable hardwood management, are \n     often the most difficult commitments for owners of \n     nonindustrial private forest land;\n       (I) the investment of a single Federal dollar in State and \n     private forestry programs is estimated to leverage, on the \n     average, $9 from State, local, and private sources; and\n       (J) comprehensive, multiresource planning assistance made \n     available to each landowner before the provision of technical \n     assistance would provide an opportunity to ensure that the \n     landowner is aware of the many projects and activities \n     eligible for cost-share assistance.\n       (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--\n       (A) to strengthen the commitment of the Secretary to \n     sustainable forest management to enhance the productivity of \n     timber, fish and wildlife habitat, soil and water quality, \n     wetland, recreational resources, and aesthetic values of \n     forest land; and\n       (B) to establish a coordinated and cooperative Federal, \n     State, and local sustainable forestry program for the \n     establishment, management, maintenance, enhancement, and \n     restoration of forests on nonindustrial private forest land.\n       (b) Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n     1978 is amended by inserting after section 6 (16 U.S.C. \n     2103b) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 6A.

WATERSHED FORESTRY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there has been a dramatic shift in public attitudes and \n     perceptions about forest management, particularly in the \n     understanding and practice of sustainable forest management;\n       (2) it is commonly recognized that proper stewardship of \n     forest land is essential to--\n       (A) sustain and restore watershed health;\n       (B) produce clean water; and\n       (C) maintain healthy aquatic systems;\n       (3) forests are increasingly important to the protection \n     and sustainability of drinking water supplies for more than \n     1/2 of the population of the United States;\n       (4) forest loss and fragmentation in urbanizing areas are \n     contributing to flooding, degradation of urban stream habitat \n     and water quality, and public health concerns;\n       (5) scientific evidence and public awareness with respect \n     to the manner in which forest management can positively \n     affect water quality and quantity, and the manner in which \n     trees, forests, and forestry practices (such as forest \n     buffers) can serve as solutions to water quality problems in \n     rural and urban areas, are increasing;\n       (6) the application of forestry best management practices \n     developed at the State level has been found to greatly \n     facilitate the achievement of water quality goals;\n       (7) significant efforts are underway to revisit and make \n     improvements on needed forestry best management practices;\n       (8) according to the report of the Forest Service numbered \n     FS-660 and entitled ``Water and the Forest Service'', forests \n     are a requirement for maintenance of clean water because--\n       (A) approximately 66 percent of the freshwater resources of \n     the United States originate on forests; and\n       (B) forests cover approximately 1/3 of the land area of the \n     United States;\n       (9) because almost 500,000,000 acres, or approximately 2/3, \n     of the forest land of the United States is owned by non-\n     Federal entities, a significant burden is placed on private \n     forest landowners to provide or maintain the clean water \n     needed by the public for drinking, swimming, fishing, and a \n     number of other water uses;\n       (10) because the decisions made by individual landowners \n     and communities will affect the ability to maintain the \n     health of rural and urban watersheds in the future, there is \n     a need to integrate forest management, conservation, \n     restoration, and stewardship in watershed management;\n       (11) although water management is the primary \n     responsibility of States, the Federal Government has a \n     responsibility to promote and encourage the ability of States \n     and private forest landowners to sustain the delivery of \n     clean, abundant water from forest land;\n       (12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     availability of Federal assistance to support forest \n     landowners to achieve the water goals identified in many \n     Federal laws (including regulations) is lacking; and\n       (13) increased research for, education for, and technical \n     and financial assistance provided to, forest landowners and \n     communities that relate to the protection of watersheds and \n     improvement of water quality, are needed to realize the \n     expectations of the general public for clean water and \n     healthy aquatic systems.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are to--\n       (1) improve the understanding of landowners and the public \n     with respect to the relationship between water quality and \n     forest management;\n       (2) encourage landowners to maintain tree cover and use \n     tree plantings and vegetative treatments as creative \n     solutions to water quality and quantity problems associated \n     with varying land uses;\n       (3) enhance and complement source water protection in \n     watersheds that provide drinking water for municipalities;\n\n[[Page S1104]]\n\n       (4) establish new partnerships and collaborative watershed \n     approaches to forest management, stewardship, and protection; \n     and\n       (5) provide technical and financial assistance to States to \n     deliver a coordinated program that through the provision of \n     technical, financial, and educational assistance to qualified \n     individuals and entities--\n       (A) enhances State forestry best management practices \n     programs; and\n       (B) protects and improves water quality on forest land.\n       (c) Program.--The Cooperative Forestry Assistance Act of \n     1978 is amended by inserting after section 5A (as added by \n     section 805) the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5B.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) there are many opportunities for the agricultural \n     sector and rural areas to produce renewable energy and \n     increase energy efficiency;\n       (2) investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency--\n       (A) enhance the energy security and independence of the \n     United States;\n       (B) increase farmer and rancher income;\n       (C) promote rural economic development;\n       (D) provide environmental and public health benefits such \n     as cleaner air and water; and\n       (E) improve electricity grid reliability, thereby reducing \n     the likelihood of blackouts and brownouts, particularly \n     during peak usage periods;\n       (3) the public strongly supports renewable energy \n     generation and energy efficiency improvements as an important \n     component of a national energy strategy;\n       (4)(A) the Federal Government is the country's largest \n     consumer of a vast array of products, spending in excess of \n     $200,000,000,000 per year;\n       (B) purchases and use of products by the Federal Government \n     have a significant effect on the environment; and\n       (C) accordingly, the Federal Government should lead the way \n     in purchasing biobased products so as to minimize \n     environmental impacts while supporting domestic producers of \n     biobased products;\n       (5) the agricultural sector is a leading producer of \n     biobased products to meet domestic and international needs;\n       (6) agriculture can play a significant role in the \n     development of fuel cell and hydrogen-based energy \n     technologies, which are critical technologies for a clean \n     energy future;\n       (7)(A) wind energy is 1 of the fastest growing clean energy \n     technologies; and\n       (B) there are tremendous economic development and \n     environmental quality benefits to be achieved by developing \n     both large-scale and small-scale wind power projects on farms \n     and in rural communities;\n       (8) farm-based renewable energy generation can become one \n     of the major cash crops of the United States, improving the \n     livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of family farmers, \n     ranchers, and others and revitalizing rural communities;\n       (9)(A) evidence continues to mount that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change; and\n       (B) agriculture can help in climate change mitigation by--\n       (i) storing carbon in soils, plants, and forests;\n       (ii) producing biofuels, chemicals, and power to replace \n     fossil fuels and petroleum-based products; and\n       (iii) reducing emissions by capturing gases from animal \n     feeding operations, changing agricultural land practices, and \n     becoming more energy efficient;\n       (10) because agricultural production is energy-intensive, \n     it is incumbent on the Federal Government to aid the \n     agricultural sector in reducing energy consumption and energy \n     costs;\n       (11)(A) one way to help farmers, ranchers, and others \n     reduce energy use is through professional energy audits;\n       (B) energy audits provide recommendations for improved \n     energy efficiency that, when acted on, offer an effective \n     means of reducing overall energy use and saving money; and\n       (C) energy savings of 10 to 30 percent can typically be \n     achieved, and greater savings are often realized; and\n       (12) rural electric utilities are often geographically well \n     situated to develop renewable and distributed energy \n     supplies, enabling the utilities to diversify their energy \n     portfolios and afford their members or customers alternative \n     energy sources, which many such members and customers desire.\n\n     SEC. 902.

BEAR PROTECTION.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Bear \n     Protection Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) all 8 extant species of bear--Asian black bear, brown \n     bear, polar bear, American black bear, spectacled bear, giant \n     panda, sun bear, and sloth bear--are listed on Appendix I or \n     II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (27 UST 1087;

and\n       (B) is authorized by a valid permit issued under Appendix I \n     or II of CITES, in any case in which such a permit is \n     required under CITES.\n       (f) Penalties and Enforcement.--\n       (1) Criminal penalties.--A person that knowingly violates \n     subsection (e) shall be fined under title 18, United States \n     Code, imprisoned not more than 1 year, or both.\n       (2) Civil penalties.--\n       (A) Amount.--A person that knowingly violates subsection \n     (e) may be assessed a civil penalty by the Secretary of not \n     more than $25,000 for each violation.\n\n[[Page S1128]]\n\n       (B) Manner of assessment and collection.--A civil penalty \n     under this paragraph shall be assessed, and may be collected, \n     in the manner in which a civil penalty under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 may be assessed and collected under \n     section 11(a) of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1540(a)).\n       (3) Seizure and forfeiture.--Any bear viscera or any \n     product, item, or substance imported, exported, sold, \n     bartered, attempted to be imported, exported, sold, or \n     bartered, offered for sale or barter, purchased, possessed, \n     transported, delivered, or received in violation of this \n     subsection (including any regulation issued under this \n     subsection) shall be seized and forfeited to the United \n     States.\n       (4) Regulations.--After consultation with the Secretary of \n     the Treasury and the United States Trade Representative, the \n     Secretary shall issue such regulations as are necessary to \n     carry out this subsection.\n       (5) Enforcement.--The Secretary, the Secretary of the \n     Treasury, and the Secretary of the department in which the \n     Coast Guard is operating shall enforce this subsection in the \n     manner in which the Secretaries carry out enforcement \n     activities under section 11(e) of the Endangered Species Act \n     of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1540(e)).\n       (6) Use of penalty amounts.--Amounts received as penalties, \n     fines, or forfeiture of property under this subsection shall \n     be used in accordance with section 6(d) of the Lacey Act \n     Amendments of 1981 (16 U.S.C. 3375(d)).\n       (g) Discussions Concerning Bear Conservation and the Bear \n     Parts Trade.--In order to seek to establish coordinated \n     efforts with other countries to protect bears, the Secretary \n     shall continue discussions concerning trade in bear viscera \n     with--\n       (1) the appropriate representatives of Parties to CITES;

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   SURPLUS FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Since both political parties have pledged not to misuse \n     social security surplus funds by spending them for other \n     purposes.\n       (2) Since under the Administration's fiscal year 2003 \n     budget, the Federal Government is projected to spend the \n     social security surplus for other purposes in each of the \n     next 10 years.\n       (3) Since permanent extension of the inheritance tax repeal \n     would cost, according to the Administration's estimate, \n     approximately $104,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, all of \n     which would further reduce the social security surplus.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--Therefore it is the sense of the \n     Senate that no social security surplus funds should be used \n     to pay to make currently scheduled tax cuts permanent or for \n     wasteful spending.\n\n     SEC. 1075.

REVIEW OF STATE MEAT INSPECTION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the goal of a safe and wholesome supply of meat and \n     meat food products throughout the United States would be \n     better served if a consistent set of requirements, \n     established by the Federal Government, were applied to all \n     meat and meat food products, whether produced under State \n     inspection or Federal inspection;\n       (2) under such a system, Federal and State meat inspection \n     programs would function together to create a seamless \n     inspection system to ensure food safety and inspire consumer \n     confidence in the food supply in interstate commerce; and\n       (3) such a system would ensure the viability of State meat \n     inspection programs, which should help to foster the \n     viability of small establishments.\n       (b) Review.--Not later than September 30, 2003, the \n     Secretary of Agriculture shall conduct a comprehensive review \n     of each State meat and poultry inspection program, which \n     shall include--\n       (1) an analysis of the effectiveness of the State program; \n     and\n       (2) identification of changes that are necessary to enable \n     the possible future transformation of the State program to a \n     State meat and poultry inspection program that includes the \n     mandatory antemortem and postmortem inspection, reinspection, \n     sanitation, and related requirements of the Federal Meat \n     Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) and the Poultry \n     Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.)

Res. 32\n\n       Whereas establishing a military academy to teach the \n     technical arts of war was a desire of many of our founding \n     fathers, particularly George Washington;\n       Whereas Congress passed legislation on March 16, 1802, to \n     establish such a military academy to be located at West \n     Point, New York, a site that Washington called the key to the \n     continent because of its strategic importance during the \n     Revolution;\n       Whereas President Thomas Jefferson signed the legislation \n     establishing the United States Military Academy at West \n     Point, an institution dedicated to promoting scientific \n     education to benefit the Nation and to attracting a diverse \n     array of young citizens to the Nation's military leadership;\n       Whereas Sylvanus Thayer, who served as Superintendent of \n     the Academy from 1817 to 1833, established the foundation of \n     the Academy's strong academic program, strict adherence to \n     discipline, and emphasis on moral and ethical conduct;\n       Whereas, under Douglas MacArthur's leadership as \n     Superintendent from 1919 to 1922, the Academy was modernized \n     to prepare its graduates for the challenges of the 20th \n     century;\n       Whereas the Academy, the first school in America to teach \n     engineering, produced graduates who were responsible for the \n     construction of the Nation's first railroad lines and many of \n     its early harbor improvements, bridges, roads, and canals;\n       Whereas Academy graduates introduced engineering education \n     to numerous colleges and universities, and carried out such \n     monumental engineering projects as the construction of the \n     Panama Canal project;\n       Whereas Academy graduates have also distinguished \n     themselves in the leadership of such innovative scientific \n     research and development projects as the development of \n     atomic bombs in the Manhattan Project during World War II;\n       Whereas Academy graduates have served with character and \n     distinction in all of America's wars and military actions \n     since the War of 1812;\n       Whereas 74 Academy graduates have earned the Nation's \n     highest military honor, the Medal of Honor;\n       Whereas 2 Academy graduates, Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. \n     Eisenhower, served both as distinguished general officers and \n     as the President of the United States, and many other \n     graduates have served in all levels of government;\n       Whereas dozens of Academy graduates have been astronauts, \n     including the Academy graduate who is the first American to \n     walk in space and 2 Academy graduates who walked on the moon;\n       Whereas hundreds of Academy graduates have utilized their \n     talents in the private sector, to provide managerial and \n     technical expertise that is responsible, in part, for \n     nurturing and sustaining a system of enterprise that is \n     admired around the world;\n       Whereas the Academy has provided an opportunity for men and \n     women of all races, religions, and cultures to receive a \n     college education and to begin a life of service to the Army \n     and the Nation; and\n       Whereas the motto of the Academy, ``Duty, Honor, Country'', \n     exemplifies the spirit of this Republic: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     congratulates the United States Military Academy on its \n     bicentennial anniversary, recognizes it as an outstanding \n     leadership development institution that upholds and promotes \n     the highest virtues of American society, and commends all \n     those who have led and taught at the Academy for inculcating \n     its 58,000 graduates with moral, ethical, and intellectual \n     values and skills that are the foundations for the dedicated \n     service so honorably given by those graduates to the Army, \n     the Nation, and friends of freedom and liberty around the \n     world for 200 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/02/25/senate-section/article/S1135-2", "month": "02", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.
