Madam President, I intend to speak again shortly before \nthe vote, but I would like to discuss the President's threat to veto \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, the letter that was sent over yesterday.\n\n[[Page S6628]]\n\n  I am disappointed that the President issued a veto threat yesterday \nregarding our bipartisan bill protecting America's patients. However, I \ncontinue to pledge my cooperation in any sincere effort to reach fair \ncompromises on the outstanding issues that still divide us. \nNegotiations continue. We will continue over the weekend, and into next \nweek, in the continued hopes we can reach agreement.\n  I repeat, we are in agreement on the vast majority of issues. It \nwould be a terrible shame for us to not be able to resolve those \nremaining differences.\n  But we cannot compromise on our resolve to return control of health \ncare to medical professionals, and to hold insurers to the same \nstandard of accountability to which doctors and nurses are held. That \nis all we are seeking and all that the American people expect from us, \na fair and effective remedy to a grave national problem.\n  Following are some concerns that were raised in the veto threat \nregarding our bipartisan bill that do not accurately represent our \nlegislation.\n  In the President's threatened veto message, he said that the \nlegislation will only serve to drive up costs and leave more \nindividuals without health insurance coverage.\n  The reality is, the year after Texas passed its liability \nprotections, premiums actually decreased; and last year the number of \npeople with insurance increased by over 200,000. In their annual \nreport, the Census Bureau attributed a large portion of the increase in \nthe number of insured Americans to the increase in employer-sponsored \ncoverage.\n  As the Congressional Budget Office has stated:\n\n       [A] reliable estimate of the coverage declines associated \n     with a mandate can only be determined by analyzing the \n     specific legislative proposal.\n\n  No such analysis on the bill before the Senate has been produced.\n  In the Presidential statement, it said that our legislation \ncircumvents the independent medical review process in favor of \nlitigation.\n  The reality is, no patient and no physician wants to go to court just \nto seek the care they need or to avoid being harmed. Under our \nlegislation, patients must exhaust internal and external appeals before \ngoing to court. That is why the legislation requires that all appeals \nbe exhausted. The sole exception is when death or irreparable injury is \nincurred as a result of the denial. Even in that case, either party can \nrequest the appeals process continue and the results of the process be \nconsidered in court.\n  In the Presidential statement, it said this legislation overturns \nmore than 25 years of Federal law, and in so doing, would not ensure \nthat ``existing state law caps would apply to the broad, new causes of \naction in state courts.''\n  The reality is, the legislation corrects the unintended consequences \nof the 25-year-old loophole contained in ERISA, the Employee Retirement \nIncome Security Act, which gives HMOs special legal protections--not \nenjoyed by any other industry--from legal recourse if they make medical \ndecisions that result in injury or death. Our legislation merely \naccepts Chief Justice Rehnquist's recommendation adopting the policy of \nthe Federal Judicial Conference that ``in any managed care legislation, \nthe state courts be the primary forum for the resolution of personal \ninjury claims arising from the denial of health care benefits, should \nCongress determine that such legal recourse is warranted.''\n\n  I hope my friends on this side of the aisle will pay attention to \nChief Justice Rehnquist's words.\n  In so doing, this legislation simply returns to how this Nation has \noverseen disputes in the courts over the last 200 years and applied the \nsame standards with which all other industries comply.\n  Finally, by deferring explicitly to State courts on medical decision \ndisputes, this legislation specifically accepts tort reform and caps \nthat States have adopted, all of which exceed any Federal tort reform \ncurrently in place.\n  The President's statement goes on to say this legislation would allow \ncauses of action in Federal court for violation of any duty under the \nplan, creating open-ended and unpredictable lawsuits against employers \nfor administrative errors.\n  In reality, there would be no open-ended, unpredictable lawsuits as a \nconsequence of this legislation. Plans would be free of any liability \nif they followed their own plan rules and did not make decisions that \nexplicitly caused injury or death. Moreover, if they follow the \ninternal appeals process provided for in this legislation, it is \nextremely unlikely that any business or plan would be exposed to any \nliability risk at the Federal level.\n  The President's statement said that the legislation would subject \nemployers and unions to frequent litigation in State and Federal court \nunder a vague standard of direct participation. The reality is, this \nlegislation related to direct participation is neither vague nor would \nit subject employers to frequent litigation in State and Federal court. \nThe bill language specifically states that direct participation is \ndefined as ``the actual working of [the] decision or the actual \nexercise of control in making [the] decision or in the [wrongful] \nconduct.''\n  This legislation specifically exempts businesses from liability of \nevery type of action except specific actions that are the direct cause \nof harm to a patient.\n  We are having continuing negotiations to try to tighten further \nlanguage to prevent employer liability.\n  Finally, the President's statement says this legislation subjects \nphysicians and all health care professionals to greater liability risk. \nMy only answer to that: Read the bill. Section 302(a)(1) states that \nphysicians, other health care professionals, insurance agents, and \nhealth care record keepers have explicitly been exempted from any new \nliability exposure. In fact, by extending accountability provisions to \nHMOs, this legislation will actually serve to protect physicians and \nother health care professionals from unwarranted, unnecessary liability \nexposure.\n  Once again, the critics need to read the bill before inaccurate \ncharges are made.\n  Madam President, there is either a misunderstanding or a failure to \ncomprehend what this legislation is all about in the message that was \nsent over and the threatened veto. Again, I urge all of our friends and \nadversaries of this bill to continue to negotiate, to continue to \nresolve the issues that exist between us so that we can come to closure \non this.\n  I repeat, we cannot sacrifice the principles upon which this \nlegislation is based, but we certainly can discuss and perfect this \nlegislation. That is something we want to continue to do. As we speak, \nthere are groups who are discussing ways of improving the legislation. \nWe are open to it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, how much time is remaining now?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The sponsor has 19 minutes, and the \nopposition has 28 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. From the sponsor's time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, from the sponsor's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the sense-of-the-Senate we will vote on \nsoon is a critical one. It puts the Senate on record as supporting \npatients in two critical areas covered by our bill: Access to clinical \ntrials and access to specialty care.\n  The reason this vote is critical is that adoption of this sense-of-\nthe-Senate language effectively endorses the solid protections \ncontained in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill and rejects the inadequate \nprotections contained in the alternative legislation.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle started out rejecting the \nidea that managed care companies should be required to cover the \nroutine doctor and hospital costs of quality clinical trials. Then they \nsaid they would support coverage of clinical trials, but only for \ncancer. Now they have finally endorsed the idea of covering clinical \ntrials, but they continue to offer the American people coverage that is \nunconscionably delayed and that bars patients from some of the most \ncrucial clinical trials--studies carried on in the private sector that \nare not funded by the Government but are approved by the Food and Drug \nAdministration.\n\n[[Page S6629]]\n\n  Of course, this, too, represents a shift in position. Last year they \nwere for coverage of FDA trials, but only for cancer patients. This \nsense-of-the-Senate makes clear that managed care companies should \ncover the routine doctor and hospital costs of all clinical trials that \noffer a meaningful opportunity for cure or improvement. It also makes \nclear that coverage should be provided without further delays--no ifs, \nands, or buts. If someone can benefit from a clinical trial, if their \ndoctor recommends it, and if they want to participate in it, their \ninsurance company should pay the routine doctor and hospital costs \nassociated with the trial.\n\n  I reviewed the comments my good friend Senator Frist made last night, \nand the sum and substance of it was that clinical trials are a \nwonderful thing but it might cost too much if insurance companies have \nto pay for routine doctor and hospital costs. So he was willing to \ncover some of the trials but not all of the trials.\n  Now of course this specter he has raised of the vast unknown mass of \nclinical trials out there ignores some fundamental facts. First, most \nstudies have not found much difference between the cost of clinical \ntrials and the cost of conventional care. Obviously, there are cases \nwhere a clinical trial can cost more, but there are also cases where it \ncan cost less.\n  Second, Senator Frist talks as if we are proposing something novel \nand dangerous. The fact is that CBO found several years ago that \ninsurance companies routinely pay these costs. They pay them 90 percent \nof the time. But managed care is cutting back on that wise policy and \npatients are being left to bear the burden.\n  So we are not talking about imposing something new. We are talking \nabout preserving and restoring what is already there. We are simply \nextending to the private sector a policy that works well under \nMedicare.\n  One of the most fundamental parts of quality medical care is access \nto an appropriate, qualified specialist to treat serious complex \nconditions. This is also one of the areas in which the abuses of \nmanaged care have been most serious and widespread. Our legislation \nprovides patients the opportunity to see a specialist outside the \nmanaged care network at no additional cost if no one in the network can \nmeet their needs.\n  The competing legislation offered by Senator Frist purports to afford \nthe same rights, but it essentially makes the plan the judge and jury \nof whether or not a non-network specialist is needed. The plan's \njudgment is not appealable.\n  Senator McCain's sense-of-the-Senate simply affirms the right to see \na specialist outside of the network, if needed. It also affirms the \nright to appeal to an independent third party if the plan disagrees \nabout the need to go outside the plan.\n  These rights are especially critical to cancer patients. That is why \ncancer patients are specifically mentioned in the McCain sense-of-the-\nSenate. It is also why so many organizations representing cancer \npatients and their families have spoken out so strongly in support of \nour legislation.\n  The story of the following patient illustrates why these rights are \nso precious and why the passage of the McCain amendment is so critical. \nThe family of Carly Christie was horrified when their 9-year-old \ndaughter was diagnosed with a Wilms' tumor, a rare and aggressive form \nof kidney cancer. They were relieved to learn that a facility close to \ntheir home in Woodside, CA, the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital at \nStanford University, was world renowned for its expertise and success \nin treating this type of cancer. The Christie family's relief turned to \nshock when their HMO told them it could not cover Carly's treatment by \nthe children's hospital. Instead, they insisted that the treatment be \nprovided by a doctor in their network, an adult urologist with no \nexpertise in treating this rare and dangerous childhood cancer.\n  The Christies managed to scrape together the $50,000 they needed to \npay for the operation themselves. Today, Carly is a cancer-free, \nhealthy, happy teenager.\n  If the Christies had been less tenacious or had been unable to come \nup with the $50,000, there is a good chance Carly would be dead today. \nThe Christies had faithfully paid their premiums to their HMO, but \ntheir HMO was not faithful to them when their daughter's life was in \njeopardy. The protections in our legislation would have avoided that \nsituation.\n  No family should have to go through what the Christies did. No child \nshould face a possible death sentence because an HMO thinks profits are \nmore important than patients. The McCain amendment puts the Senate on \nrecord as saying that families such as the Christies should have the \nright to a speedy, fair appeal to an independent review agency to get \nthe care their daughter needed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I withhold the rest of the time and \nhope the McCain amendment will be approved.\n  How much time remains on either side, Madam President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The proponents have 12 minutes. The \nopponents have 28 minutes.\n  Who yields time? If neither side yields time----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I rise today in support of the McCain \namendment.\n  Before I get to that, I want to say a few words about a patient in \nNorth Carolina who has had problems with HMO health insurance coverage. \nEthan Bedrick was a young boy who was born in 1992 in Charlotte, NC. \nBecause of the circumstances surrounding his birth, unfortunately, \nEthan was born with cerebral palsy. As a young child, he was treated by \na wide variety of health care providers--many specialists, doctors, \npediatric specialists who tried to help Ethan and his family with \nEthan's problems.\n  Among the things they prescribed was therapy on a regular basis--\nphysical therapy and other kinds of therapy--to help prevent the kinds \nof problems we often see with older persons who have cerebral palsy of \nbecoming constricted, tightened up, and not able to use his limbs \nproperly.\n  Every medical provider who made these recommendations to Ethan \nsuggested that he needed this therapy and that it was medically \nnecessary for his ongoing care. All of the doctors who treated him, and \nthere were a multitude of them, believed he needed this therapy. The \nonly one who disagreed was his insurance company. That decision was \nmade by someone sitting behind a desk somewhere many miles and many \nStates away from Ethan.\n  This is a photograph of young Ethan. As a result, it was necessary \nfor Ethan's case to be taken first to Federal district court, and then \nto be taken through an appeal that lasted a long time--2, 3 years, \napproximately.\n  After all that time and effort, Ethan was finally able to get the \ncare he needed when a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, VA, \nthe fourth circuit, said the decision made by the insurance company was \narbitrary, ridiculous, and completely inconsistent with any kind of \nmedical standards because it was obvious that Ethan needed the therapy \nthat all of his health care providers said he needed. In fact, the \ninsurance company said: We don't want Ethan to get this therapy. He is \nnever going to walk. It is not going to do him any good. We are not \npaying for it.\n  Well, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found, not surprisingly, \nthat Ethan's doctors, with training and experience in treating children \nin his condition, knew better than some insurance company clerk sitting \nbehind a desk somewhere. Unfortunately, it took years to get this \naccomplished--years of being in court and years of effort by Ethan's \nfamily.\n  Young Ethan, under our Bipartisan Patient Protection Act, would have \nhad a right to an immediate internal review within the insurance \ncompany and, had that been unsuccessful, to an external independent \nreview, where the odds are almost 100 percent that he would have been \nsuccessful since every single doctor in all areas of specialty treating \nEthan said he needed this daily therapy to keep him from becoming bound \nup and constricted.\n  This is a perfect example of why we have to do something about what \nhealth insurance companies and HMOs are doing to people in this \ncountry.\n\n[[Page S6630]]\n\n  Now, specifically to the amendment offered by my friend from Arizona. \nIt is critically important that patients have access to all clinical \ntrials, including FDA-approved clinical trials. The FDA-approved \nclinical trials are where much of the cutting edge research is being \ndone in the area of cancer. For many patients around this country--I \nspoke of one yesterday--that is the place of last resort. They have \nnowhere else to go. When chemotherapy, surgery, all these other cancer \ntreatments are not successful, they are left with one option, which is \nto participate in a cutting edge clinical trial.\n  Unfortunately, if that is not paid for by their HMO or the insurance \ncompany, many times they have nowhere to go. Our bill specifically \ncovers these clinical trials. We think it is very important that HMOs \nand insurance companies cover them. The competing bill does not. This \namendment specifically covers that provision.\n\n  Second, access to specialty care. We simply want patients to be able \nto go outside the HMO when that is their only option. We support the \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand we have 5 minutes left?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Six-and-a-half minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The other side has 28 minutes?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will speak for about 5 minutes and then \nI will be happy to yield the floor. I want to reserve our time in the \nevent someone else wants to speak. Right now, I will plan to only speak \nfor 5 minutes of our time.\n  For those who are just beginning to pay attention, about 35 minutes \nfrom now we will be going to a vote on the amendment by the Senator \nfrom Arizona which addresses issues of clinical trials, coverage of \nclinical trials as one of the patient protections in the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, and also access to specialists.\n  On the floor last night, we spent about an hour and a half walking \nthrough the very critical importance of access to clinical trials for \nthe individual patients who can potentially benefit. Remember, clinical \ntrials are investigations and experiments. We don't know if you can \nbenefit from a trial, but it is cutting edge. We want to expand access \nto these clinical trials as much as is reasonable.\n  In addition, access to clinical trials is critically important from a \nsocietal standpoint, because without an adequate number of people \nparticipating in clinical trials, there is no way to translate the \ntremendous investment that we put into research and basic science. We \nmust learn through clinical trials, clinical experiments, and \ninvestigations. Ultimately, the knowledge ends up in clinical \napplication to benefit people who have heart disease, lung disease, \nmyasthenia gravis, mental health problems, or who are recovering from \nstroke. So it is critically important in terms of benefitting \nindividual patients and society at large that we can do this \ntransformation or translation of basic science into clinical \napplication.\n  I have been blessed to be able to participate in that process as a \nphysician and clinical investigator. I have been personally involved in \na number of clinical trials. I obtained consent for those trials and \nhave given the interventions, whether it was an artificial heart or \npharmaceutical agent. As a physician and investigator, I have \nparticipated and seen the great value in those clinical trials.\n  In the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we include clinical trials as one \nof the major patient protections. We feel strongly about this \nparticular right.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts, in responding to my comments, \nmentioned two things. One, studies show these clinical trials do not \ncost very much. I have two points in response. First, we do not know \nhow much it is going to cost. I made that case on the floor last night. \nSecond, there have been several studies in one field--the field of \ncancer. However, what we are putting into the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill goes much beyond cancer.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill goes beyond cancer as well. The cost \nof those blinded, prospective peer-reviewed studies--when you look at \nartificial hearts and lasers and expensive technology--all of which are \npart of FDA, simply have not been calculated. We do not know how much \nit is going to cost. Some studies have examined the cost for cancer, \nand many of those are cost effective because the trials are done in \ncenters of excellence, with the best physicians in the world, \ninvestigators who know the literature, and the best practices. There is \nno way you can extrapolate what we know about cancer and its good \nstudies to those that have been done on heart disease and lung disease. \nIt cannot be done.\n  Two, the point by the Senator from Massachusetts was made as a \ncriticism--but I take it more as a compliment--that we have expanded \ncoverage in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords versus the bill which passed on \nthe floor of the Senate last year.\n  The following passed the Senate a year and a half ago with regard to \nclinical trials: Plans would cover routine patient costs in NIH, FDA, \nVA, or DOD approved or funded cancer clinical trials. Why did it pass \nin the Senate? Because there was good data as to how much cancer \nclinical trials would cost. We thought it most prudent to pass \nlegislation only for cancer trials.\n  In the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we said we are going to expand it \nbeyond cancer; we are going to expand it to all other diseases.\n  Madam President, I yield myself another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator has that right.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, what we have done in the balanced Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords bill is expand what passed in the Senate last year and \ntake the position we were going to cover all diseases in clinical \ntrials. I do not take that expansion as a point of criticism; I take it \nas a compliment. It shows we are not entrenched; we are willing to move \nand do what is right for the American people, given what we know at \nthis point.\n  Three years ago, we did not have these studies. We are getting them \nas we go forward. We do not have studies on medical devices and, yes, \nwe may have those studies 2, 3, 4 years from now.\n  It comes back to the approach in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \nwhich, again, is going to drive health care costs up for all 170 \nmillion people who get health insurance from their employers. Everybody \nlistening to me is not on Medicare and Medicaid. If someone has \ninsurance, they are most likely getting it through their employer. Your \npremiums are going to go up. How much? It depends on how much we add to \nthis bill and how far we go. Therefore, the prudent thing is to add \nwhat is balanced, reasonable, and in the best interest of the patients.\n  The Senator from North Carolina showed a picture of a family. We have \nseen lots of families. Republicans and Democrats have shown them. What \nis important is, when we look at the appeals process and access to \npatient protections, those patients would, under both bills, have \naccess to patient protections--access to a timely appeals process, \naccess to independent physicians in the external appeals process, and \nthe right to sue the HMO.\n  We will keep coming back to the differences. In their bill, one is \nnot required to exhaust the internal/external appeals process. One can \ngo right to court. We say, no, you have to exhaust the internal appeals \nprocess. The Senator from Arizona said that his bill states you do have \nto exhaust the appeals process. Our reading does not come to that \nconclusion. Hopefully, next week we can have a debate on exhaustion of \nthe appeals process. We have to read the language and debate the \nlanguage.\n  We know what our bill does. We do not have an exception to opt out of \nthe external/internal appeals process. At the end of the day, in the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we clearly allow suing HMOs, and the McCain \nbill allows one to sue the HMOs. We will continue to argue that they \nalso allow you to sue the employer. We will have an amendment offered \nat some point so we can go head-to-head arguing whether or not their \nlanguage protects the employer. Again, an amendment will be coming.\n  It is important for my colleagues to understand that when we see \nthese pictures of individuals, the Frist-Breaux-\n\n[[Page S6631]]\n\nJeffords bill adds the same protections: internal appeals, external \nappeals, access to suing the HMO at the end of the day.\n  The cost issue: When we see pictures of individuals--I hate to keep \ncoming back to cost, but every time I mention cost, I want my \ncolleagues to understand that when we drive up the cost of premiums for \nthe 170 million getting insurance, that means they pay more. However, \nif you are the working poor, there is some limit as to how much more \nyou can pay. Therefore, we need to balance how far we can go in \nexpanding rights to sue and new coverage with providing necessary \npatient protections. We have to come back with that balance.\n  What do we cover in the clinical trials in our bill? We cover all the \nclinical trials for all diseases for the National Institutes of Health. \nWe have made tremendous progress in this country in increased funding \nfor the National Institutes of Health, in large part because of the \nleadership of Republicans in this body and in a bipartisan way.\n\n  There are about 4,200 clinical trials in NIH, and about 1,800 of \nthose are cancer trials. Yes, we have expanded coverage compared to \nwhat passed 2 years ago. Two years ago, there was a universe of 1,800 \ntrials at NIH. Now it is up to 4,200. All clinical trials in the \nDepartment of Defense are covered also in our bill. Additionally, all \nclinical trials in the Veterans' Administration are covered under our \nbill. There is somewhere around 40,000, 50,000, 60,000 U.S. \nresearchers, clinical investigators doing the investigations like I was \ndoing before I came to the Senate, participating in those trials.\n  Last night, I mentioned an issue which we have not really talked much \nabout in this Chamber, and that is when there is a clinical trial, \nthere can be an adverse reaction. We know that. We have held hearings \nin oversight on human subject protection.\n  Last night, I mentioned the fact that there are adverse reactions by \ndefinition when you are experimenting on human beings, which clinical \ntrials are. You have good reactions and bad reactions. Bad reactions \ncan result in the loss of an arm, or it can result in death. Clinical \ntrials can result, unfortunately, in adverse reactions. We need to \nminimize that over time.\n  Now, under the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, they can sue with \nunlimited damages and on the basis of that adverse reaction. The trial \nlawyer will sue the physician for sure, but now, under this new cause \nof action in their bill, we open the door to suing or potentially suing \nthe HMO because we are forcing them or encouraging them to pay for \nthese clinical trials. I would like to see some modification in the \nlanguage so we do not open that door.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Arizona, which I think is a very \ngood amendment addressing the importance of clinical trials, also \naddresses access to specialists. In the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we \nfeel strongly that you do need to make sure people in managed care, \nHMOs, have appropriate access to specialists.\n  We require timely coverage for access to appropriate specialists when \nsuch care is covered by the plan. If the plan determines there is no \nparticipating specialist that is available to provide that care, the \nplan is required to provide coverage for such care by a \nnonparticipating or an out-of-plan specialist at no additional cost.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The plan makes the decision that specialty care is \nnecessary. However, if the plan says no and the patient believes that \nit is necessary, what rights does the patient have to question the \ndecision that is made?\n  Mr. FRIST. I appreciate the question from the Senator from \nMassachusetts. That circumstance is going to happen. We know the HMOs, \nat least historically, will do anything they can to restrain care and \nnarrow it down. That is the importance of having--it is in your bill \nand in my bill--a very quick, rapid internal appeals process.\n  Then the response is: What if the internal appeals process says no? \nThen you can go to the external appeals process. Who is in that \nexternal appeals process? We will come back and debate that later, I am \nsure, as well. The patient goes through the external appeals process \nunder our bill in a rapid, timely way. He or she makes the case, and \nthe person who makes the final decision, looking at all the data and \nall the information is an independent--not just a clerk, not a \nbureaucrat, not somebody back at the plan--but an independent--that is \nthe word used. An unbiased physician makes that final decision.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I understand, and we will have a chance to talk about \nthe appeals process----\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, let's take this time off----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We only have 6 minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. If we can take the time we use appropriately off each \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I only have 6 minutes left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will take half a minute. Can the Senator show me where \nthe appeals provisions are in his bill with regard to speciality care? \nCan he refer me to that in his proposal? My understanding is that there \nis no appeal by the patient. Once the judgment is made to reject the \nspeciality care, there is no appeals provision. The Senator from \nTennessee has given us an assurance that there is. I ask--not right \nnow--if he can give us the parts of his legislation that indicate that \nbecause we have not been able to see that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, in response, any of these medically \nreviewable decisions--any of them--can go to the appeals process, and \nspeciality care would be one of those. When you are talking about care \nand access to speciality care for a particular problem, you can go \nthrough our appeals system very specifically.\n  I will close because there are other people, and I would like to \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  We have not talked much about access to specialists. It is critically \nimportant. In the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill, we have a separate \nprovision for access to a specialist, especially access to an \nobstetrician and gynecologist. We require plans to cover OB/GYN care \nunder the designation of a primary care provider. Thus, providing \ndirect access to a participating physician who specializes in \nobstetrics and gynecology. Additionally, access to specialists should \nalso take into account age appropriateness by providing access to \npediatricians.\n  I believe strongly this amendment by the Senator from Arizona should \nbe supported. It addresses, in a sense of the Senate, support for \nclinical trials, support for breast cancer treatment, and support for \naccess to specialists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could have the attention of the Senator from \nArizona, he has 5 minutes remaining. The Senator from New York has been \nactive and involved in the clinical trial issue and will address it.\n  May I yield the remaining time to the Senator from New York?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could you yield 2 minutes so we could have 3 minutes at \nthe end?\n  Mrs. CLINTON. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I rise in support of this important sense of the \nSenate. I have a question to address to the Senator from Arizona who \nhas done so much to bring this issue of clinical trials to the \nforefront. We heard yesterday important testimony from the head of the \nNational Cancer Institute, Dr. Richard Klausner, who testified that \nclinical trials are not more expensive than standard therapies and that \nwe need to make them even more accessible. This is what the sense of \nthe Senate provides, what the underlying bill provides.\n  Probably the premier institutions in our country that deal with \ncancer, the large cancer centers, are the source of so much of the \nresearch done that translates into therapies, treatments and cures, for \npeople suffering from cancer.\n  I ask the Senator from Arizona, I am sure his sense of the Senate as \nthe underlying bill includes these cancer centers, places such as MD \nAnderson in\n\n[[Page S6632]]\n\nTexas, Sloan Kettering in New York, or Dana-Farber in New York. Is my \nunderstanding correct that the cancer centers and the research they do \nas qualified research entities are included in the sense of the Senate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to the Senator from New York, she is absolutely \nright. That is the intent of this legislation. I appreciate the fact \nshe is bringing it to the attention of the Senate to make clear the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. I thank the Senator from Arizona. I congratulate him on \nhis leadership on the underlying bill and on this important sense of \nthe Senate which clarifies that clinical trials are an essential part \nof modern medical practice and providing the opportunity for physicians \nto refer patients for these lifesaving treatments. Although they are \nexperimental, it is a way we make advances in medicine which eventually \nhelp everyone.\n\n  I yield the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, time will be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. FRIST. I rise to speak about the amendment on the floor which is \nthe amendment by the Senator from Arizona which addresses the issue of \naccess to clinical trials and access to specialists.\n  There is a section on access to appropriate care for women and men in \nterms of breast cancer. For our colleagues, these are issues in the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords bill. My bill is not on the floor of the Senate. \nWe are introducing amendments to the Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill, and \nwe are contrasting the two to say: Should we amend their bill? Should \nwe pull back in areas they have greatly expanded over the last several \nmonths? Or should we modify?\n  This amendment is a sense of the Senate expressing the importance of \nclinical trials. As someone who has been engaged in clinical trials \ntesting as to whether or not certain drugs work to suppress an immune \nsystem, I was part of a trial as an investigator. When you perform a \nheart transplant, the first 2 weeks there is higher incidence of \nrejection. We used to give powerful drugs and drive the system down, \nand when we did that, people would become susceptible to infections.\n  Science led to the field of monoclonal antibodies, more targeted ways \nof going after rejection. You do a heart transplant, and the first 2 \nweeks you investigate the new drug. The new drug might work or might \nnot work. If it does work and is more targeted, you get fewer \ninfections and it is a benefit. If not, you figure out the side \neffects. There could be harm, there may be injury; indeed, in some \ntrials there is death. That is why last night I talked about the need \nfor human subject protections. We need to address that in hearings in \nthe Subcommittee on Public Health and on health education. That needs \nto be fixed. It is inadequate today. I talked about that last night.\n  Access to specialists, from personal experience, is very important. \nWe need appropriate access to specialists. This is where balance is \nimportant. If we have anybody at any time going to any specialist or \nany physician, it is inefficient use of dollars, which we know are \nlimited in health care today.\n  I was not in this Senate when this body designed HMOs. I think the \nidea was to have more efficient use of the health care dollar for \nbetter outcome. That is translated to better coordination. The pendulum \nhas swung too far that HMOs are in the medical decisionmaking process, \nmoving the doctors out. We are trying to correct this in the Frist-\nBreaux-Jeffords bill and the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill also, but it \ngoes too far.\n  If I do a heart transplant, the next day someone hears about it, and \nit is in the newspaper. In the early days, everybody called my office \nif they had a problem with a chest pain. I was a heart transplant \nspecialist, trained to fix hearts, but people came in with heart \nmurmur, with sore ribs, and they came directly to me. It doesn't really \nmake sense to use my time, and I am not set up to make a diagnosis \nwhether it is esophagus pain or rib-cartilage pain. That coordination \nwe need to have. That is part of managed care. That is why we can't, in \nour effort to beat up on the HMOs, destroy managed care coordinated \naspects of health care today. That is where we can go too far. If we \ndestroy coordinated care and destroy all managed care and destroy all \nHMOs, the people we hurt are those individuals whose pictures we have \nseen all around because they lose their insurance.\n  Then they don't have access to get into this system where we are \nguaranteeing the rights they deserve.\n  Again, it comes back to the balance of going as far as we can but not \ngoing overboard and promising everybody everything in a disorganized \nway.\n  I mentioned access to specialists. It is a little bit of a fine line \nbecause we want to be able to coordinate people so they can get the \ncare when they need it without going through hoop after hoop, which \nHMOs have an incentive to do--because the more hoops people go through, \nthe more of a backup there is, and people will say, I am not going to \nfool with this anymore, I give up--as a way of rationing care.\n  That is what we are trying to eliminate. The Frist-Breaux-Jeffords \nbill I believe does that. The McCain-Kennedy bill attempts to do that \nand in some ways goes too far and moves too much in the direction of \ndestroying coordinated care. Again, this is going to come out in the \ndebate as we go forward.\n  We went through costs last night. How far do you go in terms of \npromising access to investigations and clinical trials? You can go keep \nenlarging and enlarging. I talked about it being enlarged in our bill, \nfrom cancer to all diseases. You can keep going further. But there is a \ncost.\n  The CBO, I think, has done a very poor job in estimating the clinical \ntrial aspect--again, because I have looked to see what their \nassumptions were, and they just weren't based on factual data. They \nhave to do the best they can. People have not done the studies to do \nthe cost estimates. It grossly underestimates. The difference between \nthe Kennedy-McCain bill and the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill is \nsignificant. It is about 50 percent. I don't know the exact figures, \nbut ours is about a little over 50 percent of what their cost is.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates raise their premiums by a \nfactor of .08. If you agree with what most economists tell us, a 1 \npercentage point in premium increase results in the loss of insurance \nfor 200,000 to 300,000 people. That means the difference between my \nbill and their bill is that it costs about 180,000 people their \ninsurance, they become uninsured, if you agree with that assumption.\n  I mentioned that because that is a tiny piece of this bill--180,000 \npeople become uninsured who do not become uninsured in my bill. It is a \nlittle piece of the bill. Remember that this is one of many patient \nprotections. And you have the appeals process--internal external. Then \nwe have the lawsuits. With this one little part, you have 180,000 \npeople losing their insurance that you might not otherwise have. But my \nbill causes people to lose insurance as well. It is just not as much as \nthey do. I think that cost factor again comes down to balance.\n  Susan Miller, who is the office manager of Miller Equipment Company \nin Heiskell, TN, that has 19 employees, wrote to me:\n\n       At the present time we offer health care coverage to our 19 \n     employees. We pay the employee's coverage and they have the \n     option to cover their dependents. We have had some health \n     problems among our employees in the last few years, so our \n     options in looking at new insurers have been limited. We \n     received a 30% increase in our premium last April when we \n     renewed and, from what I'm hearing, I can expect as much next \n     year. I do not know how long we will be able to absorb these \n     increased costs and still be able to give our employees at \n     least a cost of living raise. We already have a $1000 \n     deductible of which the company covers $750. The company \n     cannot afford to cover any more.\n\n  She closes:\n\n       I am just afraid that if we have to reduce coverage or \n     require the employee to pay part of the premium they will \n     just drop the insurance altogether.\n\n  Robby Esch from the Knoxville Computer Corporation, Knoxville, TN, \nwith about 29 or 30 employees, again tells the story in an attempt to \nexplain how we just can't keep driving those cost of premiums up.\n  He says:\n\n       This request is for you to take into consideration, Senator \n     Kennedy's Patients Bill of\n\n[[Page S6633]]\n\n     Rights Bill and what kind of devastation this could have on \n     small businesses. As the cost of health care rises (roughly \n     12%-year), it places great stress, on a small-business, to \n     provide benefits of this type. All too many businesses are \n     unable to provide health care coverage for their employees \n     for no other reason than the cost. If costs keep rising at \n     the current rate, many companies will have to make the same \n     sacrifice in order to survive.\n       As increased pressure is placed on small businesses such as \n     increasing tax burdens and this proposed Patient's Bill of \n     Rights, it brings more job losses and devastation into the \n     realm of possibility.\n\n  I have letter after letter after letter.\n  Again, I am not arguing that we should not pay for these new rights, \nbut we need to understand that these are rights we are guaranteeing. \nWhere we have the opportunity to inject some balance, we must do so \nbecause we are guaranteeing these rights at a true cost--a true cost \nthat translates down to uninsurance or loss of insurance and down to \nthe faces of the families we have seen on this floor again and again \nover the last several days.\n  The Senator from Arizona commented on the statement of administration \npolicy. The President issued a statement yesterday. I am sure it has \nalready been made part of the Record. I don't think we need to do that \nat this point in time. But, again, the President of the United States \nmade it very clear. It says:\n\n       The President objects to the liability provisions of S. \n     1052.\n\n  The President will veto the bill unless significant changes are made \nto address his major concerns--in particular, the serious flaws. The \nSenator from Arizona listed a number of those.\n  I don't think we need to delay the debate because the President in \nhis analysis says one thing, and the Senator from Arizona says their \nanalysis is incorrect. That is why these amendments need to come to the \nfloor so we can debate them.\n  I think in the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords bill we have shown a willingness \nto move to where we are compared to where we were last year. A good \nexample is the clinical trials.\n  I look forward to working with the Senator from Arizona again as we \ngo forward to come to a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. We have \ndemonstrated a willingness to do so.\n  Two years ago, suing HMOs was basically a liability. For the most \npart, we said, No, we can't do it; it drives the cost too high. We have \nbeen willing to shift to that standpoint. I think we have demonstrated \nthat. We made proposals for changes in language of this sense of the \nSenate, and I am very hopeful we will be able to do that as we go \nforward.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 809\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I have a modification at the desk. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be made a part of the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The modification to amendment No. 809 is as follows:\n\n       Add the following to the ``Findings'' section:\n       (11) While information obtained from clinical trials is \n     essential to finding cures for diseases, it is still research \n     which carries the risk of fatal results. Future efforts \n     should be taken to protect the health and safety of adults \n     and children who enroll in clinical trials.\n       (12) While employers and health plans should be responsible \n     for covering the routine costs associated with Federally \n     approved or funded clinical trials, such employers and health \n     plans should not be held legally responsible for the design, \n     implementation, or outcome of such clinical trials, \n     consistent with any applicable state or Federal liability \n     statutes.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak for 2 minutes on my modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sponsor has 1 minute, and the opposition 1 \nminute 20 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, in discussions with the Senator from \nTennessee on the issue of clinical trials, the Senator from Tennessee \nbrought forward some legitimate concerns, in our view, about increased \nliability or increased costs associated with clinical trials. He has \nasked, and we have agreed, to additional language in the findings \nsection of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution which basically states \nthat research still carries the risk of fatal results and future \nefforts should be taken to protect the health and safety of adults and \nchildren, and, also, while employers and health plans should be \nresponsible for covering routine costs associated with federally \napproved or funded clinical trials, such employers and health plans \nshould not be held legally responsible for the design, implementation, \nor outcome of such clinical trials consistent with any applicable State \nor Federal liability statutes.\n  I appreciate the input of the Senator from Tennessee. I am glad we \nare able to come to agreement on this. I hope we can all support the \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, my colleague and friend from Arizona and \nI are in agreement that, No. 1, we need to address the problems in the \nhuman subject research today. Second, we don't intend for the bill that \nwe are debating or anything that we might pass to hold employers and \nplans legally liable for the design, implementation, or bad outcomes of \ntrials.\n  I very much appreciate being able to work with the Senator from \nArizona on these modifications to the underlying amendment. I believe \nit is important for us to continue to work together as we go forward \nand address this bill.\n  I know that we can pass a strong, enforceable Patients' Bill of \nRights, with the appropriate modifications, that will be signed by the \nPresident of the United States. That would be a great service to the \nAmerican people, as we go forward.\n  Madam President, I look forward to supporting the amendment and urge \nmy colleagues to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will use my leader time just to make \na brief announcement.\n  For the information of all Senators, this will be the last vote of \nthe day and of the week. We anticipate another Republican amendment, \nafter the vote on this amendment, and amendments to be considered today \nand on Monday. There will be votes Tuesday morning on the amendments to \nbe considered today and on Monday. Should we complete our work on the \nsupplemental and on the Patients' Bill of Rights, as well as the \norganizing resolution, by Thursday night, I do not anticipate a session \nor votes on Friday, a week from today. So there will be no votes this \ncoming Friday, a week from today, if we are able to complete our work \non those three matters by Thursday night. So the next vote will be cast \non Tuesday morning. Consideration of amendments will take place between \nnow and then.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Vote On Amendment No. 809, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 10:30 \na.m. having arrived, the Senate will now vote on or in relation to the \nMcCain amendment No. 809, as modified.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 809, as modified. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator give us some idea as to the time the \nSenator from Texas wants to consider this amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The time I want to consider it?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time would he like on this amendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't have any idea. I don't have any idea how many \npeople want to speak. I don't have any idea how many want to speak in \nopposition or in favor of it. It was my understanding that the \namendment would be voted on on Tuesday. So I assume people can stay \nhere today and speak as long as they would like to, and people could \nspeak Monday as long as they would like to. But I do not know how many \npeople want to be heard.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine. I thank the Senator. I think there was the \nhope and desire--I don't think there was the expectation that we would \nvote later in the afternoon today, but there was hope that we could \nperhaps get a time definite for a vote on that Tuesday morning. I will \nlet the leaders work that out with the Senator from Texas later on.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am always amenable to try to work things \nout. Whatever the leaders work out on it, I am sure I will be happy \nwith it.\n  May we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. Senators are \nasked to take their seats or take their conversations elsewhere.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, probably no other issue has created as much \nconcern in this bill as the issue of whether or not an employer can be \nsued in a dispute arising out of the liability sections of this bill. I \nthink people can understand that concern. In America today, we don't \nrequire any employer to provide health insurance for their employees, \neither to pay for it or to pay for it on a cost-sharing basis, or to \nbuy it as part of a plan where the employers pay all of it or part of \nit. Millions of families--over 100 million families--in America are \ncovered by decisions that employers make out of what, for them, is a \ngood business decision, in terms of trying to appeal to people to work \nfor them in having a competitive benefits package, and out of the \nconcern and love they have for their employees.\n  All over America, big companies and little companies enter into \nvoluntary arrangements whereby they help buy health insurance for their \nemployees. So, obviously, a big concern in the bill before us is that \nif a company cares enough about its employees so that it is willing to \nspend its money in joining them to help buy their health insurance, or \nhelp them get health coverage, by this act of voluntarily providing a \nbenefit, can they be dragged into State\n\n[[Page S6635]]\n\nor Federal court and sued under this bill? From the very beginning of \nthis discussion, a relevant issue has been: Can Dicky Flatt, a printer \nin Mexia with 10 employees, be sued because he made the sacrifice, \nalong with his wife Linda, in helping to set up a health plan so his \nemployees can have access to health care?\n\n  Why is this question so important? It is important because there are \nliterally millions of small businesses all over America, and some \nbusinesses that are not so small, that have made it very clear in \nnational poll after national poll that if we write a law where they can \nbe sued as a result of a dispute between one of their employees and the \nmedical plan that they helped their employee buy into, they are going \nto drop their health coverage.\n  They are either going to drop it or they are going to say to their \nemployees: You take my money or your money or some combination thereof \nand go out and try to buy the best insurance you can buy, but this \nsmall business cannot afford the risk of the kinds of liability claims \nthat are being granted by courts all over America which could put this \nbusiness into bankruptcy and destroy everything that mom-and-pop \nbusinesses, such as Flatt Stationery in Mexia, TX, have worked two or \nthree generations to build.\n  That is the issue. As we have talked about this bill, over and over \nthe question has been raised: Are employers exempt from lawsuits? Can \nthey be sued as a result of their decision to provide insurance? What \nproponents of the bill have consistently said is: No, you cannot sue \nemployers.\n  What I would like to do is begin by explaining that is not so. I \nwould like to then talk about my State, Texas, which has a prototype \nplan--in fact, the proponents of the bill before us often talk about \nhow much their bill is like the Texas bill--and I want to talk about \nthe debate Texas had about suing employers. I want to talk about their \ndecision not to let employers be sued, the language they used, and then \nI want to talk about the amendment I have submitted and how that \namendment does not allow employers to be sued and how it settles this \nissue once and for all.\n  First, as we have all heard, seen on television, and read in the \nnewspaper as this debate has evolved, proponents of this bill have said \nover and over again that employers cannot be sued. When you look at the \nlanguage of the bill, basically it appears they are right.\n  In fact, on page 144 of the bill--I know my colleagues in the Chamber \ncan see these words. I do not know if other people watching the debate \ncan, but I am going to read part of it anyway so you will hear it.\n  On page 144 of S. 1052, which is the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, \nthere is a very bold headline that says: ``Exclusion of Employers and \nOther Plan Sponsors.'' Obviously, that headline is promising. Then it \nsays:\n\n       (A) Causes of Action Against Employers and Plan Sponsors \n     Precluded.--\n\n  Then it goes down and sure enough says: ``Subject to subparagraph \n(B)'' and, obviously, that should be an immediate warning because what \nthey are about to say is relevant only in the context of a paragraph \nyou have yet to read:\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     authorize a cause of action against an employer or other plan \n     sponsor maintaining the plan (or against an employee of such \n     an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of \n     employment.)\n\n  When the proponents of this bill say you cannot sue employers, they \nare obviously talking about paragraph (A). In fact, if the provision \nrelated to employers ended right there, then we would be in agreement \non this issue that you could not sue employers. But unfortunately, as \nis true in so many cases of this bill, it does not end right there. \nWhat happens is it goes on to the paragraph (B), which is mentioned \nabove, and it says: ``(B) Certain Causes of Action Permitted.--''\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), a cause of action may \n     arise against an employer or other plan sponsor. . . .\n\n  The bill goes on for several pages talking about circumstances in \nwhich an employer can be sued. Then it excludes in this section suits \nagainst physicians and it excludes in this section suits against \nhospitals, but it does not exclude suits against the employer that \nbought the health insurance to begin with. That is the problem.\n  The question is, How do we fix it? This is where it gets to be very \ndifficult. There were many efforts in the Texas Legislature in deciding \nwhat to do about suing employers, and they tried to come up with all \nkinds of ways where you could sue under some circumstances, you could \nnot sue under others, and they finally decided that if they wanted to \nbe sure that businesses did not drop health insurance out of fear that \nthey would be sued simply because they bought health insurance for \ntheir employees, that the simplest and safest--because they were very \nworried about people losing their health insurance and given that we \nhave 43 million Americans today who do not have private health \ninsurance or do not have health insurance coverage of any kind--they \ndecided that the safest route was to have an outright carve-out where \nthey said:\n\n       This chapter does not create any liability on the part of \n     an employer, an employer group purchasing organization . . .\n\n  And this language is right out of their HMO reform bill, their \nPatients' Bill of Rights. They also talk about licensed pharmacy and \nState boards being exempt but that is not at issue here. And they go on \nto say that an employer, an employer group that purchases coverage or \nassumes risk on behalf of its employees is not liable under their \nlegislation.\n  Many people have claimed the bill before the Senate is virtually a \nmirror image of the Texas law. In fact, the bill before the Senate \nallows employers to be sued, whereas the Texas Legislature, out of \ntheir deep concern especially about small businesses canceling their \nhealth insurance if they could be sued under any circumstance, decided \nto do an outright carve-out, where they excluded employers so there \nwere no ifs, ands, or buts about it. You cannot sue an employer in \nTexas that provides health insurance for its employees.\n  Many of our colleagues have talked in glowing terms about how great \nthe Texas program is because businesses have not canceled health \ninsurance. One of the big reasons employee health insurance has not \nbeen canceled is because employers are exempt under the Texas law. No \nifs, ands, or buts about it.\n  I am sure we will hear from people who say they don't want to sue \nemployers but are not willing to exempt them. We will be hearing \narguments why they should not be exempt. The human mind is a very \nfertile device. We can come up with all kinds of possibilities, many of \nwhich have no relevance whatsoever to anything on this planet, and you \ncan almost always come up with some convoluted situation in which \nsomething that generally is nonsense might make sense.\n  When the Texas Legislature looked at this issue, they looked at a lot \nof possibilities. One of the problems they had, however, when they took \neach of the possibilities and worked it out, they could not figure out \nhow to let employers be sued for anything without opening up a \nfloodgate of unintended consequences.\n  Let me give the most damning example. What if the employee calls the \nhealth plan and tries to tell them how to run the health plan. None of \nus are for that. Here are relevant points. First, the health plan can \nbe sued if they act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in responding \nto the employer, so there is still a party standing there that can be \ntaken to court and be held accountable. Why would a health plan put \nitself in a position of being sued by doing something that violates the \nstructure that has been established in Texas law, and with the passage \nof a Patient's Bill of Rights will be established in national law \nbecause an employer puts pressure on them?\n  Second, under both Texas law and the national law as proposed by \nRepublicans, Democrats, and all the variants of all the bills proposed, \nthe hallmark of each of those bills is external review. If I have a \nproblem and I don't feel I have gotten the treatment I need, I can go \nbefore a panel of specialists, that is doctors who specialize in this \narea of medicine. They are independent of the health plan and, \ntherefore, by definition, independent of any employer that bought \ncoverage under the health plan. If they agree with me, I get the health \ncare; if they disagree with me, I can go to Federal court and sue for \nthe health\n\n[[Page S6636]]\n\ncare or go into court somewhere depending on the bill we are talking \nabout.\n  In the context of this bill, health plans are not final \ndecisionmakers. A panel of independent physicians takes the role of \nfinal decisionmaker. When people say, let us sue the employer, if the \nemployer is the final decisionmaker, the plain truth is, when we look \nat the bill before the Senate or any bill proposed, who is the final \ndecisionmaker? Not the employer, not the plan, not the physician \ntreating the patient. The final decisionmaker is the external review \nprocess.\n  Here is the problem, and this is something those who were working on \nthe Texas law, which is our prototype that has been in effect and which \nhas worked relatively well, discovered in trying to write the law where \nyou could sue the employer only if the employer was a final \ndecisionmaker or intervened in any way. They found every time they \ntried to do that, you got unintended consequences. For example, many \nhealth care plans will appoint one or two of the employees of the \nemployer to interface with the health care plan as part of their \nlooking at new benefits or looking at the cost of relative add-ons or a \ngrievance process. Any time you have that interfacing, which many \nemployee groups demand, want, and deserve, and employers are eager for \nthem to have because they want them to be happy with the plan, then you \nget them involved as a decisionmaker, and potentially, in a lawsuit--\neven in negotiating and putting the plan together. To what extent are \nyou making a final decision when you decide something can be covered or \ncan't be covered?\n\n  Basically, while the Texas legislature recognized it may very well be \nyou might have one bad employer who tries to intervene in the health \ncare system, there were a lot of checks and balances to protect from \nthat. First, you could sue the health care plan if they allowed the \nemployer to do it. Second, the final decisionmaker is not the health \ncare plan, but an independent panel of physicians. Finally, whatever \navenue for lawsuit you opened up against the employer created more \nproblems than it solved. It created numerous unintended consequences \nwhere a very effective plaintiff's attorney in a sympathetic court \nmight be able to argue that something we would agree on the floor of \nthe Senate was perfectly reasonable behavior in negotiating a plan or \nnegotiating grievances with a plan that the firm's employees might do \nand in doing so they would be the agent of the employer, that could end \nup bringing a small mom-and-pop business into court and a judgment be \nrendered against them because they cared enough to buy health insurance \nand in the process are driven into bankruptcy.\n  The problem is, and what will happen is, small businesses--and some \nlarge businesses--will look at the provisions of the Federal law and \nsay under this law, notwithstanding the fact that supposedly employers \nare exempt, a cause of action may arise against employers or other plan \nsponsors, and they will look at all this language that goes on and on \nand on until it finally, interestingly enough, and amazingly, after \ngoing on for several pages, describing conditions under which the \nentity that bought the health insurance can be sued, which is the \nemployer, it then concludes that you can't sue the physician and you \ncan't sue the hospitals under this section of the bill, but you can sue \nthe employer.\n  Now, here is the point. If there is any ambiguity with regard to \nsuing employers, what is going to happen all over America is employers \nare going to get out of the business of buying health insurance. What \nwas decided in Texas, I think, was the correct decision and therefore I \nhave proposed it as an amendment to the Federal bill.\n  What was not decided was that there were no possibilities for abuse \nby employers. That was not decided by the Texas Legislature. It doesn't \ntake much imagination to figure out how an employer's behavior might be \nbad, or why an employer might try to influence a plan.\n  The Texas Legislature concluded that there are all kinds of \nprovisions in the bill to protect against that, including that anything \na plan does that an employer or anybody else tries to get them to do \nthat is harmful, they can be sued for.\n  Another Senator here on the floor is a great prosecutor. He \nunderstands health plans can be sued because if some bad actor employer \nwants them to do something wrong, but they are not going to be eager to \nstep into the courthouse.\n  Second, the legislature concluded that ultimately the final \ndecisionmaker was the external appeals process, which was totally \nindependent of both the health plan and the employer.\n  So they concluded, wisely in my opinion, that they would not create \nany liability on the part of the employer or the employer group's \npurchasing organization.\n  This amendment is very straightforward and very simple. It does not \nsay that there could never be a circumstance where employers could \nmisbehave. But it concludes that the law of unintended consequences is \nsuch, and the protections in all of our Patients' Bill of Rights are \nstrong enough that the most prudent avenue to follow is to exempt the \nemployer because if we don't, we are going to have millions of \nAmericans losing their health insurance.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at both sides of the argument. \nObviously, with a fertile mind you can come up with some hypothetical \nexamples where employers might do bad things. But you can also come up \nwith far more examples where they might be doing good and proper \nthings. Yet under this bill, and under any language you could write \nletting employers be sued, or where they would be in danger of being \nsued, and, therefore, would drop health insurance, the prudent action \nfor America is a prudent action that the most successful plan in \nAmerica followed when it became basically the blueprint. That was the \naction that the Texas Legislature followed when they decided looking at \nthe whole picture, the pros and the cons, that the safest thing to do \nwas to totally exempt people who care enough to buy the health \ninsurance--the employers.\n  Under the Texas plan you can sue the HMO. You can sue the insurance \ncompany, but you cannot sue your employer who has joined with you in a \npartnership in buying your health insurance.\n  I think this is prudent policy. I believe if we adopt this amendment \nthat we will dramatically minimize the number of people who will lose \ntheir health insurance as a result of this bill.\n  But I am absolutely confident that if we do not adopt this bill, and \nif we make it possible in any shape, form, or fashion to sue employers \nwho are helping people buy health insurance all over America, small and \nlarge employers are going to cancel their health insurance.\n  We all say we don't want that to happen. We all say we don't want to \nsue employers. Yet the bill before us allows employers to be sued.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at both sides of this argument and to \ntake a prudent course by adopting this amendment.\n  I know several of my other colleagues wanted to speak. If I can, my \ndear colleague from Texas, who is the cosponsor of the measure, has to \ncatch a plane. With the indulgence of those who are on the floor, I \nwould like to yield the floor and allow her to be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank those who are waiting to speak \nfor allowing me to talk on this amendment of which I am a cosponsor \nbecause I am very familiar with the Texas law, as one would hope. I \nknow about the success it has had since it was enacted in Texas.\n  I have heard many people around the country talking about the Texas \nlaw, and that it would be a model for what we would want to do for \nevery State in America that doesn't already have laws. I think it is an \nimportant point that we are not trying to preempt State laws in the \nFrist-Breaux-Jeffords plan. I support that. I think it is a very \nimportant point.\n  The Kennedy-McCain-Edwards bill preempts the States that have already \nacted. I don't think we need to do that. The Texas law is serving very \nwell in Texas. Yes. We can cover the plans that are not covered by \nState law in the Federal plan. But there is no reason to preempt a \nState law that is already working in a particular State.\n\n[[Page S6637]]\n\n We all know that every State has different needs. People have \ndifferent ways to look at things. Oregon has been a leader in many \nhealth care issues which might not work in Texas. That goes across all \nthe State lines.\n  I will make the point about this amendment as it would apply to the \nFederal parts of the law. It has worked in Texas.\n  The No. 1 thing that we want to do in this country is encourage more \npeople to have health care coverage. We want them to have good quality \nhealth care coverage, which is why we are passing a Patients' Bill of \nRights.\n  There have been some concerns raised about patients' rights with an \nHMO. I have heard many stories that are very sad, such as an HMO \nfailing to respond to a patient.\n  That is why all of us want to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is \nwhy we want a woman to be able to go see an OB/GYN without going \nthrough a gatekeeper. We want pediatricians to be able to be seen \nwithout going through a gatekeeper. We want every American who has an \nHMO to be able to go directly to an emergency room.\n  These are very important rights about which we are speaking. But I \nthink it is most important that we also encourage employers to give \nhealth coverage options to their employees. We want to make sure that \neverything we are doing will be an encouragement--not a \ndiscouragement--for employees to get health care coverage because \ngenerally the best plans are those that are based on an employer \nrelationship.\n  Keeping that in mind, the Texas law says:\n\n       This chapter does not create any liability on the part of \n     an employer, an employer group purchasing organization, or a \n     pharmacy licensed by the State Board of Pharmacy that \n     purchases coverage or assumes risk on behalf of its \n     employees.\n\n  Specifically, in Texas law we have a prohibition against suing an \nemployer because we want to make sure that an employer is encouraged to \ncontinue to offer health care options for employees.\n  I want to give a couple of statistics that talk about the importance \nof this and how fragile it might be.\n  In looking at some of the reasons that people give for not having \nhealth care coverage, we have some interesting statistics.\n  According to the Employee Benefits Research Institute, a 5-percent \nincrease in premiums would cause 5 percent of small businesses to drop \ncoverage. A 10-percent increase in premiums would cause 14 percent to \ndrop coverage.\n  There is also some good news in these figures; that is, if you have a \n10-percent decrease in premiums, 43 percent of small businesses would \nbe more likely to offer coverage.\n  I have talked to small business owners. I can tell you that they \nwould like to offer coverage even when they can't. Even when they \ncan't, they have found that it is too expensive, but they feel badly \nabout it. They would really like to do that.\n\n  But the other statistic we have seen is that the number of people who \nare uncovered are actually people employed. They do not take health \ncare coverage because it is too expensive even though the employer pays \npart of the premiums. That is the No. 1 reason given by an employee who \nis not covered, even though they have access to health care coverage.\n  This is an employee who says: I need that money in my paycheck more \nthan I need the health care coverage for myself or my family. That is \nan astounding thing to say because most employees would rather have \nhealth care coverage even more than higher wages because they know the \nimportance of that for themselves and their families.\n  So I do think when we look at the bill that is before us today that \none of the key components should be that we try to keep the costs to \nemployers down. That is why we want to specifically say in the bill \nthat employers will not be able to be sued.\n  We have had some debates here where it seems that some of the people \nwho are supporting the McCain-Kennedy-Edwards bill think employers \ncannot be sued. What we want to do is clarify that. Whatever language \nit takes, we want to do that. But we know the Texas language has \nworked. We know it has been referred to. So we want to put the Texas \nlanguage on suing employers in the bill to assure that costs will not \nbe raised, and to assure that employers will be encouraged--not \ndiscouraged--from offering their employees health care benefits.\n  Last point--and then I will turn this over to the others who are \nwaiting to speak--I have talked to big employers and small employers \nwho now offer health care coverage who say, unequivocally, if it is not \nvery specifically clear that you cannot sue an employer for offering \nhealth care coverage to employees, they will drop the coverage. They \nwill just give the employee a certain amount and say: You find health \ncare coverage with this amount of money the best way you can. I can't \nbe connected with it because I can't afford to take the risk that I \nmight be liable in the millions of dollars that are provided for in the \nKennedy-McCain-Edwards bill. That would be too costly, so I can't do \nit.\n  Even really big employers would drop their coverage. We could wreck \nthe health care system and the stability of the coverage that people \nhave if we do not explicitly keep employers from being able to be sued \nfor giving their employees this very important option as a perk of \nemployment.\n  This is the basis of coverage in our country. We cannot take a chance \nthat we would mess it up for the people who are covered in our country, \nand those we hope will be covered, if we encourage employers to act. I \nhope we can adopt this very clear language that came right out of the \nTexas law where it has worked very well to make sure that we encourage \nemployers to continue to offer health care coverage for their \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, it is important to remember that what \nunderlies today's debate are the lives of real people. This is about \nhealthy new babies entering the world, parents worrying in the middle \nof the night when their child has a fever, and families coping with a \nterminal illness. It is about the quality of life.\n  When your family is dealing with a medical crisis, it is time to come \ntogether in love and support. It is not the time to have to argue with \nan HMO over whether they will allow your child to go to an emergency \nroom or whether your elderly parent is allowed to see a specialist.\n  Physicians should not have to ask permission from HMOs to provide \npatients with the care they need. There is something fundamentally \nwrong with our health care system when medical decisions are not made \nby doctors, but by HMOs.\n  One year ago this month, a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights \ncame before the Senate. It was a strong bill that protected all \nAmericans. It was designed to put patients before profits. It held \nmanaged care organizations accountable for their actions. It would have \nmade a difference. What happened to this legislation? It failed by one \nvote--one vote.\n  My late husband, Mel Carnahan, understood the power of one vote in \nthe Senate. He ran for the Senate because he believed that his one vote \nwould make a difference. I am in this Chamber today because I share \nthat belief. That is why I support the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nBipartisan Patient Protection Act.\n  Many Missourians know from firsthand experience the power that a \npatient protection law can have. In 1997, Governor Mel Carnahan signed \ninto law one of the most comprehensive HMO consumer protection laws in \nthe country.\n  What happened in Missouri during that time took real political \ncourage. Legislators such as Tim Harlan and Joe Maxwell stood up to the \npowerful HMOs and said: Enough is enough.\n  Those who opposed the Missouri HMO reform law--like those who oppose \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill--said that costs would increase \nsignificantly, employers would drop coverage, and patients would crowd \nthe courts with lawsuits.\n  How many of these dire predictions came true? None; absolutely none.\n  The insurance lobby predicted costs would increase by 24 percent. \nAfter the law was passed, insurers, business groups, professional \nmedical societies, and health systems called for a review\n\n[[Page S6638]]\n\nof how much the new law would cost. Do you know what the report \nconcluded? That the average price increase would only be about 2 or 3 \npercent.\n  I have not heard a single complaint from an employer that they have \nhad to drop health care coverage for their employees or that they have \nexperienced an unacceptable increase in premiums.\n  The insurance lobby predicted people would lose their health \ninsurance. Wrong again. Rates of insurance went from 87.4 percent in \n1997 to 91.4 percent in 1999.\n  The insurance lobby predicted there would be a flood of lawsuits. \nThere has been only one lawsuit--that's right, one law suit. The \nproblem is that State laws can only go so far. Federal laws require \nthat thousands of Missourians be covered by Federal--not State--law. I \nstand in this Chamber today in support of the bipartisan McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill because it is the only bill before the Senate that \nprotects all Missourians and all Americans.\n  Recently, my office received a call from Peggy Koch, who lives in \nWinona, MO. A year ago, in February, Peggy's daughter Kim began having \nmigraine headaches every day. Her headaches became debilitating. She \ncould not work. She stopped attending college. She slept all the time \nand was in constant, severe pain.\n  Kim needed to be admitted to the Saper Clinic in Michigan, which had \nthe ability to give her the specialized care she needed. She had a \nreferral to receive the care, but her insurance company would not \napprove it.\n  When Kim's mother called my office for help to get Kim's insurance \ncompany to cover this needed treatment, there was nothing I could do to \nhelp her since current Federal law does not protect her.\n  I can do something now. I can fight for a law that protects her and \nother families in similar situations.\n  In the end, after weeks of continuous wrangling and extreme stress, \nthe insurance company paid for 7 of the 15 days of needed treatment.\n  Mrs. Koch decided that Kim's health was more important than bills and \ntold the hospital to keep her daughter until she completed the 15-day \nprogram. The treatment worked and Kim has shown remarkable improvement \nsince completing the program. Now they have no idea how they will pay \nthe bills.\n  The Kochs have always been diligent about paying their bills. They \ndon't know how they will be able to make it with the medical bills that \nwill hit them in the next few weeks and months.\n  As a mother, I understand what Kim's mother went through. When your \nchild is in such pain, you will do whatever you have to in order to \nhelp your child.\n  What is sometimes forgotten in this debate is that Kim had paid for \nthe insurance. But Kim had no way to force the insurance company to pay \nfor the critical services directed by her physician. That is why we are \nhere--to make sure that HMOs and insurance companies fulfill their \ncommitment to do what is in the best interests of patients. No family \nshould have to make this type of decision.\n  Today many Missourians currently have the right to access emergency \nroom services without prior authorization from their HMO. I would like \nto share with you a story that happened 5 years ago before Missouri \npassed its law.\n  Doug Bouldin is a registered professional nurse and family nurse \npractitioner in Troy, MO with over 12 years of experience in emergency \nmedicine and critical care. He told me this story several years ago, \nand I will never forget it.\n  Doug was working at a large metropolitan St. Louis emergency \ndepartment. A husband and wife drove into the garage of his department, \nbut the husband was in cardiac arrest. His team pulled him from the car \nand began resuscitation efforts immediately.\n  Doug showed the wife to the family room and began collecting her \nhusband's health history. She said her husband had been suffering chest \npain for several days, and when they called their health plan, they \nwere told to drive to a hospital approximately 50 miles from their home \ninstead of going to the closest facility. They passed by four major \nfacilities that could have more than adequately handled his care.\n  They ended up in Doug's emergency department after he slumped over \nunconscious in the passenger seat on the highway less than half way to \ntheir destination. The doctors were unsuccessful in resuscitating him, \nand when the physician and Doug went to tell her, the first words out \nof her mouth were, ``Why did they tell us to drive so far?''\n  Why did they tell us to drive so far?\n  There is no way to answer that question.\n  I received a letter from Dr. Alan Weaver who works at the Tri-County \nMedical Clinic in Sturgeon, MO. He wrote to me about the problems he \nexperiences trying to provide emergency care to patients who get their \ninsurance through self-funded plans. Access to emergency room care is a \nparticular problem when people suffer an injury outside of their health \nplan's network.\n  Two years ago, a worker who was covered by a self-insured plan \nthrough his employer was admitted for a heart attack into the hospital \nwhere Dr. Weaver was Working. His insurance company demanded that he be \ntransferred to a hospital in St. Louis, which is 3\\1/2\\ hours by road, \nbefore he was stable. they refused to pay for in patient care. The \npatient had no choice and transferred to the other hospital.\n  This patient is the exact reason why we are here today. We need to \npass a Federal law to protect these individuals and give them access to \nemergency room care.\n  Not all of the problems associated with HMOs involve coverage \ndenials. In many instances, the structure of the current HMO health \ncare system puts up so many barriers for patients to access care that \nthey might as well be denying care. Women are particularly affected by \nthese barriers when they need OB/GYN care.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill provides women direct access to their \nOB/GYN doctors. Now, women have to go through a gatekeeper--their \nprimary care physician--whenever they have a healthcare problem \nseparate from their annual exams.\n  When a women is experiencing a health problem and needs to see her \nOB/GYN, it is deeply personal. For a woman to share the full extent of \nher health problems, she needs to feel comfortable. If she does not \nfeel comfortable, who may not choose to seek the care she needs.\n  Let's think for a minute about the steps a woman takes just to see \nher doctor. After entering the OB/GYN's office, she goes to the front \ndesk to check in and explain her health concern to a stranger. If she \ndoesn't have a referral from her primary care physician, she is shown \nto a telephone.\n  Now she must call and discuss again what her health problem is with \nher HMO. Remember, it took courage just to make it into the office, \njust to walk into the door. Imagine how odd it must feel to be directed \nto a cold telephone.\n  After this phone call and hearing that the HMO has denied her request \nto see a specialist--her OB/GYN, I'm sure you can understand how \ntraumatic this experience can be and how unappealing it becomes to try \nthe process again. All she has sought to do is get the care she feels \nshe needs.\n  Dr. Gary Wasserman, an OB/GYN in St. Louis, so eloquently sums up \nthis situation stating: ``We have created a system that isolates women \nand infringes on their privacy and dignity.''\n  One final point: I think it is important for everyone to understand \nthat right now, HMOs are totally unaccountable for their actions. No \nother institution or profession in America enjoys this status.\n  Is there anyone in this Chamber that would vote to make lawyers, or \ndoctors, or any manufacturer totally unaccountable if they make a \nmistake that causes an injury?\n  I don't think there is.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. Of course, there will be great debate \non how to structure this bill. But the bottom line is that a vote \nagainst the Patients' Bill of rights is a vote to keep HMOs totally \nunaccountable.\n  I don't think this is good policy, and I don't believe that this is \nwhat the American people want.\n  It is time for the Senate to pass the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill. As \nMissouri has seen, HMOs will provide better care when they are forced \nto step up to the plate.\n\n[[Page S6639]]\n\n  Federal legislation will allow us to strengthen patient protections \nfor everyone in Missouri as well as in the Nation. We can and should \nensure that doctors, not bureaucrats, are making medical decisions. We \nmust ensure that patients are put ahead of profits. We must ensure that \nit begins today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we have heard several anecdotes \nconcerning individuals who are having a problem with their coverage. We \nmust ask yourselves, would those individuals have been any better off \nif they had no coverage at all? And should an employer be penalized for \nmaking the decision to have insurance coverage which may or may not \npresent problems from time to time?\n  That is what we are trying to resolve, and we will be discussing that \nissue for several days as to how best to resolve it. But we need to \nremember the front end of the process. It is always set up because some \nemployer, either a large employer or a small employer, chooses to have \ninsurance and set up an insurance plan for his employees.\n  That is what we are dealing with here with regard to the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Texas. This is a very important amendment. \nI think this is fundamental. This is what we will be discussing today \nand Monday and Tuesday. It is the fundamental question of whether or \nnot we want to sue not only HMOs for their transgressions, but whether \nor not we want to sue employers, whether or not we want to sue the \npeople who do not have to set up these insurance plans and can walk \naway from them if they want to, can have no insurance if they want to \nfor their employees, or they can give employees a certain amount of \nmoney and say you go take the headaches. I am talking about those \nindividuals. Do we want to subject them to unlimited liability in \nlawsuits, too?\n  We, of course, are focusing on the HMOs. We will have a chance to \ndiscuss how far we can go in penalizing these health care providers \nwithout driving up the costs so that we uninsure a bunch of people. As \nheartrending as some of these stories we hear are, I hope in a couple \nof years we don't have heartrending stories of people whose employers \nwalked away from insurance, leaving them with no insurance, and stories \nof people dying in emergency rooms awaiting treatment because they had \nno insurance at all. Those could be logical outcomes of what we do if \nwe go too far.\n  We are going to deal with that issue--with what to do with HMOs. But \nin the process, the sponsors of the bill on the floor have tried to \nmake it clear, I think, that that is the focus, and they are not after \nthe ability to sue, for example, attending physicians. They have been \ncarved out of this bill. They are not interested in suing attending \nhospitals. They have been carved out of this bill. They are not \ninterested in applying ordinary liability to the external review people \nand the medical reviewers who are set up in this bill to make objective \ndeterminations on coverage and what-not; they only have liability if \nthey engage in gross misconduct.\n  So all along the way, whether or not you are talking about people who \nare set up to review these matters, whether you are talking about \nattending physicians, or whether you are talking about hospitals, the \nsponsors of this bill have either totally or partially carved them out \nof the process and said we are not after them, we want to hold the HMOs \naccountable.\n  They also say they are not after employers, but they are not willing \nto carve them out. That is what we are here to discuss today. This \nbasically goes to the heart of the amendment that has been proposed.\n  As I understand the sponsors of the bill, they say they are not \ninterested in suing employers. Finally, they get down to the other \nparts of the bill and say, well, there are some instances where \nemployers can be sued if they are directly participating in the \ndecision, for example, to deny coverage, or if they fail to perform any \nother duty under this act--whatever that might be.\n  Then they go on for 2, 3, or 4 pages in the bill to describe what \ndirect participation means and what it does not mean--leading one to \nbelieve right off the bat that it obviously is not crystal clear as to \nwhen an employer might be subject to liability.\n  What does direct participation mean? My understanding is that in the \nfront end of the process that has been set up to handle claims under \nthis bill, the internal claims in the initial stage of the game, \noftentimes in some of these plans you have representatives of employers \ninvolved that would be agents, from a legal standpoint, of the employer \ninvolved in the front end of this making decisions on coverage issues. \nIf that is the case, we have built in exposure from the very beginning \nwith regard to this bill. That may or may not be a good thing.\n\n  But on the issue of whether or not employers are exposed, I think the \nanswer under this bill is undoubtedly yes. Even if they do the right \nthing, they don't engage in any willful misconduct, do their best, have \nsome of their employees perhaps involved in the initial stage, and it \ngoes on up through the appeals process, the internal appeal and the \nexternal review, and you bring in the independent folks and medical \npeople to analyze it and everybody does their best, still at the end of \nthe day they are subject to being sued, as I read the bill as currently \ndrafted.\n  I believe everyone who has any experience either on the giving end or \nthe receiving end of lawsuits in this country realizes that if there is \nany potential exposure at all for the employer, whether or not he is \nultimately found liable after a long trial, perhaps, or a motion to \ndismiss, or a summary judgment motion, he is going to be sued \ninitially. Why in the world would they sue the HMO, and maybe someone \nelse, for punitive damages, let's say, for gross misconduct, for the \nmedical review, or anyone else in the process, and not bring in the \nemployer to take discovery to see the extent to which he may have \ndirectly participated?\n  How much would it cost that employer, who ultimately was exonerated, \nwho didn't do anything wrong? How much would it cost him to buy his way \nout of that lawsuit, settle his way out of it, or go through the \nprocess of a trial and win at the end of the day? That is what \nemployers are faced with--employers who have chosen to set up a medical \nsystem to cover these employees to avoid some of these stories we have \nheard concerning people who are being denied coverage.\n  This is the result at the end of the day. If you are an employer, you \nhave to ask yourself--and we are not talking about General Motors here \nalone, we are talking about not only large employers, we are talking \nabout small employers. If you are looking at that kind of a \npossibility, if this bill is passed as it is, where everybody else \nbesides the HMOs are exempted out except them, and you are looking at \nthat kind of expense, what is going to be your natural reaction to \nthat? I am afraid many people are going to opt out.\n  There is no question that health care costs have gone up; they are \ngoing up already. We are already in double-digit increases in terms of \nhealth care costs in this country. That is the reason we set up managed \ncare. We obviously want the best of both worlds. Health care, once upon \na time, was going up astronomically. We said, we can't have health care \nfor everybody on demand, or it will drive us all bankrupt and we will \nleave a shambles for the next generation. One of the things we did was \nset up managed care.\n  We talk about managed care now as if it were some kind of evil \nenterprise. We set it up; Government set it up. We encouraged it in \nmany different ways in order to bring some cost control to the process \nbecause we wanted more people to be covered with insurance. So some of \nthe HMOs that engaged in egregious activities got caught doing things \nthey should not have been doing. States responded to much of that. The \nState of Tennessee has more coverage now for many of these things than \nthe bill that is on the floor does.\n  Most States have their own system they have set up. This bill comes \nalong and totally wipes all that out and says there is only so much the \nStates can do. Tell me what it is that needs to be done that the States \ncan't do if they choose to do it.\n  So now we are at the point--after having gone through the high health \ncosts and the response to that of setting up managed care, the response \nto\n\n[[Page S6640]]\n\nmanaged care abuses by the States--that health costs are now going back \nup. So what do we do? We come along and nationalize the rest of the \nsystem, which, under the most conservative estimates, will throw more \nthan a million people off insurance.\n  More than 1 million people will not have these problems, these \nterrible situations they find themselves in about choosing hospitals, \nthe nearest hospital, and all that. What hospital are they going to \nchoose if they have no insurance at all?\n  We cannot fool the American people into believing we can always have \nall of our cake and always eat it all at the same time. There are costs \nconnected with everything. What we are trying to do is achieve a \nrational balance so people have reasonable protections, reasonable \ncoverage at a cost that is affordable and will not drive people out of \nthe market and leave more and more people uninsured. That is what we \nare struggling for.\n  In that sense, does it make sense to hold employers who may or may \nnot choose to set up these plans, especially small employers, liable?\n  I am sure some will say: Why not make an employer liable because of \nsome kind of egregious activity? As my friend from Texas said, we can \nall come up with some kind of potential egregious activity. Suppose an \nemployer called up somebody connected with the plan that he controlled \nwho worked for him, let's say, at the front end of the process when \nthey were processing a claim, and gave them some instructions. It would \nbe a bad thing to do.\n  I could ask the same question with regard to a treating physician. \nWhat if a treating physician, because he has not been paid on time or \notherwise, was negligent, sloppy, or just angry, decided not to supply \nall the medical records for his patients to the plan in order for them \nto properly consider coverage? That would be a deliberate act, too. \nThey have been carved out of this process. One can come up with \ndeliberate acts of misconduct for other entities already carved out \nbecause we are not primarily looking at them. We do not want to drive \nthem out of the system or place undue burdens on them.\n  If something such as that happened, the person on the receiving end \nof the phone call is definitely liable. The HMO would be liable under a \nsituation such as that. As Senator Gramm pointed out, the final \ndecision is not with anyone who is subject to being influenced by an \nemployer.\n  This bill spends 12 pages under the original version setting up this \nindependent review process and qualified external review entity to make \nsure he is qualified, to make sure he is independent, to make sure he \ncannot be swayed by anyone, to make sure the Secretary is looking over \nhis shoulder at all times and having to report back to look at \nstatistics to make sure he is not going too far with the employer in \ntoo many cases. He is the guy who will be making the final decisions in \nmost of these cases, not someone the employer is going to be able to \ncall up.\n  Incidentally, it raises another interesting question in this bill. It \nis not directly related to the employer issue, but they will be caught \nup in it like anyone else.\n  There is an excellent review process that is set up by this bill. It \nhas the internal claims process, and then it has an internal review \nprocess. Then it goes to this qualified external review entity, which \nis set up as I just described--high qualifications, high degree of \nindependence, high degree of supervision.\n  They take a look to decide whether or not there is coverage in this \ncase. We could pass a law that says everybody is covered in every case. \nThat would be the logical extension of some of the rhetoric we hear \naround here, but everybody knows we cannot do that for obvious reasons. \nBut we have this entity set up to make that decision.\n\n  If he makes that decision totally objectively, not subject to \ncorruption, then a person can go to court and totally ignore everything \nthat has happened up to that point. Not only is that process I just \ndescribed not binding, it is not even relevant to the court lawsuit.\n  Let's take it a step further. Let's say this independent reviewer who \nI just described decides it is a medically reviewable question. This \nbill sets up an independent medical reviewer, and he or she is \nindependent also. The bill goes to great lengths to make sure this is a \nqualified medical independent person. It describes how their \ncompensation is set up, it puts in all these safeguards so we know we \nhave somebody who is a qualified professional doing the best he can to \nmake an objective determination on questions such as whether or not \nthis is really an experimental operation for which they are asking \ncoverage, whether or not it is medically appropriate under these \ncircumstances--issues such as that.\n  Then let's say he answers no. So you are going through the internal \nclaims process, the internal appeal process, the qualified external \nreview entity has gone through his process. Then it has been handed \nover to the independent medical reviewer, and he goes through his \nprocess. If it goes through all of that and everybody looking at all \nthe relevant documentation and listening to all the experts concludes \nthere is no coverage, the claimant can still go to Federal court and \nnot only is all this process not binding on the court, it is not even \nrelevant to the court. As best I can tell from this legislation, it is \nnot even admissible. The defendant in that lawsuit cannot even bring in \nthe fact that they spent the last year in this review process with all \nthese independent, objective, qualified experts looking at it. And we \nwon, the defendant says, but then you can set it all aside.\n  Even if we want to subject an HMO to that process because they are \nall evil, is this a process we want to subject an employer to? Is a \nsmall employer going to take a look at that kind of deal and say: This \nis something of which I want to be a part?\n  We are going to be asking ourselves that question because we can do \nsome good with this legislation and at the same time do some bad \nthrough some unintended consequences in a very complex area where \npeople do not sit still when Congress passes broad, sweeping \nlegislation.\n  People react to the laws that are on the books at the time. People \nlook at their own self-interests, and they figure out ways to protect \nthemselves. One of the easiest ways for a small business to protect \nitself from a process such as that is to get out of it.\n  As I said, as I have seen so far, the most conservative estimate says \nthat, under this bill, over 1 million people will lose their insurance \nbecause prices will go up so much further on top of the increases we \nare already seeing even before this legislation is passed. Medical \nprices are going to go up even further, and a lot of people are going \nto say: I do not need this kind of aggravation.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by reiterating what I said in the \nbeginning. This is a very important amendment. We have heard about the \nsalutary effects of the Texas law. Next week I want to talk about \nlawsuits in Texas. But Texas has been held up as an example, obviously, \nbecause that is the President's home State and people get a kick out of \nusing Texas as an example.\n  Let's use it as an example in this case. If the sponsors of this bill \nreally are not interested in targeting employers and including small \nemployers, then why do what Texas did? Let's just carve them out the \nway we did attending physicians, the way we did hospitals, the way we \ndid partially with qualified external reviewers, the way we did \npartially with independent medical reviewers, carving them out \npartially or totally. If we are really not after employers, let's carve \nthem out, too.\n  This is going to be an interesting debate and an important one not \nonly for the future of this legislation, but I think for the future of \nthe country. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reed). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, listening to this debate it probably sounds \nlike the Democrats have coined a good phrase, the Patients' Bill of \nRights, and they are the only ones in favor of it. It is a good phrase. \nWhat we are doing is legislating. Legislating means fixing the bill so \nthat it does what the title says.\n  We want to have a Patients' Bill of Rights. Both sides want a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. That is the fundamental issue before the \nSenate. The fundamental issue is getting patients the\n\n[[Page S6641]]\n\ncare they need when they need it. The lawsuits are peripheral. They are \nnot the main issue.\n  I have listened to my Republican colleagues discuss this matter for 2 \ndays; likewise, my Democratic colleagues continue to raise specific \nexamples of patients whose care was not appropriately delivered. They \nhave cited the need for their version of a Patients' Bill of Rights to \ncurb such abuses by HMOs. The Democrats know full well it is not a new \nright to sue that will address the cases they keep raising. They know \nit is the immediate medical review of the claim for benefits that will \nget people care and prevent more horrible injuries from occurring.\n  Here is the interesting part. We all agree on this point. Eighty \npercent of what is being talked about in the Patients' Bill of Rights \nwe agree on. Eighty percent of it will take care of the patients. That \nis the part on which we agree. It has been reflected in every version \nof the bill that has ever been introduced. Speaking on specific \nexamples of HMO wrongdoing is certainly relevant to this debate and \nlikely reinforces what the American people need for a bill.\n  However, the message the Democrats are trumpeting is misleading. I \nhear them saying they are the only ones who want a bill. I say again \nfor the fourth day and for the fourth year, I want to pass a Patients' \nBill of Rights and see it signed into law by the President. Patients \nare foremost in this debate. That should remain our focus. In our \neffort to meet that, we do need to make a number of modifications to \nthe underlying bill. The other 20 percent of the bill needs to be \nfixed. I believe we can do that and subsequently enact into law a \nstrong bill.\n  I don't know that it is universal that everybody wants a bill. I \nthink some people want an issue. I was involved in the Patients' Bill \nof Rights conference committee last year. Some of my more senior \ncolleagues tell me Members spent more time working that bill than any \nbill they can ever remember. We came that close to a solution. In fact, \nI know everybody realized we could have the solution, and we were about \nto get agreement on the entire package. Some decided that an issue was \nbetter than a solution, that the issue would resonate during the \nelections. So we don't have a Patients' Bill of Rights today. People \nbailed out of that conference committee, came out to this floor and \nintroduced a package that was clear back at the beginning of the \nnegotiations. It didn't contain a single issue we had resolved. They \nwanted an issue, not a solution.\n  We are all trying to get a Patients' Bill of Rights. We are all \nconcerned. Right now what we are doing is writing laws. Laws have to \nhave the right wording. I congratulate the Senators from Texas for \nproviding wording that is extremely important in this debate. I ask \nthat they make me a cosponsor on this amendment.\n  This is going to be extremely important to everybody who gets \ninsurance. It will be more important, of course, to the businesses that \nparticipate in providing that insurance. I watch out for the little \nguy. I was a small businessman. My wife and I started a family shoe \nstore in Gillette, WY. We saw what government regulation does to \npeople's job. Most of that government regulation is not bad for big \nbusiness because they can afford the specialist to do it.\n  The small businesses, who have to be experts in all of these areas we \nsee as grand solutions for everybody, don't have the experts. They have \nto handle all of these things on their own. I have been there and done \nthat and I will watch out for those small businesses.\n  One thing I will say about small business, those small business \nemployees recognize how tenuous the business is and consequently how \ntenuous their jobs are. They understand it is not a gold mine out \nthere, that it is a lot of hard work that provides people with \nservices, and consequently, people with jobs. They do understand, also, \nthat insurance is voluntary. They know their employer does not have to \ngive them insurance. The businesses want to provide the insurance. They \nrecognize it is a benefit that helps them keep the employee, but it is \nnot clear cut how that is provided.\n  As the insurance prices have gone up, more and more businesses have \ndropped insurance. As the price has gone up, more and more businesses \nhave shared the cost. They have said this is all we can afford, we will \nhave to share on the cost. Some businesses do not provide insurance and \nindividuals have to buy it themselves.\n  If costs go up, fewer and fewer of those businesses that are \nvoluntarily providing that, or are at least providing a portion of the \ninsurance, will continue. They are going to get out. One of the things \nthat will cause that to happen is the employer liability contained in \nthis bill. We are told there is no liability. I spent about 20 minutes \nyesterday discussing that there is liability here. On page 148 is the \nbeginning of the exclusions for physicians and other health care \nprofessionals. It is very straightforward. It covers one page of the \ntext. It says they can't be sued. Now, that is not an outright \nexclusion. It is pretty close to an outright exclusion. There are other \nways to be sued other than what is in the bill. This is found on page \n148, with the title at the bottom, but technically, the details are on \nthe next page, one page, double-spaced.\n  Page 150, exclusion of hospitals: Same deal, very straightforward. It \ntakes a page and a half for hospitals. Physicians only take one page \nfor exclusion, and hospitals take a page and a half. There are still \nways hospitals can be sued, as there are ways physicians can be sued.\n  I explained yesterday how the employer liability works. Page 144 says \ncauses of action against employers and plan sponsors precluded. It \nsounds about as straightforward as the others, doesn't it? The way I \ncounted, there are two dozen pages providing exceptions. It is not just \nlike you can begin reading at the beginning and see what the exceptions \nare. I mentioned yesterday, you better have a bushel basket of bread \ncrumbs to follow the trail as you go backwards and forwards looking at \nthe exceptions in the bill. Remember, this applies to small businesses. \nThey have to be able to understand this. The easy way out for them, if \nthey don't understand it, is to drop it and say, I am not going to be \nsued. If I don't carry the insurance, I can't be sued. It is that easy.\n  So they say, here is money I used to put into your insurance. I know \nyou participated in it and had to put some in, too. I know that is not \ndeductible. That is another sore point that ought to be cleared up \nwhile we are doing the bill. We had that opportunity the other night to \nallow deductibility for the insurance premiums for the self-employed.\n  That is another one of those small business issues that ought to be \ncleared up in this bill. The big corporations get deductibility for \ntheir insurance. The self-employed don't. Is that fair? I guess they do \nnot have good lobbyists. It is something we could get cleared up in \nthis bill, but we have already chosen not to do that. How did we choose \nnot to do that? Not by saying we are not going to allow the \ndeductibility by the small employer. None would have voted for that. \nInstead, we said there is this little parliamentary tactic that we can \nuse. We can say that, since the House didn't send us this tax \nprovision, we can confuse everybody and vote against it and keep those \nself-employed people from getting their insurance and never have to say \nthat is really what we are doing. Fifty-two Members--two more than \nneeded--said they weren't going to give the self-employed the same \nright to deduct insurance that we give to the big corporations.\n  Small businesses come under the self-employed category--the single \nproprietor that hires four or five people. That is the small businesses \nabout which we are talking. We wonder why they do not provide \ninsurance. We wonder why those in that group that do are a little bit \nconcerned about the liability that is involved in this bill. If they \nreally intended to include employers and plan sponsors, why didn't they \ndo it like they did for physicians? Why didn't they do it like they did \nfor hospitals? The wording can be just as easy. That is what this \namendment is about.\n  The bill is purported to follow the Texas plan. I congratulate the \nTexas Senators for kind of making them put their writing where their \nmouth is. The amendment we have here is the Texas version. It is a \nTexas version that says the employer can't be sued. With physicians and \njust as with hospitals, it isn't quite as straightforward as that. They\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\ncan still be sued, but not specifically because of the way this bill is \nwritten. Bad drafting produces bad legislation. I hope it was just \nwritten this way as a result of speed, but I have to tell you I think \nit was intentional.\n  I sat through all of those discussions about liability before and all \nof the unusual cases that can happen from it and all of the strange \nexceptions. Those will affect a few people in this country. But most of \nthem who will be losing their health insurance will never come into a \nsingle exception that applies to the employer, to the physician, or to \nthe hospital. They just want to be well. When you are sick, that is \nwhat you want. When you are sick, you are not trying to figure out who \nto sue and how to sue. When you are well, that can be taken care of.\n  I congratulate them on coming up with this amendment that will clear \nit up. I have to tell you I was a little disappointed when we spent a \ncouple of days talking about problems in this bill, and problems that \nwould make this bill acceptable. We have talked about those before, \nnegotiated them, and have had some success on that. I was really \ndisappointed when the first amendment by the proponents of this bill \nwas a sense of the Senate.\n  I hope everybody understands what a sense of the Senate is. A sense \nof the Senate is merely a political statement that takes up a lot of \nfloor time and results in a vote that is almost always unanimous. They \njust pick something that everybody is going to agree to. And we take \ntime debating it when we could be debating corrections that need to be \nmade to allow people to keep insurance. It is no surprise to anybody \nthat those wind up with a huge vote. I have to tell you that this one \nwas 89-1. Usually they are 99-1. I will also tell you that I am usually \nthe one. I vote against any sense of the Senate that comes here, unless \nit gives direct instructions to the Senators themselves. That is what \nthe sense of the Senate was designed for. It wasn't designed to tell \nthe House, or the President, or anybody else what to do. It was \ndesigned to give very specific instruction to us. But we have gotten \naway from that tradition.\n\n  Now if there is something that is peripherally related, we want to \nmake a big deal out of it, such as running an ad to the country. Then \nwe propose a sense of the Senate. There have been some fascinating ones \naround here--ones that nobody could understand how anybody could vote \nagainst. I do not understand how anybody could vote against them either \nbecause they don't achieve anything. But they make this great political \nad.\n  I thought that during some of this discussion there would have been \nan amendment that corrected a few things in this bill--maybe not even \nmajor things, but at least made a correction.\n  I was disappointed to hear the leader before this discussion say he \nthought they had compromised as much as they could. That is not how we \ndo legislation around here. You can't have this great smile and talk \nabout bipartisanship and then say you compromised as much as you can \nbefore the debate starts. That is not how we do legislation.\n  I told you that we agree on 80 percent of what is in the bill. That \nis the 80 percent that deals with the patients. Health insurance is \nvoluntary in this country. I know there are a lot of people who prefer \nthat were not the case, but we had that as another tax bill in the \nbureaucracy to provide inadequate care, as Canada is purported to do. \nAt least I assume they do, since most of their people come down here \nfor care. But we have a system where business pays, or business pays \npart and the employees pay part, or the individuals buy it on their \nown, or, in the worst of all worlds, there is no insurance in any \ncombination from anybody.\n  We have to make sure this Patients' Bill of Rights doesn't became a \npatient bill by driving up the costs, which, of course, will make some \nothers decide that since they have been paying for their own insurance \nthey can no longer afford it, or it will make businesses decide they \nwill have to pass along a bigger share to their employees, or that they \nwon't be able to afford insurance either.\n  That would be a patient's bill--not a Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  One of the great things about this bill, and one of the things we \nworked hard on in conference, and one of the things that was agreed to \nwas an internal and external review process. If you need the care, \nthere is a way to get it reviewed by doctors. If you do not like the \ndecision, there is a way to get it reviewed by doctors outside of the \nsituation so there isn't a conflict of interest.\n  Those approaches get care to the patient, and can even be expedited, \nif there is a dramatic health care problem. It can be expedited. There \nis the internal review and the external review, which will get you the \ncare and which makes the external review the final decisionmaker, as \nthe Senator from Texas said.\n  This bill ought to be written in a straightforward way. I was hoping \nthat the proponents of the bill would see the error, listen to the \ncomments that have been made, and make the changes. But they haven't. \nInstead, they purported that this is the Texas version, and since the \nTexas version and President's version is there, we ought to accept it. \nWe are pointing out that is not the Texas version. But we are willing \nto do the Texas version. Then it makes it just as straightforward for \nphysicians and for hospitals and for employers. It puts them all in the \nsame category. We say: Look, we know mistakes are made sometimes. But \nwe want to have health care, and we want to get everybody on board who \nis getting health care.\n  I have a few quotes that I want to share with you on this ability to \nsue and how effective it is of getting health care.\n  Dr. Richard Corlin, who is the president-elect of the American \nMedical Association, says:\n\n       We are for medical malpractice reform because we have seen \n     the consequences of what happens when it gets enacted and \n     what happens when it doesn't get enacted. . . . Premiums \n     drive people out of practice, they do not provide anything in \n     the way of added patient safety. . . . It's not just \n     physicians. The costs go up inordinately and they are passed \n     along to everyone.\n\n  He is talking about the propensity to sue in the United States, which \nis what we are talking about in the convoluted writing of this first \nprovision which first says we are going to exclude the providers, the \nbusinesses, from liability, and then weaves this nasty little web which \nshows that the intent is to sue them.\n  Another thing on lawsuits by the American Medical Association:\n\n       The AMA is strongly committed to legislation that would (1) \n     strengthen states' rights to govern the healthcare of their \n     clients, (2) shield employers from frivolous lawsuits, and \n     (3) not open the courts to a wide array of new lawsuits.\n\n  A member of the AMA board of trustees says:\n\n       Some opponents of patient protection legislation have \n     spuriously alleged that employers will be held liable for \n     simply selecting the plans, under this scenario. We therefore \n     believe that the bill should explicitly state that employers \n     and other plan sponsors cannot be held liable for fulfilling \n     their traditional roles as employers and plan sponsors.\n\n  That is from a member of the American Medical Association board of \ntrustees.\n  Another quote by the American Medical Association:\n\n       Although patients, physicians, and health care providers \n     are most directly harmed by the present liability system, \n     society as a whole is harmed. The spiraling costs generated \n     by our nation's dysfunctional liability system are borne by \n     everyone.\n\n  Remember, these are quotes from the people who are specifically \nexcluded in the bill, not the ones on the macrame string trail of not \nbeing excluded. And they still feel that strongly.\n  Another one from the American Medical Association:\n\n       In the testimony, the AMA indicated its concerns about \n     ``enterprise liability,'' a proposed policy change included \n     in the Clinton Administration's health reform, that would \n     have made health plans liable for physicians' malpractice. At \n     the time, the AMA stated, ``Enterprise liability may also \n     increase the frequency and magnitude of medical liability \n     claims as individuals become more willing to sue an anonymous \n     ``deep pocket.''\n\n  Everything isn't from the American Medical Association, and should \nnot be. I have a quote from the vice president of government affairs of \nthe Associated Builders and Contractors, Inc. He says:\n\n       Many of ABC's--\n\n  That is the Associated Builders and Contractors--\n\n     member companies are small businesses and thus the prospect \n     of facing a $5 million liability cap on ``civil assessments'' \n     is\n\n[[Page S6643]]\n\n     daunting. The financial reality is that if faced with such a \n     large claim, many of our members could be forced to drop \n     employee health insurance coverage rather than face the \n     potential liability or possibly even shut their business \n     down.\n\n  The Corporate Health Care Coalition says:\n\n       Enactment of this bill (McCain-Kennedy) would unleash a \n     flood of state court cases aimed at pushing the limits on \n     coverage of tested and often questionable medical treatments. \n     Cases that have been brought in state courts against state \n     employee plans have produced huge punitive damage awards \n     ($120 million in a recent California case) that have reshaped \n     health plan coverage in the plans. . . . Uncapped liability \n     exposure driven by aggressive personal injury lawyers will \n     raise health care costs for employees and make health \n     insurance increasingly unaffordable to individuals. Patient \n     rights begin with coverage.\n\n  Once again, we are trying to give people a Patients' Bill of Rights, \nnot a patient's bill.\n  I have to also quote the American Association of Health Plans:\n\n       Employers who voluntarily provide health care benefits to \n     their employees can be pulled into lawsuits under the \n     Kennedy-McCain bill. Under Kennedy-McCain, businesses could \n     be forced to pay unlimited economic and non-economic damages, \n     plus unlimited damages under state law and up to $5 million \n     of unprecedented punitive damages under federal law. One \n     lawsuit could easily bankrupt a small business.\n\n  The cost of pursuing it alone could undoubtedly bankrupt some of the \nsmall businesses with which I am familiar.\n  Also the American Association of Health Plans says:\n\n       According to a recent survey of 600 national employers by \n     Hewitt Associates, 46 percent of employers would be likely to \n     drop health care coverage for their workers if they are \n     exposed to new health care lawsuits.\n\n  Finally, from the American Health Care Partnership, the founder and \nchief medical officer says:\n\n       Employers, especially small and medium sized ones, \n     operating under tight profit margins, cannot afford to place \n     themselves at the risk imposed by onerous punitive damages. . \n     . . Companies will mitigate the risk by either dropping \n     health coverage altogether, or make health care a defined \n     contribution, which, due to adverse risk selection, will make \n     health care insurance unaffordable for most of the sick.\n\n  Again, yesterday, we passed up the opportunity to help small \nbusinesses. We used a parliamentary procedure, technique, to remove \nsome of the liability for Members of this body, so they could vote \nagainst having deductibility for insurance for the self-employed; that \nis, for the self-employed and their employees.\n  Now we are saying it is OK if we have good, clear, concise language \nin this bill that exempts physicians from lawsuits, and it is OK if we \nhave clear, concise language in here that exempts hospitals, but it is \nnot OK to exempt the people paying the bill, the people providing \nvoluntary health insurance in this country.\n  So I ask that my colleagues pay careful attention to this, make a \ncorrection in the bill, so it will make sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, this is such an important issue. I think \nit is important to start with the facts in the underlying bill. With \nall respect to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I feel \ncompelled today--after listening to the debate--to rise and to \nspecifically speak to the language in our Patients' Bill of Rights, to \nstate what it specifically says, not what has been talked about, not \nwhat the HMOs and the insurance companies are telling employers that it \nsays, but what it actually says.\n  Unfortunately, the biggest myth that has been perpetrated about this \nlegislation is in relation to businesses being sued. The reality is--\nand I take it from the relevant section of the bill; and I welcome \nanyone listening today, rather than listening to us going back and \nforth and debating the language in the bill, to go to the Congress.gov \nWeb site and look up the language themselves. I would encourage them to \ndo that. In this kind of debate that is very helpful to do, as people \nare interpreting and misinterpreting language.\n  In this bill--and I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bill--we have \nspecific language in section (5): ``Exclusion of Employers and Other \nPlan Sponsors.'' Then there is another subsection: ``Causes of Action \nAgainst Employers and Plan Sponsors Precluded.'' And other than a \ncouple of exceptions that I will speak to in terms of direct \ndecisionmaking, it says:\n\n       . . . does not authorize a cause of action against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor maintaining the plan (or \n     against an employee of such an employer or sponsor acting \n     within the scope of employment).\n\n  It does go on to talk about certain causes of action that are \npermitted, and it indicates that a cause of action may arise against an \nemployer to the extent there was direct participation by the employer \nor other plan sponsor in the decision of the plan--this would apply to \nvery few, if any; I don't know employers that directly make medical \ndecisions--if, in fact, the employer was making a direct decision, \ndirectly participating. And this goes on to talk about the fact that \nthis shall not be construed to be engaged in direct participation \nbecause of any form of decisionmaking or other conduct that is merely \ncollateral. It defines what that is.\n  This is not about those employers who hire someone to manage their \nplan, whether they hire an insurance company, they have coverage for \ntheir employees, or whether they themselves are self-insured and hire \nsomeone to administer their plan for them. The only way an employer \nwould be held accountable is if they had direct participation in the \ndecision, if the employer denied the test, if the employer was the one \nmaking the medical decision; we would all agree in that small number of \noccasions. I don't know anyone directly providing and making medical \ndecisions--possibly a group of physicians together in a business or \nsome other medical group. The employers I know either have their \ninsurance through an insurance company or they pay someone to \nadminister the plan. In those cases, you cannot come back against the \nemployer.\n  We make it extremely specific. I would not want to have the HMO or \nthe insurance company be able to come back against an employer.\n  It is extremely important that we make it clear what is going on. It \nis very unfortunate that we have seen so much misinformation in order \nto scare small businesses and other employers about what this does.\n  I will speak about a small business owner--this is someone about whom \nI have spoken before--and how he feels about this. Sam Yamin from \nBirmingham, MI, owned a tree trimming business, had insurance, and \nthought he had health insurance and care available through that \ninsurance for himself and his family and employees. He had an accident. \nHe had a severe accident with a chain saw.\n  He was rushed to the nearest emergency room. The surgeons came in to \ndo emergency surgery on his leg to save the nerves. They called the \nHMO, and the HMO said: Sorry, you are at the wrong emergency room. We \nare not going to OK this emergency surgery to save this man's leg. You \nhave to pack him up and take him across town.\n  That is what they did. And this small businessman who had insurance, \nwho paid the premiums, who believed that he had cared for himself, his \nemployees, his family, was packed up, taken across town, where he sat \non a gurney for 9 hours before he literally pulled a phone out of the \nwall in desperation and pain to get attention to receive care.\n  In that situation, instead of the surgery the doctors had said needed \nto be performed in order to save the nerve endings in his leg, he was \nsewn up. The least amount of procedure was done. He was sent home.\n  Today this small business owner no longer has his small business. \nToday this gentleman does not have the use of his leg. This gentleman \nis disabled. Sam and Susan Yamin described this situation as having \ngone through ``health care hell.'' This small businessman would gladly \npay what is 23 cents a month per person for the accountability \nprovisions in this bill--23 cents a month, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office--in order to have his leg functioning, in \norder to have his business back, in order to have his family out of the \nincredible debt that resulted from this situation.\n\n  Was the HMO held accountable for this decision? They can be held \naccountable for the cost of the test he\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\ndidn't receive or the cost of the procedure, but they cannot be held \naccountable for the loss of this man's business, for his life \ndramatically changing, his and his family's, for the permanent \ndisability and the ongoing pain he tells me he has and the medical \ncosts he now has. He cannot hold the HMO accountable for the \nconsequences of the medical decisions they made.\n  That is the debate, plain and simple. There are only two categories \nof people--and this has been said by colleagues of mine over and over \nagain on the floor, but we should all understand--in the United States \nof America who cannot be held accountable for their decisions: foreign \ndiplomats and HMOs. That is pretty shocking.\n  This bill says that HMOs, insurance companies, have to be held \naccountable for the medical decisions they make that affect our \nfamilies. People are paying the bill. Businesses are paying the bill. I \nknow they want their employees to have the health care they are \nassuming they will receive because they are paying for it.\n  If we ask and if we are factual about what this bill entails, if \npeople understand the truth about this bill and that they are not held \naccountable unless the medical decision is made by the business and \nthat the difference in cost is 23 cents a month and you ask them: Would \nyou add 23 cents a month per employee to make sure that when you get \ndone, the health care is really there and that there are good medical \ndecisions and accountability if there is a problem? I know the people \nof Michigan say yes.\n  That is what this is about: 23 cents a month per person. We know that \nwhen this provision has been put in, in other States, when patients' \nrights have been put in, in the State of Texas--almost the same \nlanguage--they have averaged, I think it is five lawsuits a year. \nCalifornia has put in this language; so far, zero lawsuits. These are \nscare tactics being put forward by the people who control the decisions \ntoday--the HMOs and the insurance companies.\n  I appreciate from their perspective, they have a good thing going. \nThey control the decisions. They can't be held accountable. That is a \ngreat deal, if you can get it. But it is a terrible deal if you are a \nmom or a dad who cares about your kids, if you are a business that \ncares about your employees, if you are a family farmer worried about \nwhat is going to happen on the farm, if you are anyone needing care or \nif you are anyone providing care. The frustration of doctors and nurses \nand dentists and other providers in this country is unbelievable \nbecause they see every day what happens.\n  This is not about lawsuits. We have protected employers. This is \nabout good medical decisions. There is no evidence whatsoever that good \nmedical decisions will not be made and that instead we will just be \nincreasing lawsuits. There is no evidence anywhere beyond rhetoric that \nsays that that is true.\n  I urge that we proceed with the language in the bill which is very \nclear: There is no ability to proceed to sue a business unless they \nparticipate directly in the medical decisions. It seems only right to \nbe able to have that happen.\n  One other point I will make. It is true that we need to provide more \nsupport for small businesses to provide insurance. I support that. It \nis true that we should be allowing someone who is self-employed to \ndeduct 100 percent of their cost. In fact, during the tax bill, we put \nan amendment up and colleagues on this side of the aisle--Senator \nDurbin took the lead with others, and we passed a provision to help \nsmall businesses and the self-employed. It was taken out in the \nconference committee.\n  So it didn't pass, even though we tried to pass it. I support it and \nI will support it again. But this is about making sure that people who \npay for insurance get the care they think they are buying.\n  One other point, there is no question that insurance costs have gone \nup. I believe it is 10 percent last year. There is no relationship to \nwhat we are debating now. When I talk to employers, hospitals, and \nphysicians, they say what has a lot to do with the uncontrollable rise \nin health care costs is prescription drugs. That is the No. 1 \nuncontrollable cost in the health care system today.\n  I am anxious to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \norder to address that and, hopefully, very soon after passing the \nPatients' Bill of Rights we will address the access and cost of \nprescription drugs. There is no question that we have high costs. We \nhave rising costs of health care. But when I talk to my doctors, my \nhospital administrators, and businesses, they tell me the insurance \ncompanies tell them it is going up because of the cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  We are talking about a difference of 23 cents a month per employee \nfor the accountability provision in this bill. I go back to Sam Yamin \nfrom Birmingham, MI, an employer himself who today sits at home in pain \nwith high, mounting health care bills because of the lack of \naccountability. I know that Mr. Yamin and the business community and \nthe families I support think that this bill is worth it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think maybe the distinguished majority \nwhip has a unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nresume consideration of S. 1052 on Monday, June 25, at 2 p.m. and that \nit be in order on Monday to debate concurrently both the Grassley \nmotion and the Gramm amendment No. 810; further, that on Monday, \nSenator McCain or his designee be recognized to offer an amendment; \nfurther, when the Senate resumes consideration of S. 1052 on Tuesday, \nJune 26, at 9:30 a.m. there be 2 hours for debate in relation to the \nGrassley motion and the Gramm amendment with the time for debate \nequally divided in the usual form; further, at 11:30 on Tuesday, the \nSenate vote in relation to the Grassley motion, followed by a vote in \nrelation to the Gramm amendment, with 2 minutes of closing debate prior \nto each rollcall vote, divided in the usual form, with no second-degree \namendments or motions in order prior to the votes; further, that upon \ndisposition of the McCain, or designee, amendment, Senator Gregg, the \nmanager of the bill, or designee, would be recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. President. I appreciate my friend's courtesy \nin yielding the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not going to get into a fight with our \ndear new colleague from Michigan. She has always been very sweet to me. \nI want to make a couple points that I think are very relevant to the \nissue before us. Let me make one thing clear. The bill that I \ncosponsored on the Patients' Bill of Rights last year with Senator \nNickles, Senator Frist, and others, which passed the Senate by one \nvote, required that every HMO in America apply a prudent layperson \nstandard in admitting people to emergency rooms. It is exactly the same \nlanguage that is in the Democrat bill that is before us today. \nBasically, it says that if you are experiencing something that to a \nreasonable layperson would convince you that something bad is happening \nto you and it might hurt you or kill you, you can go to the emergency \nroom.\n  So the issue before us has had absolutely nothing to do with the \nright of people to go to the emergency room. In the bill before us, \nthat right is guaranteed. In the Republican bill that we passed last \nyear, that right was guaranteed, and it was guaranteed in exactly the \nsame language. Also, as good as it sounds to say that an employer might \ncall the emergency room and say don't admit this employee of mine, A, I \nam not aware that any employer has ever done it; secondly, the \nemergency room doesn't work for the HMO. And in virtually every State \nin the Union it is illegal for them not to admit the patient and the \nHMO is going to pay for the care.\n  So it sounds like a good example, but it makes no sense, nor would an \nemergency room ever, based on an employer calling and saying ``don't \nadmit this person,'' fail to admit them when the emergency room is \nguaranteed that they are going to get paid and that the HMO is required \nby law to pay for the service they are going to provide.\n  Now, let me go back to the central issue here, which is not people \nbeing\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\nabused and not being admitted to the emergency room--that has never \nbeen an issue in this debate. Both parties agree on that. That is part \nof about 90 percent of the provisions in both bills that are identical. \nWhat we are not debating here or what the majority side of the aisle, \nthe Democrats, don't want to debate is suing employers. That is the \nissue that is before us.\n\n  The amendment that I proposed is an amendment from the Texas law, and \nwe chose it because the proponents of this bill hold the Texas law up \nas an example of what they want to do. The Texas law is the result of \nthe Texas Legislature looking at this problem and concluding that they \nwanted people to be able to sue their medical plan, they wanted people \nto be able to sue HMOs; but because your employer helped you buy health \ninsurance, they didn't want to put the employer in harm's way, where \nyour employer could be sued.\n  Why didn't they? For two reasons, really: One, the employer is the \ngood guy here. Nobody makes them help you buy health insurance. They \nchoose to do it. We didn't want them to choose not to do it. Secondly, \nwe knew if we made it so you could sue employers for the simple act of \ndoing something good for their employees that especially small \nbusinesses without deep pockets would be forced to cancel their health \ninsurance.\n  So the Texas Legislature wrote their law, which proponents of this \nbill say is almost identical to the bill before us, which, as I will \nshow, is not true. But the Texas Legislature basically said that this \nchapter, the provision of the bill, does not create any liability on \nthe part of an employer or an employer group purchasing organization \nthat purchases coverage or assumes risk on behalf of its employees. We \nare trying to exempt employers from lawsuits.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. FRIST. It is clear that this whole issue of suing employers is \ncritically important.\n  In debates, again and again we hear that the Kennedy bill does not \nallow employers to be sued. Yet if you read their bill, there are all \nthese pages and pages of exceptions. I want to clarify, for my own use, \nthe law in Texas. It says ``does not create any liability on the part \nof an employer'' and then there is a period. Does the Texas law have \nmany exceptions after that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Texas law has no exceptions after that. There are no \nifs, ands, or buts in the Texas law. You cannot sue an employer. They \nchose not to for two reasons. One, the employer is the guy helping buy \nthe health insurance. Why would we sue the employer? And, two, they \nwere very much afraid that if you let people sue their employer when \nthey are in a dispute with their HMO, and not with their employer, that \nthe employer, who is not required to buy health insurance, might stop \noffering health insurance.\n  Our colleagues who are for the bill before us say: In Texas, there \nhave not been these rash of lawsuits. Part of the reason is, in Texas, \nyou cannot sue the employer.\n  Let me explain what is different between the Texas law and the bill \nthat is before us. Sure enough, the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan, as have many supporters of the bill, read us paragraph (A); \nin fact, the heading before paragraph (A) is very clear. It is a little \ntedious, but bear with me a second.\n  Their bill says in title (5):\n\n       Exclusion of Employers and Other Plan Sponsors.--\n\n  That sounds like they are excluding employers, right? Then they say \nin paragraph (A):\n\n       Causes of Action Against Employers and Plan Sponsors \n     Precluded.--\n\n  If it had ended there, they would have been precluded, but they come \ndown and say:\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B)--\n\n  Remember that; it is always a dead give-away that things are not \nexactly as they say:\n\n       Subject to subparagraph (B), paragraph (1)(A) does not \n     authorize a cause of action against an employer or other plan \n     sponsor maintaining the plan (or against an employee of such \n     an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of \n     employment).\n\n  If they stopped right there, this would have been the equivalent of \nthe Texas law.\n  When Democrats defend this bill and say we do not allow suing \nemployers, that is generally where they stop, but their bill does not \nstop there. Their bill goes on to say in paragraph (B), which was \nalready referred to previously, that:\n\n       Certain Causes of Action Permitted.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor. . . .\n\n  Then for 7 pages, they have all kinds of ifs, ands, or buts. Then \nthey have little provisions that have little hooks in them. I want to \nexplain one of them. There are a bunch of them, but I want to explain \none of them.\n  They are saying conditions under which an employer can be sued, and \nthen they use the following term. They say: ``Failure described in . . \n. such paragraph, the actual making of such decision or the actual \nexercise of control in making such decision. . . .''\n  That does not sound too perilous until you realize that under ERISA, \na Federal statute which governs all employee benefits in America, that \nthe employer is always assumed to be exercising control. In fact, ERISA \nassumes or requires that the employer be bound to be 100-percent \nresponsible and deemed to be in control of employee benefits.\n\n  The point I am making is, they have seven and a half pages of \nconditions under which employers can be sued, including these little \nprovisions that people reading it do not know refers back to law where \nthe employer on employee benefits are always assumed to be in control. \nBut the tell-tale sign comes at the end of the seven and a half pages. \nHere is what they do.\n  At the end of the seven and a half pages, they exclude physicians \nfrom being sued. They exclude hospitals from being sued, but then if \nyou had any doubt in your mind, any question in your heart as to \nwhether they intend to sue employers, look at the last little sentence \nin this seven and a half pages of ifs, ands, or buts, gobbledygook, \nlegal reference. Let me just read it. They are talking about \nphysicians:\n\n       (8) Rules of Construction Relating to Exclusion from \n     Liability of Physicians, Health Care Professionals, and \n     Hospitals.--\n\n  The heading sounds like it has nothing to do with employers, does it? \nBut then it says:\n\n       Nothing in paragraph (6)--\n\n  And Paragraph (6) is the paragraph that says you cannot sue a \nphysician--\n\n     and nothing in paragraph (7)--\n\n  Which is the paragraph that says you cannot sue a hospital--\n\n     shall be construed to limit the liability (whether direct or \n     vicarious) of the plan, the plan sponsor--\n\n  And who is the plan sponsor as required under ERISA? The plan sponsor \nis the employer.\n\n     or any health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage in connection with a plan.\n\n  In other words, after seven and a half pages of conditions under \nwhich employers can be sued, including where they are deemed to be in \ncontrol of employer benefits where ERISA requires they always be \ntreated as in control, they then exempt doctors and hospitals. But just \nto be absolutely sure that employers were not exempt, they add the \nlanguage that nothing in exempting the doctors and the hospitals would \nbe construed as limiting the liability of the plan sponsor, which is \nthe employer.\n  The plain truth is that this is confusing, but it is a classic bait \nand switch. It is a classic bait and switch when they say you cannot \nsue them, and then notwithstanding the paragraph that says you cannot \nsue them, which is subparagraph (A), they then go on to have a cause of \naction that may arise against an employer or other plan sponsor, and \nthen they go on for seven and a half pages of where you can sue the \nemployer. Then they decide: Gosh, it probably would be good politics \nright now to exclude physicians and hospitals who are involved in \nhealth care. And then so there is no doubt whatsoever, they come back \nand say: But in excluding doctors and hospitals, we are not excluding \nemployers from being sued.\n  To suggest that in any shape, form, or fashion this language is \nequivalent to the language in Texas, which says you cannot sue an \nemployer, is invalid. What does our amendment do?\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n  Mr. FRIST. May I ask one more question? It really has to do with this \nsubject. Madam President, may I address a question to the Senator from \nTexas?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). The Senator may ask a question.\n  Mr. FRIST. This is the Texas law. I want to make it clear, because \nthe answer to my first question was that there are not five or six \npages of exceptions in Texas law.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There are no exceptions in Texas.\n  Mr. FRIST. We have to make it clear because again and again during \nthis debate the statement is being made that what the Kennedy bill does \nin terms of employers is exactly what the Texas law does. But with what \nthe Senator from Texas has just gone through, that is simply not true.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right, there is no question about that. When the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan--and others have done it as well--\nsay what if the employer called up the emergency room and said: Do not \nprovide treatment to my employee, let my employee die--first, under all \nof the bills people are guaranteed admission to the emergency room. The \nfirst thing the attending physician--and the Senator from Tennessee has \nbeen there--the first thing the attending physician says to the \nemployer is drop dead because the law guarantees the emergency room is \ngoing to be paid by the HMO.\n  In Texas, they didn't conclude that there may not be employers that \ntry to do bad things. What they concluded was the following: First, \nthere are checks and balances. If an employer tries to interfere in \nanybody getting health care, how does this bill work? How does the \nTexas plan work? If I think I need health care and I don't get it, I \ncan ask for internal review. There is an internal review. If I don't \nbelieve I have been treated fairly, I can ask for an external review. \nThat is guaranteed. The external review is made up of a panel of \nphysicians who don't work for the HMO and who are not hired by the \nemployer. How does the employer exert any control over this final \ndecisionmaker, which is this external review panel? The employer can \nexert no control over the external review panel.\n  Now what our Democrat colleagues have said is, there may be some \ncircumstance where employers could do something bad. The point is, not \nthat there might not be an employer that tried to do something bad, but \nthe whole bill is set up to produce checks and balances.\n  When the Texas Legislature decided to exempt employers, they were not \nassuming employers were all well intended. They were not assuming that \nsomething bad couldn't happen because of something an employer did. \nThey simply looked at the cost and the benefits. They concluded, with \nall the checks and balances they had in their bill, which are in the \nbill before the Senate, we are pretty well protected from employers \ndoing bad things because of internal and external review and the right \nto go to court. You can always sue the HMO.\n  They decided if you get into these provisions, as this bill does, of \nwhen you can sue the employer, that you are going to create so much \nuncertainty, so many unintended consequences where maybe your objective \nwas good but you are going to create unintended consequences where an \nemployer could be sued when they were not trying to do anything wrong, \nthat the Texas Legislature was deathly afraid of people losing their \nhealth insurance because you are not required to provide health \ninsurance as an employer.\n  So they decided, looking at the whole picture, that thanks to the \nchecks and balances of internal and external review, the safest thing \nto do if you don't want people to lose their health insurance, is \nexempt the employer. You can say there is something to be gained by not \nexempting the employer, by having seven pages of ifs, ands, or buts, \nbut if that induces the employer to drop your health issue, what good \ndoes it do you?\n  Let me conclude with the following two charts.\n  Mr. FRIST. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. FRIST. Please state what your amendment does. Clearly, you can \nsue your employer. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill says you can sue the \nemployer. How do you fix this? We clearly have to fix it. The trial \nlawyer makes 40 cents on the dollar and, in a $1 million suit, that \nputs $400,000 in their pocket. Only 33 percent goes to the patient and \nthe rest to the lawyer and the system. Clearly, the lawyer has \nincentive to sue.\n  You can sue the HMO, the doctor, the hospital, the plan \nadministrator, and the employer. They tried to take care of the doctor \nand the hospital. You can sue the HMO. How do you fix this? Clearly, \nthe lawyer will go for the employer. How will it be fixed by your \namendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The amendment mirrors Texas law that says nothing in the \nbill creates any liability on the part of the employer or an employer \ngroup purchasing organization, that purchases coverage or assumes risk \non behalf of its employees. No ifs, ands, or buts, no modifying \nclauses, no seven and a half pages of exceptions. You simply cannot sue \nthe employer.\n\n  Those who support S. 1052 unamended, despite all their efforts to the \ncontrary, are creating numerous loopholes that will force small \nbusinesses in your hometown and my hometown to look at this and say, I \ndon't know if I can be sued. They will go to lawyers, and the lawyers \nwill say it will depend on a jury, it will depend on the court, it will \ndepend on how good that plaintiff's attorney is.\n  You need to recognize there are seven and a half pages in this bill \nof circumstances under which you can be sued. When you relate this \nlanguage to other laws like ERISA, it sure looks as if you can be sued.\n  I am afraid for little employers in Arkansas, Tennessee, Texas, and \neverywhere else. I often talk about my friend Dicky Flatt who has 10 \nemployees. I can envision Dicky Flatt getting together with his \nemployees and saying: Look, with this new law, I cannot be sure that I \ncan't be sued if you have a bad experience in our health plan. While I \nlove you all and while we built this business together, I can't let the \nwork of my foreman, my work, my mother's, my wife's work, and our \nchildren's work be put in jeopardy. So I will have to stop providing \nhealth coverage.\n  That is what will happen. The only way to guarantee it will not \nhappen is to do what the Texas Legislature did.\n  The proponents of this bill say: Look at how great it has worked in \nTexas. If you want it to work as it has worked in Texas, do it the way \nthey did it in Texas. Exempt the employer. So for every small business \nin Arkansas, every small business in Tennessee, every Dicky Flatt, \nthere will be things they are uncertain about in the bill, but the one \nthing they know is: You cannot sue me because I cared enough about my \nemployees to buy them health insurance. You cannot do it. You can sue \nthe HMO. You can sue the health care provider if they didn't do a good \njob. But you can't sue me because I negotiated the plan, because I am \nresponsible for it under ERISA, because I picked two employees to \nrepresent all of us in interfacing with this HMO, with this insurance \ncompany. You cannot sue me for that.\n  Why is that so important? There are a lot of Americans who still \ndon't have health insurance and who are losing health insurance every \nday. When we debated the Clinton health care bill, there were 33 \nmillion Americans who didn't have health insurance. Today, there are \n42.6 million Americans who don't have health insurance. Shouldn't we be \nconcerned about a bill that could add millions to this number?\n  I remind my colleagues, the Congressional Budget Office, in looking \nat this bill, concluded it would drive up insurance by more than 4 \npercentage points in cost. The estimate that is normally used is \n300,000 people lose their health insurance for every 1 percent increase \nin cost. So at a minimum, we are looking at 1.2 million people losing \ntheir health insurance.\n  But there is one other thing. In looking at that number, did CBO look \nat the fact that employers could be sued? Or did they just look at the \nfirst paragraph that said they couldn't be sued? Nothing in CBO's \nestimate seems to take into account that employers can be sued under \nthis bill.\n  The final reason that goes beyond health insurance goes to something \nmore important to your health than whether you have health insurance or \nnot.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n  What is that? It is the right to choose your freedom because we are \nthe only developed country in the world where people still have freedom \nto choose their own health care and their own health care providers.\n  It is pretty startling when you think about it. I have listed the \nrichest, most developed countries in the world. These are the so-called \nG-7 countries. Every time we have a meeting of the G-7, these are the \ncountries that are at that meeting. They are the countries that are \nrich, like we are--Canada, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, \nGermany, and the United States of America. Those are the richest \ncountries in the world.\n  In Canada, 100 percent of health care is dominated by the Government. \nIn Canada, a famous cancer doctor said as he left the system a week or \nso ago, that I have patients dying of cancer in Canada who could be \ntreated. But they have a Government-run system. They have lost \nsomething more important than their health insurance in Canada. They \nhave lost their freedom.\n  In Italy, a 100-percent Government system;\n  In Japan, a 100-percent Government system;\n  In the United Kingdom, everybody has to be a member of the Government \nsystem. They have a loophole for very rich people. They can go outside \nthe system and get treatment from the doctor independently of the \nsystem. They have to pay for it twice. But only rich people can afford \nto pay for it twice.\n  In France, 99 percent of health care is controlled by Government; in \nGermany, 92 percent.\n  Then we come to the United States of America. Sixty-seven percent of \nAmericans have the right to choose. They are free to choose their \nhealth care. Obviously, they are concerned about losing their health \ninsurance. That is why I don't want people to sue employers. But there \nis something bigger you can lose. You can lose your freedom.\n  I know my Democrat colleagues get mad when I keep going back to the \nClinton debate, but it is relevant on this one point. I will make it \nand then stop.\n  In 1994, when President Clinton proposed we take everybody out of \nprivate health care and force everybody to buy health care through the \nGovernment, in that plan, if your doctor thought you needed health care \nthat was not prescribed by the health care purchasing cooperative in \nyour region, and your doctor went ahead and gave it to you anyway, your \ndoctor could be fined $10,000.\n  If you thought your baby was dying, and you went to the doctor and \nsaid, look, I know this treatment is not prescribed by this health care \npurchasing cooperative, and I know the Government won't pay for it, but \nI will pay for it; can you provide the care, under the Clinton bill, \nthe doctor would be sent to prison for 5 years for providing the care.\n  What was the argument for this bill? The argument for this bill was \nthat 33 million people were uninsured and that was the price we had to \npay to cover them.\n  Today we have 42.6 million people uninsured. If we pass a bill \nletting people sue employers and employers dropped their health \ncoverage, won't the same people who were for this plan 7 years ago be \nback here saying now it is not 33 million who are uninsured, but it is \n50 million? They are not going to tell you their plan produced the 50 \nmillion. They are not going to tell you that suing employers caused \nsmall and medium sized and large businesses to drop health insurance. \nThey are just going to say: Look. The time has come to now have the \nGovernment take over health care. Look. Shouldn't we be doing it? \nEverybody else in the developed world is doing it, and America is out \nof step. And what we need to do to get people coverage is to have one \nGovernment plan.\n\n  My colleagues, I simply urge that before we do something as harmful--\nsuch as letting people sue the employer for helping them buy health \ninsurance--let's think about what that is going to do to employers \ndropping health insurance.\n  I hope everybody understands that you don't have to provide health \ninsurance. No employer is required by law to provide health insurance. \nThey do it because they think it is good business, and they do it \nbecause they love the people who work for them. But if you put the \nbusiness at risk, they will stop providing health insurance. This \nnumber is going to go up and then we are going to start having a system \nsuch as Canada, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.\n  If anyone wants to know why I am so concerned about this bill, it is \nbecause I am not going to lose my health insurance. I have the standard \noption Blue Cross/Blue Shield. In fact, under this plan, if I needed \nsome health care, this external review process can deem that Blue \nCross/Blue Shield has to give it to me, even if they specifically \npreclude it in the contract. I bought the standard option, but I am \ngoing to get the high option under this bill.\n  What is going to happen to my health insurance costs? It is going to \ngo up. I am not going to lose my health insurance, but there are a lot \nof Americans who may. If they lose their health insurance, the people \nwho are blessed, such as I and every Member of the Senate is, may not \nlose our health insurance. But we could ultimately lose our freedom. I \nwant to ask people to think about that as we cast this vote.\n  The Texas Legislature did not conclude that every employer was the \nsame. They did not conclude that there might not be bad actors out \nthere. They concluded that this bill, as our bill, gives real \nprotections against that, but, in the end, they concluded that if you \nlet people sue the employer because of a dispute with an HMO or health \ncare provider, you are going to end up having people drop their health \ninsurance.\n  We need to do the right thing in this bill. There are too many ifs, \nands, and buts. There are 7\\1/2\\ pages of exceptions. If you want to be \nable to go home and say to the small mom-and-pop businesses, under the \nbill I voted for you cannot sue an employer, then you are going to have \nto vote for this amendment, or else you are not going it be able to say \nit.\n  I thank Senator and Dr. Frist for his great leadership on this issue. \nThe amazing thing is we agree on 90 percent of this bill. The amazing \nthing is if we could take about six or seven issues, and fix them, we \nwould get 90 votes, maybe 100 votes on this bill. One of those has to \nbe you can't sue the employer. Another has to be that when Blue Cross/\nBlue Shield signs a contract with me, I can't come back after the fact \nand say: Well, now I only paid for 60 days in the hospital for mental \ncare, but I need more. If I needed it, I should have bought the high \noption. If they give it to me, they are going to have to charge me for \nwhat the high option would have been. This has to be fixed.\n  We also have to have some reason and responsibility on lawsuits. When \nis the last time anybody was healed in a courtroom? I have seen people \nhealed in the emergency room, in doctor's offices, outpatient clinics, \nhospitals, and even as a little boy with my grandmother, I have seen \npeople healed in revival tents. But I have never seen anybody healed in \na courtroom.\n  Our Democrat colleagues say: Look. We have these rights to sue. \nGreat. But if my child is sick, I don't want to sue. I want health \ncare. After my baby is dead, I am not interested in going to the \ncourthouse and suing somebody. I want my child to have health care.\n  We have agreed on internal and external reviews. We have said that \nanybody can go to the emergency room. We have set up systems on which \nwe agree. But we don't agree on these endless lawsuits that can destroy \naccess to health care. What good is the right to sue a plan if I am not \na member of the plan because I lost my health insurance?\n  If we could work out those five or six issues, we would have a bill \nthat everybody could be for. But don't think for a minute that those \nissues are not critical to health care and critical to America. That is \nwhat this fight is about.\n  I ask my colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle and some of my \ncolleagues over here that are for this bill: Do you really believe that \nthis matches what Moses brought down from Mount Sinai?\n  Is this really the embodiment of perfection? Do you have every good \nidea that was ever had in history? Could it be that it could be \nimproved? Could it be that some reason and compromise might actually \nmake the bill better? My guess is it could be; and I hope they will \nconsider it possible.\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Texas because \nthe discussion over the last 20 minutes makes it crystal clear--walking \nstep by step through the bill--that employers, under the Kennedy bill, \ncan be sued. The amendment of the Senator from Texas basically says: \nLet's take the words of the Texas law and pass them in this Senate \nChamber. It will make it crystal clear, with no exceptions, that \nemployers cannot be sued.\n  The chart that has been shown by the Senator from Texas is the Texas \nlaw verbatim. It is interesting. The Senator from Texas took the exact \nwords in the Texas law and put them in his amendment.\n  I have just asked to have the chart brought down a little bit closer \nso I can walk through it because this chart is a little bit different \nthan the one we showed earlier. It is the actual picture of the page of \nthe Texas law.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Texas is several pages in terms of \nthe explanation and the definition, but the words that are actually \nused in the amendment are ``does not create any liability on the part \nof an employer or other plan sponsor (or on the part of an employee of \nsuch an employer or sponsor acting within the scope of employment).''\n  He took the words exactly from the Texas law, which are: ``does not \ncreate any liability on the part of an employer.'' That is crystal \nclear. In the rest of it there are no exceptions. In the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill, there is page after page of exceptions.\n  I am very glad this amendment is being considered in this Chamber \ntoday because we have an opportunity--through this afternoon, and \ntomorrow, and the next day--for our colleagues to go back and actually \nread the bill. We can debate in this Chamber and on the television \nshows and we can read in the newspapers about the question of whether \nor not you can sue an employer. Now I believe it is crystal clear, \nafter the debate, that you can sue employers under the Kennedy bill. \nTherefore, all the employers of the 170 million people in this country \nwho voluntarily receive their insurance through their employers--that \nis just about everybody in the gallery and those watching on C-SPAN and \neveryone else who does not have Medicare or Medicaid--can be sued under \nthe McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill.\n\n  When you go around the water fountain on Monday--or if you are \nworking on the weekend, or have a shift later tonight--turn to your \nemployer and say: Do you mean to say, if this McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill passes, you can be sued for voluntarily providing health \ninsurance? This applies to unions as well. I want to talk about that \nbecause that is actually addressed, and the Senator from Texas did not \nmention it. All the union members should listen to this.\n  You cannot right now. You cannot under the proposal of the Senator \nfrom Texas. You cannot under the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords plan. Under the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy plan, you can be sued. If this bill were passed \ntomorrow, your employer could be sued the next day.\n  I hope those 170 million people are listening and do pay attention to \nthis amendment. Again, the Gramm amendment says: This bill ``does not \ncreate any liability on the part of an employer. . . .''\n  Let me show, first, what the Texas law is. This is an actual picture \nof the page itself. It says:\n\n       This chapter does not create any liability on the part of \n     an employer--\n\n  Do those words sound familiar? They should. What I am showing you is \na blown up picture of the law Texas passed in 1997 that has been very \nsuccessful. Again, this is from the State of our current President of \nthe United States, who, as Governor, signed this law. The words: ``does \nnot create any liability on the part of an employer''--if that sounds \nfamiliar, it should, because those are the exacts words that are in the \nGramm amendment: ``does not create any liability on the part of an \nemployer''. But those words are not in the underlying McCain-Edwards-\nKennedy bill.\n  I posed the question to the Senator from Texas: Are there exceptions \nin here? As you look through it, no there are not exceptions. There is \na period. There is a period under the Texas law. As you look at the \namendment by the Senator from Texas, there is a period after \n``employment.'' Again, there are no exceptions.\n  If you look at the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill--I do not have it \nright in front of me--but there are pages and pages of exceptions. The \nSenator from Texas very eloquently went through those exceptions.\n  So that is the amendment--a simple amendment--which crystallizes, for \nme, many of the arguments. I am glad we got to that amendment because \nit is important to address the big issues of the bill. The Senator from \nTexas again outlined very well years of work--and the Senator from \nMassachusetts has been involved for years and has initiated much of the \ndiscussion on Patients' Bill of Rights. I think he needs to be \ncommended for that. The Senator from Massachusetts and I, and the \nSenator from Texas, spent much of last year debating these same issues \naround a table, in this Chamber, and also in what we call a markup in \ncommittee in a room back behind this Chamber.\n  So we have come to this general agreement on, say, 90 percent of the \nbill; but the 10 percent we do not agree on has the potential for \nthreatening the health care of millions and millions and millions and \nmillions of people who get their health care through union-sponsored \nplans and employer-sponsored plans.\n  So, yes, we have come to all this agreement on 90 percent of it. It \nis this little 10 percent we have to address. We have to address it as \nwe are doing, up front, with debate. We need to hear from people around \nthe country. Is it real? Is it bad to allow employers to be sued? In a \nlittle bit I will refer to some of the people in Tennessee in relation \nto what they have told me about this risk of being sued, what it means \nto them, what it means to their employees.\n  Much of the debate on the Kennedy bill does come to this issue of \nopening the floodgates to a wave of frivolous lawsuits, lawsuits that \nare uncapped, subject to runaway costs, because that does translate, \nultimately, down to the 170 million people paying a lot more for their \nhealth care insurance. It translates to the working poor not being able \nto afford insurance and thus having to say: I just can't afford my \ninsurance anymore. I have to put food on the table. I have to put \nclothes on my children. I just can't afford putting money into \nfrivolous lawsuits and the pockets of trial lawyers. That does nothing, \nas the Senator from Texas said, to address the issue of getting the \ncare to people when they need it.\n  A lot of people do not realize that the average malpractice case is \nnot settled for 3 years. If you need care, you deserve that care. We \nhave to fix the system with patient protection, strong internal \nappeals, strong external appeals, and strong patient protections. That \nis what you do to fix the system to get the care when you need it; it \nis not to run to a courtroom and wait, on average, 3 years for a \nmalpractice case. If you take your child to the emergency room, or go \nfor a referral for appendicitis, or treatment of heart disease, 3 years \nlater means very little.\n  We talked a little bit about the lawyers. We rely on the legal system \nagain in terms of holding plans accountable. If there is a wrong or an \ninjury, we hold HMOs accountable. We hold them accountable.\n  For economic damages, that can be millions and millions of dollars. \nUnder the Frist-Breaux-Jeffords proposal, the trial lawyers can sue for \nmillions and millions of dollars of economic damages. We do not allow \nyou to sue for punitive damages. Suing for punitive damages does not \nfix the system. We say let's save the millions of dollars on punitive \ndamages. Let's invest in the system through internal and external \nappeals and strong patient protections. That is the way you fix the \nsystem. You do not want money that should be spent taking care of \npatients and delivering care put it into the courts and into the trial \nlawyers' pockets. This takes money out of the system, away from the \ndelivery of health care, and away from the doctor-patient relationship.\n  Nobody has unlimited money. This money is not just going to fall from \nthe sky. You are taking money out of the system through increased \npremiums paid from the pockets of the union workers and the employees \nenrolled in\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\nthese plans, and you put it into the pockets of the trial lawyers.\n  I mention all this because where are the trial lawyers going to go? \nYou can sue a doctor. You should, if there is malpractice. You should. \nIf there are economic damages and noneconomic damages, that is the \nright thing to do. If a hospital was involved in the injury, you should \nbe able to sue a hospital, if that hospital really did commit \nmalpractice. HMOs, you should be able to sue. You have to be able to \nhold them accountable if there is harm or injury.\n  What about an agent of the plan? The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill says \nyou can sue an agent of the plan, an agent of the HMO. Who is that?\n  It was interesting. I talked to doctors, to members of the AMA. I \nasked: How can you support a bill when you are for tort reform? The \nAmerican Medical Association for years has been in favor of tort \nreform, malpractice reform, modernizing the system. How can you support \na bill that has the opportunity for unlimited runaway lawsuits, \nmultiple causes of action, travel from State court to Federal court, \nback and forth forum shopping--how can you do that? And they say: \nbecause we can be sued. If we can be sued, we ought to be able to sue \neverybody.\n  I am not sure that is the correct answer. Several of my colleagues \nand I sent a letter to the medical profession asking, what if we reform \nthe overall system, have tort reform on the doctors as well as adequate \ntort reform and construction of a common ground between suing doctors \nas well as suing HMOs? We haven't heard back yet. Reform of the overall \nsystem is one way to address the issue.\n  The trial lawyer will go after the doctor, the hospital, the agent of \nthe plan, the plan, or the employer. He or she will go after whoever he \nor she can, if there is injury or harm.\n  It is interesting because for the last three years the bill that \nSenator Kennedy has been on and has proposed--or at least the first few \nmonths of this year--said that you can sue the plan or you can sue an \nagent of the plan. I think it was in last year's bill. The physicians \nhadn't caught that. Then they caught it a few days ago and said: You \nshouldn't be going after doctors. You should go after the HMO, the \nplan.\n  For the first time, in the rewrite of the bill submitted last \nThursday there is the exclusion that the Senator from Texas just \nexplained. You can sue the plan and you can sue an agent of the plan, \nbut you can't sue the treating doctor. That little loophole was closed.\n  Also in this new McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill from last Thursday, \nunlike the bill from last Wednesday and the one from months before, it \nappeared you can not sue the hospital. The trial lawyer must be sitting \nback: I could sue everybody before. Now I can't sue the doctor or the \nhospital. Now whom can I go after? The HMO, which is appropriate. I can \ngo after an agent of the HMO. Is that the clerk, is that the secretary \nwho called to arrange the plan? I am not sure. We have to look at that \nloophole. There is a huge loophole right now that the trial lawyer can \nexamine.\n\n  Where are the deep pockets? The HMO, appropriately so; the agent of \nthe plan, I am not sure. No, you cannot sue the doctors anymore. That \nwas rewritten and taken out of the bill introduced last Thursday. You \ncannot sue the hospital because that was taken out of the bill last \nThursday. You have the employer. In the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill the \ntrial lawyer, who has a financial incentive for personal gain--I am not \nquestioning the ethics of the trial lawyers, I am saying there is a \nfinancial incentive there--if there is an injury, is going to go after \nall the pockets of money out there. Potentially, the biggest pocket, in \nterms of assets, is the employer.\n  We just walked through the bill that says you can sue the employer. \nIf you are a trial lawyer worth your salt, you will say: OK, you have \ngone down the aisle and the sponsors of the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill \nchanged the bill, in a positive direction, and took the doctors and \nhospitals out. What they have not done is take out the employers. The \nGramm amendment does this in crystal-clear terms it takes out the \nemployers. It leaves the HMO.\n  The employers are out there voluntarily trying to do what is best for \ntheir employees. If you are running a business and you have a product \nand you are dependent upon your workforce, you want to pay them as well \nas you can. You want to give them all the benefits you can. And the \nbenefit that is most challenging today is health care, because of \nescalating costs across the board and because today people need health \ninsurance in order to access the system. Having this huge loophole \nwhere you can sue employers means that employers are going to drop that \nhealth care coverage. They are not going to be able to afford that \nexposure.\n  If you are sitting there with a small business of 25 employees and a \ngroup of 18 or 19 convenience stores, making margins of 2 or 3 percent, \nand you are not subjected to lawsuits today, and tomorrow you are going \nto be subjected to this unlimited liability when all you are doing is \ntrying to help your employees by paying for part of their premiums and \nvoluntarily giving them their health insurance, you will simply say: I \ncan't do it anymore. I will walk away.\n  What do those employees do? Well, they will probably say: Give me \nsome money, the money you are spending, and I will go out and try to \nfind a policy. They may not be able to find a policy. One hundred \nseventy million people are in union plans and in employer-sponsored \nplans today. As we uncover what is in this bill, they have to be asking \nthemselves: Can I afford to keep offering health insurance for my \nemployees? Unfortunately, the answer in many cases is going to be, no, \nI simply cannot.\n  I know this is the case because when I got home the other day from \none of the television shows my wife said: This sure is confusing to me. \nYou say you cannot sue employers. Your colleague, your good friend who \nfavors the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, says very specifically you \ncannot sue employers. It is confusing to everybody in this room.\n  I know it has to be confusing to the millions of people who are out \nthere. Whom do you believe? What does the bill really say? That is why \nI have so much respect for the Senator from Texas, because he really \ndoes go back and read every line of these bills. It is something that I \nboth admire and I try to do, and that is what it is going to take to \nreally settle this question of what is in the bill.\n  What does ``direct participation'' actually mean?--the words in the \nbill.\n  A number of people have gone out and looked at the very specific \nlanguage in the bill outside of this body. I would like to enter into \nthe Record shortly, but first let me quote from, a letter sent to the \nHonorable Tom Daschle, our majority leader, and to the Honorable Trent \nLott, minority leader, dated June 15, 2001. I will quote from the \nletter just what their interpretation is on this whole issue of \nemployers. A lot of points are made in the letter. I think in a very \nconcise way, these people, who represent millions of people, state \ntheir interpretation of this issue of being able to sue the employer.\n  Before I read it, let me tell you who these groups of people in the \nletter are.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this letter.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle and Senator Lott: With the Senate \n     poised to consider the Kennedy-McCain patients' bill of \n     rights, we are writing to express our serious concerns with \n     this dangerous and extreme legislation. This bill would allow \n     costly and unlimited lawsuits against employers, would add to \n     already skyrocketing health care costs, and would put at risk \n     the health insurance of millions of Americans. For these \n     reasons, we urge Congress to oppose this legislation and \n     avoid the dire consequences it would have on our employer-\n     based health care system.\n       Employers are not protected from liability under the \n     Kennedy-McCain bill, and lawsuits are allowed in both state \n     and federal courts for the same incident under different \n     causes of action. Further, the legislation's $5 million \n     dollar cap on punitive damages in federal court is really no \n     cap at all. Employers would still be subject to unlimited \n     liability in at least five other ways in state and federal \n     courts. Finally, lawsuits could be filed against employers \n     before an independent external review is completed. If faced \n     with such liability, many employers--especially small \n     employers--will have no choice but to stop offering coverage \n     altogether.\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\n       Employers today are already struggling to cope with \n     skyrocketing health care costs, especially in the midst of a \n     dramatically slowing economy. This year, costs are up an \n     average 13 percent--the seventh annual increase in a row. \n     Health care costs for many small employers are even higher, \n     up more than 20 percent. The Kennedy-McCain bill will make \n     health care coverage even more expensive. The Congressional \n     Budget Office found the bill would increase costs an \n     additional 4.2 percent. With many employers already being \n     forced to pass these rising costs on to their workers, even \n     more employees will be unable to afford coverage. Especially \n     vulnerable will be America's working poor, many of whom can \n     barely afford coverage now.\n       More than 172 million Americans rely on health care \n     coverage voluntarily offered to them by their employers, but \n     the unlimited liability and higher costs that would result \n     from the Kennedy-McCain patients' bill of rights would \n     undoubtedly put their coverage at risk. We firmly believe you \n     can't sue your way to better health care, and a recent poll \n     shows voters agree. Only 19 percent of those polled supported \n     the kind of unlimited liability found in the Kennedy-McCain \n     bill. In today's slowing economy, the last thing Congress \n     should do is consider legislation that would discourage \n     employers from offering health care coverage and make \n     coverage more difficult for workers to afford.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Federation of Independent Business.\n       National Association of Manufacturers.\n       U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n       National Retail Federation.\n       Printing Industries of America.\n       Rubber Manufacturers Association.\n       The ERISA Industry Committee.\n       National Employee Benefits Institute.\n       Food Marketing Institute.\n       Food Distributors International.\n       The Business Roundtable.\n       American Benefits Council.\n       National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.\n       National Restaurant Association.\n       Associated Builders and Contractors.\n       International Mass Retail Association.\n       National Association of Convenience Stores.\n       Society for Human Resource Management.\n       Associated General Contractors of America.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I thank the Chair.\n  The groups I will quote from have examined the legislation. It is in \ntheir interest to really read through the bill and not just the \nrhetoric. They include the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the National Retail Federation, the Printing Industries of \nAmerica, the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the National Employee \nBenefits Institute--the whole institute--the Food Marketing Institute, \nthe Food Distributors International, the American Benefits Council, the \nNational Association of Wholesalers Distributors, the National \nRestaurant Association, the Associated Builders and Contractors, the \nInternational Mass Retail Association, the National Association of \nConvenience Stores, the Society for Human Resource Management, the \nAssociated General Contractors of America. All of those associations \nand others are on here; but you get the message when you are talking \nabout hundreds of millions of people. They wrote, after looking at the \nspecifics of the legislation, the following:\n\n       Employers are not protected from liability--\n\n  As an aside, those six words are underlined in the letter by the \nauthors, referring to the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy Patients' Bill of \nRights in the first paragraph. They are talking about skyrocketing \nhealth costs.\n\n       Employers are not protected from liability under the \n     McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, and lawsuits are allowed in both \n     State and Federal courts for the same incident under \n     different causes of action. Employers would still be subject \n     to unlimited liability in at least five other ways in State \n     and Federal courts.\n\n  Finally, lawsuits could be filed against employers before an \nindependent external review is complete. If faced with such liability, \nmany employers, especially small employers, would have no choice but to \nstop offering coverage altogether.\n  That captures it. Again, this is not a Senator who has a vested \ninterest because he, with Senators Jeffords and Breaux, wrote a bill--\nit is not me or the Republicans or the Democrats. These are the \nassociations that represent scores of millions of people--I don't know \nexactly how many. You heard the list. That is their interpretation of \nwhat is written in this bill. This simple amendment put forth by \nSenator Gramm addresses the issue of whether or not you can sue your \nemployer in the most direct, clear-cut way, taking the exact language \nout of the Texas State law and putting it into Federal law, using the \nexact same words.\n  It is hard to say the other side of the aisle because Senator McCain \nis a Republican on their bill, and on our bill we have a Republican, a \nDemocrat and an Independent. But, for the most part, their bill is the \nDemocratic bill and our bill is supported and endorsed by the President \nof the United States and is consistent with his principles.\n  The President has said that he will veto the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy \nbill unless it is substantially altered. This is one of the areas I \nknow. I have some correspondence from the President and the opportunity \nto sue employers is one of the things that has to be changed in that \nbill. You just can't go out and sue employers in an indiscriminate way, \nas you can in their bill. From the other side of the aisle, they have \nsaid, ``First of all, we specifically protect employers from \nlawsuits.'' I think, clearly, we have just debunked that in the last \nhour and a half.\n  Another quote taken from one of the Sunday shows last week is:\n\n       The President, during his campaign, looked the American \n     people in the eye in the third debate and said, ``I will \n     fight for a Patients' Bill of Rights [referencing the Texas \n     bill]. Our bill is almost identical to Texas law.''\n\n  ``Our bill,'' meaning the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, ``is almost \nidentical to Texas law,'' they said. We need to settle that. I have not \naddressed it, but some of my colleagues have addressed it. That is \nabsolutely not true. The Kennedy bill is not similar to, not identical \nto, not even consistent with Texas law, period. So when we hear it \nrhetorically, it sounds good because they are trying to jab the \nPresident a little, saying, why do we not federalize the Texas law and \nmake it the law of the land; that is what our bill does and therefore \nthe President has to come on board or there is incongruity to the \nargument. Well, it is incongruous because the assumption that McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy is consistent with Texas law is totally false. The \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill is inconsistent with Texas law.\n\n  How? Right here. Right here is where you can start. Texas law \nexplicitly does not create any liability on the part of an employer, \nand there are no exceptions. That is the No. 1 difference. S. 1052, the \nMcCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill, explicitly authorizes lawsuits against \nemployers. Again, Senator Gramm from Texas went through the bill line \nby line.\n  The second difference is that the Texas law caps damages in State \nlawsuits. S. 1052 does not. Texas law does not authorize lawsuits for \nnonmedically reviewable coverage decisions. The Kennedy bill does. That \nis the third difference. Let me explain that, because it will help with \nthe understanding of the overall bill.\n  The sort of decisions that you can sue for can be broken down into \ntwo categories. One is treatment decisions and the other is coverage \ndecisions. The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill applies to both treatment \ndecisions as well as coverage decisions. Texas law has a much narrower \nscope. Texas law applies only to treatment decisions and does not apply \nto coverage decisions.\n  Again, when people say there are so few lawsuits at the end of the \nappeals process in Texas and our bill is like the Texas bill, \ntherefore, we are not going to see lawsuits, go back to the basic \nassumption. The other side of the aisle is basically saying we are \ngoing to be like Texas, you are not going to see any lawsuits. They are \nnot like Texas. No. 1, Employers can be sued. No. 2, they have caps in \nTexas. No. 3, this whole issue of Texas scope is much narrower than the \nscope in the Kennedy bill.\n  The McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill involves treatment decisions. What \nare they? They are quality-of-care issues, malpractice, holding a plan \naccountable in a vicarious liability way. Those treatment decisions \nTexas applies to also. What Texas does not include that the Kennedy \nbill does are the coverage decisions. If you listen to the debate on \nthe floor, that has been what most of the debate has been all about. If \nyou are an individual, the question is, Did your plan cover your \ncardiac catheterization? If they say they did not and you were hurt \nbecause you did not get a catheterization so you could be treated, you \ncould go through an internal\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\nand external appeals process and sue. All that decisionmaking is \naddressed in the McCain-Edwards-Kennedy bill--and inadequately, I might \nsay. It is addressed in our bill, I believe, in a much more responsible \nway.\n  The point is that Texas does not involve any coverage decisions. That \nis way beyond the scope. So when people say there are so few lawsuits \nin Texas, therefore, we will make Texas law Federal law and we are not \ngoing to see the lawsuits, that may or may not be true. But the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill does not make Texas law the law of the land \nbecause of the employers' lawsuits and the caps.\n  What has the President of the United States said? We have been \nthrough some of the statements. Again, I think it is important to see \nhow other people are viewing the underlying legislation, other than \njust Senators coming to the floor engaging in debate. I went through \nand circled several of the areas where employers are mentioned in the \nStatement of Administration Policy, issued June 21, 2001, a statement \nthat came from the Executive Office of the President. Again, it is \npertinent to the underlying amendment. First of all, in a paragraph on \npage 2 it says:\n\n       The President will veto the bill unless significant changes \n     are made to address his major concerns.\n\n  Then under that, where he mentions employers, it says:\n\n       S. 1052 jeopardizes health care coverage for workers and \n     their families by failing to avoid costly litigation. S. 1052 \n     overturns more than 25 years of Federal law that provides \n     uniformity and certainty for employers who voluntarily offer \n     health care benefits for millions of Americans across the \n     country. The liability provisions of S. 1052 would, for the \n     first time, expose employers and unions to at least 50 \n     different inconsistent State law standards.\n\n  Further down in this Statement of Administration Policy it says:\n\n       S. 1052 also would allow causes of action in Federal court \n     for a violation of any duty under the plan, creating open-\n     ended and unpredictable lawsuits against employers for \n     administrative errors.\n\n  A little bit later in this statement from the administration it says:\n\n       Moreover, S. 1052 would subject employers and unions to \n     frequent litigation in State and Federal court under a vague \n     ``direct participation'' standard, which would require \n     employers and unions to defend themselves in court in \n     virtually every case against allegations that they ``directly \n     participated'' in a denial of benefits decision.\n\n  These statements are from the administration and the attorneys who \nhave advised them.\n  What about people back home? Again, a number of people have recited \nremarks from people across the country. I will quote from a couple of \nletters from Tennessee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that three letters from which I will read be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Billy Rogers Plgb, Htg, & A/C, Inc.,\n\n                               Dyersburg, Tennessee, June 7, 2001.\n\n     Senator Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: I am writing you in regards to the \n     proposed Patients' Bill of Rights being proposed by Senator \n     Kennedy. I am very much opposed to S. 283.\n       Our Company provides Health Coverage to all of our \n     employees that wish or can afford to enroll. We presently \n     have (6) families enrolled and (3) individuals at an \n     astronomical annual cost of $55,000.00.\n       Our Company pays approximately 80% of the total cost of the \n     annual premiums. Our Company, this year, experienced an \n     increase of approximately 35% in which was totally absorbed \n     by the Company. If we are confronted with an increase of this \n     magnitude in the upcoming new year, I strongly believe that \n     our Company will have to pass on tremendous increases to our \n     employees or even drop our program altogether. Please do what \n     ever is necessary to see that this Bill does not pass.\n           Sincerely,\n\n     Billy G. Rogers, Jr. (VP)\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Dillard Door & Specialty Co., Inc.,\n\n                                        Memphis, TN, June 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As the president of a small business \n     with 17 employees, I am concerned over the cost of our \n     company's medical insurance. Under our medical plan, we pay \n     the premiums for our employees, and they pay for their \n     dependents. Our carrier increased the charges over 15% this \n     year, and did approximately the same last year. Our company \n     absorbed these additional costs, but we did raise our \n     deductibles (if we hadn't, the increase would have been much \n     greater). Should premiums continue to increase in such a \n     manner, we will be forced to discontinue or drastically alter \n     our plan. Being such a small company, we are at a \n     disadvantage when it comes to rates, and current laws do not \n     allow us to seek coverage through any of the associations to \n     which we belong.\n       We also are concerned over any aspects of a future \n     Patients' Bill of Rights that would allow employees to sue \n     our company for alleged deficiencies in coverage. If such \n     suits were allowed, we would most certainly discontinue \n     coverage for our employees, as I'm sure almost all small \n     business owners would. What would probably happen is that we \n     would raise our employees' salaries enough to cover their \n     medical coverage at our current rate, and they would purchase \n     coverage personally (if they could). Such wage increases \n     would, of course, be taxable, so they would have even less to \n     pay for a plan.\n       The situation is already a most serious one, and if any \n     more burdens are placed on the backs of small businesses for \n     medical costs than currently exist, I believe the rolls of \n     the non-insured will swell beyond belief. Your efforts in \n     doing anything to not only improve the situation, but also to \n     prevent any future changes that would have a burdensome \n     effect would be greatly appreciated.\n           Sincerely yours,\n\n                                         John W. Dillard, Jr.,\n\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        Herndon & Merry, Inc.,\n\n                                      Nashville, TN, June 7, 2001.\n     Senator Bill Frist,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: My letter today is to share with you my \n     concerns about the potential of a ``Patients' Bill of \n     Rights'' coming out of a newly Democratic controlled senate.\n       Our company has been in business for 42 years and over that \n     time we have been able to provide, at differing levels, \n     health care coverage to our employees. This experience gives \n     me some footing to address this issue. We currently have 22 \n     employees and most of these participate in our insurance \n     program of which the corporation pays 85%. In past years we \n     paid 100% of the premium and paid for family coverage. \n     However, due to cost increases that in some years were 30 to \n     40% we were unable to continue to either absorb this cost or \n     to pass it on in price increases to our customers. So, we \n     scaled back coverage and required employees to pay a portion \n     of the premium. The real question is why such dramatic \n     increase in the first place? I think the answer is painfully \n     clear-government meddling. The more government meddles in the \n     free market, no matter what kind of market, the greater the \n     cost. Just ask Californians what government price controls \n     have done for the availability and the REAL cost of power. \n     While all of the increase in the cost of health care cannot \n     be laid at the feet of both state and federal mandates, it is \n     surely at the root of those increases. The proof lies in how \n     both the federal government and the state of Tennessee exempt \n     themselves from most of the mandates because they know how \n     expensive they really are.\n       I urge you to fight to the last man against S. 283. If my \n     employees will have the right to sue me because I am paying a \n     portion of their health care then you can be assured they \n     will no longer receive this benefit from my company. They \n     will be left out in the cold. But I fear that that is exactly \n     what Senator Kennedy and those on the left would like. Then \n     they can reintroduce Hilliary care and come to the ``rescue''\n           Your Friend,\n\n                                               Bill Merry, Jr.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. The first one is from Billy Rogers. He is in Dyersburg, \nTN. He is a small businessperson:\n\n       Dear Senator Frist: Our Company provides Health Coverage to \n     all our employees that wish or can afford to enroll. . . .\n       Our Company pays approximately 80 percent of the total cost \n     of the annual premiums. . . .\n       I strongly believe that our Company will have to pass on \n     tremendous increases to our employees or even drop our \n     program altogether. Please do whatever is necessary to see \n     that this Bill does not pass.\n\n  The second letter is from John Dillard, who is president of Dillard \nDoor, a door speciality company in Memphis, TN:\n\n       Dear Senator Frist: We also are concerned over any aspects \n     of a future Patients' Bill of Rights that would allow \n     employees to sue our company for alleged deficiencies in \n     coverage. If such suits were allowed, we would most certainly \n     discontinue coverage for our employees, as I'm sure almost \n     all small business owners would. What would probably happen \n     is that we would raise our employees' salaries enough to \n     cover the medical coverage at our current rate, and they \n     would purchase coverage personally (if they could). Such wage \n     increases would, of course, be taxable, so they would have \n     even less to pay for a plan.\n\n  The last letter I entered into the Record is from Herndon & Merry, \nInc., in Nashville, TN. The last paragraph says:\n\n       I urge you to fight to the last man against S. 283.\n\n  Which is the predecessor Kennedy bill.\n\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\n\n       If my employees will have the right to sue me because I am \n     paying a portion of their health care, then you can be \n     assured they will no longer receive this benefit from my \n     company. They will be left out in the cold. But I fear this \n     is exactly what Senator Kennedy and those on the left would \n     like. Then they can reintroduce Hillary care and come to the \n     ``rescue.''\n       Your friend, Bill Merry.\n\n  I wanted to give some perspective from outside the Senate and the \nWhite House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a four-page letter that was just sent \ntoday from Margaret LaMontagne be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                        Washington, June 22, 2001.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Thank you for your inquiry regarding the \n     Texas Patients' Bill of Rights. Numerous questions have been \n     raised about the substance of that legislation. I am happy \n     for the opportunity to clear up any confusion. As you may \n     know, I was a policy advisor to then Governor Bush during his \n     tenure as Governor and currently serve as Assistant to the \n     President for Domestic Policy. I would be delighted to \n     provide any additional information that would be helpful to \n     Congress during this important debate.\n     History of Texas Patients' Bill of Rights\n       As Governor, President Bush signed five patient protection \n     bills and allowed a sixth to become law without his \n     signature. Throughout the legislative debate, he strongly \n     supported efforts to provide patients with comprehensive \n     patient protections and access to a strong independent review \n     procedure. Governor Bush focused on the goal of providing \n     quality care to patients by ensuring timely and independent \n     medical review of HMO decisions. He stressed that legislation \n     should focus on protecting patients, not trial lawyers. And \n     he emphasized that, while patients should be able to hold \n     HMOs liable in court, liability provisions should be drawn \n     narrowly to ensure that they do not cause large increases in \n     premiums or raise the number of uninsured.\n       When, in 1995, the Texas Legislature sent Governor Bush a \n     Patients' Bill of Rights that created loopholes and exempted \n     a major HMO from its provisions, Governor Bush vetoed the \n     legislation, stating that he would not sign a bill that \n     favored special interests over patients. He then worked with \n     the Texas Commissioner of Insurance to draft strong patient \n     protection regulations that formed the model for the bills he \n     signed into law the next biennial legislative session.\n       The Patients' Bill of Rights Governor Bush signed in Texas \n     in 1997 has been widely regarded as among the strongest in \n     the country. Patients in Texas now have comprehensive patient \n     protections, and Texas independent review organizations have \n     considered claims by roughly 1400 patients, approximately \n     half of which have resulted in partial or complete reversals \n     of the health plan's decision. Perhaps because of the success \n     of the Texas legislation, some of the Congressional sponsors \n     of legislation have insisted that their bills most closely \n     resemble, and give the greatest deference to, the Texas \n     Patients' Bill of Rights. In particular, some supporters of \n     the bill offered by Senators McCain, Kennedy and Edwards have \n     argued that their bill, S. 1052, would adopt, roughly, Texas \n     law. We strongly disagree.\n       S. 1052 departs fundamentally from the model adopted in \n     Texas. S. 1052 would threaten to preempt the strong patient \n     protections adopted in states like Texas, would allow causes \n     of action in state and federal court much broader than those \n     authorized in Texas, and would threaten to upset the careful \n     safeguards imposed by the Texas legislature regarding \n     employer protections and caps on liability.\n     Preempting Texas Patient Protections\n       The bill sponsored by Senators McCain, Kennedy and Edwards, \n     far from protecting good state laws like those in Texas, \n     threatens to override them by imposing a preemption standard \n     that gives virtually no deference to states. The bill does \n     not allow states to apply their own strong patient \n     protections even when the protections they offer are \n     consistent with federal law. Rather, S. 1052 would require \n     that each state requirement be ``at least substantially \n     equivalent to and as effective as'' each federal requirement, \n     without requiring the Department of Health and Human Services \n     to give deference to the need for flexibility or the state's \n     determination that its standards best protect its citizens. \n     We believe that this provision in S. 1052 would give the \n     federal government too much latitude to override state law \n     and undo the good work of states like Texas.\n     Cause of Action\n       Another key difference between Texas law and S. 1052 \n     relates to the breadth of the cause of action. The \n     legislation enacted in Texas created a narrow cause of action \n     against HMOs for any wrongful ``health care treatment \n     decision,'' defined by the Texas legislature as ``a \n     determination made when medical services are actually \n     provided by the health care plan and a decision which affects \n     the quality of the diagnosis, care, or treatment provided to \n     the plan's insureds or enrollees.'' Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. \n     Code Sec. 88.001. This language has been interpreted to apply \n     only to claims alleging wrongful delivery of medical care, as \n     opposed to decisions by an HMO regarding benefit \n     determinations. As the United States Court of Appeals for the \n     Fifth Circuit stated last year, the Texas liability \n     provisions: ``impose liability for a limited universe of \n     events. The provisions do not encompass claims based on a \n     managed care entity's denial of coverage for a medical \n     service recommended by the treating physician: that dispute \n     is one over coverage, specifically excluded by the Act. \n     Rather, the Act would allow suit for claims that a treating \n     physician was negligent in delivering medical services, and \n     it imposes vicarious liability on managed care entities for \n     that negligence.'' Corporate Health Inc., Inc. v. Tex. Dept. \n     of Ins., 215 F.3d 526, 534 (5th Cir. 2000).\n       Unlike the narrow cause of action provided in Texas, S. \n     1052 allows expansive causes of action in both state and \n     federal court. Under S. 1052, state courts would consider \n     sweeping lawsuits related to denials of claims for benefits, \n     while federal courts would hear cases related to violations \n     of administrative duties under the plan. Neither cause of \n     action is currently available in Texas state court. And, as \n     drafted, both are excessively broad and would invite frequent \n     and costly litigation.\n     Employer Protections\n       Another fundamental difference between Texas law and S. \n     1052 relates to the treatment of employers. When the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights was debated in Texas, the \n     legislature acted decisively to protect employers--and their \n     employees--from costly litigation by prohibiting lawsuits \n     against employers. The Texas statute clearly states: ``This \n     chapter does not create any liability on the part of an \n     employer.'' Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Sec. 88.002(e). This \n     protection was considered essential, by the Texas legislature \n     and by Governor Bush, to ensuring that the new liability \n     provisions did not create an incentive for employers to drop \n     health coverage altogether.\n       Conversely, S. 1052 invites frequent litigation against \n     employers by subjecting them to liability under a vague \n     ``direct participation'' standard. Under this standard, \n     employers can be held liable for ``the actual making of [a] \n     decision or the actual exercise of control in making [a] \n     decision.'' Because the question whether an employer \n     ``exercised control'' in a decision is inherently fact-based, \n     employers will be forced to defend at trial in virtually \n     every case alleging a wrongful denial decision. Moreover, the \n     interpretation of ``direct participation'' will differ in the \n     various state courts, forcing employers to comply with \n     different standards throughout the country.\n       This treatment of employers is a radical departure from the \n     approach adopted in Texas and will create incentives for \n     employers to drop employee health coverage entirely, further \n     increasing the number of uninsured.\n     Additional Protections\n       Texas adopted numerous other protections to ensure that \n     lawsuits benefit patients and not trial lawyers. For example, \n     as Governor, President Bush signed legislation that limits \n     punitive damages to the greater of $200,000 or two times \n     economic damages plus non-economic damages of no more than \n     $750,000. Tex. Civ Prac. and Remedies 41,007. S. 1052, \n     conversely, allows for unlimited non-economic and punitive \n     damages in state courts, imposes no limitation on non-\n     economic damages in federal court, and limits punitive \n     damages in federal court to the excessively high figure of $5 \n     million. Further, it is not clear that the new state causes \n     of action under S. 1052, which will no doubt include \n     physicians in many cases, would be subject to the various \n     state medical malpractice caps.\n       Finally, Texas law discourages patients from bringing \n     frivolous claims by requiring that when a patient files suit \n     he must submit either a written report by a medical expert \n     that supports his case or must file a bond. Tex. Civ. Prac. & \n     Rem. Code Sec. 88.002. S. 1052 has no procedural requirements \n     to ensure that patients bring only medically meritorious \n     claims to court. Indeed, that legislation would allow a \n     patient to bring suit even if a panel of independent medical \n     experts concludes that his claim is meritless.\n     Summary\n       Supporters of S. 1052 have made much of the fact that few \n     lawsuits have been filed under the Texas Patients' Bill of \n     Rights. We believe that this fact is attributable to the \n     emphasis in Texas on quality of care and strong independent \n     review, the careful drafting of the Texas liability \n     provisions, the protections provided to employers, the \n     exhaustion requirement, and the imposition of caps and other \n     limitations to discourage frivolous suits. We strongly \n     believe that the success in Texas will not be mirrored on the \n     federal level unless substantial changes are made to the \n     liability provisions of S. 1052.\n       We urge Congress to send a strong and effective Patients' \n     Bill of Rights--one that meets the President's principles--to \n     the President's desk.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Margaret LaMontagne,\n\n                                        Assistant to the President\n                                              for Domestic Policy.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. This is a letter that I hope will be distributed and read, \nbut I will read what this letter says about employer protections. It is \ntalking\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\nabout the difference between the Texas law and the proposal by Senator \nKennedy before us.\n  Under employer protections:\n\n       Another fundamental difference between Texas law and S. \n     1052 relates to the treatment of employers. When the \n     Patients' Bill of Rights was debated in Texas, the \n     legislature acted decisively to protect employers--and their \n     employees--from costly litigation by prohibiting lawsuits \n     against employers. . . .\n       Conversely, S. 1052 invites frequent litigation against \n     employers by subjecting them to liability under a vague \n     ``direct participation'' standard. Under this standard, \n     employers can be held liable for ``the actual making of [a] \n     decision or the actual exercise of control in making [a] \n     decision.'' Because the question whether an employer \n     ``exercised control'' in a decision is inherently fact-based, \n     employers will be forced to defend at trial in virtually \n     every case alleging a wrongful denial decision. Moreover, the \n     interpretation of ``direct participation'' will differ in the \n     various state courts, forcing employers to comply with \n     different standards throughout the country.\n       This treatment of employers is a radical departure from the \n     approach adopted in Texas and will create incentives for \n     employers to drop employee health coverage entirely, further \n     increasing the number of uninsured.\n\n  Again, people can read this letter from Margaret LaMontagne in the \nRecord. She was policy adviser to then-Governor Bush during his tenure \nas Governor and currently serves as Assistant to the President for \nDomestic Policy. She clearly was involved in the formulation of the \nTexas legislation and has had the opportunity to examine the \nlegislation introduced by Senator Kennedy.\n  I close by saying I am delighted to support the amendment as proposed \nby the Senator from Texas. It makes it crystal clear that you cannot \nsue employers, and it will eliminate this potentially huge source of \nfunding for litigators. But, it will do absolutely nothing for patients \nto get the care they need in a timely way, in a way of high quality, \nand in a way that can be respected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Murkowski). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been closely listening to the \ndebate this morning. I presided over the Senate for an hour this \nmorning and was listening for that time to the debate with respect to \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. It reminded me of a story about the great \ndebates between Lincoln and Douglas. I have mentioned this story on a \nprevious occasion.\n  Apparently during those debates, Lincoln and Douglas were having \ndifficulty understanding each other's point. Lincoln finally said to \nDouglas: Well, tell me, how many legs does a cow have?\n  Douglas said: Why, four, of course.\n  Lincoln said: Well, now, if you call a tail a leg, how many legs \nwould a cow have?\n  Douglas said: Five.\n  Lincoln said: No, that is where you are wrong. Just because you call \na tail a leg doesn't make it a leg.\n  What I have seen today is interesting. They have taken a tail, called \nit a leg, and spent 4 hours describing this new leg. There is nothing \nin the Patients' Bill of Rights or the Patient Protection Act that is \ndesigned to subject employers to lawsuits or to liability. In fact, \nthis act, as described, specifically protects employers from the kind \nof suits that have been described for the last 4 hours.\n  It is, I suppose, a classic response to something you do not like to \ntry to change the subject, and that is what this amendment is all \nabout, changing the subject.\n  The central feature of the patient protection legislation is very \nsimple. This legislation is about empowering patients who are \nconfronted with a challenge too often in this country. That challenge \nis of large managed care organizations that in too many cases will not \nprovide the treatment patients expect to have covered under their \nhealth plan. Under this act managed care organizations would be \nrequired to provide that treatment.\n  We believe a patient has a right to know all of their medical options \nfor treatment, not just the cheapest option. We believe a patient has \nthat right.\n  We believe a patient has the right to go to an emergency room and get \nemergency treatment if they have an emergency. Do you think every \npatient has that opportunity now? The answer is no. We believe a \npatient ought to have the right to see a specialist when they need to. \nThat is not a right that exists today.\n  Yes, we believe a patient ought to be able to hold their HMO or \nmanaged care plan accountable. Does that mean being able to sue? We are \nnot interested in lawsuits. We are interested in accountability.\n  If an HMO decides it is not going to provide the treatment that is \nnecessary, then should someone be able to hold them accountable and \ntake them to court? The answer is, you bet. I have spoken about \nChristopher Roe on a couple of occasions. Let me do it again because it \nis important in the context of the patient rights we talk about. \nChristopher died on his 16th birthday. He fought cancer and had to \nfight his managed care organization at the same time. That is not a \nfair fight. This young boy, according to his mother who testified at a \nhearing I chaired, waged a courageous fight against cancer but didn't \nget the care he needed or the treatment he needed to give him a shot at \nbeating his cancer. He looked up from his bed and asked his mother: \n``Mom, how can they do this to a kid?'' He died on his 16th birthday.\n  It shouldn't happen. It need not happen. All too often in this \ncountry, for-profit managed care organizations have viewed a patient's \ncare through the lens of how that care will affect their profit and \nloss. Is this something we are willing to stand for? No. We believe it \nis important to put into law a set of patient protections or patient \nrights to change that.\n  It is interesting to listen to discussions about Dicky Flatt. It is \ninteresting to hear letters from people who say if employees are \nallowed to sue employers, they will no longer have health care. The \nfact is, this legislation will not allow employees to sue employers. It \nis a classic opportunity to divert attention. That is what is happening \nwith the current amendment on the Floor, offered by Senator Gramm. \nThere are people who have never wanted a Patient's Bill of Rights \nenacted. When it comes time to answer the question of who they stand \nwith, these people stand with the insurance companies and managed care \norganizations. They do not stand with nurses and doctors, all of whom \nsupport this legislation. They say they stand on the other side because \nthey don't like this legislation.\n  That is fine. That is all right. Everyone has a right to oppose this \nlegislation. But there is not an inherent right to misrepresent what \nthis legislation does. And this legislation does not allow wholesale \nopportunity for people to sue their employers who offer health \ninsurance to their employees. That is not what this legislation is \nabout. This legislation contains specific protections against that very \nthing.\n  My hope is we will find substantial common ground in the coming week \nor so and be able to pass a Patient's Bill of Rights by a week from \ntoday. This bipartisan legislation has been 4 years in the making. I \nfind it interesting to hear people say this has not been the subject of \nhearings. My Lord, we have had this piece of legislation or legislation \nlike it on the floor of the Senate time after time after time. It has \nbeen around for 4 years. If one cannot read that fast, one can employ \nsomeone else to read that fast. This is not new legislation. The only \nproblem is we have people who dig their heels in and do not want to \ndeal with it.\n  That is a classic response that has come to all changes that have \nmade this a better and better country. Every single thing we have done \nto advance interests in this country has been opposed by those who do \nnot want to do something for the first time. I understand that.\n  There is the story of the old codger, 85, 90 years old, interviewed \nby the radio station announcer, who said: You must have seen a lot of \nchanges.\n  He said: Yep, and I've been against every one of them.\n  We have people like that who serve in public life, too. That is just \nfine, except this change is necessary. This change is important. This \nchange empowers patients and does not injure employers. It contains \nprotections to make sure employers are not going to be subject to \nlawsuits.\n  We will have more discussion about the protections for employers in \nthe\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\ncoming days, especially next week. I hope we can keep our eye on the \nball and pass a patient protection act that offers protections that I \nthink are needed and should be offered in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, for offering this amendment, as well as Senator Thompson. I \ncompliment Senator Frist for his comments and work and leadership on \nthis bill in general, as well as Senator Gregg. People are becoming \nmore familiar with the bill before the Senate, S. 1052, the McCain-\nEdwards-Kennedy bill.\n  I have heard sponsors of the bill say employers cannot be sued under \nthis bill. I believe that is a direct quote. That is not factually \ncorrect. Under this bill, on page 144, is language that deals with \nthis. It says:\n\n       (A) Causes Of Action Against Employers And Plan Sponsors \n     Precluded.\n\n  That sounds really good. But that is paragraph (A).\n  Paragraph (B) on page 145 says:\n\n       Certain Causes Of Action Permitted.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (A), a cause of action may arise against an \n     employer or other plan sponsor.\n\n  (A) says you cannot sue an employer and (B) says notwithstanding (A) \nyou can sue an employer.\n  It goes on for several pages, whether an employer had direct \nparticipation or not. But as an employer, if you have to comply with \nERISA, you do a lot of things other than the exemptions provided in the \nlegislation. In other words, under this bill, you can be sued.\n  Some say that is not true, that is not what we meant. If it is there, \nwe will fix it.\n  We have a chance to fix it and we can adopt this language. This is \nlanguage that says employers shall not be held liable under this law. \nWe ought to pass it.\n  Some have said liability is not such a problem because Texas has not \nhad many claims--other States have not had many claims.\n  We are looking at the Texas law which says employers shall not be \nliable. If we are going to say it on the floor, if we say employers are \nnot going to be hit, let's protect them. We protected doctors in this \nbill, we protected hospitals in this bill. That was a change made last \nThursday night. This bill has evolved and changed significantly from \nthe bill we were considering. The original bill was Senate bill 872 and \ndid not have that fix. We fixed it for doctors and some hospitals. Now \nwe have a new bill S. 1052 and it did not fix it for employers.\n  As a matter of fact, employers get more than ``fixed'' in this bill. \nEmployers, beware. If we don't pass this amendment or something close \nto it, employers, beware. The majority leader says to pass it next \nweek. I would love to conclude this debate by next week. But if you \nmake all employers liable for unlimited damages, there are a lot of \nemployers that would rather have Members stay and debate a bill than \npass a bill that says we are sorry you provide health care for your \nemployees. You don't have to provide your employees with healthcare, \nbut for doing that good service for your employees, you can be sued for \neverything you have, maybe for everything you ever will have. There is \nno limit on damages.\n  Somebody said under McCain-Kennedy there is a $5 million cap on \npunitive damages. There should not be punitive damages in this bill in \nthe first place. I thought the purpose of this bill was to protect \npatients, not to enrich attorneys. Why are punitive damages in if you \nare trying to protect patients? They don't belong. That $5 million cap \non punitive damages is a cap in Federal court, not in State court.\n  There is no cap on noneconomic damages. What are those? That is pain \nand suffering. You get in front of a sympathetic jury, get a good trial \nlawyer--if you have a great big company, why not just sue for the \nworld? If you are going to sue for a million dollars, why not make it \n$100 million, or make it hundreds of millions of dollars? If you do a \nreal job on the jury, you might win. It is a little bit of a lottery. \nYou might win the golden jackpot. You might win several hundred \nmillions of dollars. We have seen cases recently from some juries that \nare in the billions of dollars.\n  Now we are flirting with the survival of big companies. I am not so \nworried about the big companies, but I am worried about a lot of small \ncompanies that are struggling to survive who are providing health care \nfor their employees because they want to--not, frankly, because it is \nappreciated. I will tell you as a former employer that most employers \npay a lot more for health care than their employees realize. Even \nthough you might tell them every once in a while, they don't appreciate \nthe money being spent. If you gave employees the option, they would \nprobably rather have the cash and risk not buying health insurance so \nthey could have more disposable income. Those are just the facts. That \nis the case in many areas.\n  Why not just do that? If we pass the McCain-Kennedy bill that is what \na lot of employers will do. They will say, I don't have to provide this \nbenefit. It is not appreciated as much as it probably should be. And \nnow, now not only do I have to pay thousands of dollars per year to \nprovide health care, but I can be sued for everything. Maybe this \ncompany has been going for 40, 50, or 60 years. It may be a bank. It \nmay be a manufacturing company. A good attorney will say: Wow, no limit \non pain and suffering. We had a problem. I know you didn't really have \nanything to do with it. But you hired this big insurance company, and \nthey hired their doctor. That doctor wasn't very competent. Something \nbad happened. Somebody died. Therefore, we are going to sue you for \nwhat you have because you hired the company that hired the doctor. You \nare liable. You are involved. You had a direct participation. \nTherefore, you are liable.\n  All of a sudden, you are going to go bankrupt. Not only do you lose \nhealth care and your health care costs go up, but you may lose your \ncompany. The employees may lose their jobs.\n  That could easily happen under this bill.\n  Again, I know, I have heard the sponsors of this legislation say, oh, \nno; that is not our intention. We are not going after employers. We are \ngoing after those big bad HMOs.\n  If we are not going after employers, let's exempt them. We have \nexempted physicians and hospitals. Let's exempt employers. That is what \nTexas did. That probably enabled them to pass their bill. Let's exempt \nemployers under this bill. That is one clear-cut way of not trying to \ndefine if they participated in the decision.\n  I challenge anyone. Start reading through the definition of direct \nparticipation. Then tell me if an employer in carrying out their \nfiduciary duties in providing health care for their employees--\nincluding plan determinations, reporting, enrolling people, choosing \nplans, maybe an optional plan, and so on--tell me they do not do more \nthan what the exemptions are here. They are not complying with the law.\n  This list is written basically saying, employers, you are covered. \nYou can be sued. You can be held liable.\n  It says Patients' Bill of Rights. It should say beware, employers. We \nare getting ready to come after you. Trial lawyers are looking out for \nthemselves--not for patients. If you want to look out for patients, we \ncould pass a bill tomorrow that will give every patient in America--\nexternal and internal review--a place where they can get a benefit \ndetermination. If they were denied, it could be overturned. At least, \nit could be reviewed by medical doctors--an independent panel. That \ncould be binding. We can do that. We can pass that overnight. They \nwould have new, needed additional protections.\n\n  No; we want to go a lot further than that. We want to be able to take \nnot only the HMOs but also take employers to court and be able to sue \nthem for everything they have with no limit, and no caps. As a matter \nof fact, we want to be able to choose under this bill between Federal \ncourt and State court, whichever is best, with no caps. We might be \nable to do pretty well.\n  I urge people and employers, if you are concerned about this bill, \nplease contact Members of the Senate because we will be voting on this \namendment sometime Tuesday. There is a chance that we can fix employer \nliability once and for all--very clean, no exemptions, no exceptions.\n  There is one other comment I wanted to make. I heard our colleague, \nthe junior Senator from Missouri, say,\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\nwell, Missouri passed a good patients' bill of rights. She was very \nproud of that. I compliment Missouri. I don't know what is in \nMissouri's law. But I compliment the State of Missouri for passing a \ngood patients' bill of rights.\n  I do not know if Senators are aware, but in the bill that we are \npassing, the patient protections are going to supersede whatever the \nState of Missouri did--as a matter of fact, whatever any State has \ndone. There are over 1,100 patient protections that different States \nhave passed. No matter what your State has done, we are getting ready \nto pass a bill which says that may not be good enough because if the \nState of Missouri or Oklahoma or Alaska didn't pass patient protection \nthat is substantially equivalent and as effective as we have proposed \nunder this bill, then you are in trouble. It doesn't qualify. It is not \ngood enough. It is going to be replaced with this.\n  As a matter of fact, you almost have to have identical language in \nthis bill for the State protections to apply.\n  Another way of saying it is the State has to adopt what we are \npassing. You might say that is fine. I am sure we are passing good \nprotections here. Maybe we are. Maybe they are better. Maybe they are \nnot.\n  Who will be determining if these protections are better, or if the \nState protections are better than these? The Government is. Somebody \nelected? No. It would be a bureaucrat over at the offices of the Health \nCare Finance Administration, HCFA. They will determine whether or not \nState law which was probably negotiated with the State legislature and \nwith the Governor, or maybe the State insurance commissioner, possibly \nwith a lot of input from the participants, beneficiaries, plans, \npossibly with years of experience--hey, in this plan, does this benefit \nwork? Is this excessive in cost? Is it overutilized or underutilized? \nThey have experience. They determine if they can afford this patient \nprotection or they can't. They made modifications. We say we don't care \nwhat your case history is, or what your State history is. We are going \nto replace your patient protections with one that Senator Kennedy, \nSenator McCain, and Senator Edwards have decided is in your best \ninterests.\n  I negotiated with Senator Kennedy on patient protections last year. \nBut I refused to go along with saying that what we have done is better \nthan what the States have done. I don't think that these protections \nshould supersede what the States have done.\n\n  That is what we are doing in this bill. This language says you have \nto have substantially equivalent patient protections that are at least \nas effective as what we have. Nobody knows how effective these are. \nThese are not law. They have never been tried. They have never been \ntested. They have never been analyzed. They have never been in the real \nmarket. No one really has any idea about how much they really cost.\n  We are saying to the State, whatever you have, it has to be as \neffective as these, even though we don't know if these are effective or \nnot.\n  Talk about a bad example of government knows best, that is exactly \nwhat we are doing in this bill. We will have an amendment that \naddresses that in the course of the debate next week.\n  One other comment I want to make deals with the issue of coverage. I \nhave kind of alluded to it. This bill says it covers all Americans. I \nhave heard several people say that. But if they say that this bill \ncovers all Americans, I assume they are not very knowledgeable about \nthe bill. This bill doesn't cover all Americans. We had a conference \nthis morning. One of my colleagues hit his head. I said: Be careful. \nYou can't sue. You can't sue the Federal Government.\n  We are getting ready to mandate on the private sector rights and \nprivileges that we don't have as Senators or as Federal employees.\n  If we took a poll amongst Federal employees and asked ``Do you \nbelieve your health care is pretty good?''--my guess is most people \nwould say yes. We get to choose from a lot of health plans.\n  Guess what. You can't sue your employer. This bill doesn't say the \nFederal Government can be sued by employees. Fine. Private sector, go \nout and sue your employer. Sue your HMO. Can you sue your HMO if you \nare a Federal employee? No. You cannot. You can sue to get a covered \nbenefit. You can do that in the private sector right now. Some people \nsay you can't sue your HMO. But you can sue to get a covered benefit.\n  What people want is to get into a lawsuit lottery where they can go \nfor millions of dollars of excess covered benefits. You can say, I sue. \nIf you want to have coverage for a benefit that you think you are \nrightly entitled to, you can sue for that today. This bill doesn't \ncover Federal employees.\n  This bill doesn't cover the lowest income Americans. What did you \nsay? I said this bill that we have before us doesn't cover the lowest \nincome Americans. It doesn't cover Medicaid.\n  Think about that. We have a Federal insurance program called \nMedicaid. This bill doesn't apply to Medicaid. We don't care about low-\nincome Americans with all of these patient protections that we are \nsaying are so magnificent. We are giving these to the private sector, \nand they won't cost anything? So we are going to have this mandate on \nthe private sector, including liability, but we do not have it for low-\nincome people? Does that make sense?\n\n  We love seniors, so I am sure this benefit applies to seniors. I read \nthrough the bill and, much to my chagrin, this bill does not apply to \nMedicare. Wow. I know I heard President Clinton say we are going to \nmake these patient protections apply to Medicare. These protections do \nnot apply to Medicare. Somebody in Medicare cannot sue the Federal \nGovernment. Somebody in Medicare cannot sue for unlimited damages \nthrough their employer.\n  I know I heard President Clinton say I already instituted an \nexecutive order that applies these patient protections to Federal \nemployees in Medicare, but it did not happen. He did a little \nsomething, but it did not apply anything like this bill. It was not \nnearly as extensive or expensive.\n  So if we are trying to apply these patient protections to all \nAmericans, we sort of left out a few people. We left out Federal \nemployees. That is interesting. Employees in the State of Alaska, the \nGovernor of Alaska, the State legislature, they have to comply. These \nbenefits must apply to State employees in every State of the Union but \nnot to Federal employees. Wow. We have a heck of a deal.\n  And, oh, yes, they have to apply to every health care plan in \nAmerica, every private-sector health care plan in America but not the \nVA. These benefits do not apply to veterans in our hospitals. These \nbenefits do not apply to Indians in the Indian Health Service. These \nbenefits do not apply to Federal employees. They do not apply to \nMedicare. They do not apply to Medicaid, to low-income people. So when \nmy colleagues say we want these to apply to all Americans, they have \nnot read their bill.\n  Guess what. They do not apply to union members either, not for the \nduration of their contract. If you renegotiate your contract by next \nsummer--and it could be a 10-year contract--you would not be covered in \nthis bill for 11 years. We are going to apply it to everybody else in \nthe private sector, but we are going to have an exemption for our \nfriends in the unions. Wow. That is interesting. So I just make that \ncomment.\n  I think this bill is aimed, like a gun, at the heads of employers. \nPrivate sector, look out. Trial lawyers are after you. They are not \njust after the HMOs, they are after employers as well. We can fix that \nby adopting the Gramm amendment. We can exempt employers and make it \nnice, clean, and straightforward. If you want to exempt employers, vote \nfor this amendment.\n  Employers, if you want your Members of the Senate to exempt you, if \nyou do not want to be strapped with this unlimited liability, I would \nurge you to contact your Senators between now and Tuesday and say: \nPlease pass the Gramm amendment. It will have a real effect. It will \nduplicate the Texas law that exempts employers. So we can make a \ndifference.\n  Also, if seniors think all these great patient protections we are \nlauding so much are very good things, you might ask them: Why are you \nleft out of this bill? If this is so good for the private sector, why \ndon't we do it for the public sector as well? It seems like we have a \nlittle habit around here, every once in a while, of saying: It is just \nfine\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nto sue the private sector. We can put all kinds of mandates on them. So \nwhat. Oh, but we will not do that to us. I am not sure I agree with \nthat. We may have to have an amendment to clarify that as well.\n  This bill, in my opinion, is fatally flawed. We are going to try to \namend it to improve it. I very much want to put a bill on the \nPresident's desk in the not-too-distant future that he can sign and \nthat we will be proud of. Maybe Senator Kennedy and I can be shaking \nhands behind him saying we have a good bill that really does protect \npatients but in the process does not threaten and scare employers.\n  I think that is possible. I do not think it is in this bill. I think \nPresident Bush is exactly right in saying this bill would cost too \nmuch. The cost of this bill could increase health care costs 8 or 9 \npercent over and above inflation in health care, which right now is 13 \npercent nationally. That is about 22 percent for small business. \nBusinesses and employees cannot afford another 8 or 9 percent on top of \nalready very high medical costs.\n  So this bill needs to be fixed. It needs to be improved. One giant \nstep toward doing that would be the approval of the pending amendment \nthat we will be voting on some time Tuesday.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the underlying amendment. We will \ncome up with additional amendments to improve this bill in relation to \nliability and scope and contracts. This bill just happens to have a \nsection that says you shall not be bound by the contract. That is \ninteresting. It means it is totally unlimited in what this bill may \ncover, what somebody may have to pay for, whether it is contractual or \nnot. We will try to fix that as well.\n  Hopefully, we will improve this bill to the extent that it will be a \ngood bill worthy of the President's signature and one where we can say \nwe did a good job and passed a real bipartisan bill that will improve \npatient protections for all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Will the Senator withhold that \nrequest?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I withhold it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to follow on the comments made by my good \nfriend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, relative to the bill before \nthis body.\n  I come to this Chamber as a Senator that represents a State that does \nnot have a single HMO. As a consequence, with our small population, \nspread over a large land mass, I do not expect to see many HMOs moving \ninto Alaska anytime soon. But I think this fact has led me to perhaps \nhave an objective view, to look at this legislation with more neutral \neyes. And what I see troubles me. I think it should trouble all \nAmericans.\n  We do have a crisis in our health care system. Right now, there are \n42.6 million Americans who are uninsured. These individuals lack even \nthe most basic coverage and must continually worry about how they will \npay for health care services.\n  Will they become sick and fall into a situation where they fail to \nreceive proper medical attention? Will they become hospitalized but \nhave their hospital bills drive them into bankruptcy? Should they pay \ntheir doctor bills or pay their rent? Which is it? These are the real \nconcerns facing 1 out of every 6 Americans.\n  With such a staggering number of uninsured, and such real \ndifficulties they could face, why have the proponents of the bill so \ncavalierly shrugged off the additional costs of this Patients' Bill of \nRights? For every 1 percent increase in premiums, 300,000 more \nAmericans will be faced with the reality of being uninsured. That is \n300,000. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the McCain-\nKennedy bill will increase health care premiums by 4.2 percent.\n  I think Americans need to know more about this matter. Further, more \nthan 1 million people will lose their health care coverage because of \nthis pending bill. Who is going to protect their right to even be a \npatient? Who will ensure that they will even have access to a doctor? \nHow are they going to have direct access to a hospital or, for that \nmatter, an emergency room? What new rights will 1 million newly \nuninsured individuals have in this country?\n  That is the real problem. And there is real concern for all of us. \nAnd don't think there won't be a cost for those who are still lucky \nenough to retain health care insurance. There would be a cost.\n  Last year, the average family spent $6,351 on health care expenses. \nThat payment is expected to now go up 13 percent to more than $7,000, \neven without the McCain-Kennedy bill. If it is enacted as it is \ncurrently drafted, those families would have to take on even more \nfinancial burdens. Newly uninsured individuals will still receive some \nmodest level of care through expensive emergency room visits or \nhospitalizations. If they are unable to pay, however, this bad debt \nwill be passed on to those among us, and, as a consequence, the Federal \nGovernment will also pick up a significant share. We will all pay more \nwhen more and more care is delivered to uninsured individuals.\n  I have talked to some of my constituents in Alaska. One thing is \nperfectly clear. They want quality health care for their families, not \na prime slot on the local court's docket.\n  Let's not be coy about who is really pushing this legislation. It is \nthe trial lawyers, and the trial lawyers smell blood in the water.\n  I applaud Senator Frist and Senator Breaux, and others, for putting \nforward a more well-thought-out Patients' Bill of Rights. They have \nthis part right: Americans want to see their doctor and their \nspecialist in a timely and appropriate manner; they do not want to see \ntheir employer, who has gone the extra mile to offer health care \nbenefits, dragged into court.\n  Under the McCain-Kennedy bill, an employer could be subjected to \nunlimited economic damages, unlimited non-economic damages, and up to \n$5 million in punitive damages.\n  I have served in this body for a little over 20 years. During that \ntime, I have worked to strengthen and support America's small \nbusinesses.\n  I firmly believe that small businesses are the backbone of our \neconomy and represent the ideals that form this great Nation. Those are \nthe folks who take the real risks. The individuals who start a small \nbusiness are the risk takers. Obviously, it is a very tough process. \nThey have to be the bookkeeper, the timekeeper. They have to be the \nfirst aid master. Anything imaginable you have to do yourself in a \nsmall business. You don't have a clinic to go to. You don't have all \nthe assets that a large corporation has almost within house.\n  That any American could work hard, open a business, create hope and \nopportunity for their families is what small businesses are all about. \nWhen they succeed, of course, they hire employees and eventually offer \nhealth care benefits. We should not punish them just because they offer \nthese benefits.\n  The bottom line effect of this legislation is to force employers to \neither drastically rewrite their health insurance plans or drop \ncoverage altogether. Whose rights are served then?\n  While McCain-Kennedy may claim to have a copyright on the so-called \nPatients' Bill of Rights, I think nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Rather, I think we must all understand that the Frist-Breaux \npackage contains comprehensive patient protections, all without \nthreatening employers. These include:\n  Guaranteed access to emergency care: As such, a patient can go to the \nnearest hospital emergency room regardless of whether the emergency \nroom is in their health care plan network or not;\n  Direct access to OB/GYN care: If OB/GYN care is offered, women can \ndirectly access that care;\n  Direct access to pediatricians: All Americans can choose a \npediatrician as their child's primary care doctor;\n  Access to valuable and beneficial prescription drugs: Physicians and \npharmacists will work to develop appropriate drug formulas;\n  Timely access to specialty care: If a plan lacks a specialist, the \npatient can go outside the network for no additional cost.\n  What better protections and rights than access to quality care? \nQuality care that the more than a million newly uninsured individuals \nwill never, ever receive?\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\n  I am grateful that we are debating this bill. I am also grateful that \nthis bill will be subjected to an amendment process. We have a lot of \nwork to do. The first thing we should do is to make sure that employers \nare not subject to liability simply because they want to care for their \nemployees. Together we can make this a true Patients' Bill of Rights \nbill. I am committed to having a solid piece of legislation sent to our \nPresident for his signature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6657-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF J. STEVEN GRILES\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am very concerned. The Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee has oversight of the Department of the \nInterior. As a consequence, we have had the responsibility of holding \nhearings on the nomination of various individuals for the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  It is rather ironic that the only individual at the Department of the \nInterior who has been cleared by the Senate in its entirety is \nSecretary of the Interior Gale Norton. We have had a situation with \nregard to the Deputy Secretary, Mr. Steven Griles, that deserves some \nexamination by this body.\n  Mr. Griles was nominated on March 9 by our President. Hearings were \nheld on May 16, as I chaired the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. He was reported favorably out of the committee by a vote of \n18-4 on May 23 of this year. All this was prior to the switch by \nSenator Jeffords who made his announcement on May 24. At that time, we \nimmediately began to try to move the nomination. The minority also \ntried to get a time agreement.\n  According to the information we have from the floor staff, Griles was \ncleared on the Republican side on May 23. In an executive session on \nMay 23, we did move one nomination. On May 24, we moved 19 nominations. \nOn May 25, we moved 33 nominations. On May 26, we moved 8 nominations. \nIn each case, Griles was cleared by the Republican side but objected to \nby the Democratic side. I wonder why.\n  During this period, a unanimous consent agreement was offered to \nallow for 2 hours of debate and a vote--the Democratic side said they \nneeded 2 hours--with consideration the week we were to return from the \nMemorial Day recess.\n  That was again rejected by the Democrats, as was a modification that \ndeleted the time certain and only included the time limitation. At that \npoint, it was clear that the Democrats would control the floor and the \ntiming on our return.\n  Yet in executive session on June 14, we cleared three additional \nnominations, but the Democrats would not clear Mr. Griles. Why?\n  As of today, Friday, June 22, Mr. Griles has been pending for 30 days \nwithout even a time agreement. Even if the majority leader wants to \nhold consideration of further nominations hostage in the sense of \norganizing resolutions, an agreement on time for debate has nothing to \ndo with the resolution and the actual scheduling of the debate.\n  Who suffers by this politicizing? Obviously, the Department of the \nInterior as a functioning body, and the public whom the Department of \nthe Interior serves. We have a new Secretary, again, the only person \ndown there who is confirmed. She needs help. I encourage the leadership \non the Democratic side to let this nominee go. He has not been nor is \nhe a part of the general holdup on the other nominees because action \nwas taken on him prior to the change in the leadership in the Senate.\n  I am kind of amused by some of the comments of my colleagues on the \nother side who indicate a puzzlement, saying there have been no attacks \non Griles. They simply have said all the nominations are on hold while \nthe Senate reorganizes because of the switch of the Senator from \nVermont.\n  I think the explanation I have given is not only accurate but gives \nthought to some of the excuses we have heard from the other side as to \ntheir justification. There is no justification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6657-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6657-S6658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter I know is \nvery close to the interests and the heart of my colleague who occupies \nthe chair. That is the issue of energy.\n  As we look at energy in view of the calendar, it is quite obvious \nthat while energy appears to be the No. 1 issue in the minds of most \nAmericans today, it certainly is not on the minds of the leadership in \nthe Senate body. Energy is not even on the calendar.\n  It is my understanding, after the Patients' Bill of Rights, we will \nprobably go to a supplemental. We may have the minimum wage, any number \nof things. Energy is not on the list.\n  I can only allude to what I assume is a political evaluation that \nsomehow the Democrats are better off not working in a bipartisan manner \nto address the corrections that are going to be needed to bring about \nrelief from this energy crisis but would rather object to any action \nbeing taken as they blame our President and his association with the \nenergy industry as the cause of some of the problems associated with \nenergy in this country.\n  When you think about it, you might say the Democrats are waging a war \nagainst the prosperity and freedoms associated with the character of \nthis country.\n  The character of this country, to a large degree, is directly \nassociated with a standard of living. That standard of living is based \non affordable energy and a plentiful supply. Energy really powers our \nNation's freedom, our national security. It gives us the flexibility to \nlive our lives as we choose, to pursue our hopes and our goals. Energy \npowers the workplace, moves the economy, moving it forward and bringing \nall of us along with it.\n  As we know, as evidenced by the polls, the energy supply and price of \nenergy are all part of the energy crisis in this country. Supplies are \nthreatened, costs are rising, and the resulting crisis is undermining \nour economy.\n  When an issue of this magnitude touches so many families in so many \nways, Congress simply must act. We must do what we can to help provide \nsolutions to the crisis. But now with the change of leadership, what we \nseem to have on the other side is a lack of interest in even including \nenergy on the agenda. We have asked the Democratic leadership time and \ntime again to schedule on the calendar time so we can debate the \ncomprehensive energy bills that have been introduced. These bills are \npending in the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, where I am \nnow the ranking member. But the reality is we can't seem to move or get \nany time agreement or any priority in this body.\n  It is amazing that the emphasis seems to be blaming our President--a \nPresident who has proposed a methodology to fix it. He has developed \nfrom his energy task force report specific recommendations. One of the \nmore interesting things is the manner in which some in the media are \ncoming to the general assumption that there really isn't a shortage at \nall, and that this is something that has been trumped up by the oil \nindustry, big oil, with the knowledge and support of the President.\n  How ridiculous, Mr. President. I have a chart here that shows why \nthings are different, why this crisis exists. Anybody who suggests \nthere is no crisis is not being realistic.\n  This is America's energy crisis today. It starts with our increased \ndependence on foreign oil. We are importing 56 percent of the total oil \nwe consume in this country. In 1973, when we had gas lines around the \nblock, when we had the Arab oil embargo, as a consequence of that, we \nwere 37-percent dependent. We created a Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We \nfelt that we never wanted to exceed 50 percent in imports because it \nwould affect national security. Now we are 56-percent dependent and the \nDepartment of Energy says that it will be 66 percent by 2010.\n  Secondly, natural gas--which we have taken for granted for a long, \nlong time--was about $2.16 per thousand cubic feet 14 months ago. Today \nit is $4, $5, $6. It has quadrupled. We are looking for electric energy \nfrom the resource of gas. So that has changed.\n  The nuclear industry--well, we haven't built a new nuclear plant in \nmore than 10 years--nearly 20 years. We licensed a plant approximately \n10 years ago. We are not doing anything in nuclear.\n  We are concerned about air quality and emissions and we are concerned \nabout Kyoto, global warming, climate\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\nchange. What particular source of energy contributes more relief and \ndoes not emit any emissions of any consequence? Nuclear energy. The \nnuclear industry contributes 22 percent of the power generated in this \ncountry. We haven't done a thing in that area.\n  When we talk about gasoline prices, why are they so high? Obviously, \nit is the law of supply and demand. Even Congress can't change that. We \nhaven't built a new refinery in 25 years. The last new one was built in \nmy State of Alaska. The demand is up and we have more people driving.\n\n  An interesting thing to notice, while we have other sources of energy \nfor power generation, is that America moves on oil. I wish we had \nanother alternative, but we don't. Our ships, our trains, trucks, cars, \nairplanes--we don't fly in and out of Washington, DC, on hot air. \nSomebody has to drill the oil and refine it and transport it and put it \nin the airplanes, and so forth.\n  My point is clear. We don't have any other alternative for energy to \nmove America, other than oil at this time. The technology simply \ndoesn't exist.\n  We haven't built a new coal-fired plant in this country since 1995. \nSuddenly, we find that our electric transmission lines haven't been \nexpanded, our natural gas transmission lines haven't been expanded. \nThat is why we have an energy crisis. That is why it is different than \never before. It has all kind of come together like the ``perfect \nstorm.'' Everything has come together because we haven't had a policy. \nWe haven't acted and now the American public is saying: What's going \non? Why can't Congress fix it? Congress is pointing the finger at \neverybody and everything, blaming each other instead of moving ahead in \na bipartisan manner.\n  The Democratic leadership refuses to put energy on the priority \ncalendar for this body. I find that unconscionable. America's No. 1 \npriority is nowhere on the Democrats' list. I think, by holding up this \nprocess, they are holding up the prosperity of this Nation. One of our \nfreedoms is to have plentiful and affordable supplies of energy. Our \nstandard of living, to a large degree, is dependent upon that. Do we \nwant to change that standard of living? Clearly, we do not. We want to \nadvance that standard of living by bringing on affordable energy, \nalternative energy.\n  A lot of people say, well, conservation is the answer. Conservation \nis important. We can do a better job, but it will not make up the \ndeficiency that exists. Some say alternatives. Some say renewables. But \nthey constitute a very small percentage, even if you include \nhydroelectric, which is a renewable. Renewables constitute less than 4 \npercent of the total energy mix in this country. I wish they \ncontributed more.\n  I am just afraid the Democrats would rather see this energy issue as \na partisan issue, as opposed to a bipartisan victory for both \nRepublicans and Democrats. I can only reach the conclusion that the \nDemocrats are pulling the plug on the energy solution, figuring they \nare better off to attack the President, the White House, big oil, than \nto address the problem. If they do, we are all going to be left in the \ndark.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues \nan historical event which took place at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk, \nVA on May 22, 2001. The event memorializes a remarkable chapter in Army \nhistory that occurred after Word War II.\n  The event was the dedication of the Survivor's Talmud Exhibit which \nwas done in honor of a truly great man, Leonard Strelitz, by his close \nfriends. The story of the Survivor's Talmud speaks to the strength and \nresolve of a very determined people of Jewish faith some 54 years ago; \nand, to the resourcefulness and caring of a handful of U.S. Army \nsoldiers.\n  Today, I place in the Congressional Record excerpts from the ceremony \nthat convey the historical and spiritual splendidness of this \nextraordinary tale to include: the Invocation, by Rabbi Dr. Israel \nZoberman, spiritual leader of Congregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia \nBeach; Remarks and Benediction by Major General Gaylord T. Gunhus, \nChief of Chaplains, U.S. Army; and Remarks by Mr. Marvin Simon and Mr. \nWalter Segaloff, hosts of the evening's events.\n  Due to Senate business on the day of the ceremony, I was not able to \nattend so I am also placing in the Record a copy of a letter I wrote to \nbe read during the ceremony.\n  As this magnificent exhibit tours throughout the country, I hope it \nwill instill in younger generations the critical importance of \npreserving human rights, individual dignity, and freedom. It will \nremind future generations of the incomprehensible sacrifices of the \nWorld War II generation and their need to always remain alert to \nprevent a reoccurrence in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the material to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Remarks of Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman\n\n       Mekor Hachaim, Source of All Life, Our God, Goodness' \n     Guide, Dear and Distinguished Friends and Guests:\n       We have gathered on a momentous occasion at this enchanting \n     setting of the Chrysler Museum of Art, dedicated to \n     civilization's creative celebration of life, mindful that our \n     Norfolk and Hampton Roads are home to the military might for \n     sacred freedom's sake of the world's sole superpower, \n     allowing the human enterprise to flourish into a blessing. \n     Here from whence our heroic sons and daughters sailed to \n     brave history's harshest storm of World War II, we recall \n     with lasting gratitude and devotion our proud nation's \n     sacrificial contribution in blood and spirit to ending the \n     threat to creation of the Nazi kingdom of death, with its \n     genocidal destruction of a third of the Jewish people and \n     untold suffering to humanity.\n       I stand before you, profoundly awed, son of Polish \n     Holocaust survivors who spent from 1947 to 1949 with my \n     family in the Displaced Persons Camp of Wetzlar at Frankfurt, \n     benefiting from a much appreciated reassuring embrace at a \n     trying time of turmoil and transition. The printing for us of \n     the Talmud on German soil facilitated by the U.S. Army, to \n     save the Jewish soul, was an act of enduring love we shall \n     always cherish. We knew that our miraculous physical \n     perseverance was ultimately rooted in preserving our unique \n     spiritual heritage that was Hitler's final target, seeking to \n     eradicate from the planet Earth the essential Judeo-Christian \n     values and ideals.\n       Honoring our U.S. Army and government through affirming by \n     special friends the blessed memory of beloved Leonard \n     Strelitz with acquiring a full 19 volume edition of that \n     legendary Babylonian Talmud publication is most appropriate \n     indeed, along with this being the beginning of the traveling \n     treasured exhibit sponsored by the American Jewish Historical \n     Society. Leonard's towering stature propelled him to rise to \n     new heights of commitment, caring and compassion. A great \n     American, the prophetic vision was fulfilled in him with both \n     the lion and lamb dwelling in his big heart of a true leader \n     with commanding presence. He singularly served the surviving \n     remnant of his Jewish people as a tough lion, national \n     chairman of the United Jewish Appeal aiding the embattled \n     State of Israel, as well as a tender lamb in support of all \n     worthy causes with the crown jewel of the Leonard R. Strelitz \n     Diabetes Institutes at Eastern Virginia Medical School, \n     placing personal success to serve the public agenda, most \n     ably prodding others to follow suit, for none could refuse \n     him.\n       To him, his dear wife Joyce who nourished and sustained him \n     and the entire family, our heartfelt thanks. Leonard's \n     inspiring legacy is forever intertwined with out tradition's \n     best impulse and the noblest in our nation's character, \n     shining testimony to his faith's abiding message to all of \n     shalom's promise, purpose and peace. Let us say Amen.\n       [Rabbi Dr. Israel Zoberman, spiritual leader of \n     Congregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach, is President of \n     the Hampton Roads Board of Rabbis and Chairman of the \n     Community Relations Council of the United Jewish Federation \n     of Tidewater. He was born in Kazakhstan in 1945.]\n                                  ____\n\n\n       Speech and Benediction by Major General Gaylord T. Gunhus\n\n       On behalf of the United States Army, it is with great \n     pleasure that I accept this plaque. Thank you for this \n     symbol, of your gracious recognition for the service our Army \n     rendered to the Jewish community in post War\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\n     Germany. It is an honor to be here today to acknowledge the \n     events that led to the printing of the Survivors Army Talmud \n     and to acknowledge the role United States Army leaders had in \n     making the Talmud printing possible.\n       Most Americans are unaware of the history and story, which \n     we have heard and celebrate today.\n       Europe in the mid 20th century, a site of the worst carnage \n     and evil in the modern period, was freed at great cost a cost \n     few of us here were able to witness first hand.\n       This Great War of liberation against the forces of \n     totalitarianism, posed for the entire world, then and now, an \n     open question. Can mankind find the goodness within the soul \n     to defend against the impulses of tyranny and hatred? This is \n     a question we must answer daily for ourselves, and for the \n     sake of our children, the heirs of the future.\n       It is with great pride in the values, which our nation \n     represents, that I stand here today. This pride, which we \n     share in common, is tempered by the knowledge of the \n     sacrifice and courage of those, who in times past, gave their \n     lives for our fondest hopes of liberty.\n       We know that a free nation must rise above the simple pride \n     bestowed by victory in war. A free nation, if it desires to \n     be great, must be the servant of freedom and the defender of \n     dignity for every man and woman. The Army of our nation in \n     post war Europe, was then, and is today, more than a mighty \n     physical force.\n       Similarly, the printing of the Talmud in Post War Germany \n     is more than simply the printing of books. The event for \n     which we gather today to commemorate and honor, the \n     restoration of the Jewish religious and cultural life in \n     Germany after the defeat of Nazi forces, is the result of \n     many individuals labor and courage. Some of these leaders \n     were men in uniform some were not, some were religious \n     leaders some were not, but each was connected by a common \n     commitment to turn back the tide of darkness that had spilled \n     across the continent.\n       For me, this event signifies the values and principles of \n     our nation and the institution that I serve, the United \n     States Army.\n       It would be my hope that every citizen could witness this \n     exhibit and read the history that helped bring back the light \n     to those that may otherwise have lost hope. May the words of \n     the Scriptures ever be heard, ``Hear O Israel: The Lord our \n     God, the Lord is one.''\n       On behalf of (Army Chief of Staff) General (Eric) Shinseki, \n     and all the members of the Army, past and present, thank you \n     for your gift of gratitude and this symbol of appreciation.\n\n\n                              Benediction\n\n       As we conclude today's ceremony honoring the many \n     participants including the 3rd U.S. Army for bringing the \n     light of the Torah to the victims of persecution, we are ever \n     grateful, as Americans and men and women of faith, for the \n     blessings of freedom and privilege of living in this great \n     land. We ask, Lord, that you watch and protect our brave \n     soldiers who stand guard over the nation throughout the \n     world.\n       May this magnificent Army Talmud Exhibit serve as a \n     poignant reminder that Your Word, is the ``tree of life for \n     those who grasp it, and all who upheld it are blessed. Its \n     ways are pleasantness and all its paths are peace.'' And, as \n     we read, in Proverbs (6:22-23) ``When you walk, it will lead \n     you; When you lie down, it will watch over you; And when you \n     are awake it will talk with you. For these commands are a \n     lamp, this teaching a light.''\n       Let us, as people of God, work together to build a world \n     free from intolerance and prejudice. All this we ask in Your \n     name. Amen.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                Excerpts From Remarks of Walter Segaloff\n\n       Good Evening everyone. I am Walter Segaloff and I want to \n     thank you for joining us for this very historic occasion.\n       This evening is special for two reasons--\n       First, we deal with a forgotten chapter in our history, \n     that is ``The Story of the Jewish--Displaced Persons--From \n     1945 thru 1949''--and the unique part that the United States \n     Army played in that tragedy.\n       Secondly, we honor Leonard Strelitz through the dedication \n     of the Army Talmud Exhibit to him. Many of us knew Leonard as \n     ``our leader'' or affectionately as ``the Don of the Southern \n     Mafia.'' He was the one who energized so many of us, the one \n     who solicited us, and by way of example through his and his \n     brother Buddy's and their family's extraordinary level of \n     giving set an example that we willingly and in many cases \n     ``unwillingly'' followed. Most of the time we felt better \n     about our giving, we felt prouder, for we knew we were making \n     vital contributions to the birth of a nation and the \n     gathering in of the remnants of the Holocaust--the displaced \n     persons of Europe.\n       I would like to recognize a number of people who are in the \n     audience tonight for this occasion:\n       TRADOC Chief of Chaplains, COL Douglas McLeroy and his \n     wife, Dana;\n       Dr. William Hennessey, Director of the Chrysler Museum of \n     Art in Norfolk;\n       Dr. Michael Feldberg, Director of the American Jewish \n     Historical Society in New York City;\n       Dr. Arthur Kaplan, chairman, of the Tidewater Jewish \n     Foundation and his wife Phyllis;\n       Philip S. Rovner, Executive Director of the Tidewater \n     Jewish Federation;\n       Ms. Annabel Sacks, President United Jewish Federation of \n     Tidewater;\n       Mark Goldstein, Executive Vice President of the United \n     Jewish Federation of Tidewater;\n       Rabbi Michael Panitz of Temple Israel who prepared a \n     pamphlet on the Talmud that is available at the exhibit;\n       Joel R. Rubin, President, Rubin Cawley and Associates;\n       U.S. Senator John Warner.\n       We are privileged to have with us a truly unique group of \n     people who honor us with their presence--Local Holocaust \n     Survivors:\n       Esther Goldman;\n       Alfred Dreyfus;\n       David and Brinia Hendler;\n       David Katz;\n       Bronia Drucker;\n       Hanns Loewenbach;\n       Kitty and Abbott Saks;\n       Aron Weintraub who lived in a DP camp after World War II in \n     Germany.\n       Tonight the Jewish Community in Hampton Roads Virginia \n     representing Jewish people everywhere is pleased to dedicate \n     an exhibit commemorating the decision by the United States \n     Army 54 years ago. in post war Germany to print complete sets \n     of the Babylonian Talmud for the survivors of the Holocaust.\n       It was a remarkable humanitarian gesture and was evidence \n     of the great spirit of our nation and its kindness to people \n     who have been beset by human tragedy that defied comparison \n     or imagination.\n       Later in the program you will hear from Marvin Simon how \n     this exhibit and program came about.\n       In preparing this exhibit, Dr. Michael Feldberg from the \n     American Jewish Historical Society expressed his enthusiasm \n     for the project and noted: ``. . . I understand that \n     Leonard's Hebrew name is R-YEA (aryon), which means lion, and \n     that his family name Strelitz in Russian means steel. We \n     would all agree Leonard was truly a man with a lion's heart \n     and a will of steel. His leadership and personal example \n     inspired countless others throughout the country--through \n     them--through us--his work continues to this day. . . .''\n       A brief overview of the primary reason we are here tonight \n     which is to thank the U.S. Army for their role . . . During \n     these historic times.\n       During 1945 and 1946, American Jewish organizations such as \n     ORT and the Joint Distribution Committee lobbied to improve \n     the Jewish DP's living conditions. At their urging, President \n     Harry S. Truman appointed the Harrison Commission to \n     investigate the treatment of Jewish DP's. The commission \n     reported, ``As matters now stand, we appear to be treating \n     the Jews as the Nazis treated them except we do not \n     exterminate them. They are in concentration camps in large \n     numbers under our military guard instead of S.S. troops. One \n     is led to wonder whether the German people, seeing this, are \n     not supposing that we are following or at least condoning \n     Nazi policy.''\n       Truman ordered General Dwight D. Eisenhower, commander of \n     U.S. forces in Europe, to ``get these people out of camps and \n     into decent housing until they can be repatriated or \n     evacuated . . . I know you will agree with me that we have a \n     particular responsibility toward these victims of persecution \n     and tyranny who are in our zone . . . We have no better \n     opportunity to demonstrate this than by the manner in which \n     we ourselves actually treat the survivors remaining in \n     Germany.''\n       Part of restoring their lives meant reinvigorating Judaism. \n     Remember, along with humans, the Nazi's burned Jewish books, \n     synagogues and schools. By 1945, not one complete set of the \n     Talmud could be found in Europe.\n       After Truman's memo to Eisenhower, conditions got much \n     better followed by a high level mission of American Jewish \n     leaders including Rabbi Stephen Wise who visited the camps in \n     a show of support for the DPs and Rabbi Wise thanked the U.S. \n     Army and General McNarnary when he said ``At its highest \n     levels, the U.S. Army has become sincerely and deeply \n     involved in the effort to make camp life bearable, restoring \n     freedom and dignity to the survivors of the Holocaust.''\n       The Army was showing the very best side of American \n     humanitarianism in its handling of a civilian refugee \n     situation, a task for which it was not trained.\n       With the U.S. Army's encouragement, a ``Charter of \n     Recognition'' was written. The U.S. Army was saying something \n     that no other arm of any allied government was yet willing to \n     say--that the Jewish DP's must be recognized as different. \n     All other DP's could be repatriated to a homeland; only the \n     Jews were without one.\n       The difference could be remedied by a political decision \n     beyond the Army's capability. But in the meantime, the Army \n     would declare, in effect, that Palestine had to be recognized \n     someday as the DP's homeland. Thus, the most important \n     military arm of the United States was accepting the basic \n     premises of the Zionist movement. How remarkable!\n       I quote from part of Rabbi Herbert Friedman's book ``Roots \n     of the Future''.\n       He writes ``No matter which camp in Germany I visited, I \n     kept hearing the name of Babenhausen. It became a symbol for \n     restlessness, for the huge problem of being stuck in camps \n     without a solution for the future. The question grew more \n     persistent: ``When will we get to Palestine?''\n       About two months later, I was able to help supply an \n     answer. David Ben-Gurion, chairman of the Jewish Agency, was \n     in Paris, en\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\n     route to Switzerland. He wanted to visit a refugee camp--not \n     a model operation, but one in which he could see the true, \n     rough fiber of DP life. I took him to Babenhausen.\n       Ben Gurion was the clear and undisputed leader of the \n     Jewish population of Palestine (about 600,000 at that time) \n     and the leader of world Jewry's thrust toward a sovereign \n     state. He was a fighter--the small, cocky, bantam rooster--\n     the charismatic, world famous symbol of the Zionist force.\n       For the occasion, we utilized the camp's largest stable, \n     with a small stage at one end and standing room for thousands \n     of people. Ben-Gurion's presence did indeed produce an \n     electric wave of excitement. So many DP's crowded in that it \n     seemed almost all of the camp's 5,000 residents were pressed \n     into that area. They knew that this dynamic, white-haired man \n     was their link with a history they thought had forgotten \n     them.\n       For the first time, there were smiles inside the gates of \n     Babenhausen, and then came the inevitable question--poignant, \n     pleading, uncertain, wavering, but persistent: ``When, Mr. \n     Ben-Gurion? When will we go to Palestine?''\n       As Ben-Gurion listened to those questions, he began to \n     weep, the only time in my long relationship with him I saw \n     that happen. The tears fell slowly. He spoke through them, \n     quietly but firmly. I remember his words almost exactly:\n       ``I come to you with empty pockets. I have no British entry \n     certificates to give you. I can only tell you that you are \n     not abandoned, you are not alone, you will not live endlessly \n     in camps like this. All of you who wish to come to Palestine \n     will be brought there as soon as is humanly possible. I bring \n     you no certificates--only hope. Let us sing our national \n     anthem--Hatikvah which means Hope.''\n       In that way, the people of Babenhausen understood that \n     their unloved camp was not the end of the line but a way \n     station on the road to freedom.\n       After the apparent absence of God during the maniacal years \n     of their torment, the survivors were not strong in religious \n     faith. But they were fierce in their ethnicity; they clung to \n     each other desperately and were loyal to their peoplehood. \n     And, thus the reason we are here tonight--to honor the U.S. \n     Army for their understanding, sympathy, and the morality of \n     their conduct and their help in providing books of \n     traditional significance.\n       The rest of this remarkable story which 54 years later \n     brings us to tonight is left to Marvin Simon, Senator John \n     Warner, and our guest speaker--Lucian Truscott IV and to \n     Major General Gaylord T. Gunhus, Chief of the U.S. Army \n     Chaplains.\n       I now call on another giant of our community who was the \n     lead benefactor of this project--the man who made tonight \n     possible. He has worked closely with the American Jewish \n     Historical Society to make sure the exhibit tells the \n     story, both of the Survivor's Talmud and of Leonard \n     Strelitz. Please welcome Marvin Simon.\n\n\n                Introduction of sponsors by Marvin Simon\n\n       Please welcome our guest Senator Chuck Robb--a friend of \n     many of you--a long time proven friend of Israel and the \n     Jewish people--Senator Robb\n\n\n                  Introduction of Senator John Warner\n\n       In 1946, a delegation of DP rabbis approached General \n     Joseph McNarney, commander of the American Zone of Occupied \n     Germany, asking that the Army publish a Talmud. McNarney \n     understood the symbolic significance of their request and \n     received assistance from General Lucian Truscott who had \n     succeeded General George Patton as commander of the 3rd Army.\n       The grandson of General Lucian Truscott is Historian Lucian \n     Truscott IV and we are pleased that he is with us this \n     evening as our keynote speaker.\n       Mr. Truscott, whose father was a West Point graduate and \n     Colonel in the Army, is the oldest of five children. Mr. \n     Truscott graduated from West Point in 1969, then made a name \n     for himself by revealing a serious problem with heroin abuse \n     that existed in the service, a revelation that at first did \n     not sit well with the Army and led to his discharge.\n       Lucian Truscott subsequently became a investigative \n     reporter for the Village Voice, then the best author of Dress \n     Gray, considered one of the best novels ever written about \n     West Point. It became a television mini-series. Mr. Truscott \n     then wrote Dress Blue, a riveting novel about Vietnam. He has \n     also written screenplays and today lives in Los Angeles.\n       Please welcome Lucian Truscott IV.\n\n\n                     Introduction of Joyce Strelitz\n\n       It is my pleasure now to bring you someone who needs no \n     introduction to this audience. Joyce Strelitz. Tonight the \n     benefactors would like to thank the following for tonight \n     would not have been possible without their invaluable \n     participation, work and support in the coordination of the \n     Survivors' Talmud exhibit and dedication.\n       Thank you to:\n       American Jewish Historical Society, Executive Director, Dr. \n     Michael Feldberg;\n       Chrysler Museum of Art, Director Dr. William T.

I had planned until \n     one hour ago to be with you but the only thing senators must \n     do is to vote, so here I must remain--voting--on legislation \n     to provide federal tax relief.\n       My thoughts, however, are truly with you as the Survivors' \n     Talmud Exhibit is dedicated and a long awaited `Thank you' is \n     delivered to the U.S. Army. This extraordinary story speaks \n     to the strength and resolve of a determined people and it is \n     in honor of a great man, Leonard Strelitz.\n       In a war ravaged Europe, Army soldiers managed to gather \n     scarce resources, that ``officially'' did not exist, in order \n     to publish the Talmud. By the end of 1948, 100 copies had \n     been published and a brave people had renewed hope for their \n     future.\n       That is the historic past; now we look to the future. The \n     citizens of this community have joined in this commemorative \n     event to preserve a unique chapter of history for future \n     generations to more fully understand the sacrifices, losses, \n     and the courage of the World War II generation.\n       With great humility I mention that I was a young sailor in \n     the closing months of World War II, and today, I experience \n     stunning disbelief of how few of this generation have any \n     remembrance of that period of history. Future generations \n     must always remain alert to prevent abuses of human rights, \n     individual dignity, and freedom. I thank those present \n     tonight for their vigilance and recognition of the \n     initiatives of the citizen soldiers of World War II.\n       With kind regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n     John Warner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6660-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   QUESTIONS ON CONCEALED WEAPONS LAW\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last Wednesday the Michigan Supreme Court \nheard oral arguments on whether or not the State should allow a new \nconcealed weapon law to go into effect without being put before the \nvoters in a referendum. I oppose the law because it would undermine the \nauthority of local gun boards and explode the number of concealed \nweapons on Michigan's streets. As the Justices deliberate this issue, \nrecent press reports have raised a number of disturbing questions about \nthe law.\n  For example, how will the corner drug store deal with a suspected \nshoplifter knowing that every person could be legally armed? Will \nemergency rooms and board rooms be filled with armed citizens? If so, \nwhat will that mean for public safety? Think about it. One Michigan \nemployment expert perhaps described it best: ``How many times have \npeople seen others react to situations or stress in the workplace, or \nreact to a situation and think, if they had a gun?''\n  A recent article from the Oakland Press in Michigan refers to a \nbumper sticker that says, ``An armed society is a polite society.'' \nWhile I am all for improving civility, I don't believe that arming our \ncitizens is the best way to achieve it. And, I hope that I don't have \nthe opportunity to be proven correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6660-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6660-S6661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 26, 1990 \nin New York City. A gang of men shouting anti-gay slurs attacked three \nmen. Seven men were arrested in the attack. One victim was slashed on \nthe face and another was cut. The assailants picked up the third and \nthreatened to throw him in the Hudson River.\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, today I have the special privilege \nof acknowledging forty-seven extraordinary individuals who have \nreceived this year's ``Heroes Among Us\" Award from the Boston Celtics.\n  This past season was the fourth consecutive season that the Celtics \nhave honored these heroes at home games in recognition of the selfless \ncontributions they have made to their communities. Over the last four \nyears, the Celtics have honored over one hundred and fifty men and \nwomen with this prestigious award, which is one of the leading \ncommunity-outreach programs that the Boston Celtics Charitable \nFoundation has initiated.\n  The Foundation was established to improve the lives and opportunities \nof young people in New England through local outreach programs. Members \nof the Celtics are actively involved in these initiatives and I commend \ntheir leadership and dedication to this worthwhile activity. The \nCeltics deserve great credit for all they have done to promote \ncommunity service programs which have benefited Boston's public \nschools, raised funds for local neighborhoods, and have given the \narea's youth the opportunities they need and deserve in order to become \nactive and responsible members of society.\n  These heroes are men and women who represent the great potential of \nMassachusetts. Their common tie is the commitment to community service \nthat exemplifies the best of our country. The forty-seven heroes \nhonored by the Celtics this year are role models for all of us, and \nthey are living proof that one person can make a difference in the \nlives of others. These extraordinary individuals saw the opportunity to \nimprove the lives of their fellow citizens, and their leadership has \nhelped brighten the lives of countless others in our community.\n  I commend the Celtics and all of these ``Heroes Among Us'' for their \ncontributions and achievements. I ask that the names of this year's 47 \n``Heroes Among Us'' may be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n  1. Michael Obel-Omia.\n  2. Matthew & Miriam Gannon.\n  3.

Mr. President, today I reflect on the career of \none of the most respected and influential members of the California \nSupreme Court, Justice Stanley Mosk.\n  Before his death at the age of 88, on June 19, 2001 at his home in \nSan Francisco, Justice Mosk was the longest-serving member in the \nCourt's 151-year history. He leaves an exceptional legacy that will be \nfelt for many years in California and beyond. Among his many \ncontributions he continuously worked, from the beginning of his career \nto the very end, to protect the civil rights and liberties of \nCalifornians and all Americans. He will be remembered for his \nintegrity, his intellect and for his unwavering commitment to assuring \nthat our courts and laws are based on the principles of justice and \nequality for all.\n  Stanley Mosk was appointed to the California Supreme Court by \nGovernor Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown on August 8, 1964. He served on the \nCourt for nearly 37 years.\n  He began his career in the law during the Depression. Not many years \nafter graduating from law school he rose to become executive secretary \nand legal advisor to California Governor Culbert Olson. He was \nappointed to the State Superior Court bench in 1942. At the time of his \nappointment, he was 31 years old, the State's youngest Superior Court \njudge. He served on the Superior Court bench for some 16 years, a \ntenure interrupted only by military service during World War II. He \nwent on to win statewide election as California Attorney General, a \nposition in which he served for 6 years, and was the first practicing \nJew to be elected to that office. As attorney general, he fought for \ncivil rights reforms and to strengthen antitrust laws.\n  During his tenure on the Supreme Court, Justice Mosk wrote over 1,600 \nopinions many of which of which had a profound influence on California \nlaw, and were later echoed in opinions of other States' courts and the \nU.S. Supreme Court. He was often a man ahead of his time. As one \nexample, in 1978 he wrote an opinion which outlawed racial \ndiscrimination in jury selection. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the \nsame principle 8 years later. Justice Mosk also worked to promote the \nState constitution as an independent document, guaranteeing essential \nrights, distinct from the U.S. Constitution. Many States followed his \nlead.\n  To quote current California Supreme Court Chief Justice Ronald \nGeorge, ``Stanley Mosk was a giant in the law.'' Although he is no \nlonger with us, his passion for justice will live through his rulings \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6661-3", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6661-4", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6661-5", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:48 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2217.

Therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Louisiana Legislature does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take all steps \n     necessary to replace the proposed St. Claude Avenue Bridge \n     (LA 49) and the Claiborne Avenue Bridge (LA 39), in \n     conjunction with the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal Lock \n     Replacement Project, with tunnels or fixed, high-rise bridges \n     to benefit residents of St. Bernard, Orleans, and Plaquemines \n     parishes and the maritime industry and to withhold all future \n     funding of the lock replacement project until the matter is \n     reviewed and resolved by qualified members of the Louisiana \n     Department of Transportation and Development, the United \n     States Coast Guard, and local representatives of the barge \n     transportation industry; and be it further\n       Resolved, that the Louisiana Legislature requests our \n     federal elected officials to request the United States Army \n     Corps of Engineers to consider tunnels or fixed high-rise \n     bridges, which are the canal crossing solutions preferred for \n     this project by both the\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\n     shipping industry and state motorists because either would \n     eliminate the need for bridge curfews and provide for the \n     uninterrupted flow of marine and vehicular traffic; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, that the Louisiana Legislature memorializes the \n     United States Congress to make resumption of federal funding \n     for this project contingent on the completion of a traffic \n     study and that the project evaluation report be rewritten to \n     include such crossings if warranted by the traffic study \n     review; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-122.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na shorter recovery period of the depreciation of certain leasehold \nimprovements; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by my colleagues Mr. \nNickles, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Helms, \nMr. Hutchinson of Arkansas, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \nTorricelli, to introduce important legislation to provide for a 10-year \ndepreciation life for leasehold improvements. Leasehold improvements \nare the alterations to leased space made by a building owner as part of \nthe lease agreement with a tenant.\n  This is a common sense move that will help bring economic development \nto cities and towns around the country that want to revitalize their \nbusiness districts. It will allow owners of commercial property to \nremodel their buildings to better meet the business needs of their \ncommunities--whether it's new computer ports and data lines for high-\ntech entrepreneurs, or better lighting and sales space for retailers.\n  In actual commercial use, leasehold improvements typically last as \nlong as the lease--an average of 5 to 10 years. However, the Internal \nRevenue Code requires leasehold improvements to be depreciated over 39 \nyears--the life of the building itself.\n  Economically, this makes no sense. The owner receives taxable income \nover the life of the lease, yet can only recover the costs of the \nimprovements associated with that lease over 39 years--a rate nearly \nfour times slower. This preposterous mismatch of income and expenses \ncauses the owner to incur an artificially high tax cost on these \nimprovements.\n  The bill we are introducing today will correct this irrational and \nuneconomic tax treatment by shortening the cost recovery period for \ncertain leasehold improvements from 39 years to a more realistic 10 \nyears. If enacted, this legislation would more closely align the \nexpenses incurred to construct improvements with the income they \ngenerate over the term of the lease.\n  By reducing the cost recovery period, the expense of making these \nimprovements could fall more into line with the economics of a \ncommercial lease transaction, and more building owners would be able to \nadapt their buildings to fit the needs of today's business tenant.\n  We have an interest in keeping existing buildings commercially \nviable. When older buildings can serve tenants who need modern, \nefficient commercial space, there is less pressure for developing \ngreenfields in outlying areas. Americans are concerned about preserving \nopen space, natural resources, and a sense of neighborhood. The current \nlaw 39-year cost recovery period for leasehold improvements is an \nimpediment to reinvesting in existing properties and communities.\n\n  Shortening the recovery period will make renovation and \nrevitalization of business properties more attractive. That will be \ngood not just for property owners, but also for the economic \ndevelopment professionals who are working hard every day to attract new \nbusinesses to empty downtown storefronts or aging strip malls. And it \nwill be good for the architects and contractors who carry out the \nrenovations.\n  The broad appeal of this proposal is reflected in the roster of \nsupporters we have attracted. The proposal has been endorsed by \nBuilding and Office Managers Association International; International \nCouncil of Shopping Centers; National Association of Industrial and \nOffice Properties; National Association of Real Estate Investment \nTrusts; National Association of Realtors; American Institute of \nArchitects; Real Estate Roundtable; Associated General Contractors; \nNational Retail Federation; and International Franchise Association.\n  I urge all Senators to join us in supporting this legislation to \nprovide rational depreciation treatment for leasehold improvements.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1087\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to facilitate \nthe use of educational assistance under the Montgomery GI bill for \neducation leading to employment in high technology industry, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am tremendously pleased to \nintroduce today legislation that would allow veterans to use their \nMontgomery GI bill educational benefits to pay for short-term, high \ntechnology courses that lead to lucrative careers. I am pleased to be \njoined by my colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Ranking \nMinority Member Senator Arlen Specter.\n  The GI bill allowed a generation of soldiers returning from World War \nII to create the booming post-war economy, and, in fact, the prosperity \nthat we enjoy today. Today's Montgomery GI bill, MGIB, modeled after \nthe original GI bill, provides a valuable recruitment and retention \ntool for the Armed Services and begins to repay veterans for the \nservice they have given to our Nation. As a transition benefit, it \nallows veterans to gain the skills they need to adjust productively to \ncivilian life.\n  Currently, the MGIB provides a basic monthly benefit of $650 for 36 \nmonths of education. This payment structure is designed to assist \nveterans pursuing traditional four-year degrees at universities. \nHowever, in today's fast paced, high-tech economy, traditional degrees \nmay not always be the best option. Many veterans are pursuing forms of \nnontraditional training, short-term courses often leading to \ncertification in a technical field. In certain fields, these \ncertifications are a prerequisite to employment.\n  These courses, such as Microsoft or Cisco systems training, may be \noffered through training centers, private contractors to community \ncolleges, or the companies themselves. They often last just a few weeks \nor months, and can cost many thousands of dollars. The way MGIB is paid \nout in monthly disbursements is not suited to this course structure. \nFor example, MGIB would pay, at most, $1300 for a two-month course that \npotentially costs $10,000.\n  Even if veterans claimed this small benefit, providers must be \napproved by VA as an educational institution in every State in which \nthey operate in order for MGIB benefits to be paid for coursework. \nBecause veterans would only recoup a small portion of the course cost \nfrom VA, many of the course providers do not undertake the onerous \nprocessing of becoming VA-approved. Therefore, many veterans with MGIB \neligibility are forced to bear the entire costs of these courses. Many \nborrow the funds to pay for them, incurring significant interest \ncharges.\n  I note that last year, in Public Law 106-419, Congress extended MGIB \nbenefits to cover the costs of certification exams that these courses \nprepare veterans to take. I believe that we should take the next \nlogical step and pay for the courses themselves.\n  The percentage of veterans who actually use the MGIB benefits that \nthey have earned and paid for is startlingly low, despite almost full \nenrollment in the program by servicemembers. By increasing the \nflexibility of the MGIB program, we will permit more veterans to take \nadvantage of these benefits. We should give veterans the right to \nchoose what kind of educational program will be best for them.\n  This legislation would modify the payment method to accommodate the \ncompressed schedule of the courses. Specifically, Section 1 would allow \nveterans to receive an accelerated payment equal to 60 percent of the \ncost of the program. This is comparable to VA's MGIB benefit for flight \ntraining, for which VA reimburses 60 percent of the costs. The dollar \nvalue of the accelerated payment would then be deducted from the \nveteran's remaining entitlement. Section 2 would allow courses offered \nby these providers to be covered by MGIB.\n  In closing, I note that many servicemembers leave the military with \nskills that place them in demand for careers in the technology sector. \nBut even these veterans may require coursework to convert their \nmilitary skills to civilian careers. The MGIB must continue to evolve \nto keep pace with the careers and education that today's veterans \nrequire. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the changing \nneeds of our veterans, and to maintain this investment in our veterans \nand our Nation.\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1088\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 7253 of title 38, United States \nCode, to expand temporarily the United States Court of Appeals for \nVeterans Claims in order to further facilitate staggered terms for \njudges on that court, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am today introducing this \nlegislation which attempts to ensure there will be a sufficient number \nof judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims so as to \ndecide the appeals of our Nation's veterans for disability claims. In \naddition, this bill would terminate the Notice of Disagreement \nrequirement in the current law which acts as a bar to appealing cases \nto the court.\n  The U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, CAVC, originally named \nthe Court of Veterans' Appeals, was created in 1988 in the Veterans \nJudicial Review Act, VJRA, to provide judicial review to veterans' \nclaims for benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs. It is \ncomprised of one chief judge and six associate judges.\n  At the court's inception, the terms for judges on the court were not \nstaggered. The original chief judge and six associate judges were \nappointed to 15-year terms within 16 months of one another from 1989 to \n1991. A new judge was appointed in 1997 to fill a vacancy created by \nthe death of one of the\n\n[[Page S6668]]\n\noriginally appointed judges. The chief judge retired in 2000 and his \nseat has not yet been filled. By 2005, the terms of five of the \nremaining judges will end.\n  Because the judges' terms were not staggered, it is very likely that \nthere will be simultaneous vacant seats.\n  In 1998, Congress attempted to preemptively avoid the crisis of \nhaving only two sitting judges, and the resulting backlog of cases, by \noffering some of the original judges an opportunity to retire early. \nHowever, no judges accepted the offer. Therefore, we must again make \nthe effort to solve this problem. The legislation I am introducing \nproposes to do so by allowing two additional judges to be appointed to \nfull terms, in order to bridge the retirement of the original judges.\n  Specifically, this bill would temporarily expand the membership of \nthe court by two judgeships until August 2005, when the last of the \nseven original judges' terms will expire. This expansion should give \nample time for the President to nominate and the Senate to confirm \njudges for the court, and avoid the potentially damaging effects of a \ncourt with only two judges.\n  In addition, this bill would terminate the Notice of Disagreement, \nNOD, as a jurisdictional requirement for review at the court. The NOD \nbegins the appellate process within the VA. The veteran usually sends \nthe NOD to a regional office of the VA, telling the regional office \nthat he disagrees with the regional office's decision, in whole or \npart. This constitutes notice that the veteran is appealing his case to \nthe Board of Veterans' Appeals. When Congress created the court in \n1988, it required claims to have an NOD filed after November 18, 1988, \nthe date of enactment of the VJRA, in order to be appealed to the CAVC. \nThis explicit rule was enacted to keep the new court from becoming \noverwhelmed with appeals.\n  However, many difficulties have arisen with this jurisdictional \nrequirement, due to the complexity of the VA appellate process. \nProblems mainly arise in determining what is the applicable NOD when \nthere are multiple agency decisions and extensive correspondence by the \nclaimants. Also, many cases originated before November 18, 1988, adding \nto the difficulty of determining which NOD confers jurisdiction to the \ncourt. In addition, much litigation has occurred to determine what type \nof writing constitutes an NOD, and the type of language that must be \nused to construe disagreement over the VA's decision.\n  While there has been favorable response to the court, the anticipated \nfloodgates have not opened. Last year the court decided 1,556 claims. \nThis legislation does not confer jurisdiction upon the court on any \nmatter not currently within its jurisdiction. Instead, it is meant to \nfree up the court to determine appeals on the merits. The appellate \nprocess for veterans' claims is long enough without a veteran being \nadditionally burdened to argue over NODs.\n  In closing, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill. \nVeterans appeals already take years, sometimes decades. We must do what \nwe can to avoid increasing the length of the process.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 1116 of title 38, United States \nCode, to modify and extend authorities on the presumption of service-\nconnection for herbicide-related disabilities of Vietnam era veterans, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today \nlegislation that would continue to respond to at least some of the \nconcerns of Vietnam veterans exposed to Agent Orange during their \nservice to this Nation. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague on \nthe Veterans' Affairs Committee, Ranking Minority Member Senator Arlen \nSpecter, and my good friend, Senator Tom Daschle, the Senate majority \nleader and a true champion of Vietnam veterans.\n  In passing the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Congress demonstrated its \ncommitment to securing fair treatment for veterans enduring long-term \nhealth consequences following their service during the Vietnam war. The \nbill before us would continue the systematic scientific reviews that \nhelp us understand these consequences. Provisions in this bill also \nwould extend the presumptive period for Vietnam veterans suffering from \nrespiratory cancers and ease the burden on veterans in proving exposure \nto Agent Orange.\n  The Agent Orange Act of 1991 directed the National Academy of \nSciences, NAS, to review scientific evidence on the health effects of \nexposure to dioxin and other chemicals found in\n\n[[Page S6669]]\n\nherbicides used in Vietnam. The scientific reviews, there have been \nfour thus far, have found evidence of connections between exposure to \ndioxin and diseases such as respiratory cancers, Type 2 diabetes, and \nthe birth defect spina bifida, all currently compensated by the VA as \nservice connected.\n  These reviews will end after 2002 unless we act now. We simply do not \nknow enough about the long-term effects of dioxin exposure to say that \nthe body of scientific evidence is complete. The bill before us would \ndirect the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to extend the existing \nagreement with NAS to provide five more biennial reports.\n  Currently, title 38 of the United States Code allows Vietnam veterans \nwith respiratory cancers to claim benefits for this disease as a \nservice-connected disability, but only if the disease manifested within \n30 years of their service in Vietnam. The most recent NAS report \nconfirmed that there is no scientific basis for assuming that cancers \nlinked to dioxin exposure would occur within a specific window of time.\n  The bill that I am introducing would remove this arbitrary limit, and \nwould restore eligibility for benefits to any Vietnam veterans with \nrespiratory cancers previously denied due to the cutoff. I recently \nlearned of the tragic story of Jerry Slusher from Huntington, WV, a \ndecorated combat veteran of the Vietnam war. While dying of respiratory \ncancer in 1999, Jerry filed for benefits and learned that he might have \nbeen eligible, if only he had been diagnosed just a few months earlier. \nThe men and women who served this Nation, and who struggle with the \nconsequences of that service so many years later, deserve better.\n  Lastly, this bill would give all Vietnam veterans the benefit of the \ndoubt regarding their exposure in Vietnam when claiming benefits for \ndiseases related to Agent Orange exposure. Due to the difficulties in \ndetermining who might have been exposed to Agent Orange, Congress \ndetermined in 1991 that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs should \nconcede exposure to veterans whose military records indicated that they \nserved in Vietnam during the Vietnam era. This presumption eased a \nveteran's burden in qualifying for service-connected benefits.\n  VA subsequently interpreted this law to mean that, if a veteran had \nserved in Vietnam during the war, it should be presumed that the \nveteran was exposed to Agent Orange. However, the United States Court \nof Appeals for Veterans Claims ruled in McCartt v. West (12 Vet. App. \n164[1999]) that VA had interpreted the statute too broadly. This ruling \nlimited the presumption of exposure to Vietnam veterans diagnosed with \none or more of the diseases listed by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs, rather than to any disease claimed by a veteran.\n  As a result, veterans who suffer from diseases not on this list must \ngo about the difficult task of proving exposure to Agent Orange while \nserving in Vietnam, and that the disease resulted from that exposure. \nThis legislation would restore the presumption of exposure for all \nveterans who served in Vietnam during the war.\n  This bill ensures that the system of scientific review and \ndeterminations for presumptive compensation already in place for \nVietnam veterans will continue. We must address these issues promptly \nto continue to assist veterans who have already waited too long for \nanswers. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting \nthis legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nresearch, information, and education with respect to blood cancer; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nMikulski and Senator Murray to offer legislation on a critical health \nresearch issue. When I first started looking into the Federal \ncommitment to these deadly blood cancers, leukemia, lymphoma, and \nmultiple myeloma, I was frankly astonished to learn that, despite the \nfact that these cancers account for 11 percent of all cancer deaths in \nthe U.S., they receive less than 5 percent of the research funding from \nthe National Cancer Institute.\n  That is why I would like to offer legislation today that would \nauthorize an additional $250 million in research at the National \nInstitutes of Health next year, and at least that amount in subsequent \nyears. The bill also contains the specific authorization of $25 million \nnext year to expand public education, outreach, and early detection \nprograms for three of these deadly blood cancers.\n  It is my hope and my expectation that this legislation will serve to \nfocus additional resources on these diseases, as well as to help expand \nthe public's awareness of how deadly and pervasive they can be.\n  I commend the Senators from Maryland and Washington for their support \non this issue and urge other Senators to join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1094\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hematological Cancer \n     Research Investment and Education Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) An estimated 109,500 people in the United States will \n     be diagnosed with leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma in \n     2001.\n       (2) New cases of the blood cancers described in paragraph \n     (1) account for 8.6 percent of new cancer cases.\n       (3) Those devastating blood cancers will cause the deaths \n     of an estimated 60,300 persons in the United States in 2001. \n     Every 9 minutes, a person in the United States dies from \n     leukemia, lymphoma, or multiple myeloma.\n       (4) While less than 5 percent of Federal funds for cancer \n     research are spent on those blood cancers, those blood \n     cancers cause 11 percent of all cancer deaths in the United \n     States.\n       (5) Increased Federal support of research into leukemia, \n     lymphoma, and multiple myeloma has resulted and will continue \n     to result in significant advances in the early detection, the \n     treatment, and ultimately the cure of those blood cancers.\n\n     SEC. 3. RESEARCH, INFORMATION, AND EDUCATION WITH RESPECT TO \n                   BLOOD CANCER.\n\n       (a) Research.--Part B of title IV of the Public Health \n     Service Act (42 U.S.C. 284 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 409I.

Res. 114\n\n       Whereas, On June 25, 1876, the 7th Cavalry of the United \n     States Army, led by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong \n     Custer, fought with a group of Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho \n     Indians camped on the shores of the Little Bighorn River.\n       Whereas, this battle was the result of increasing hostility \n     between the United States and Sioux and Cheyenne tribes over \n     Sioux ownership of the Black Hills and the trespass of non-\n     Indians into the area;\n       Whereas, the Sioux believed the Black Hills, or Paha Sapa, \n     as they called them, to be sacred, a place they traveled to \n     in order to have visions and pray;\n       Whereas, the United States and Sioux leaders agreed to the \n     Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868, securing to the Sioux the \n     ownership of the Black Hills forever, and pledging to aid and \n     assist in keeping trespassers away from the Black Hills;\n       Whereas, the United States violated the Treaty of Fort \n     Laramie in 1874 by sending, without the permission of the \n     Sioux, a reconnaissance mission to the Black Hills, led by \n     General George Armstrong Custer;\n       Whereas, tensions were rising in Sioux Country, where the \n     tribes were becoming increasingly unsettled, and feared the \n     loss of Sioux Country and their way of life;\n       Whereas, the Battle at Little Bighorn was preceded by two \n     military engagements, occurring on March 17, 1876, and June \n     17, 1876;\n       Whereas, after the second engagement, now known as the \n     Battle at Rosebud, the Sioux and Cheyenne moved their \n     encampment from the Rosebud River to the Little Bighorn \n     River;\n       Whereas, Lieutenant Colonel Custer, along with 650 soldiers \n     and scouts, was dispatched to scout for the Indians along the \n     Rosebud and Little Bighorn Rivers;\n       Whereas, on the morning of June 25, 1876, Lieutenant \n     Colonel Custer discovered the Indian encampment of \n     approximately 10,000 on the shore of the Little Bighorn River \n     and determined to engage in a battle with them;\n       Whereas, Lieutenant Colonel Custer's forces, upon \n     attempting to engage the Indian warriors at the shore of the \n     Little Bighorn River, were forced back up the ridge from \n     which they attacked and forced west, and were overwhelmed by \n     Indian forces;\n       Whereas, the 201 men under the command of Lieutenant \n     Colonel Custer were killed and the total losses suffered by \n     the U.S. Army numbered 258;\n       Whereas, the Sioux and Cheyenne, led by Sitting Bull, Crazy \n     Horse, and Gall, suffered losses of approximately 58;\n       Whereas, the Battle of Little Bighorn occupies a legendary \n     place in American history, a tragic clash of two cultures \n     leading to the demise of the traditional Indian way of life, \n     and the end of the era known in American history as the \n     ``Indian Wars'';\n       Resolved, that the Senate,\n       (1) honors the memory of those who died in the battle, the \n     Indians fighting for a way of life that they believed in, the \n     cavalry troops fighting for a young nation in which they \n     believed;\n       (2) recognizes June 25th, 2001 as the 125th Anniversary of \n     the Battle of Little Bighorn;\n       (3) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL: Mr. President, next Monday, June 25th, marks the 125 \nanniversary of the Battle of Little Bighorn, an event which occupies \nnear-mythical significance in the American psyche and one that is \nrepresentative of an era past in the American West.\n  In 1990, I introduced legislation which changed the American \nperspective of the Battle of Little Bighorn. The bill, which latter \nbecame Public Law 102-201, achieved two key goals: First, it changed \nthe name of the Custer Battlefield National Monument to Little Bighorn \nBattlefield National Monument. Additionally, it directed that a \nmonument be designed and built which commemorated the American Indian \nindividuals who died in the Battle of Little Bighorn.\n  When I began the process for changing the name of the Little Bighorn \nBattlefield National Monument, my purpose was not to scour and rewrite \nhistory but to provide a small measure of justice to the American \nIndians who died there, protecting their families, their property, and \ntheir way of life. Ultimately, the name change signified a shift in \nattitude about the way our Nation views the Battle of Little Bighorn.\n  Now, instead of the scene of a bloody battle in which U.S. troops \nwere entirely decimated while ``fighting brutal savages who stood in \nthe way of westward progress'' as some early reports described it, the \nname now represents what really happened 125 years ago, the inevitable \nand tragic clash of two cultures and the end of an era.\n  The Battle of the Little Bighorn, while known as the greatest victory \nof a group of American Indians over the U.S. Army during the period \nknown as the Indian Wars, also marks the beginning of the demise of the \nwestern American Indian peoples in the United States, their loss of \nfreedom, and the end of their traditional way of life.\n  Today I introduce a resolution that would commemorate the 125th \nanniversary of the battle and honor the memory of all who died in that \nepic battle, Indian and non-Indian alike, for they all believed in what \nthey fought for and they all made the ultimate sacrifice for their \nrespective cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6670-S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 115--RESOLUTION ENCOURAGING A LASTING CEASE-FIRE IN \nMACEDONIA, COMMENDING THE PARTIES FOR SEEKING A POLITICAL SOLUTION, AND \n                           FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Biden) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                               S. Res. 115\n\n       Whereas, the political, economic, and social situation in \n     Macedonia has steadily deteriorated since February 2001;\n       Whereas, ongoing fighting between the National Liberation \n     Army and the Government of Macedonia presents a clear and \n     present danger to the viability of Macedonia;\n       Whereas, a Macedonian civil war exacerbates tensions in the \n     region and could trigger additional incidents of violence in \n     the Balkans;\n       Whereas, the ongoing fighting has displaced at least 18,000 \n     people inside Macedonia, and forced another 40,000 people to \n     flee into neighboring countries;\n       Whereas, political parties in Macedonia are negotiating a \n     political solution to the current crisis;\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\n       Whereas, a cease-fire and dialogue between the parties are \n     essential to preventing full scale inter-ethnic warfare in \n     Macedonia; and\n       Whereas, a unified and independent Macedonia is in United \n     States national security interests: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) encourages a lasting cease-fire, and calls upon the \n     Government of Macedonia to ensure the protection of the lives \n     and property of all citizens of Macedonia;\n       (2) commends the political parties in Macedonia for seeking \n     a political solution to the current crisis, and encourages a \n     continued commitment to dialogue by those parties;\n       (3) calls upon the Government of Macedonia to address the \n     concerns of all citizens of Macedonia in a fair and equitable \n     manner;\n       (4) recognizes that the United States and other countries \n     must assume a more pro-active role in aiding the Government \n     of Macedonia and the political parties in Macedonia to secure \n     and maintain a lasting solution to the conflict; and\n       (5) pledges its support for additional United States \n     assistance for programs and activities that contribute to \n     reconstruction in Macedonia and a resolution of inter-ethnic \n     tensions in that country.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy, Senator Biden, and I \nsubmit this resolution as an indication of our support and \nencouragement for continued negotiations between ethnic-Albanian and \nMacedonian political parties. A unified and independent Macedonia is in \nthe best interests of all the citizens of Macedonia, neighboring \ncountries, and the United States.\n  The news this morning of renewed fighting in the wake of stalled \ntalks is deeply troubling. Continued armed conflict serves only to \nexacerbate an already difficult and tense situation. American \nleadership and engagement is essential in resolving the current crisis. \nWe must be clear: a lasting cease-fire and peace can only be secured \nthrough dialogue and disarmament.\n  Frustrations on both sides of the negotiating table are growing \ndaily. However difficult and dire the situation may seem today, it will \nonly get worse if the talks completely collapse. The stakes are indeed \nhigh, and call for cooler heads and responsible, and responsive, \nleadership.\n  Make no mistake, the long standing and legitimate grievances of \nethnic-Albanians must be on the table for discussion, and successful \nresolution. While the rights and lives of all Macedonian citizens must \nbe protected and guaranteed, Macedonian officials must be particularly \nvigilant in ensuring that ethnic-Albanians are not targeted for \nretribution, as has unfortunately been the case in the past. The \nfoundation of peace and stability is nothing less than equality for all \ncitizens of Macedonia under the law and genuine respect for democratic \nprocesses, institutions, and the rule of law.\n  We hope that all parties at the negotiation table in Skopje \nunderstand that in their hands rests the fate of the country. We stand \nready to support U.S.-funded programs and activities that contribute to \nthe reconstruction and a resolution of inter-ethnic tensions in \nMacedonia.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution \non Macedonia, with my friend from Kentucky, Senator McConnell.\n  Macedonia stands out as the country in the Balkans which, until \nrecently, avoided the bloodshed and destruction that engulfed the rest \nof the former Yugoslavia throughout much of the past decade. In \nMacedonia, ethnic Macedonians and Albanians have lived peacefully \ntogether.\n  But recently, a small number of Albanian fighters have resorted to \nviolence. Some have demanded a separate Albanian state. Others are \ninterested in nothing more than control over smuggling routes in and \nout of Macedonia. Still others are from Kosovo, and are using Macedonia \nas a staging ground to focus international attention on their \ngrievances in Kosovo.\n  But there are others who have taken up arms who represent the \naspirations of the larger community of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia, \nwho have been the victims of discrimination in their own country, or \nwhat is now Macedonia, for generations.\n  Albanians comprise approximately one third of the population of \nMacedonia, but they hold only a fraction of government positions. There \nare no public institutions of higher learning where Albanian language \nis taught or spoken. Albanians are not recognized in Macedonia's \nConstitution.\n  The ethnic Albanian's grievances are legitimate, and must be \naddressed. The ethnic Macedonians also have rights, which must be \nrespected.\n  Recently, the leaders of a coalition government, representing ethnic \nMacedonian and Albanian political parties, have met to try to find a \npolitical settlement of the conflict. Both sides have acknowledged that \nthere is no military solution, and that a civil war would be \ndevastating for the country. But after a week of negotiations they have \nmade little progress, and the talks have reportedly reached an impasse. \nThat is unacceptable. There is no other way to avoid a wider war than \nthrough dialogue. The United States has offered support, but not as \nvigorously as I believe it should. The leaders of the European Union \nhave also invested considerable time and energy in search of peace.\n  NATO is prepared to assist in implementing a peace agreement, as it \nshould, but the parties in Macedonia need to recognize that the United \nStates will not intervene militarily, nor will we finance a war on \nbehalf of either side. To think otherwise would be both unrealistic and \npointless. The United States would support a political settlement that \nupholds the rights of all citizens of Macedonia, regardless of \nethnicity, and which preserves the political and geographical integrity \nof the country.\n  This resolution calls attention to the importance of the situation in \nMacedonia, for the Balkans region, for Europe, and for the United \nStates. This is a solvable problem, and it would be unforgivable if, \nwhat is still a relatively low intensity, localized conflict, erupted \ninto full-scale civil war. The administration needs to give this \nprecarious situation far more attention than it has thus far. We have \nan ambassador there who is doing his best, but it is not enough. Higher \nlevel diplomacy is needed, and it is needed urgently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/06/22/senate-section/article/S6671-1", "month": "06", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 54--AUTHORIZING THE ROTUNDA OF THE CAPITOL \n TO BE USED ON JULY 26, 2001, FOR A CEREMONY TO PRESENT CONGRESSIONAL \n           GOLD MEDALS TO THE ORIGINAL 29 NAVAJO CODE TALKERS\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Lott) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

As a result, 9 out of \n     every 10 school districts in the country receive some form of \n     aid under the Formula.\n       (3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least \n     some funding under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, including many suburban schools with \n     predominantly well-off students.\n       (4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor \n     students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all \n     under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965.\n       (5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, \n     Congress declared that grants under title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 would more sharply target \n     high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant Formula, but \n     annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of that \n     Formula.\n       (6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other \n     funding formulas under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 is that the Targeted Grant \n     Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the \n     percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school \n     district increases.\n       (7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's family \n     is much more likely to be associated with educational \n     disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large \n     concentrations of poor families.\n       (8) States with large populations of high poverty students \n     would receive significantly more funding if more funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.\n       (9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     so that such funds will positively affect the largest number \n     of economically disadvantaged students.\n       (b) Limitation on Allocation of Title I Funds Contingent on \n     Adequate Funding of Targeted Grants.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the total amount allocated in any \n     fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for programs and \n     activities under part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) may \n     not exceed the amount allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such \n     programs and activities unless the amount available for \n     targeted grants to local educational agencies under section \n     1125 of that Act (20 U.S.C. 6335) in the applicable fiscal \n     year is sufficient to meet the purposes of grants under \n     that section.\n\n               PART B--LITERACY FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES\n\n     SEC. 121.

Further, rural areas often cannot \n     support specialized schools, such as magnet or charter \n     schools.\n       ``(2) Technology can offer rural students educational and \n     employment opportunities that they otherwise would not have.\n       ``(3) Schools in rural and small towns receive \n     disproportionately less funding than their urban \n     counterparts, necessitating that such schools receive \n     additional assistance to implement technology curriculum.\n       ``(4) In the future, workers without technology skills run \n     the risk of being excluded from the new global, technological \n     economy.\n       ``(5) Teaching technology in rural schools is vitally \n     important because it creates an employee pool for employers \n     sorely in need of information technology specialists.\n       ``(6) A qualified workforce can attract information \n     technology employers to rural areas and help bridge the \n     digital divide between rural and urban American that is \n     evidenced by the out-migration and economic decline typical \n     of many rural areas.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part to give \n     rural schools comprehensive assistance to train the \n     technology literate workforce needed to bridge the rural-\n     urban digital divide.\n\n     ``SEC. 2703.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) Native Hawaiians are a distinct and unique indigenous \n     people with a historical continuity to the original \n     inhabitants of the Hawaiian archipelago, whose society was \n     organized as a nation and internationally recognized as a \n     nation by the United States, Britain, France, and Japan, as \n     evidenced by treaties governing friendship, commerce, and \n     navigation.\n       ``(2) At the time of the arrival of the first non-\n     indigenous people in Hawai`i in 1778, the Native Hawaiian \n     people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient \n     subsistence social system based on a communal land tenure \n     system with a sophisticated language, culture, and religion.\n       ``(3) A unified monarchal government of the Hawaiian \n     Islands was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, the first \n     King of Hawai`i.\n       ``(4) From 1826 until 1893, the United States recognized \n     the sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, \n     which was established in 1810 under Kamehameha I, extended \n     full and complete diplomatic recognition to the Kingdom of \n     Hawai`i, and entered into treaties and conventions with the \n     Kingdom of Hawai`i to govern friendship, commerce and \n     navigation in 1826, 1842, 1849, 1875, and 1887.\n       ``(5) In 1893, the sovereign, independent, internationally \n     recognized, and indigenous government of Hawai`i, the Kingdom \n     of Hawai`i, was overthrown by a small group of non-Hawaiians, \n     including United States citizens, who were assisted in their \n     efforts by the United States Minister, a United States naval \n     representative, and\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\n     armed naval forces of the United States. Because of the \n     participation of United States agents and citizens in the \n     overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i, in 1993 the United \n     States apologized to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow and \n     the deprivation of the rights of Native Hawaiians to self-\n     determination through Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 1510).\n       ``(6) In 1898, the joint resolution entitled `Joint \n     Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to \n     the United States', approved July 7, 1898 (30 Stat. 750), \n     ceded absolute title of all lands held by the Republic of \n     Hawai`i, including the government and crown lands of the \n     former Kingdom of Hawai`i, to the United States, but mandated \n     that revenue generated from the lands be used `solely for the \n     benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands for \n     educational and other public purposes'.\n       ``(7) By 1919, the Native Hawaiian population had declined \n     from an estimated 1,000,000 in 1778 to an alarming 22,600, \n     and in recognition of this severe decline, Congress enacted \n     the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920 (42 Stat. 108), which \n     designated approximately 200,000 acres of ceded public lands \n     for homesteading by Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(8) Through the enactment of the Hawaiian Homes \n     Commission Act, 1920, Congress affirmed the special \n     relationship between the United States and the Native \n     Hawaiians, which was described by then Secretary of the \n     Interior Franklin K. Lane, who said: `One thing that \n     impressed me . . . was the fact that the natives of the \n     island who are our wards, I should say, and for whom in a \n     sense we are trustees, are falling off rapidly in numbers and \n     many of them are in poverty.'.\n       ``(9) In 1938, Congress again acknowledged the unique \n     status of the Hawaiian people by including in the Act of June \n     20, 1938 (52 Stat. 781, chapter 530; 16 U.S.C. 391b, 391b-1, \n     392b, 392c, 396, 396a), a provision to lease lands within the \n     National Parks extension to Native Hawaiians and to permit \n     fishing in the area `only by native Hawaiian residents of \n     said area or of adjacent villages and by visitors under their \n     guidance.'.\n       ``(10) Under the Act entitled `An Act to provide for the \n     admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', approved \n     March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), the United States transferred \n     responsibility for the administration of the Hawaiian Home \n     Lands to the State of Hawai`i but reaffirmed the trust \n     relationship between the United States and the Hawaiian \n     people by retaining the exclusive power to enforce the trust, \n     including the power to approve land exchanges and amendments \n     to such Act affecting the rights of beneficiaries under such \n     Act.\n       ``(11) In 1959, under the Act entitled `An Act to provide \n     for the admission of the State of Hawai`i into the Union', \n     the United States also ceded to the State of Hawai`i title to \n     the public lands formerly held by the United States, but \n     mandated that such lands be held by the State `in public \n     trust' and reaffirmed the special relationship that existed \n     between the United States and the Hawaiian people by \n     retaining the legal responsibility to enforce the public \n     trust responsibility of the State of Hawai`i for the \n     betterment of the conditions of Native Hawaiians, as defined \n     in section 201(a) of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act, 1920.\n       ``(12) The United States has recognized and reaffirmed \n     that--\n       ``(A) Native Hawaiians have a cultural, historic, and land-\n     based link to the indigenous people who exercised sovereignty \n     over the Hawaiian Islands, and that group has never \n     relinquished its claims to sovereignty or its sovereign \n     lands;\n       ``(B) Congress does not extend services to Native Hawaiians \n     because of their race, but because of their unique status as \n     the indigenous people of a once sovereign nation as to whom \n     the United States has established a trust relationship;\n       ``(C) Congress has also delegated broad authority to \n     administer a portion of the Federal trust responsibility to \n     the State of Hawai`i;\n       ``(D) the political status of Native Hawaiians is \n     comparable to that of American Indians and Alaska Natives; \n     and\n       ``(E) the aboriginal, indigenous people of the United \n     States have--\n       ``(i) a continuing right to autonomy in their internal \n     affairs; and\n       ``(ii) an ongoing right of self-determination and self-\n     governance that has never been extinguished.\n       ``(13) The political relationship between the United States \n     and the Native Hawaiian people has been recognized and \n     reaffirmed by the United States, as evidenced by the \n     inclusion of Native Hawaiians in--\n       ``(A) the Native American Programs Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. \n     2991 et seq.);\n       ``(B) the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1996);\n       ``(C) the National Museum of the American Indian Act (20 \n     U.S.C. 80q et seq.);\n       ``(D) the Native American Graves Protection and \n     Repatriation Act (25 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.);\n       ``(E) the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.);\n       ``(F) the Native American Languages Act (25 U.S.C. 2901 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(G) the American Indian, Alaska Native, and Native \n     Hawaiian Culture and Art Development Act (20 U.S.C. 4401 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(H) the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2801 \n     et seq.); and\n       ``(I) the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3001 et \n     seq.).\n       ``(14) In 1981, Congress instructed the Office of Education \n     to submit to Congress a comprehensive report on Native \n     Hawaiian education. The report, entitled the `Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project', was released in 1983 and \n     documented that Native Hawaiians scored below parity with \n     regard to national norms on standardized achievement tests, \n     were disproportionately represented in many negative social \n     and physical statistics indicative of special educational \n     needs, and had educational needs that were related to their \n     unique cultural situation, such as different learning styles \n     and low self-image.\n       ``(15) In recognition of the educational needs of Native \n     Hawaiians, in 1988, Congress enacted title IV of the Augustus \n     F. Hawkins-Robert T. Stafford Elementary and Secondary School \n     Improvement Amendments of 1988 (102 Stat. 130) to authorize \n     and develop supplemental educational programs to address the \n     unique conditions of Native Hawaiians.\n       ``(16) In 1993, the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     released a 10-year update of findings of the Native Hawaiian \n     Educational Assessment Project, which found that despite the \n     successes of the programs established under title IV of the \n     Augustus F.

Stafford Elementary and \n     Secondary School Improvement Amendments of 1988, many of the \n     same educational needs still existed for Native Hawaiians. \n     Subsequent reports by the Kamehameha Schools Bishop Estate \n     and other organizations have generally confirmed those \n     findings. For example--\n       ``(A) educational risk factors continue to start even \n     before birth for many Native Hawaiian children, including--\n       ``(i) late or no prenatal care;\n       ``(ii) high rates of births by Native Hawaiian women who \n     are unmarried; and\n       ``(iii) high rates of births to teenage parents;\n       ``(B) Native Hawaiian students continue to begin their \n     school experience lagging behind other students in terms of \n     readiness factors such as vocabulary test scores;\n       ``(C) Native Hawaiian students continue to score below \n     national norms on standardized education achievement tests at \n     all grade levels;\n       ``(D) both public and private schools continue to show a \n     pattern of lower percentages of Native Hawaiian students in \n     the uppermost achievement levels and in gifted and talented \n     programs;\n       ``(E) Native Hawaiian students continue to be \n     overrepresented among students qualifying for special \n     education programs provided to students with learning \n     disabilities, mild mental retardation, emotional impairment, \n     and other such disabilities;\n       ``(F) Native Hawaiians continue to be underrepresented in \n     institutions of higher education and among adults who have \n     completed 4 or more years of college;\n       ``(G) Native Hawaiians continue to be disproportionately \n     represented in many negative social and physical statistics \n     indicative of special educational needs, as demonstrated by \n     the fact that--\n       ``(i) Native Hawaiian students are more likely to be \n     retained in grade level and to be excessively absent in \n     secondary school;\n       ``(ii) Native Hawaiian students have the highest rates of \n     drug and alcohol use in the State of Hawai`i; and\n       ``(iii) Native Hawaiian children continue to be \n     disproportionately victimized by child abuse and neglect; and\n       ``(H) Native Hawaiians now comprise over 23 percent of the \n     students served by the State of Hawai`i Department of \n     Education, and there are and will continue to be \n     geographically rural, isolated areas with a high Native \n     Hawaiian population density.\n       ``(17) In the 1998 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress, Hawaiian fourth-graders ranked 39th among groups of \n     students from 39 States in reading. Given that Hawaiian \n     students rank among the lowest groups of students nationally \n     in reading, and that Native Hawaiian students rank the lowest \n     among Hawaiian students in reading, it is imperative that \n     greater focus be placed on beginning reading and early \n     education and literacy in Hawai`i.\n       ``(18) The findings described in paragraphs (16) and (17) \n     are inconsistent with the high rates of literacy and \n     integration of traditional culture and Western education \n     historically achieved by Native Hawaiians through a Hawaiian \n     language-based public school system established in 1840 by \n     Kamehameha III.\n       ``(19) Following the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai`i in \n     1893, Hawaiian medium schools were banned.

Native performance on \n     standardized tests is low, Native student dropout rates are \n     high, and Natives are significantly underrepresented among \n     holders of baccalaureate degrees in the State of Alaska. As a \n     result, Native students are being denied their opportunity to \n     become full participants in society by grade school and high \n     school educations that are condemning an entire generation to \n     an underclass status and a life of limited choices.\n       ``(5) The programs authorized in this title, combined with \n     expanded Head Start, infant learning and early childhood \n     education programs, and parent education programs are \n     essential if educational handicaps are to be overcome.\n       ``(6) The sheer magnitude of the geographic barriers to be \n     overcome in delivering educational services in rural Alaska \n     and Alaska villages should be addressed through the \n     development and implementation of innovative, model programs \n     in a variety of areas.\n       ``(7) Congress finds that Native children should be \n     afforded the opportunity to begin their formal education on a \n     par with their non-Native peers.

HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FULLY FUNDING THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT \n                   (IDEA).\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education and general education teachers, \n     related services personnel, and other school personnel. \n     Congress recognizes concerns about the nationwide shortage of \n     personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for \n     improvement in the qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 15 percent of the maximum State \n     grant allocation for educating children with disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n       (b) Local Educational Agency Eligibility.--Clauses (i) and \n     (ii) of section 613(a)(2)(C) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(2)(C)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\n     amounts appropriated to carry out section 611 exceeds \n     $4,100,000,000, a local educational agency may treat as local \n     funds, for the purpose of such clauses, up to 55 percent of \n     the amount of funds it receives under this part that exceeds \n     the amount it received under this part for fiscal year 2001, \n     except where a local educational agency shows that it is \n     meeting the requirements of this part, the local educational \n     agency may petition the State to waive, in whole or in part, \n     the 55 percent cap under this clause.\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary \n     determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the Secretary may prohibit the \n     local educational agency from treating funds received under \n     this part as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal \n     year, and may redirect the use of those funds to other \n     educational programs within the local educational agency.''.\n       (c) Funding.--Section 611(j) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(j)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(j)

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING EDUCATION \n                   OPPORTUNITY TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Improving the education of our children is an essential \n     and important responsibility facing this country.\n       (2) Strong parental involvement is a cornerstone for \n     academic success; it is parents who know and understand the \n     special, individual needs of their own children.\n       (3) Advanced technology has fueled unprecedented economic \n     growth and positively transformed the way Americans conduct \n     business and communicate with each other.\n       (4) Families will need ready access to the technical tools \n     and skills necessary for their school age children to succeed \n     in the classroom and the increasingly competitive \n     international marketplace.\n       (5) Studies have shown that the presence of a computer in \n     the home has a positive impact on a student's level of \n     academic achievement and performance in school.\n       (6) Tax relief, enabling the purchase of technology and \n     tutorial services for K-12 education purposes, would \n     significantly help defray the cost of education expenses by: \n     Empowering families financially and increasing education \n     spending; allowing families to provide their children access \n     to a far greater range of educational opportunities suited to \n     their individual needs; and bridging the digital divide.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should--\n       (1) act expeditiously to pass legislation in the First \n     Session of the One Hundred Seventh Congress that provides tax \n     relief to parents of K-12 students for the cost of their \n     children's education-related expenses, specifically, \n     computers, peripherals and computer-related technology, \n     educational software, Internet access and tutoring services; \n     and\n       (2) that such tax relief would not apply toward the cost of \n     private school tuition.\n\n     SEC. 1005. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TAX RELIEF FOR \n                   ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The average salary for an elementary and secondary \n     school teacher in the United States with a Master's degree \n     and 16 years of experience is approximately $40,582.\n       (2) The average starting salary for teachers in the United \n     States is $26,000.\n       (3) Our educators make many personal and financial \n     sacrifices to educate our youth.\n       (4) Teachers spend on average $408 a year, out of their own \n     money, to bring educational supplies into their classrooms.\n       (5) Educators spend significant money out of their own \n     pocket every year on professional development expenses so \n     they can better educate our youth.\n       (6) Many educators accrue significant higher education \n     student loans that must be repaid and whereas these loans are \n     accrued by educators in order for them to obtain degrees \n     necessary to become qualified to serve in our Nation's \n     schools.\n       (7) As a result of these numerous out of pocket expenses \n     that our teachers spend every year, and other factors, 6 \n     percent of the Nation's teaching force leaves the profession \n     every year, and 20 percent of all new hires leave the \n     teaching profession within three years.\n       (8) This country is in the midst of a teacher shortage, \n     with estimates that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed \n     by 2009 because of teacher attrition, teacher retirement, and \n     increased student enrollment.\n       (9) The Federal Government can and should play a role to \n     help alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage.\n       (10) The current tax code provides little recognition of \n     the fact that our educators spend significant money out of \n     their own pocket to better the education of our children.\n       (11) President Bush has recognized the importance of \n     providing teachers with additional tax relief, in recognition \n     of the many financial sacrifices our teachers make.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should pass legislation providing elementary \n     and secondary level educators with additional tax relief in \n     recognition of the many out of pocket, unreimbursed expenses \n     educators incur to improve the education of our Nation's \n     students.\n\n     SEC. 1006.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING POSTAL RATES FOR \n                   EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President and Congress both agree that education is \n     of the highest domestic priority;\n       (2) access to education is a basic right for all Americans \n     regardless of age, race, economic status or geographic \n     boundary;\n       (3) reading is the foundation of all educational pursuits;\n       (4) the objective of schools, libraries, literacy programs, \n     and early childhood development programs is to promote \n     reading skills and prepare individuals for a productive role \n     in our society;\n       (5) individuals involved in the activities described in \n     paragraph (4) are less likely to be drawn into negative \n     social behavior such as alcohol and drug abuse and criminal \n     activity;\n       (6) a highly educated workforce in America is directly tied \n     to a strong economy and our national security;\n       (7) the increase in postal rates by the United States \n     Postal Service in the year 2000 for such reading materials \n     sent for these purposes was substantially more than the \n     increase for any other class of mail and threatens the \n     affordability and future distribution of such materials;\n       (8) failure to provide affordable access to reading \n     materials would seriously limit the fair and universal \n     distribution of books and classroom publications to schools, \n     libraries, literacy programs and early childhood development \n     programs; and\n       (9) the Postal Service has the discretionary authority to \n     set postal rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that, since educational materials sent to schools, libraries, \n     literacy programs, and early childhood development programs \n     received the highest postal rate increase in the year 2000 \n     rate case, the United States Postal Service should freeze the \n     rates for those materials.\n\n[[Page S6789]]\n\n     SEC. 1015.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL \n                   EDUCATION FUNDING THAT IS SPENT IN THE \n                   CLASSROOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Effective and meaningful teaching begins by helping \n     children master basic academics, holding children to high \n     academic standards, using sound research based methods of \n     instruction in the classroom, engaging and involving parents, \n     establishing and maintaining safe and orderly classrooms, and \n     getting funds to the classroom.\n       (2) America's children deserve an educational system that \n     provides them with numerous opportunities to excel.\n       (3) States and localities spend a significant amount of \n     education tax dollars on bureaucratic red tape by applying \n     for and administering Federal education dollars.\n       (4) Several States have reported that although they receive \n     less than 10 percent of their education funding from the \n     Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their education \n     paperwork and administration efforts are associated with \n     those Federal funds.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, in 1998, 84 \n     percent of the funds allocated by the Department for \n     elementary and secondary education were allocated to local \n     educational agencies and used for instruction and \n     instructional support.\n       (6) The remainder of the funds allocated by the Department \n     of Education for elementary and secondary education in 1998 \n     was allocated to States, universities, national programs, and \n     other service providers.\n       (7) The total spent by the Department of Education for \n     elementary and secondary education does not take into account \n     what States spend to receive Federal funds and comply with \n     Federal requirements for elementary and secondary education, \n     nor does it reflect the percentage of Federal funds allocated \n     to school districts that is spent on students in the \n     classroom.\n       (8) American students are not performing up to their full \n     academic potential, despite significant Federal education \n     initiatives and funding from a variety of Federal agencies.\n       (9) According to the Digest of Education Statistics, only \n     54 percent of $278,965,657,000 spent on elementary and \n     secondary education during the 1995-96 school year was spent \n     on ``instruction''.\n       (10) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, only 52 percent of staff employed in public \n     elementary and secondary school systems in 1996 were \n     teachers, and, according to the General Accounting Office, \n     Federal education dollars funded 13,397 full-time equivalent \n     positions in State educational agencies in fiscal year 1993.\n       (11) In fiscal year 1998, the paperwork and data reporting \n     requirements of the Department of Education amounted to \n     40,000,000 so-called ``burden hours'', which is equivalent to \n     nearly 20,000 people working 40 hours a week for one full \n     year, time and energy which would be better spent teaching \n     children in the classroom.\n       (12) Too large a percentage of Federal education funds is \n     spent on bureaucracy, special interests, and ineffective \n     programs, and too little is effectively and efficiently spent \n     on our America's youth.\n       (13) Requiring an allocation of 95 percent of all Federal \n     elementary and secondary education funds to classrooms would \n     provide substantial additional funding per classroom across \n     the United States.\n       (14) More education funding should be put in the hands of \n     someone in a classroom who knows the children personally and \n     frequently interacts with the children.\n       (15) Burdensome regulations, requirements, and mandates \n     should be refined, consolidated or removed so that school \n     districts can devote more resources to educating children in \n     classrooms.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to \n     urge the Department of Education, the States, and local \n     educational agencies to work together to ensure that not less \n     than 95 percent of all funds appropriated for carrying out \n     elementary and secondary education programs administered by \n     the Department be spent to improve the academic achievement \n     of our children in their classrooms.\n\n     SEC. 1018.

DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE ACCESS \n                   OF ARMED FORCES RECRUITERS TO STUDENT DIRECTORY \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Service in the Armed Forces of the United States is \n     voluntary.\n       (2) Recruiting quality persons in the numbers necessary to \n     maintain the strengths of the Armed Forces authorized by \n     Congress is vital to the United States national defense.\n       (3) Recruiting quality servicemembers is very challenging, \n     and as a result, Armed Forces recruiters must devote \n     extraordinary time and effort to their work in order to fill \n     monthly requirements for immediate accessions.\n       (4) In meeting goals for recruiting high quality men and \n     women, each of the Armed Forces faces intense competition \n     from the other Armed Forces, from the private sector, and \n     from institutions offering postsecondary education.\n       (5) Despite a variety of innovative approaches taken by \n     recruiters, and the extensive benefits that are available to \n     those who join the Armed Forces, it is becoming increasingly \n     difficult for the Armed Forces to meet recruiting goals.\n       (6) A number of high schools across the country have denied \n     recruiters access to students or to student directory \n     information.\n       (7) In 1999, the Army was denied access to students or \n     student directories on 4,515 occasions, the Navy was denied \n     access to students or student directories on 4,364 occasions, \n     the Marine Corps was denied access to students or student \n     directories on 4,884 occasions, and the Air Force was denied \n     access to students or student directories on 5,465 occasions.\n       (8) As of the beginning of 2000, nearly 25 percent of all \n     high schools in the United States did not release student \n     directory information requested by Armed Forces recruiters.\n       (9) In testimony presented to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate, recruiters stated that the single \n     biggest obstacle to carrying out the recruiting mission was \n     denial of access to student directory information, as the \n     student directory is the basic tool of the recruiter.\n       (10) Denying recruiters direct access to students and to \n     student directory information unfairly hurts the youth of the \n     United States, as it prevents students from receiving \n     important information on the education and training benefits \n     offered by the Armed Forces and impairs students' \n     decisionmaking on careers by limiting the information on the \n     options available to them.\n       (11) Denying recruiters direct access to students and to \n     student directory information undermines United States \n     national defense, and makes it more difficult to recruit high \n     quality young Americans in numbers sufficient to maintain the \n     readiness of the Armed Forces and to provide for the national \n     security.\n       (12) Section 503 of title 10, United States Code, requires \n     local educational agencies, as of July 1, 2002, to provide \n     recruiters access to secondary schools on the same basis that \n     those agencies provide access to representatives of colleges, \n     universities, and private sector employers.\n       (b) Campaign to Promote Access.--\n       (1) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, each State shall transmit to the \n     Secretary of Education a list of each school, if any, in that \n     State that--\n       (A) during the 12 months preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act, has denied access to students or to student \n     directory information to a military recruiter; or\n       (B) has in effect a policy to deny access to students or to \n     student directory information to military recruiters.\n       (2) Education program.--\n       (A) In general.--The Secretary of Education, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Defense, shall, not later \n     than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act, make \n     awards to States and schools using no more than $3,000,000 of \n     funds available under section 6205(c) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act to educate principals, school \n     administrators, and other educators regarding career \n     opportunities in the Armed Forces, and the access standard \n     required under section 503 of title 10, United States Code.\n       (B) Targeted schools.--In selecting schools for awards \n     required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall give \n     priority to selecting schools that are included on the lists \n     transmitted to Congress under paragraph (1).\n\n     SEC. 1025.

Nevertheless, EPA cannot guarantee that \n     registered\n\n[[Page S6794]]\n\n     pesticides do not pose risks, and unnecessary exposure to \n     pesticides should be avoided. Based in part on \n     recommendations of a 1993 study by the National Academy of \n     Sciences that reviewed registered pesticides and their \n     potential to cause unreasonable adverse effects on human \n     health, particularly on the health of pregnant women, \n     infants, and children, Congress enacted the Food Quality \n     Protection Act of 1996. That law requires EPA to reevaluate \n     all registered pesticides and new pesticides to measure their \n     safety, taking into account the unique exposures and \n     sensitivity that pregnant women, infants, and children may \n     have to pesticides.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the `Ready to \n     Learn, Ready to Teach Act of 2001'.\n       ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) In 1994, Congress and the Department collaborated to \n     make a long-term, meaningful and public investment in the \n     principle that high quality preschool television programming \n     will help children be ready to learn by the time the children \n     entered first grade.\n       ``(2) The Ready to Learn Television Program through the \n     Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and local public television \n     stations has proven to be an extremely cost-effective \n     national response to improving early childhood cognitive \n     development and helping parents, caregivers, and professional \n     child care providers learn how to use television as a means \n     to help children learn and develop social skills and values.\n       ``(3) Independent research shows that parents who \n     participate in Ready to Learn workshops are more selective of \n     the programs that they choose for their children, limit the \n     number of hours of television viewing of their children, and \n     use the television programs as a catalyst for learning.\n       ``(4) The Ready to Learn (RTL) Television Program is \n     supporting and creating commercial-free broadcast programs \n     for young children that are of the highest possible \n     educational quality.\n       ``(5) Through the Nation's 350 local public television \n     stations, these programs and other programming elements reach \n     tens of millions of children, their parents, and caregivers \n     without regard to their economic circumstances, location, or \n     access to cable. Public television is a partner with Federal \n     policy to make television an instrument of preschool \n     children's education and early development.\n       ``(6) The Ready to Learn Television Program supports \n     thousands of local workshops organized and run by local \n     public television stations, child care service providers, \n     Head Start Centers, Even Start family literacy centers and \n     schools. These workshops have trained 630,587 parents and \n     professionals who, in turn, serve and support over 6,312,000 \n     children across the Nation.\n       ``(7) The Ready to Learn Television Program has published \n     and distributed a periodic magazine entitled `PBS Families' \n     that contains developmentally appropriate material to \n     strengthen reading skills and enhance family literacy.\n       ``(8) Ready to Learn Television stations also have \n     distributed millions of age-appropriate books in their \n     communities. Each station receives a minimum of 300 books \n     each month for free local distribution. Some stations are now \n     distributing more than 1,000 books per month. Nationwide, \n     more than 653,494 books have been distributed in low-income \n     and disadvantaged neighborhoods free of charge.\n       ``(9) Demand for Ready To Learn Television Program outreach \n     and training has increased from 10 Public Broadcasting \n     Service stations to 133 stations in 5 years. This growth has \n     put a strain on available resources resulting in an inability \n     to meet the demand for the service and to reach all the \n     children who would benefit from the service.\n       ``(10) Federal policy played a crucial role in the \n     evolution of analog television by funding the television \n     program entitled `Sesame Street' in the 1960's.

Video modeling of \n     standards-based lessons, combined with professionally \n     facilitated online learning communities of teachers has been \n     proven to help mathematics teachers adopt and implement \n     standards-based practices. This integrated, self-paced \n     approach breaks down the isolation of classroom teaching \n     while making standards-based best practices available to all \n     participants.\n       ``(2) More than 5,800 teachers have participated over the \n     last 3 years in the demonstration. These teachers have taught \n     more than 1,500,000 students cumulatively.\n       ``(3) Independent evaluations indicate that teaching \n     improves and students benefit as a result of the program.\n       ``(4) The demonstration program should be expanded to reach \n     more teachers in more subject areas under the title of \n     Teacherline. The Teacherline Program will link the digitized \n     public broadcasting infrastructure with education networks by \n     working with the program's digital membership, and Federal \n     and State agencies, to expand and build upon the successful \n     model and take advantage of greatly expanded access to the \n     Internet and technology in schools, including digital \n     television. The Teacherline Program will leverage the Public \n     Broadcasting Service's historic relationships with higher \n     education to improve preservice teacher training.\n       ``(5) Over the past several years tremendous progress has \n     been made in wiring classrooms, equipping the classrooms with \n     multimedia computers, and connecting the classrooms to the \n     Internet.\n       ``(6) There is a great need for high quality, curriculum-\n     based digital content for teachers and students to easily \n     access and use in order to meet State and local standards for \n     student performance.\n       ``(7) The congressionally appointed Web-based Education \n     Commission called for the development of high quality public-\n     private online educational content that meets the highest \n     standards of educational excellence.\n       ``(8) Most local public television stations and State \n     networks provide high-quality video programs, and teacher \n     professional development, as a part of their mission to serve \n     local schools.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) While the families or communities of some gifted \n     students can provide private programs with appropriately \n     trained staff to supplement public educational offerings, \n     most high-ability students, especially those from inner \n     cities, rural communities, or low-income families, must rely \n     on the services and personnel provided by public schools. \n     Therefore, gifted education programs, provided by qualified \n     professionals in the public schools, are needed to provide \n     equal educational opportunities.\n       ``(2) Due to the wide dispersal of students who are gifted \n     and talented and the national interest in a well-educated \n     populace, the Federal Government can most effectively and \n     appropriately conduct research and development to provide an \n     infrastructure for, and to ensure that there is, a national \n     capacity to educate students who are gifted and talented to \n     meet the needs of the 21st century.\n       ``(3) State and local educational agencies often lack the \n     specialized resources and trained personnel to consistently \n     plan and implement effective programs for the identification \n     of gifted and talented students and for the provision of \n     educational services and programs appropriate for their \n     needs.\n       ``(4) Because gifted and talented students generally are \n     more advanced academically, are able to learn more quickly, \n     and study in more depth and complexity than others their age, \n     their educational needs require opportunities and experiences \n     that are different from those generally available in regular \n     education programs.\n       ``(5) Typical elementary school students who are \n     academically gifted and talented already have mastered 35 to \n     50 percent of the school year's content in several subject \n     areas before the year begins. Without an advanced and \n     challenging curriculum, they often lose their motivation and \n     develop poor study habits that are difficult to break.\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\n       ``(6) Elementary school and secondary school teachers have \n     students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits, \n     characteristics, and needs. Most teachers receive some \n     training to meet the needs of these students, such as \n     students with limited English proficiency, students with \n     disabilities, and students from diverse cultural and racial \n     backgrounds. However, most teachers do not receive training \n     on meeting the needs of students who are gifted and talented.\n\n     ``SEC. 11403.
