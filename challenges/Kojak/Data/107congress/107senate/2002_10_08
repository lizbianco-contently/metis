Mr. President, I have addressed the Senate many times \non my oversight efforts of the FBI. As my colleagues know, I have been \ntrying to improve the FBI for years. Sometimes that means investigating \nproblems that some people would otherwise rather cover up. But there is \nnothing like sunshine that fixes what is wrong, particularly in \nGovernment.\n  I do this not because I am against the FBI but because I think the \nFBI is\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\nmeant to work well and work right so our country is protected. In fact, \nsince September 11, the FBI is on the front line on the domestic war on \nterrorism. Obviously, the FBI must change to meet that demand. If it \ndoes not, we lose the domestic war on terrorism when the people on the \nfront line are not ready to do what needs to be done.\n  In February, I was addressing the Senate about the FBI reform bill \nintroduced by Chairman Leahy and myself to help bring more security and \naccountability to the FBI. I want to highlight that bill.\n  The bill strengthens the FBI uniformed police, creates an effective \npolygraph program to detect moles, and establishes an attractive career \npath for internal security officers. This is important. It has not been \nthat long since probably the worst spy case in FBI history, Robert \nHanssen, was uncovered.\n  For accountability, it ends the double standard in discipline that \nallows top bureaucrats to escape punishment. This bill gives real \nwhistleblower protections to FBI agents so others, such as Coleen \nRowley of Minneapolis, can come forward with the truth, as Director \nMueller complimented her as a whistleblower for bringing valuable \ninformation to the surface.\n  I happen to think the Attorney General and the FBI Director are \nworking hard to reform and improve the FBI, but the Leahy-Grassley bill \nwill help ensure that reform really happens. In fact, the Justice \nDepartment has even asked us for several provisions that we agreed to \nput in the bill.\n  The Judiciary Committee approved this bill unanimously back in April. \nSince then, this bill has been in limbo. There is now a hold on this \nbill--one of these secret holds. I do not do secret holds. When I put a \nhold on a nominee or a bill, I always put a statement in the \nCongressional Record so Senators know it is Chuck Grassley and why \nChuck Grassley is putting a hold on a bill. It seems we need to put a \nstop to the backroom squabbles that have brought this hold about and \nput national security first and help reform the FBI.\n  A few parts of the bill were luckily included in the Department of \nJustice reauthorization bill last week. I appreciate that the inspector \ngeneral's authority to investigate the FBI is now codified, and I am \nsure the FBI appreciated the help we gave them by including provisions \nfor the uniformed police force.\n  That is all nice, but the heart of the FBI reform bill was left out, \nand that heart is more whistleblower protections and ending the double \nstandard in discipline.\n  I have outlined why this bill is important. Now I think an example I \nhave will help people understand why we need to enact this bill very \nshortly.\n  Quite recently, my staff was shown a Tiffany crystal paperweight \nglobe. This globe sells for $100 to $200 but has been valued by experts \nat more than $5,000. This globe was wrapped in an evidence bag.\n\n  What does this have to do with the FBI?\n  Well, the answer is this globe was stolen from Ground Zero New York \nCity, as you know. I don't think I have to explain how disgraceful that \nact is.\n  It is not only illegally taking evidence from a crime scene, but it \nis stealing from hallowed ground where thousands of people died on \nSeptember 11. There have already been numbers of prosecutions for \nremoving items from Ground Zero. There is not question then that this \nact was wrong.\n  But in this case, I am told that the globe was taken by one or more \nFBI agents. That is right. I am sorry to say it was taken by FBI \nagents.\n  Agents from the Minneapolis Division apparently took it back with \nthem after being on official business at Ground Zero. When they \nreturned, I guess they gave it to a secretary in the office, as if it \nwas some memento from the trip.\n  This is how I know that: because an FBI agent decided to blow the \nwhistle after her superiors would not do anything about the theft.\n  The FBI and the Federal Emergency Management Administration \nInspectors General have been investigating a Minnesota company for \nstealing items from Ground Zero and other matters.\n  Coincidentally, Agent Jane Turner of the Minneapolis office \ndiscovered that other FBI agents did the very same thing.\n  In fact, it was one or more agents from the Evidence Response Team \nthat took the globe. The ERT is supposed to secure and collect evidence \nat a crime scene. Their job is to preserve the integrity of a crime \nscene, not take from it and disrupt it.\n  When Agent Turner told her supervisor about this, he said he already \nknew about it. It evidently was not that big a deal because he did not \ndo anything about it.\n  Well, I do think it is a big deal. I think it is outrageous. And I \nsuspect that the loved ones of the 9/11 victims would think this is an \noutrage.\n  In New York, the fact is people are working overtime to try and \nreturn items like this to the families that once owned them. Maybe some \npeople who work at these scenes think that taking something is OK, like \nit is a trophy for their hard work, but I do not think so. Most \nimportant, it is against the law.\n  This makes me wonder what else these agents stole, if they were \ngenerous enough to give a pricey crystal globe to a secretary.\n  This is the kind of behavior from a law enforcement agency that could \nbackfire and hurt the case against criminals.\n  For example, if a company were to do the same thing, steal something \nfrom Ground Zero, they might argue in court that the FBI did it, so it \nmust be OK and why can't they get away with it? So taking this from \nGround Zero was not only wrong, but it could really hurt prosecutions.\n  Because Agent Turner could not get an investigation into this matter \nby the FBI, she had to bring this to my staff and Chairman Leahy's \nstaff. Because of the severity of the situation, it was decided that \nshe report the situation to the Justice Department Inspector General \nfor a criminal investigation.\n  Fortunately, Agent Turner was able to recover the globe from the \nMinnesota office and bring it to the Inspectors General in a sealed \nevidence bag. The bag was sealed and signed both by Agent Turner and an \nagent from the FEMA Inspector General office, which is also working the \ncase.\n  I have also learned of other problems with the FBI Minneapolis \noffice. Apparently, a former FBI agent from that office is using his \ninfluence and access to undermine an FBI investigation. This former \nagent is now a consultant to the subject of an investigation. So he is \nworking against the FBI on a case, but at the same time trying to \ninfluence and get information from the FBI with such perks as sideline-\naccess Vikings tickets.\n  This appears to be a violation of Government ethics rules, a big \nsecurity problem and conflict of interest. I hope the FBI looks into \nthis problem as well.\n  What does this have to do with the FBI reform bill? Agent Turner's \ndisclosures to the committee are not protected. The FBI knows they \ncould retaliate.\n  It is the same thing that happened with Agent Coleen Rowley from \nMinneapolis. She was involved with the Moussaoui case, and she was not \nretaliated against because of media attention and Director Mueller's \npromise.\n  But that is not going to happen every time. FBI agents cannot always \ntake the risk that comes with blowing the whistle. There has to be \nprotection in the law, and that's what the FBI reform bill does. In the \nTurner case, Chairman Leahy and I wrote to the Director asking for his \nassurance that Agent Turner not get hit with retaliation, but we have \nnot gotten an answer back yet.\n  This bill also will put an end to the double standard in discipline, \nwhere senior officials get away with misconduct and coverups, while \nrank-and-file agents get punished for the same thing. This hurts the \nmorale of the FBI.\n  And how do we know about these discipline problems? We know about \nthem because of whistleblowers, patriotic American citizens wanting the \nlaw to be abided by.\n  Agents John Roberts, Frank Perry, Patrick Kiernan, and former agent \nJohn Werner all testified about this discipline scandal last summer. \nThis bill is only the first step to fix it, but the bill has not gone \nanywhere. These\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\nagents stuck their necks out to explain what is wrong with the FBI to \nCongress and the public. So far the Senate has ignored them, and their \ncareers continue to be at risk.\n  I know all this might be embarrassing for the FBI, but stealing is \nwrong, especially from Ground Zero, and there has to be consequences. \nHeads have to roll. I think the FBI agents in the field around the \ncountry do a great job. I have found that the big FBI mistakes over the \nyears usually come from headquarters, not from the grassroots.\n  In this case, it looks as if there are a few bad apples who did \nsomething wrong. And no one wanted to deal with it, so Agent Turner was \nobligated to blow the whistle. It was her sworn duty as a Federal law \nenforcement officer.\n  If we do not have the FBI reform bill, we will not have \nwhistleblowers like Jane Turner and Coleen Rowley who expose these \nhidden problems that need to be fixed.\n  Without the bill, agents in the field will still think senior \nbureaucrats are held to a different standard, so morale suffers.\n  Without the bill, FBI internal security will not be the best it can \nbe. That means the FBI will be more vulnerable and less effective, and \nthat hurts national security.\n  This is not about politics. It is about improving the FBI and \nnational security, and about making sure truth, fairness and justice \nprevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning I will make a few comments \nwith regard to the issue that is generally before us and before the \ncountry, and that is, of course, where we go with regard to Iraq and \nSaddam Hussein.\n  The President did a great job last night. He made very appropriate \ncomments at a very appropriate time. He has discussed in detail the \nthreats we see in Iraq, the threats we see in terrorism, and he has \ntalked about his solution.\n  There have been questions raised, and properly so, and the President \nlast evening sought to answer those questions, as indeed I think he \nshould.\n  Why do we need to contain this dictator? I think surely most people \nunderstand that. Why do we need to do it now? I suppose that may be one \nof the most difficult questions for some. Why are we waiting to have \nallies in the U.N.? Certainly most agree that is something we want. The \nPresident covered that very thoroughly, and indicated that is his goal.\n\n  Our loss of 3,000 innocent Americans on September 11 makes us aware \nof why we need to make some changes; that activity in the world has \nchanged. A number of years ago the threats were of landing on barges, \nflying huge formations of airplanes, with divisions of armed men and \nwomen. Now it is not entirely safe, as we found out September 11. We \nsuffer huge damages from one incident. That is difficult to control. \nClearly we have a problem.\n  We must complete our discussion, move forward and make decisions. It \nis an issue important to everyone, as a Nation, and important to the \nworld. We will be voting on a resolution soon. I suppose there will be \namendments to the resolution. The House may or may not come up with the \nsame resolution. Nevertheless, that is the role of the Senate. I hope \nwe deal with it as quickly as we can.\n  It grants the authority of the President to do what he feels has to \nbe done to deal with this issue. Today we understand the clear and \npresent threat of terrorism being different than in the past. September \n11 changed that. We see evidence of these threats around the world.\n  Our personal safety has changed, as well as our national security. We \nrecognize that. I understand there is reason to debate this issue. \nPeople have different views. We need to discuss the commitment of the \nmilitary in this world. The question of acting unilaterally is a \ndifficult question. That is one alternative.\n  We need to offer leadership in the world to reduce the risk that \nexists. The administration has done an excellent job of getting the \nsupport of our allies. Not all have signed up. Not all have stood up \nand raised their hands. Many support what we do now, as in Afghanistan.\n  Obviously, people have different views. Some are politicized. Some \nare different, legitimate views. We have to identify what our role \nshould be as a leader in the world. More importantly, we need to \nprotect this country's freedom and protect the freedom of all citizens.\n  In England, Prime Minister Blair has stepped up. I am sure others \nwill, as well. We need to continue to discuss it. Much of the \ndiscussion has already taken place and the decision is ready to be \nmade. Is this a sufficient threat to cause us to commit ourselves? I \nthink so. Should we work through the U.N. with our allies? Of course. \nThat is what the President suggested last night. I heard a fellow \nSenator this morning saying we should not do anything until the U.N. \nauthorizes it. I hope the U.N. does, and I hope the U.N. is there. They \nshould be. On the other hand, I don't think we ought to be controlled \nby the U.N. If we find this has to be something we do, we must go \nahead.\n  Our role is to disarm Saddam. Inspectors are an excellent way to do \nthat. But we have to review policy to see they are unrestricted. \nHowever, getting inspectors in is not the goal. Disarmament is the \ngoal. Inspectors may be a way to do that. We hope they are. There will \nbe movement in the U.N. The President's talk last night will do a great \ndeal to assist in that regard.\n  The resolution before the Senate provides for the \nnecessary authority. It pertains to support of diplomatic efforts of \nthe President to strictly enforce the United Nations Security Council \nresolutions that have been in place for 10 years. That is all we are \nasking.\n\n  We support, in this resolution, action by the Security Council to \nensure Iraq abandons its strategy for delay and invasion. The \nauthorization is included. The President is authorized to use the Armed \nForces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and \nappropriate in order to defend the national security of the United \nStates against the continuing threat posed by Iraq, and, number 2, \nenforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \nregarding Iraq. The President makes those determinations and reports to \nthe Congress. He makes available to the Speaker of the House and the \nPresident pro tempore his determination that, number one, reliance by \nthe United States on further diplomatic or peaceful means alone either \nwill not adequately protect the national security or will not likely \nlead to the enforcement of those Security Council resolutions. It makes \nthat determination, and, number 2, determines that acting pursuant to \nthis resolution is consistent with the United States and other \ncountries continuing to take necessary actions against international \nterrorists, terrorist organizations, including the nations, \norganizations, and persons planning and authorized to commit or aiding \nterrorists in the attacks that occurred on September 11.\n  It is pretty clear what needs to be done. It is appropriate to \ndiscuss this. We have discussed it sufficiently. I hope in the next day \nor two we can complete action. We need a little less talk and more \naction. The time has come to do that. It is our challenge. It is our \nresponsibility. I hope we can do it in the next several days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today, once again, I will rise for the \npurpose of asking unanimous consent to take up and pass S. 724. I will \nwithhold doing that until Senator Nickles is able to come to the floor. \nI understand he wishes to address the issue.\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n  This is a subject I raised last week here in the Senate. S. 724 is \nthe Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of 2001. It was reported \nby the Senate Finance Committee unanimously in July. It is legislation \nwhich was introduced by Senators Bond and Breaux and would simply give \nStates the option of covering pregnant women in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, or the CHIP program, for the full range of \npre- and postpartum care.\n  This legislation did pass out of the Senate Finance Committee by \nunanimous vote. It includes language we incorporated in an earlier \nbill, S. 1016, which was the Start Healthy, Stay Healthy Act of 2001 \nintroduced by me and supported by Senators Lugar, McCain, Corzine, \nLincoln, Chafee, Miller, and Landrieu, and it provides children with \ncontinuous health care coverage throughout the first and most fragile \nyear of life.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, the United States ranks \n21st in the world in infant mortality and 26th in the world in maternal \nmortality. For a nation as wealthy as ours, these statistics are simply \nunacceptable.\n  Unfortunately, the regulation the administration issued last week to \nallow unborn children to be covered by the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program, or CHIP, leaves pregnant women out of that equation. \nThat is contrary to the clinical guidelines of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists. It is contrary to the guidelines of \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics. Both organizations indicate that \nthe woman and the unborn child need to be treated together.\n  If you are covering only the fetus, as this regulation that came out \nlast week purports to do, this eliminates important aspects of coverage \nfor women during all the stages of birth, pregnancy, delivery, and \npostpartum care. The various health services that pregnant women could \nbe denied, without passage of this legislation, were elaborated on the \nSenate floor earlier. We need to do better by our Nation's mothers than \nwe have done so far. This legislation will do that.\n  Let me also make it clear, though, that this bill is about children's \nhealth. Senator Bond's bill appropriately is called the Mothers and \nNewborns Health Insurance Act. It is given that title for a very good \nreason. We all know the importance of an infant's first year of life. \nSenator Bond's legislation, as amended in our committee, the Finance \nCommittee, provides 12 months of continuous coverage for children after \nthey are born.\n  Again, the United States ranks 21st in the world in infant mortality. \nWe need to do a better job by our Nation's newborn infants just as we \nneed to do a better job by our Nation's mothers. The rule that was \npassed last week does provide an option for 12 months continuous \nenrollment to States, but it makes the time for that 12 months \nretroactive to the period that the child was in the womb. Therefore, if \n9 months of pregnancy were covered, the child would lose coverage in \nthe third month after birth. Potentially lost would be a number of \nwell-baby visits, immunizations, and access to pediatric caregivers.\n\n  This legislation, S. 724, which was introduced by Senator Bond, has a \nlarge number of bipartisan cosponsors. Senator Daschle is a cosponsor. \nSenator Lott is a cosponsor. Many others of my colleagues are \ncosponsors.\n  Last Wednesday, we tried to pass S. 724 and objections were raised. \nSenator Nickles asked a number of questions, and Senator Lincoln and I \nprepared some detailed responses. We made several points in those \nresponses. Let me just summarize those.\n  First, with regard to the cost of this legislation, the bill is \nalmost entirely offset over the first 5 years it would be in existence, \nand it actually saves money over the 10-year period.\n  With regard to whether the administration supports the bill, \nSecretary Thompson has repeatedly expressed support for passage of \nlegislation, including specifically mentioning support for S. 724 and \ncompanion legislation in the House. He has done that on two occasions.\n  With regard to whether the regulation eliminates the need for \nlegislation, the regulation itself notes that it leaves many gaps in \ncoverage that the rule creates, including denials of care for pregnant \nwomen through pregnancy, through delivery, and through postpartum care.\n  With regard to the burden this bill could place on States, the \nlegislation would simply allow States the option to expand coverage to \npregnant women through the CHIP program, or not to expand that \ncoverage, as they choose. States that do not wish to expand coverage \nwould not be compelled to do so. The National Governors Association \nbelieves all States should have that option. Therefore, the NGA has \nspecific policy in support of expanding options to cover pregnant women \nthrough this CHIP program.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the more \ndetailed response Senator Lincoln and I sent to Senator Nickles with \nrespect to the objections and questions he raised on the floor last \nWednesday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Don Nickles,\n     Assistant Minority Leader,\n     Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Nickles: On Wednesday, October 2, 2002, we \n     tried to pass by unanimous consent bipartisan legislation by \n     Senators Bond and Breaux, the ``Mothers and Newborns Health \n     Insurance Act'' (S. 724), which passed the Senate Finance \n     Committee in July by unanimous consent. The legislation has a \n     number of bipartisan cosponsors, including Senators Daschle \n     and Lott.\n       We were unable to proceed with passage of this important \n     legislation to cover pregnant women due to the objection you \n     raised, which, you stated, were based on questions you wanted \n     answered prior to passage. Through this letter and \n     attachment, we have addressed all the issues that you raised. \n     Therefore, we will once again ask for unanimous consent to \n     proceed to passage next week, and we hope we can count on \n     your support.\n       Thank you for your immediate consideration. The health of \n     many of our nation's mothers and children await this \n     important action by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff Bingaman.\n     Blanche L. Lincoln.\n       Attachment.\n\n                   Questions and Answers About S. 724\n\n       Question. How much does the bill cost and what is the \n     offset?\n       The CBO estimate of the pregnant women bill was $611 \n     million over five years and $1.08 billion over 10 years prior \n     to the issuance of the rule. The legislation also uses SSI \n     pre-effectuation reviews as the offset, with a savings of \n     $279 million over 5 years and $1.34 billion over 10 years. \n     Over ten years, there is a net savings to the passage of this \n     legislation.\n       However, according to the Administration, the cost of their \n     rule is $330 million between fiscal years 2003 and 2007. With \n     that taken into account, the cost of passage of pregnant \n     women coverage would drop to $281 million over five years. As \n     a result, the overall net cost of the bill would be almost \n     nothing over five years and would save money over the 10-year \n     period.\n       Question. . . . It's just my understanding that Secretary \n     Thompson has promulgated a reg[ulation] which I believe he \n     thinks satisfies a lot of the unmet health care needs of \n     children, including unborn children, and . . . so he supports \n     the reg[ulation] that he's promulgated and is now effective \n     and does not support the legislation which goes far beyond \n     the reg[ulation] that he's just promulgated . . . Maybe he \n     did make a statement that was supportive in March but he may \n     well feel like that was accomplished in the reg[ulation].\n       Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary \n     Tommy Thompson has stated repeatedly his support for the \n     passage of legislation to allow states the option to cover \n     the full range of health services to pregnant women through \n     the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), and \n     specifically mentioned S. 724 on at least one occasion.\n       In a statement issued on January 31, 2002, Secretary \n     Thompson praised Senators Bond, Breaux and Collins for \n     ``bipartisan leadership in supporting S. 724, a bill that \n     would allow states to provide prenatal coverage for low-\n     income women through the SCHIP program. We support this \n     legislative effort in this Congress.''\n       In testimony before the Senate Finance Committee on \n     February 14, 2002, Secretary Thompson expressed support for \n     legislation expanding coverage to pregnant women rather than \n     states having to seek waivers.\n       In testimony before the House Labor-HHS Appropriations \n     Subcommittee on March 6, 2002, Secretary Thompson said, ``And \n     so, if you can pass the bill [the House companion bill to S. \n     724 introduced by Representatives Hyde and Lowey], we don't \n     need the rule.'' He added, ``Let's pass the legislation.''\n       In a letter to Senator Bingaman dated April 12, 2002, \n     Secretary Thompson wrote:\n       ``Prenatal care for women and their babies is a crucial \n     part of medical care. These services can be a vital, life-\n     long determinant of health, and we should do everything \n     we can\n\n[[Page S10059]]\n\n     to make this care available for all pregnant women. It is \n     one of the most important investments we can make for the \n     long-term good health of our nation.\n       ``As I testified recently at a hearing held by the Health \n     Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, I \n     also support legislation to expand SCHIP to cover pregnant \n     women. However, because legislation has not moved and because \n     of the importance of prenatal care, I felt it was important \n     to take this action [of issuing regulations].''\n       Repeatedly, Secretary Thompson has expressed support for \n     legislation over the past year. As to whether he now thinks \n     the rule eliminates the need for legislation, it is important \n     to note that HHS issued a waiver on September 27, 2002, to \n     Colorado requested by Republican Governor Bill Owens to cover \n     pregnant women through SCHIP. The Colorado waiver was issued \n     on the same day the Secretary issued a press release on the \n     rule to allow coverage to ``unborn children'' through SCHIP. \n     As Secretary Thompson is quoted, ``Approved this waiver means \n     that thousands of uninsured women and their babies will be \n     able to get health care coverage.'' This is the third wavier \n     granted by Secretary Thompson to cover not just ``unborn \n     children'' but pregnant women, as previous waivers were given \n     to Rhode Island and New Jersey. Clearly, the Republic \n     Governor of Colorado did not think the rule fully covered \n     their desire to provide coverage to pregnant women.\n       HHS acknowledges in the regulation that the rule covering \n     ``unborn children'' does not fully cover pregnant women and \n     is in lieu of legislation being passed by Congress to provide \n     care to pregnant women. The regulation also acknowledges that \n     despite the rule that ``there are still gaps'' and that \n     waivers are not a fully acceptable way to address them. As \n     the rule reads:\n       ``This regulation bridges a gap in eligibility between the \n     Medicaid and the SCHIP programs that has now existed for five \n     years. Members of the Congress have also recognized this gap \n     and have introduced various pieces of legislation over the \n     years to address this gap. The opportunity to expand vital \n     health insurance coverage during a critical time is at hand.\n       ``We welcome all of these suggestions for expanding health \n     insurance coverage and indeed States and the Secretary have \n     already used the flexibility in current regulations. However, \n     there are still gaps. We also welcome support for the actions \n     of the Secretary in granting waivers to States . . . But the \n     Secretary's ability to intervene through one mechanism (a \n     wavier) should not be the sole option for States and may in \n     fact be an inferior option. Waivers are discretionary on the \n     part of the Secretary and time limited while State plan \n     amendments are permanent, and are subject to allotment \n     neutrality.''\n       The rule explains what gaps still exist. For example, the \n     rule highlights what cannot be covered for women via care to \n     ``unborn children.'' If you only are covering the fetus, this \n     eliminates important aspects of coverage for pregnant women \n     during all the stages of a birth--pregnancy, delivery, and \n     postpartum care. Among other things, pregnant women would not \n     be covered during their pregnancy for cancer, medical \n     emergencies, accidents, broken bones, or mental illness. Even \n     life-saving surgery for a mother would appear to be denied \n     coverage.\n       Further, during delivery, coverage for epidurals is a state \n     option and is justified only if the health of the child is \n     affected. On the other hand, anesthesia is covered for \n     Caesarean sections. The rule would wrongly push women and \n     providers toward performing C-sections to ensure coverage.\n       And finally, during the postpartum period, women would be \n     denied all health coverage from the moment the child is born. \n     Important care and treatment, including but not limited to \n     the treatment of hemorrhage, infection, episiotomy repair, C-\n     section repair, family planning counseling, treatment of \n     complications after delivery (including, once again, life-\n     saving surgery), and postpartum depression would not be \n     covered.\n       Question. I'm also going to check with the states, because \n     I also believe this is an expansion of Medicaid, which I know \n     my state is struggling to pay. As a matter of fact, actually \n     reducing payments in some cases in Medicaid because they just \n     don't have the budget. And, our state health director . . . \n     has told us don't increase any new expansions on Medicaid \n     because we can't afford it . . . Pregnant women [are eligible \n     for Medicaid] with incomes less than 185% of poverty . . . \n     and I believe this legislation would take that up to 300%. \n     So, it would make many more people eligible for Medicaid \n     which would also increase the costs to the states, which some \n     states can't afford it.\n       The legislation provides for an expansion of coverage for \n     pregnant women, at a state option, through the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP).\n       As the Committee report (Senate Report 107-233) reads:\n       ``The Committee bill allows states to cover additional \n     pregnant women under SCHIP. The SCHIP expansion group \n     includes pregnant women with family income above the state's \n     Medicaid financial eligibility standard for pregnant women in \n     effect on January 1, 2002, up to the income eligibility for \n     SCHIP children in effect as of January 1, 2002 . . .\n       ``Current federal law enables low-income pregnant women to \n     receive coverage under SCHIP through age 18, but it does not \n     provide such coverage to women ages 19 and above. While \n     states have the ability to add SCHIP coverage for pregnant \n     women over age 18 through Section 1115 waivers, states find \n     this process to be both time-consuming and administratively \n     burdensome. The Committee bill allows states to cover \n     pregnant women through the simpler state plan amendment \n     process. The committee bill also eliminates the disparity in \n     coverage levels between pregnant women and infants that has \n     been created through SCHIP, enabling both mothers and their \n     newborn children to immediately receive health coverage under \n     the program.''\n       According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), 38 \n     states and the District of Columbia provide coverage up to \n     200% of poverty or less. States cannot exceed those levels of \n     coverage through SCHIP beyond the levels of poverty covered \n     for children.\n       Also, if a state cannot afford an expansion of coverage to \n     additional pregnant women, they do not have to. It is a state \n     option. However, it allows those states that choose to expand \n     coverage to pregnant women to do so without having to seek a \n     waiver, just as the regulation has done for ``unborn \n     children.''\n       As a result, there is strong support for this legislation \n     from the National Governors' Association. Their policy \n     position (H.R.-15. ``The State Children's Health Insurance \n     Program (S-CHIP) Policy'') expresses strong support for \n     passage of such legislation. As it reads:\n       ``The Governors have a long tradition of expanding coverage \n     options for pregnant women through the Medicaid program. \n     However, pregnant women in working families are not eligible \n     for SCHIP coverage. The Governors call on Congress to create \n     a state option that would allow states to provide health \n     coverage to income-eligible pregnant women under SCHIP. This \n     small shift in federal policy would allow states to provide \n     critical prenatal care and would increase the likelihood that \n     children born to SCHIP mothers would have a healthy start.''\n       States are partners with the federal government in Medicaid \n     and SCHIP. They are asking for additional state flexibility \n     in coverage options here that should be granted by the \n     passage of S. 724. The ``Mothers and Newborns Health \n     Insurance Act of 2002.''\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, again, at the appropriate time, once \nSenator Nickles has arrived in the Chamber, I will rise once again to \nseek unanimous consent that we be allowed to bring up and pass S. 724, \nas passed out of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I am informed Senator Nickles will not be able to come \nto the floor in the near future. Therefore, I will go ahead and make \nthe unanimous consent request at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar No. 541, S. 724; that the committee \nsubstitute be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the \ntitle amendment be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelated to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on behalf of several of our Members who \nwant to talk, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I see my colleague from New Jersey is \nhere to speak. He has been a strong supporter of this legislation from \nthe time it was first introduced. I will yield the floor at this time \nso he may speak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of the efforts \nabout which Senator Bingaman was speaking. Senator Bond, Senator \nLincoln, and the Presiding Officer have also been supportive of working \nto expand the access to prenatal care for pregnant women. I thank all \nthose involved for efforts to pass this legislation.\n  I have to say I am disappointed we are not able to get this unanimous \nconsent, given the overwhelming support in the Finance Committee. There \nwas unanimous passage there of all the elements Senator Bingaman just \nspoke about with regard to funding. I will speak to it a bit myself.\n  But this is something that, given our record as a nation, being 21st \nin the world with regard to deaths of children at birth, just is hard \nto understand--why we are not taking the steps to address this fact and \ngive those States the flexibility to deal with it.\n  As I said, I am pleased the Finance Committee unanimously passed the \nlegislation, S. 724, which includes, as the Senator from New Mexico \nmentioned, the major provisions of legislation we introduced about 18 \nmonths\n\n[[Page S10060]]\n\nago called Start Healthy, Stay Healthy. Many of us have been supportive \nof that legislation.\n  The bipartisan bill, as it now stands, seeks to expand pregnancy-\nrelated care to low-income women who fall above Medicaid eligibility \nlevels. Under this bill, pregnant women would be eligible for the full \nspectrum of prenatal and postpartum care, as recommended by the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists.\n\n  Unfortunately, what many of us believe is noncontroversial \nlegislation is being held up for reasons of which I am not completely \ncertain. There were a number of questions raised last week by the \nSenator from Oklahoma which have been answered in detail in a letter \nabout which the Senator from New Mexico spoke. But the main objection \nis that it somehow contradicts a rule published by the Bush \nadministration to expand health insurance to unborn children but not to \npregnant women.\n  Actually, many of us believe this legislation complements the \nadministration's rule and will result in pregnant women receiving more \ncomprehensive pre- and postnatal care, which will clearly result in \nhealthier births and give newborns a better start in life.\n  Furthermore, S. 724, as amended, guarantees health coverage to \nchildren born to eligible women until age 1 regardless of income \neligibility. The administration's rule would only guarantee that health \ncare for 3 months of their lives. So we think it does an outstanding \njob of broadening the coverage to make sure that kids really do start \nhealthy and that they will stay healthy as they go forward in their \nlives.\n  The administration has stated that the goal of its new rule is to \nincrease a woman's access to prenatal care. I think all of us applaud \nthat. I certainly do. Why, then, is the woman explicitly left out of \nthat rule? For example, under the administration's rule, it is \nuncertain whether pregnant women will be offered treatment for ailments \nthat may not be directly related to pregnancy.\n  For instance, under the administration's rule, a pregnant woman would \nnot be eligible to receive care for cancer, diabetes, medical \nemergencies, accidents, broken bones, or mental illness. It is also \nunclear whether or not a woman would be provided certain types of care \nduring delivery. In order to have an epidural covered, for instance, a \ndoctor would have to certify that it was in the best interest of the \nfetus.\n  Finally, the rule provides for absolutely no postpregnancy care. \nTreatment of postpartum complications, including hemorrhaging, \ninfection, and postpartum depression, would be inaccessible to the \nmother.\n  These things are hard to put in the context of what is the desire of, \nI think, most of us to see that there is a good continuum, a good start \nfor our children. I think there are some conflicts that are put in \nplace by the regulations that would be very hard to enforce and could \nbe endangering to both the child and certainly to the mother's health. \nI think they do not meet the commonsense test.\n  It contradicts also ACOG's standard of care, which views pregnancy-\nrelated care as including prenatal, labor and delivery, and postpartum \ncare. Second, surely we can agree that neglecting the mother's health \nis not the best way to give a newborn a healthy start in life.\n  If the administration and Members of Congress are serious about \nproviding meaningful health care to pregnant women and their children, \nI believe we should support passage of the bipartisan initiative, S. \n724. This legislation gives the States the option to enroll low-income \npregnant women into their CHIP programs, a proposal that HHS Secretary \nThompson has endorsed verbally and in writing many times, which is \nindicated in the letter Senator Bingaman has forwarded to \nSenator Nickles.\n\n  This legislation will provide for all of the care related to the \nfetus outlined under the administration's rule, but it will also \nprovide full access to prenatal and postpartum health care, other \nessential health care for pregnant women, and 1 year of continuous \ncoverage for newborns.\n  Let me be clear, States will still have the option of expanding care \nto fetuses under the administration's rule. But by passing this \nlegislation, we would also give the States the option of expanding care \nto pregnant women along the lines of what I talked about earlier.\n  My own State of New Jersey has already received a waiver from HHS, \nand a number of other States have; a number are applying. It is \nactually a very complicated and onerous process to get these waiver \nprocedures in place. I think we ought to make it legislatively \nappropriate, statutorily appropriate, for all States, so they have the \nchoice of moving in this direction if they so choose.\n  Every week in our country 8,500 children are born to mothers who lack \naccess to prenatal care. This is one of those areas where insurance \ncoverage can actually be provided and make a big difference, so we do \nnot end up paying more for health care for children who are brought \ninto the world in poor health conditions, who then end up costing \nsociety even more because they have had poor prenatal care. Every day \nwe wait to pass this legislation, more children will be born with \nserious health problems because their mothers cannot afford health \ncare.\n  I hope we can address this issue. There is strong bipartisan support. \nI think it is time to move. I very strongly support the efforts of all \nmy colleagues who are pushing for S. 724 and hope we can put the \npolitics aside and vote today to pass this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak again on the \nimportance of passing S. 724, the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance \nAct, as soon as possible. It is beyond me why in the world we cannot \nmove forward on such a practical piece of legislation. This bill will \nmake a real difference in the health of thousands of low-income women \nand their babies across our great Nation, not to mention the money it \nis going to save this Nation, because we all know that for every $1 we \ninvest in prenatal care, we save anywhere from $5 to $6 down the road. \nIt is not only compassionate and good policy, it is also good \neconomics.\n  Last Wednesday, Senator Bingaman asked for unanimous consent to pass \nthis bipartisan bill, but Senator Nickles from Oklahoma objected. Since \nthen, Senator Bingaman and I have sent Senator Nickles a letter \nanswering the questions he had about this particular legislation.\n  It is so important Members understand how critically important this \npiece of legislation is, and that these questions can be answered. With \nthose questions answered, it is my hope that we can pass S. 724 today.\n  This bill, which we unanimously approved in the Finance Committee, \ngives States the option. They can simply take the option, if they \nchoose, of covering pregnant women under the State's Children's Health \nInsurance program. Most importantly, the bill allows coverage for \nprenatal care, delivery, and postpartum care. These are all complete \nparts of delivering healthy children. It is not just one opportunity to \ncare for a fetus that is being carried by a woman; it is, more \nimportantly, the opportunity to bring that child into the world \nhealthy. We all know to do that, we must look at the health of the \nmother in a prenatal situation. We have to look at the delivery, and we \nalso have to look at the postpartum care, which is essential for women \nto care for and maintain healthy children.\n  I am so pleased we are joined on the floor by some of our colleagues \nwho work so hard to improve the health of women and children: Senator \nCorzine, Senators Landrieu and Clinton are leaders in this area. I am \nglad they have all been here or will be here to speak. I understand \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Lugar have submitted \nstatements for their support of S. 724.\n  Some of us talk a lot about the importance of process in the Senate. \nSometimes it does not translate to our colleagues or friends and \nconstituents out there in the greater part of our Nation. Some of us \ncomplain when bills\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\ndo not go through the regular process of committee markups and on to \nthe Senate floor. When we are talking about such an important issue, \npeople do understand, when the Senate does not act on something that is \nthis critical to the well-being of their life, particularly to the \nhealth of their children.\n  This bill went through the classic Senate process, as is described in \nGovernment textbooks. As Senators Bingaman, Bond, and I discussed last \nweek, S. 724 unanimously passed the Finance Committee and is now on the \nlegislative calendar under general orders. Even better, it has strong \nbipartisan support. Both the majority leader and minority leader have \ncosponsored it. That is because the idea of ensuring a healthy start in \nlife is a sound policy, it is good fiscal policy, and it is not a \npartisan issue. I have no earthly idea why we are trying to make it \none. If we really care about life, the Senate needs to pass this \ncommonsense bill.\n  I want to make an important point about the necessity of S. 724 in \nlight of the administration's regulation that provides CHIP coverage to \nunborn fetuses. This regulation fails to cover the full range of \nmedical services needed by a woman during and after pregnancy. Simply \nput, it flies in the face of the Guidelines for Prenatal Care Fourth \nEdition, established by the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, guidelines that \nare used by doctors all across our country.\n  Under the regulation, doctors will not be reimbursed for providing \ncare they are ethically obligated to provide. In the modern practice of \nobstetrics, postpartum care is absolutely a critical part of the \noverall care and the treatment the women receive prenatally and during \nlabor and delivery. Postpartum care is essential for any of us who have \ngone through pregnancies and who have been so blessed to have had good \nprenatal care, who have seen what it can do in the delivery room, by \nproviding the ability to go through a healthy delivery, and then, when \nyou come out of that delivery, to be blessed and fortunate enough to go \nhome within 2 days with your children because you have had good care. \nIt is so common sense.\n  It is so positive for everybody concerned: The taxpayers who may be \npaying the tax bill or the medical bills, for the individual who wants \nto get off to the right start, the mother who wants to get off to the \nright start, the child who needs to get off to a healthy start.\n  We have learned so much about early development in children and what \nit means later on in life in their ability to succeed and learn, how \ncritical it is they not be in that neonatal unit, but that they can be \nborn healthy, and they can all go home together to start that life off \ncorrectly.\n  We have an opportunity to make a difference in each and every newborn \nlife. There is no excuse that we should not move quickly. With rising \nmedical malpractice rates, particularly for obstetricians and \ngynecologists, these doctors may simply decide to stop serving CHIP \npatients. This regulation may become another disincentive for doctors \nto participate in programs serving our low-income population.\n  Failing to pass S. 724 leaves doctors choosing between following \nclinical guidelines which we know, through research, is the most proper \ncare women need; they have to choose between following these clinical \nguidelines they know and trust or getting paid. These decisions will be \nespecially hard for doctors who serve high-risk women, given the fact \npostpartum care is even more critical for women who have preexisting \nmedical conditions such as diabetes or hypertension--any of these.\n  Under the President's order, these women wouldn't get care. They \ncould only care for the unborn fetus they are carrying. It makes no \nsense whatsoever that the pregnant woman could not even get the care \nshe needed, and the doctor, if giving it ethically, cannot even be \nreimbursed.\n  This bill does not overturn the administration's regulation. It \nsimply complements it. It makes the regulation better. It clarifies \nthat doctors will get reimbursed for the clinical care they provide, \nand it will ensure pregnant women get the full scope of medical care \nthey need.\n  S. 724 is supported by 25 national organizations, including the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Obstetricians \nand Gynecologists, and the March of Dimes. Each of these organizations \nhas expressed serious concern with the administration's regulation, and \nbelieves this bill is better.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a complete list of the organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Organizations supporting S. 24:\n       American Association of University Affiliated Programs;\n       American Academy of Pediatrics;\n       American College of Nurse Midwives;\n       American College of Obstetricians & Gynecologists;\n       American College of Osteopathic Pediatricians;\n       American Hospital Association;\n       American Medical Association;\n       American Osteopathic Association;\n       American Public Health Association;\n       Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and Neonatal \n     Nurses;\n       Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs;\n       Catholic Health Association;\n       Council of Women's & Infants' Specialty Hospitals;\n       Easter Seals;\n       Family Voices;\n       Greater New York Hospital Association;\n       March of Dimes;\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals;\n       National Association of Public Hospitals & Health Systems;\n       National Women's Health Network;\n       National Association of County & City Health Officials;\n       Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine;\n       Spina Bifida Association of America;\n       The Alan Guttmacher Institute;\n       United Cerebral Palsy Associations.\n  Ms. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have joined me. \nIn the last few days of the session, let us prove to the American \npeople we in the Senate do understand what goes on in their everyday \nlives, we do care, and we can act in ways that will actually make a \ndifference in their lives; that we won't sit here and talk about \nprocess.\n  This bill has been through every piece of process there is. Let us \ncome together in a partisan way and move forward at least this piece of \nlegislation that will make a difference in not only a child's life, a \nwoman's life, an entire family's life, a community's life, but in this \nNation's success.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I understand several of my colleagues \nhave come to the floor to speak in favor of this piece of legislation \nSenator Lincoln is championing so well and appropriately. I rise to \ntake a moment to add my words of support for this very important \nmeasure.\n  I understand the Senator from Missouri will be following me, if \npossible.\n  Last year in Louisiana, there were about 67,000 children born. If you \nthink about a medium-sized town, that is like a medium-sized town born \nevery year.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the majority has \nexpired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is fine, as long as the minority gets \nan extra 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Reserving the right to object, I did not hear that.\n  Mr. REID. I said as long as the minority gets an extra 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I appreciate that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, 67,000 babies were born in Louisiana \nlast year. It would be most certainly in the interest not only of those \nparticular children and those particular families but the community \nthat reaches out, in the broader sense, to the people of our Nation to \nmake sure those new babies, and their moms who are delivering them, are \ncoming into the world in the healthiest way possible. Not only does \nthat help us across the board in health issues, it helps us because \nthen we are better able to educate those children because they have \nbeen born in a healthy manner, we are more able to reach out and \nprevent all sorts of illnesses and diseases and mental health problems, \nand save the taxpayers of this country billions of dollars.\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\n  So the Senator from Arkansas is so right. The rule proposed in the \nHouse falls short. Let us pass this bill that encompasses the health of \nchildren and their mothers and give them the prenatal care they need to \nget these children born healthy for their own benefit and for the \nbenefit of the taxpayers in our Nation.\n  I thank the Senator from Missouri for his strong leadership on this \nissue as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for giving me the \nopportunity to rise today in support of the unanimous consent request \nto consider and pass S. 724, the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance \nAct of 2001. I believe the bill is essential to the health care of \nchildren and pregnant women in America. Thus, I am proud to be an \noriginal sponsor of the legislation with Senator Breaux and Senator \nCollins.\n  The goal of the legislation is quite simple: To make sure more \npregnant women and more children are covered by health insurance so \nthey have access to the health care services they need to be healthy.\n  This legislation would simply give the States the option and \nflexibility to cover low-income pregnant women in the State Children's \nHealth Insurance program, which we call SCHIP, for the full range of \nnecessary prenatal, delivery, and postpartum care.\n  Let me reiterate, this is a choice for the States, should they choose \nto exercise it. No State, under this bill, is required, or forced, to \nexpand coverage to additional pregnant women. This bill merely provides \nStates the option.\n  This bill will complement the administration's final rule that allows \nStates to expand SCHIP coverage to an ``unborn child'' by covering \nadditional vital health care services for the pregnant mother that the \nrule, unfortunately, does not cover.\n  The rule attempts to treat the unborn child without treating the \nmother. This approach is in direct conflict with the clinical \nguidelines set forth by the American College of Obstetricians and \nGynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which state a \npregnant woman and the ``unborn child'' must be treated together. It \ncertainly makes common sense to a layperson, but there is a \nprofessional opinion that the two cannot be treated separately.\n\n  It is simply counterintuitive to deny coverage for disease \nmanagement, medical emergencies, accidents, broken bones, mental \nillness, or surgeries for the mother during pregnancy. Failure to treat \nthe mother in such circumstances will have a direct and profound effect \non the health and development of her unborn child.\n  In addition, under the rule, during delivery, coverage for epidurals \nis a State option and is justified only if the health of the child is \naffected. On the other hand, anaesthesia is covered for Caesarean \nsections. The rule would wrongly push women and providers toward \nperforming more C-sections to ensure coverage for epidurals--a choice \nwhich is more expensive and, in most cases, a much harder road to \nrecovery for the mother.\n  Finally, after delivery, women would be denied all health coverage \nfrom the moment the child is born. Important care and treatment, \nincluding the treatment of hemorrhage, infection, episiotomy repair, C-\nsection repair, and the treatment of complications after delivery would \nnot be covered.\n  This bill will work hand in hand with the administration's rule by \ngiving States the flexibility and option to treat the mother and child \ntogether and provide the full range of necessary prenatal, delivery, \nand postpartum care--care which is essential to the health and well-\nbeing of both the mother and the baby.\n  No health care program that ignores this fact can fully address the \nissue of children's health care. This bill will eliminate the illogical \ndisconnect between pregnant women and babies.\n  This bill has strong bipartisan support in both the Senate and the \nHouse, as well as the endorsement of the National Governors Association \nand 25 other national organizations, including the March of Dimes, \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, American Public Health Association, \nNational Association of Children's Hospitals, American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, and the Catholic Health Association.\n  In addition, Secretary Thompson, in the past, has voiced his strong \nsupport for this legislation.\n  In fact, in a January 31, 2002, press release on the administration's \nrule, Secretary Thompson congratulated Senators for ``bipartisan \nleadership in supporting S. 724, a bill that would allow States to \nprovide prenatal coverage for low-income women through the SCHIP \nprogram.'' He went on to say, ``We support this legislative effort in \nCongress.''\n  All women need prenatal care. Young or old, first baby or fifth, all \nmothers-to-be benefit from regular care during pregnancy.\n  Studies have shown that an uninsured pregnant woman is much less \nlikely to get critical prenatal care that reduces the risk of health \nproblems for both the woman and the child. Babies whose mothers receive \nno prenatal care or late prenatal care are at-risk for many health \nproblems, including birth defects, premature births, and low birth-\nweight.\n  We know prenatal care improves birth outcomes and can save money. \nAccording to the National Center for Health Statistics, infants born to \nmothers who receive no prenatal care or late prenatal care are nearly \ntwice as likely to be low birth weight.\n  Moreover, low birth weight and pre-term births are one of the most \nexpensive reasons for a hospital stay in the United States with \nhospital charges averaging $50,000--an especially serious financial \nissue for families without health insurance.\n  A report by the IOM entitled Health is a Family Matter notes, \n``Infants of uninsured women are more likely to die than are those of \ninsured women. In one region of West Virginia, the fetal death rate \ndropped from 35.4 to 7.0 per 1,000 live births after introduction of a \nprenatal care program for the uninsured.''\n  In addition to ensuring better health outcomes, research and state \nexperience suggests that covering pregnant women is a highly successful \noutreach mechanism for enrolling children.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman for his leadership in the Finance Committee \non this issue. With his help, this bill passed the Finance Committee in \nthe beginning of August by unanimous consent.\n  Madam President, studies have shown time and time again that babies \nborn to mothers receiving late or no prenatal care are more likely to \nface complications--which results in hospitalization, expensive medical \ntreatments and ultimately increased costs to public programs. We must \nclose the gap in coverage between pregnant mothers and their children \nto improve the health of both and to address more fully the issue of \nchildren's healthcare.\n  This is crucial legislation, and urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupport of it so that we can pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for \nimmediate passage of the Mothers and Newborns Health Insurance Act of \n2001, as reported by the Senate Finance Committee in July.\n  This important legislation would simply give States the option to \nprovide health insurance coverage to pregnant women under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Such coverage would include the \nfull range of care, both during pregnancy and postpartum.\n  This means that a pregnant women would have access to epidurals \nduring the birthing process and any health-related services necessary \npostpartum. It also means that a pregnant women who has other health \nconditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, would be able to \nreceive treatment for such disorders. Even life saving surgery for a \npregnant woman appears to be not covered under the propose rule.\n  Keeping the mother healthy is not only in her best interest, but \nclearly in the best interest of the child. Providing a mother with \naccess to health care services could help ensure that her child will \nhave the opportunity to be raised by a healthy mother who will \nhopefully live a long life.\n  Additionally, providing the mother with access to health care \nservices during pregnancy could also help eliminate complications \nduring childbirth\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nand postpartum. This could potentially cut down on health care costs.\n  Passage of this legislation is particularly important since last week \nthe administration issued a final proposed rule that would give States \nthe option to provide health insurance through SCHIP to a fetus. No \nmention is made of providing the same coverage to the woman carrying \nthe fetus. Woman are completely left out of the equation. It simply \nmakes no sense to issue a regulation that provides for health insurance \nfor a fetus but not the woman preparing to give birth. In my mind, it \nmakes more sense to simply expand access to prenatal and postpartum \ncare.\n  In a country as prosperous as the United States, it is disturbing \nthat we still rank 26th in the world in maternal mortality. This could \nall be avoided if we only did a better job of ensuring that all \npregnant women, regardless of their income or status, had access to the \nfull-range of health care services throughout the continuum of their \npregnancy.\n  Currently under SCHIP, only women under the age of 19 are covered for \npregnancy-related services. However, what happens to a woman who turns \n20 halfway through her pregnancy? A 20-year old woman would not be able \nto access the same services under current law but would certainly need \naccess to prenatal and postpartum care to ensure a safe pregnancy and \nmaximize the chances of giving birth to a healthy child. This \nlegislation would eliminate this discrepancy.\n  States can currently apply for a waiver to provide coverage to \npregnant women. Many States have applied for such a waiver. The waiver \nprocess is often burdensome and timely. Why not just give all States \nthe option to provide such coverage?\n  HHS Secretary Thompson himself said on March 6, 2002, before the \nHouse Labor-HHS Appropriations Subcommittee: ``And so, if you can pass \nthe bill, we don't need the rule. Let's pass the legislation.''\n  I echo Secretary Thompson's sentiment. In the remaining days of \nCongress, let's pass this commonsense legislation. It is a good \ninvestment. It will help protect our Nation's pregnant women by \nproviding them with access to vital health care services, and will help \nensure that our Nation's children are born to healthy mothers who have \nbeen given the foundation necessary to lead a long and healthy life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10063-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S.J. Res. 45, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A Joint Resolution (S.J. Res. 45) to authorize the use of \n     United States Armed Forces against Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, in a short while, on behalf of a number of \ncolleagues, particularly Senators Warner, Bayh, McCain, and myself--and \nI am happy to note the occupant of the Chair, the junior Senator from \nLouisiana is also a cosponsor with us--we are going to be offering a \nsubstitute to the pending business to authorize the use of United \nStates Armed Forces against Iraq.\n  This is, obviously, a momentous decision. The debate has begun in \nthis Chamber over the last few days. I have watched a lot of it with \ngreat interest. It has been carried on with the tone of seriousness and \npurpose the matter requires. This debate will continue in earnest over \nthe next few days as we, each in our own way, facing our own \nconscience, considering our values, our sense of history, our \nunderstanding of the threat posed by Iraq under Saddam Hussein, will \nreach a conclusion.\n  Senators Warner, Bayh, McCain, and I have reached a conclusion in \nsubmitting the resolution. I say for the record this resolution is the \nresult of an open and spirited process of discussion and negotiation \nbetween the President of the United States and Members of both parties \nin both Houses.\n  The result is a resolution that, in its preamble, states the case \nagainst Saddam, the case of the ambitions this brutal dictator has to \ngain hegemonic control over the Arab world and the oil there; the \nextraordinary acts of brutality he has committed himself and directed \nothers to commit against his own Iraqi people; his invasions of his \nneighbors, Iran and Kuwait, which is evidence, prior to the gulf war, \nof the long-held belief that he has had which is fundamental to the \nBaath party, which he heads, of rising to dominate the region as a \nmodern-day Saladin and all that it contains.\n  The resolution records the allied efforts in the gulf war which were \ntriumphant, and the resolutions of the United Nations that followed \nthereafter as part of the promises Saddam Hussein made to end the gulf \nwar, the most significant of which was to disarm and to allow United \nNations inspectors in to guarantee the world that disarmament would \noccur.\n  I talked to someone who was in our Government at that time, and they \nsaid the presumption was disarmament would occur rapidly and that \ninspectors might be necessary just to make sure there was not, over \ntime, an attempt to rearm. Of course, it is 11 years after the gulf war \nended, and disarmament has never occurred. The United Nations \nresolutions have been violated repeatedly, and ultimately the \ninspectors were thrown out in 1998. All of this, and more, is recorded \nin the preamble section of the resolution we will offer.\n  Also recorded is the effort the Bush administration is making now to \nfinally convince the United Nations to act, to prove its resolutions \nare worth more than the paper on which they are printed; that the \nUnited Nations Security Council will act to enforce its resolutions, to \nprotect the world from the unique threat represented by Saddam Hussein, \nan ideology which calls on him to spread out and dominate his region, \nweapons of mass destruction he has used not once but repeatedly against \nthe Kurdish people who are Iraqi citizens, and against the Iranians in \nwar and his support of terrorism.\n  There are only seven nations in the world our own State Department \nlists as state sponsors of terrorism.\n  Iraq is one of those, and it has supported terrorist groups that have \nkilled Americans. This is a unique circumstance. At different times I \nknow our colleagues have asked: What about the other countries that are \non the list of state sponsors of terrorism? What about other nations \nthat have weapons of mass destruction? What about other nations that \nhave aggressive ambitions? Well, there are such nations, but there is \nno one other nation that brings as much poison and evil intent together \nand, in that sense, so threatens the United States of America as Iraq.\n  This resolution, which again is the process of bipartisan and \nbicameral negotiation with the White House, is explicit. It has taken \nsome clauses out of the original White House proposal and has added \nsome others, but in its most operative sections it says this Congress \nof the United States authorizes the President to use the Armed Forces \nof the United States to defend the national security of the United \nStates against the continuing threat posed by Iraq and enforce all \nrelevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\n  There are those who ask: Why now? What is the urgency? My own \nresponse, as the President of the United States declared most recently, \nlast night, is: Why not earlier? Why not over the course of the last \ndecade, when Saddam Hussein, to our knowledge, continued to build up \nhis weapons of mass destruction and the most dangerous and threatening \nmeans to deliver them on targets near and far, constantly ignoring and \nviolating resolutions of the United Nations, growing more ominous a \nthreat to his neighbors and to the world?\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\n  My answer, again, to, why now? is, why not earlier?\n  Others have said: There has been no provocation. Why are we not \nwaiting for an attack to occur? Well, why, after the devastation of \nSeptember 11, 2001, would we want to wait until an attack occurs by \nsomeone who is clearly arming and threatening us?\n  This is not, in the classic sense, an act of preemption to authorize \nthe President to take military action against Iraq as a last resort if \nall else fails. In fact, the United States of America--and the United \nNations, for that matter--have been in a continuing military conflict \nwith Iraq since the gulf war began.\n  We have 7,500 American military personnel dispatched to the region, \nworking alongside their British colleagues to enforce the no-fly zones, \ncosting American taxpayers more than $1 billion a year. This is not \nsafe duty. This is not casual duty. These American Air Force personnel \nare being fired on repeatedly. More than 400 times this year alone, \nAmerican and British aircraft have been fired on by Iraqi forces. So \nthis is not an act of preemption. This is an act of response and \nprevention.\n  Others have said on this floor that the authorization we are giving \nthe President of the United States is an abrogation of our \nconstitutional responsibilities and is much too broad. I respectfully \ndisagree. It seems to me the Constitution and the Framers have set up \nattention, attention that they must have understood, to give us, the \nMembers of Congress, the authority to declare war, to essentially \nauthorize war, but they gave one person, the President of the United \nStates, the power to be Commander in Chief to carry out war. Five \nhundred and thirty-five Members of Congress cannot conduct a war. It is \nour responsibility to determine when and under what circumstances we \nwill authorize the Commander in Chief to do that, but only the \nPresident, as Commander in Chief, can do that.\n\n  This resolution we will submit in a few moments strikes exactly the \nright balance. It gives the President a clear and a strong mandate, but \nit limits it. It limits it to a defense of the national security of the \nUnited States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq, and it \nauthorizes the President to use military force, if necessary, to \nenforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \nregarding Iraq.\n  For those of us who are sponsoring this resolution, it is based on \nour conclusion that Iraq is a threat to the security of the American \npeople, a clear and present danger that, if we do not stop Saddam now, \nwe will look back on some terrible day, with a profound sense of \nremorse and guilt, and say why didn't we do it?\n  Based on those conclusions, all the evidence I have recited, and so \nmuch more that has been recited on this floor and will again be \nrecited, this resolution says: Mr. President, we have decided Iraq is a \ndanger to the United States, we have decided that United Nations \nSecurity Council resolutions can no longer be ignored, and we give you \nthe authority, as Commander in Chief, to take it from there.\n  In closing, with that authority we are giving the President come \naccountability and responsibility. There are some who have said this is \na blank check. Of course if somebody forges a check, they are held \naccountable, but it is not as if this is a blank check, without \naccountability, on a bank account that has no limit.\n  With this resolution--if and when, as I hope, it passes \noverwhelmingly--we not only give the President the authority to act \nwithin the parameters of the resolution, we give him a tremendous and \nawesome responsibility. It is not a blank check. It is the most serious \nresponsibility the Congress can give the President. As the President \nhimself has made clear over the last several weeks on several \noccasions, he understands the weight of that responsibility. But he and \nwe, the sponsors of this resolution, understand if we do not authorize \nhim to take this action, the American people may suffer a far worse \nfate.\n  It is our intention to lay this resolution down soon. I look forward \nto the debate. My colleagues and I intend to be in the Chamber to \nanswer questions of our colleagues about these issues.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate the remarks of my friend, their tone, and \nparticularly the content that really lays out the parameters of this \ndebate. I ask my friend from Connecticut: Did the Senator have a chance \nto hear the President's address to the Nation last night?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I did.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Was it clear to the Senator that the President showed the \nAmerican people that every option is being explored before a military \noption is exercised? I ask this question because I hear time and again \nfrom many Americans, who either are opposed to any military \nintervention or have not made up their minds, that they seem not to \nhave confidence that the President is exercising every option. He is \ncoming to Congress to get approval from both Houses of Congress. We \nhave had significant debate, and we will have significant debate.\n  We are working at the Security Council level. We are making it \nabsolutely clear that tomorrow Saddam Hussein, if he did away with his \nweapons of mass destruction, destroyed the laboratory and allowed \ncomplete and comprehensive inspections, would probably remove the \nthreat he now faces. It is Saddam Hussein who has continued for the \nlast 11 years.\n  My question to the Senator is, Do you think the President's speech \nlast night went some distance in convincing the American people that \nneither the President nor the Senator from Connecticut, nor I, nor the \nSenator from Virginia, nor the Senator from Indiana, choose the \nmilitary option? We are sending young Americans into harm's way. As \nsuccessful as this operation may be, we will still lose some brave \nyoung Americans' lives. That is the reality. That is why we avoid it at \nall costs.\n  As we conduct this debate, we need to talk about the fact that this \nis not the preferred option for the President of the United States or \nany Member of this body. This is the last option. We can make the case \nthat it is obvious that Saddam Hussein continues this buildup of \nweapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. But we are not \nthe ones who are forcing this issue. The President of the United States \nin this resolution is not forcing the issue. It is Saddam Hussein who \nis forcing this issue.\n  We will, as we go through this debate and the conversations at the \nUnited Nations Security Council, make sure we have exhausted every \npossible option. This is a critical factor in getting the American \npeople behind this resolution and behind the President of the United \nStates and behind the men and women in the military.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his question. Of \ncourse, I agree with the Senator that the President of the United \nStates has made it quite clear that he is asking us for this authority \nto dispatch our responsibility under the Constitution to give him the \npower to make war if necessary, but he hopes--and clearly, we hope--\nthat will not be necessary.\n  I hope this is one of those cases where, as someone once said, the \nbest way to achieve peace is to prepare for war. The best way to \nachieve compliance by Saddam Hussein with the promises he made at the \nend of the gulf war is to show that finally we are prepared to go to \nwar once again to enforce those promises he made.\n  This Nation has been remarkably patient. The fact is, over the last \ndecade or more we and the United Nations have tried just about every \nother conceivable way, short of war, to get the Iraqis under Saddam \nHussein to keep the promises they made and to disarm. We have tried \nsanctions which have been so difficult because of the way Saddam \nHussein has carried them out on the Iraqi people. We have tried \ninspections. We have tried the Oil for Food Program. We have tried \nlimited military action. None of it has worked to convince this brutal \ndictator to observe the rule of law and to keep the policies he made.\n  In one sense, we might say this is the moment of truth for him, the \nchallenge the President has given Saddam Hussein, and that this \nbipartisan resolution, which I hope and believe will achieve an \noverwhelming vote of bipartisan support by our colleagues, this \nresolution finally says to Saddam Hussein: Disarm. We do not want to go \nto\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\nwar against you. Disarm or face war. The danger you represent is so \ngreat. We can only hope and pray that message will be heard in Baghdad.\n  I thank my colleague for the question. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I reiterate what our distinguished \ncolleague from Connecticut has said, what my longtime friend of over 30 \nyears, Senator McCain, just said.\n  This is the last option. What we are doing in the Senate today, \ntomorrow, and when that vote comes is to vote our conscience, 100 \nindividuals, to do our very best to deter the use of force but to make \nit clear that our Constitution has given this President and every \nPresident who has preceded him, and every President who will come \nafter, the authority to utilize all the assets of our Nation, \nprincipally the men and women of the Armed Forces, to secure our \ninterests and protect our people.\n  I have been privileged to be a Member of this body nearly a quarter \nof a century now, and if the good Lord returns me in January, it will \nmark the 25th year. I cannot recall any moment when I have stood on the \nfloor with a greater sense of humility and pride to be associated with \nthree more courageous individuals than Senator Lieberman, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Bayh, as we, the four horsemen, work to direct and \nguide a resolution which the four of us put together with the \nassistance of the President, through his surrogates, and the leadership \nof the Senate on both sides of the aisle. It is our best effort to \nprovide leadership to this body which we do so, the four of us, with a \ngreat sense of humility.\n  There is not a day in the life of those who serve in the Senate when \npolitics is not raised. It has been raised with regard to this issue. \nWhen Senator McCain and I approached Senator Lieberman in the past few \nweeks about his interest, Senator Lieberman stood up and said, I want \nto be counted from the very first.\n  I remember so well in 1990 and 1991 when I was privileged to work \nwith Senator Dole, Senator McCain, and many others, Senator Dole said: \nLet us find a partner for the 1991 resolution. This great Senator from \nConnecticut had just joined the Armed Services Committee. He was, if I \nmay say, a freshman Senator. I said to our leadership on this side: I \nthink there is our man. And the Senator proved to be just that man.\n  The resolution that the Senator and I and others drew up in 1991 \nprovided the basis for one of the great debates in contemporary times \nin the Senate, 3 days and 3 nights, culminating in a historic \nbipartisan vote. By a mere margin of only five votes did the Senate \npass and adopt that resolution which gave the President the support of \nthe Senate to follow through with his constitutional responsibilities. \nThat was George Bush, we call him ``old 41,'' President at that time, \nthe father of our President today.\n  I say to you, Senator, as the history of this institution is written, \nyou will properly take your place in history. You showed courage then, \ncourage now, and not politics.\n  Last night, we listened carefully to our President as he addressed \nthe Nation to provide the leadership necessary with regard to this very \nserious issue of Saddam Hussein and eliminating his weapons of mass \ndestruction. Speaking just for myself, but I think it is shared by \nother Senators, this President has shown remarkable courage. We would \nnot be here today in this debate, we would not be watching the debate \nin the United Nations on a possible 17th resolution, we would not be \nseeing our country focusing on this issue, had it not been for George \nBush, our President, having the foresight to see the essential need for \nthe United States to lead at this time. Not tomorrow, not the next day, \nnot the next month, not the next year, but now in the effort of the \nfree world to rid Saddam Hussein of the weapons of mass destruction.\n  We owe a debt of gratitude to that President, who, in clear, \nforthright, and often soft tones of voice, last night addressed the \nNation with the need for action now.\n  I thank our President. It is important, in my judgment, and, I think, \nthat of the three of my cosponsors, that the Congress and the President \nspeak with one voice on behalf of this Nation--one voice. It is my \nfervent hope this body will adopt this resolution, the House of \nRepresentatives will adopt the identical language which is before the \nHouse at this moment, and there be no air, no daylight, no distance \nperceived by anyone between the Congress and the President--arm in arm, \nleading the world towards a solution to this problem.\n  The President, time and time again, made tireless efforts, engaging \nheads of state and governments throughout the world to join. Now is the \ntime.\n  We will be visited today by the Secretary of State, who has \ncourageously worked on behalf of the President, with the nations at the \nUnited Nations, in framing a resolution which leaves no doubt in the \nmind of anyone that this Nation and other nations are together for an \ninspection regime. It will not be like the previous regimes but will \nhave clear directions clearly showing Saddam Hussein now is the time \nfor cooperation, not for thwarting the efforts of the team. Should this \nresolution be adopted and should they go in, and that is yet to be \ndetermined, clearly, the enforceability of their task is with the \ncommitment of the member nations of the union.\n  More will be said following the four of us as we speak about that \nresolution. Right now it is being debated largely behind closed doors. \nBut we know enough that our President and our Secretary of State have \nmade it eminently clear past efforts have failed, and if we are to \nundertake a 17th resolution, it must leave no doubt as to the outcome \nin terms of enforceability of carrying out that inspection.\n  The question is raised: Why now? Let's wait and see.\n  I say with no disrespect to those who raise it, but I say it for my \nown views, that is sort of: Give Saddam Hussein the benefit of the \ndoubt. I do not find anywhere in the history of that dictator, those \nfacts, that justify--whether it is the Senate, whether it is the House, \nwhether it is the Congress, whether it is the President, whether it is \nany nation in the world--that this man is entitled to the benefit of \nthe doubt that he will do the right thing now, tomorrow, or in the \nfuture. It is now we must act. For those who say take time and wait, \nthen point out what is the cost of waiting; what is the cost of waiting \nif he were to finish his program. We do not know exactly what is \nestablished with this nuclear program.\n  We know the courage of the Israeli government, I believe it was in \n1981, to go in and bomb that plant that was then clearly manufacturing \ncomponents for nuclear weapons. We have other bits of information from \nthe inspections that took place following the 1991 conflict that he \nclearly was endeavoring to build a nuclear weapon. More evidence is \ncoming in he is continuing to acquire the raw material, the parts, and \nthe other pieces that are essential to build a nuclear weapon. So there \nis no doubt he is propelling his nation forward to acquire it. What \nwould be the status of the states in the Middle East, indeed our own \nNation, or other parts of the world, if this man, given his past and \nhis proclivity to use poison gas against his own people, to behead \nthose in his own nation who have the courage to disagree with him--what \nis the cost of waiting?\n  I say most respectfully to those who want to wait and see and give \nhim the benefit of the doubt, do explain what is the cost if we wait \nuntil he acquires not only a nuclear capability but further builds upon \nthe stockpile of weapons of mass destruction in terms of biological and \nchemical weapons.\n\n  This is what the President said last night, very clearly. I would \nlike to read it:\n\n       Approving this resolution does not mean that military \n     action is imminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell \n     the United Nations, and all nations, that America speaks with \n     one voice and it is determined to make the demands of the \n     civilized world mean something.\n       Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator in \n     Iraq that his only . . . choice is full compliance, and the \n     time remaining for that choice is limited.\n\n  I think that is the persuasive case of why not and not wait for the \nfuture.\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       Some have argued we should wait, and that's an option.\n\n  He acknowledged that is a option.\n\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\n\n       In my view, it's the riskiest of all options, because the \n     longer we wait, the stronger and bolder Saddam Hussein will \n     become. . . .\n       As Americans, we want peace. We work and sacrifice for \n     peace. But there can be no peace if our security depends on \n     the will and whims of a ruthless and aggressive dictator. I'm \n     not willing to stake one American life on trusting Saddam \n     Hussein.\n\n  The American people understand that. They understand that, and I \nthink they will receive with gratitude the action of this body, as we \nwill pass this resolution most assuredly in the days to come.\n  Last, I will talk about one aspect of the weapons of mass destruction \nprogram in response to those who say, What's new? The four of us follow \nintelligence very carefully because of our respective assignments. But \nI did not realize until it is now in open literature Saddam Hussein had \nprogressed in his biological infrastructure to the point where he now \nhas his plants on truck beds: One, two, three, four trucks--just like \nthe ones you see every day on the highways of the United States--that \ncan be brought together at, I suppose, any number of places to \nmanufacture biological material. It can be containerized in small \nvials. Obviously it can be transported, given it is manufactured as \ntrucks move about.\n  As our President said very carefully last night, that can be placed \nin the hands of terrorists, the international organizations of terror, \nand transported to the United States through our open borders of \nfreedom. Those small vials can be released upon communities large and \nsmall, and wreak havoc and devastation.\n  We have seen that on 9/11, a year ago, we are no longer protected by \nthese great oceans, by the friendly nations--to the north, Canada, and \nour friends to the south. We are a vulnerable Nation. Saddam Hussein \nhas the capability either directly or indirectly to strike us.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Last sentence, and then I will yield.\n  As the President said, that strike could come and we cannot trace the \nfingerprints.\n  We are still trying to study who brought the anthrax against the U.S. \nSenate, the post offices--I reiterate, without fingerprints.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. May I say first how \ngrateful I am for his kind words towards this Senator. I return them in \nthe fullness of sincerity. One of the great honors and pleasures of the \nlast 14 years has been serving with you, but also getting to know you \nand considering you a friend. There is not a better person or gentleman \nor anyone more committed as a patriot to our country than the Senator \nfrom Virginia. I am honored once again to be working with him in this \ncause.\n  I appreciate what he has just said about the programs of weapons of \nmass destruction Saddam Hussein has, and particularly these programs of \nchemical and biological weapons.\n  I know the Senator has spent some time considering, and I wonder if \nyou might, to the extent you are able to, discuss matters in an open \nsession as to some of the concerns that I know you and I share about \nthe programs that Saddam Hussein's Iraq has now to develop not just \nballistic missiles to carry biological and chemical weapons but \nunmanned aerial vehicles, some of which are quite small and potentially \ncould threaten not only Saddam's neighbors there in the region but \npotentially could threaten us, the American people, here in the \ncontinental United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Virginia has \nexpired. Under the order, it was 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to extend my \nremarks for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to the Senator, you and I, on the Armed Services \nCommittee--as a matter of fact, several years ago, when I was \nprivileged to be chairman of that committee--initiated a program among \nall our U.S. services to move more in the direction of unmanned \nvehicles--aircraft, vehicles on the ground, and in every other way--\nrecognizing the tremendous advantages to that.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Myers, as well as \nothers, recently has said that he is pursuing that program \nunrelentingly to encapsule in small, sometimes large, unmanned \naircraft--just point them in a direction and away they go.\n  Now, just speaking from my own knowledge, not intelligence, I say to \nmy good friend, there are 1,000 hobby shops in America where anyone--or \nyou can go into catalogs--and you can buy model planes with a 6-foot \nwing span, and maybe it can carry only a small amount. But sometimes \nonly a small amount of a weapon of mass destruction, if released over a \ncommunity or otherwise disbursed, depending on the winds, can bring \nabout incredible devastation.\n  I say to the Senator, you are so right about that particular set of \nfacts. I tell you, America should be on alert. And we should show the \nsupport of this Congress behind our President at this time so that we \ncan send that message to the United Nations that this 17th resolution, \nif in fact it comes into being, has to be the last, the final. \nHopefully it will deter any use of force over and above what is \nnecessary to enforce the Resolution No. 17, I will call it.\n  But again, if Saddam Hussein does not cooperate on No. 17, then it \nhas to be made imminently clear to him that the member nations then \nhave no other recourse but to resort to the use of force, hopefully \ncollectively.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator. Our colleague from Indiana is \nwaiting to speak, but I want to just very briefly say to you again what \nyou know--and I hope to put some testimony into the Record--about the \ndevastating biological weapons that Saddam possesses, some for which we \ndo not have an effective cure or have an effective response.\n  I hesitate to even say this, but I think to show the seriousness of \nwhat we are about, I know there has been a lot of discussion: Does \nSaddam have nuclear weapons? How soon will he have them? Will it be 10 \nyears or 1 year or 5 years?\n  But does the Senator agree with me that the biological weapons \ncapacity Saddam has now, if delivered by an unmanned aerial vehicle, \ncould do far more damage--I am talking about death to people--than the \nkind of primitive nuclear weapon he might have in a year at best, 5 \nyears, 10 years?\n\n  In other words, the danger is here. It is clear and present, and it \nis now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the Senator is so correct in his views. \nWe know not what he might be able to build. Frankly, we do not know a \ngreat deal about what he has today by way of nuclear capacity. The best \nknowledge that is in the open is that he does not have a finished \nweapon, but we do not know whether it is 6 months, 6 years, or what \ntime it may be.\n  But that might be a single weapon or maybe two, whereas the \nbiological, in small containers, can be multiplied 100 times over in \n100 different locations. Therefore, the tragic death and injury to \nAmericans or others--as a matter of fact, we keep focusing on this \nNation. There are other nations that stand at peril to this dictator.\n  I must conclude to stay within the allocation of time. I say to my \nfriend, I look forward to our further debates on the floor. But I close \nby saying this vote which we will cast here has to be a vote of \nconscience, not influenced in any way by political considerations. And \nabove all in our hearts and minds will be the men and women of the \nArmed Forces who will undoubtedly bear the burden if it is necessary to \nuse force. May God bless them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4856\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may seek the indulgence of my \ncolleague from Indiana for just a moment, I am now prepared to send, on \nhis behalf, on behalf of Senator Warner and Senator McCain, the \noccupant of the Chair, Senator Landrieu, and others, a resolution, an \namendment in the nature of a substitute for S.J. Res. 45, which I ask \nthe clerk to call up at this time, and ask that the clerk, for the \nRecord, read the names of the initial cosponsors of the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] for himself, \n     Mr. Warner, Mr.\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\n     Bayh, Mr. McCain, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Miller, \n     Mr. Domenici, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n     Allard, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Helms, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4856.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.\n\n       The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by \n     the President to--\n       (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security \n     Council all relevant Security Council resolutions applicable \n     to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and\n       (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security \n     Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, \n     evasion and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies \n     with all relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the \n     Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be \n     necessary and appropriate in order to--\n       (1) defend the national security of the United States \n     against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and\n       (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions regarding Iraq.\n       (b) Presidential Determination.--In connection with the \n     exercise of the authority granted in subsection (a) to use \n     force the President shall, prior to such exercise or as soon \n     there after as may be feasible, but not later than 48 hours \n     after exercising such authority, make available to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate his determination that--\n       (1) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or \n     other peaceful means alone either (A) will not adequately \n     protect the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq or (B) is not likely to \n     lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions regarding Iraq; and\n       (2) acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with \n     the United States and other countries continuing to take the \n     necessary actions against international terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations, including those nations, \n     organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed \n     or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September \n     11, 2001.\n       (c) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution.\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) The President shall, at least once every 60 days, \n     submit to the Congress a report on matters relevant to this \n     joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the \n     exercise of authority granted in section 3 and the status of \n     planning for efforts that are expected to be required after \n     such actions are completed, including those actions described \n     in section 7 of Public Law 105-338 (the Iraq Liberation Act \n     of 1998).\n       (b) To the extent that the submission of any report \n     described in subsection (a) coincides with the submission of \n     any other report on matters relevant to this joint resolution \n     otherwise required to be submitted to Congress pursuant to \n     the reporting requirements of Public Law 93-148 (the War \n     Powers Resolution), all such reports may be submitted as a \n     single consolidated report to the Congress.\n       (c) To the extent that this information required by section \n     3 of Public Law 102-1 is included in the report required by \n     this section, such report shall be considered as meeting the \n     requirements of section 3 of Public Law 102-1.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The absence of a quorum has been suggested. \nThe clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Thank you, Madam President. It is good to be with you \ntoday. I am reassured by your presence. And I am grateful for the \nsupport of the Senator from Louisiana for our resolution.\n  It is an honor and privilege for me to join today with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Warner, Senator McCain, and my good \nfriend, Senator Lieberman, in support of this resolution granting the \nPresident of the United States the authority to defend our country.\n  Madam President, I support this resolution not because I favor a \nresort to war but because I believe this resolution gives our country \nthe best chance to maintain peace.\n  I support this resolution not because I favor America acting \nunilaterally, unless we must, but because I believe this resolution \ngives us the best opportunity to rally our allies and convince the \nUnited Nations to act with us, and in so doing give that international \ninstitution meaning for the resolutions that it adopts.\n  I favor this resolution because in a world where we have rogue \nregimes possessing weapons of mass death, and suicidal terrorists who \nare all too eager to use them against us, weapons of that nature in the \nhands of a regime such as Saddam Hussein's represents an unacceptable \nrisk to the safety and well-being of the American people.\n  As much as I wish we could ignore this threat, it is my heartfelt \nconviction that in all conscience we cannot.\n  Finally, along with my colleagues, I support this resolution because \nI believe we must learn the terrible lessons from the tragedy of \nSeptember 11, foremost among which is that we waited too long to \naddress the gathering danger in Afghanistan. If we had acted sooner, \nperhaps--just perhaps--we could have saved 3,000 innocent lives: men, \nwomen, and children. We waited too long to act. Let us not make that \nmistake again.\n  Unfortunately, in dealing with Saddam Hussein and the regime of Iraq, \nwe are dealing with a brutal dictator who understands one thing, and \none thing only: either the threat of force or the use of force.\n  We have tried everything else. We have tried economic sanctions for \nyears, to no avail. We have tried diplomacy for over a decade. It has \navailed us nothing. We do not have the covert means presently to deal \nwith this tyrant. And so as my colleagues have indicated, there is \nnothing left to us to defend ourselves except an ultimatum to Saddam: \nDisarm or else.\n  For those who believe we can remove the weapons of mass destruction \nfrom this regime without the credible threat of the use of force, I \nregrettably must say they are engaged in wishful thinking. It is my \nheartfelt conviction that the best and only chance we have for a \npeaceful resolution to this problem, for him to give up these \ninstruments of mass death, is to present him with a credible ultimatum \nthat the survival of his regime depends upon doing so, that any other \ncourse of action will lead to his overthrow, and that alone will \npreserve the peace, the safety, and the security of our country.\n  I believe this course presents us with the best opportunity to rally \nour allies and convince the United Nations to act with us. We should \nmake every effort--as Senator McCain indicated in his colloquy with \nSenator Lieberman and as the President indicated last night--to \nconvince the United Nations and our allies of the justice of our cause. \nWe are stronger when we act together, so we must seek a consensus for \nthis course of action.\n  Unfortunately, the United Nations has a long history of equivocation \nwhen it comes to taking difficult steps to enforce even its own \nresolutions. Our allies, as much as we cherish their support, also have \na mixed record in this regard. Need I remind the Senate that for too \nlong we waited while genocide was perpetrated on the very doorstep of \nEurope in Bosnia and Kosovo? It was only when the United States of \nAmerica demonstrated a willingness to take action to bring that \nlamentable chapter to a conclusion that the United Nations and our \nallies demonstrated the will to act with us.\n  It is only through strong leadership, leadership by the United \nStates, that we will preserve the peace, rally our allies, and convince \nthe United Nations to enforce its own resolutions. If these efforts \navail us not, it is my heartfelt conviction that weapons of mass death \nin the hands of a brutal dictator such\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\nas Saddam Hussein, combined with the presence of suicidal terrorist \norganizations that would all too eagerly use these instruments of mass \ndestruction against us, represent an unacceptable risk for the safety \nand well-being of the American people.\n  I hope Saddam will do the right thing. I pray that he will do the \nright thing and give up these weapons of mass destruction. Regrettably, \nbased upon the track record of his past behavior, I believe he probably \nwill not.\n  Weapons of mass destruction represent an indispensable part of his \npower. Saddam Hussein is a megalomaniac who has attempted to project \nthat power around the region. As we all know, he invaded Kuwait. He has \ninvaded Iran. He has launched missiles at Saudi Arabia and Israel. He \nhas killed hundreds of thousands, including tens of thousands of his \nfellow citizens.\n  I ask my colleagues to anticipate a world in which we do not act. \nWhat will Saddam do? Can there be much doubt that he will attempt to \ndevelop the ability to deter our future action by threatening us with \nthe use of weapons of mass destruction? I believe there is not. If he \ncannot develop this deterrent on his own, I believe there is little \ndoubt he will reach out to al-Qaida or Hezbollah or other international \ninstitutions of terrorism to develop a deterrent to threaten us, with \nunacceptable consequences, if in the future we decide to restrain his \naggressive actions.\n\n  If there is only a 10-percent chance or a 15-percent chance that \nweapons of mass death will find their way from Iraq into the hands of \nsuicidal terrorists, I believe this is a risk to the American people \nthat we cannot afford to run.\n  The world changed forever on September 11. The principal lesson of \nthat tragedy is that America waited too long to address the gathering \ndanger in Afghanistan. We must not make that mistake again.\n  To those who say, what is the rush? why can't we wait? I respond by \nasking the question: How long must we wait? Until the missiles have \nbeen launched? Until smallpox, anthrax, or VX nerve agent has found its \nway into our country? Is that how long we should wait?\n  The consequences of error in this instance are much too great. The \ndeaths next time might not be numbered in the threes of thousands but \n30,000 or 300,000.\n  To respond to the question of my friend from Connecticut, in all \nlikelihood Saddam Hussein possesses smallpox. We are not sure whether \nhe has weaponized it yet. There is a 50/50 proposition. But if he has \nand if that would find its way into our country, which would not be too \ndifficult to accomplish, the consequences would be catastrophic.\n  We conducted a simulated exercise of a smallpox attack--I believe it \nwas called Dark Winter--simulating a smallpox outbreak put into a \nventilation system in a mall in Oklahoma City. The consequences were \ncatastrophic: Tens of thousands of deaths, hundreds of thousands of \nillnesses; civil law broke down. These are the kinds of consequences \nthat would be all too real were we to stay our hand.\n  I remind my colleagues that in a world of imperfect intelligence--and \nthere will always be imperfect intelligence--if we wait, we run the \nvery real risk of having waited too long. We have seen the kind of \ntragedy to which that can lead.\n  I ask all of us to consider, if this debate had been conducted 2 \nyears ago and my colleagues and I had laid a resolution upon this desk \nthat said, there is danger brewing in Afghanistan, it threatens the \nUnited States of America, we need to take it seriously, and we must act \nbefore it is too late, all of the arguments that are being made against \nthe current resolution would also have been made at that time. As we \nnow know, the arguments have all been mistaken. They are mistaken today \nas well.\n  To those who say the threat is not imminent, after 9/11, how long can \nwe afford to wait? To those who say regime change is not an appropriate \nreason for acting, I say weapons of mass destruction and the regime of \nSaddam Hussein are one and indivisible. To remove weapons of mass \ndestruction, we must remove that regime. To think anything else is to \ndelude ourselves.\n  For those who believe the United Nations' approval is necessary for \nour action, I say it is preferential but we cannot afford to give that \ngreat body veto power on America's right to defend itself. To those who \nsay we need allied support, I agree. But this is an argument of the \nchicken and the egg. It is only with American leadership and taking a \nstrong hand in this instance that we will receive the kind of united \nallied support we seek.\n  To those who ask the question, What will we do after our victory? I \nsay that is a good question, but can the regime in Iraq be worse? I \nthink not. We could begin to rebuild that country in a way that would \nprovide a positive example to the people of that region about the \nprinciples and the ideals upon which America stands.\n  Our eventual victory in the war against terror will be won as much by \nthe values and the principles we embrace and advocate as by the force \nof our arms. This gives us an opportunity to put those principles and \nvalues into action.\n  To those who say we must exhaust all of our alternatives before \nacting, I simply say that we already have. In conclusion, let me \nsummarize by saying this: I and my colleagues support this resolution \nnot because we desire war but because it is our heartfelt conviction \nthat this is the best and only path to preserve the peace. My \ncolleagues and I support this resolution not because we favor the U.S. \nacting alone, but because we know that, by taking a strong stand, it \ngives us the best opportunity to garner U.N. support and to rally our \nallies to our side.\n  We support this resolution because we believe that the lesson \nlearned, very painfully and so tragically by our country on September \n11 of last year, is that we wait in an era of mass terror at our peril. \nWe were mistaken then; let us not be mistaken again. Let us act to \nprotect our country and, in so doing, discharge our constitutional \nduty. It is my privilege and honor to do so in such esteemed company.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAYH. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Indiana indicated to me when we had \ndiscussions about this resolution, introduced by Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Warner, the Senator, and myself, about the fact that in his \nhome State there is great concern about going to war. In fact, he \nmentioned to me that was the majority of calls and communications he \nhad with the people of Indiana, which he was privileged to serve as \nGovernor as well as a Senator. In other words, the Senator has a fairly \ngood finger on the pulse of the people he represents. That skepticism \nwas based on what concerns and what led the Senator from Indiana to \nconclude that it was important for him not only to support this \nresolution but play a role as a major sponsor of this legislation. I \nthink it is important for the people of this Nation and our colleagues \nto understand that, since his State is part of the heartland of \nAmerica, as is Arizona. Many people feel otherwise.\n  I am very interested in hearing what the Senator from Indiana has \nviewed as the factors leading him to play such a visible, as well as \nimportant, role in this resolution.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank my colleague. Our State is known as the crossroads \nof America. With my colleagues' States, I believe we represent the \ncommon sense and wisdom of the American people.\n  On my visits home, and in communications from constituents, there has \nbeen an expression of concern about our present set of circumstances. I \nmust say to my friend that it is a concern that I share.\n  I did not come easily to the conclusion that we have collectively \nreached. There is reluctance in my heart, as I know there is in the \nother Senators', to contemplate the use of force. But I reached the \nconclusion that we were simply left with no other credible alternative \nto protect the safety and well-being of the American people.\n\n  As you indicated in your colloquy with Senator Lieberman, and as I \nindicated in my own remarks, and the President spoke to last evening, I \nhope beyond anything else that this does not come to war; that the use \nof force will not be necessary. But I also believe that the best chance \nto achieve that outcome is the credible threat of the use of force. \nSaddam Hussein responds\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\nto nothing else. If he does not disarm voluntarily--as I hope he will, \nand we all pray he will--I have also concluded that his possession of \nweapons of mass death, and the real likelihood that he will develop the \ncapability for using them against us to deter us from restraining him \nat some future point, or the risk of those weapons--nuclear, \nbiological, chemical weapons--falling into the hands of suicidal \nterrorists represent too great a risk to our country.\n  As I tried to outline in my remarks, I believe the principal lesson--\nand I asked this question to the head of the CIA: What is the principal \nlesson we learned from 9/11?\n  He responded directly and said the principal lesson was that we \nwaited too long to address the gathering threat in Afghanistan.\n  So I am convinced we should act sooner rather than later to defend \nour country because we have seen the terrible consequences that can \nresult. For all those reasons, I have reached the conclusion that this \nresolution is necessary.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for one further question?\n  Mr. BAYH. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have one additional question for the Senator from \nIndiana. He mentioned, as the Senator from Connecticut has and as the \nSenator from Virginia has, there is great concern about this issue \namongst our constituents. Yet I have found in communications with the \npeople of my State, both directly and from being on talk shows and in \nspeeches and things such as that, that the reassurance given to them \nthat we are taking every possible action by going to the Congress of \nthe United States and having this debate on the resolution of approval, \nwhich represents the people of this country in both bodies, by going to \nthe Security Council and getting a very important resolution through \nthe Security Council--which has not been achieved yet, but I think is \npart of the very important part of the process we are going through--I \nfind that people are far more comforted and feel much more supportive \nin a realization that this is the last option and not the first option.\n  Perhaps some months ago the impression was created that this was the \nfirst option the President wanted to pursue when, clearly, I think he \nhas displayed, by what he is doing and by how he spoke last night, that \nthat is not the case. Has the Senator had that feeling?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has used 15 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Indiana may \nrespond to the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I would say three things to my colleague. \nFirst, I believe he is correct. I think there was an initial impression \nthat our Government had a preference for unilateral action, perhaps \nwithout exhausting every other alternative. I do not believe that to be \ntrue. We have begun to correct that. I should compliment my colleague \nfrom the State of Indiana, Senator Lugar, who played an important role \nin convincing the administration to reach out and pursue other \nalternatives with the U.N. and our allies.\n\n  The Senator from Arizona has raised two very good points. When I go \nhome, people say to me: We understand the danger and we wish it didn't \nhave to come to war.\n  That is a reluctance that I share. My response would be, looking at \nthe brutal nature of his regime, and Saddam Hussein's history, I \nbelieve the best chance to remove the weapons, without coming to war, \nis to present him with a credible ultimatum. That is what we are doing \nhere.\n  People also say: Senator, we wish we were not in it alone, and that \nwe had the U.N. with us and more allies with us.\n  As my colleague knows--and I think we share this belief--my strong \nconviction is that our best chance to gather that support is through \nstrong American leadership. Only then will the U.N. and our allies \nrally to our side, when we show our own determination.\n  So the best chance for a peaceful outcome, the best chance for a \nunited front with our allies and with the imprimatur of the U.N., I \nbelieve, is by giving a strong hand to the President to present Saddam \nHussein with no alternative; and when I have a chance to relay that to \nthe people of Indiana, they understand.\n  Nobody wants war, but they understand this is the best avenue to \navoid that, while also ensuring the security of our country.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  One of the reasons why I return to this particular aspect of this \nissue is, as the Senator from Virginia knows well, or better than I--\nand others do, too--we once embarked into a conflict that the American \npeople were not well informed on and, over time, they did not support. \nI believe this debate is important. I respect and admire the views of \nthose who disagree with this resolution, but we will not enter this \nconflict without it being fully understood by the American people, as \nto what is at stake and why we are doing it. That is why I continue to \ngo back to this issue of whether our constituents will be satisfied; \nthat if, as a last resort, we enter into a conflict, it will not be \nbecause they have not been informed.\n  Madam President:\n\n       The retention of weapons of mass destruction capabilities \n     is self-evidently the core objective of the [Iraqi] regime, \n     for it has sacrificed all other domestic and foreign policy \n     goals to this singular aim.\n\n  So concludes a recent report by the International Institute for \nStrategic Studies.\n  I want to repeat that. The International Institute for Strategic \nStudies said:\n\n       The retention of weapons of mass destruction capabilities \n     is self-evidently the core objective of the [Iraqi] regime, \n     for it has sacrificed all other domestic and foreign policy \n     goals to this singular aim.\n\n  The question facing all of us in this body is whether Saddam \nHussein's aggressive weapons development in defiance of this gulf war \ncease-fire in the decade of U.N. Security Council resolutions can stand \nwhen the cost of inaction against this gathering threat could be \nintolerably high.\n  I am proud to join Senators Lieberman, Warner, and Bayh in laying \ndown our amendment providing the President the necessary authority to \ndefend the national security of the United States against the \ncontinuing threat posed by Iraq and enforce all relevant U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions against Saddam Hussein's regime.\n  I welcome this debate. I am confident it will result in a resounding \nvote of support for the President as he moves to confront the threat we \nface in Iraq. I also believe it will be a powerful signal to the world \nthat the American people are united in their determination to meet and \nto end this menace.\n  Our diplomacy at the United Nations will benefit from a strong and \nbipartisan congressional vote in favor of this resolution. Our enemies \nwill understand that we are united in our resolve to confront the \ndanger posed by a dictator whose possession of the worst weapons and \nsystematic defiance of every norm the civilized world holds dear \nthreaten all who value freedom and law.\n  Congress has already spoken on this matter. On August 14, 1998, \nPresident Clinton signed into law Senate Joint Resolution 54 which \ndeclared that ``the Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable \nbreach of its international obligations'' and urged the President ``to \ntake appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and \nrelative laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with \nits international obligations.''\n  On October 31, 1998, then-President Clinton signed into law the Iraq \nLiberation Act which stated:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a domestic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  That was October 31, 1998, the Iraq Liberation Act signed into law by \nthe President of the United States.\n  Then, as now, Democrats and Republicans recognized the menace posed \nby Saddam Hussein's arsenal and his ambitions. Unfortunately, after 4 \ndays of bombing Iraq in Operation Desert Fox in December 1998--4 days \nof bombing--the United States and the international community \neffectively walked away from the Iraq problem, freeing Iraq from a \nweapons inspection regime that, by that time, had become so compromised \nby Saddam Hussein's intransigence as to be completely ineffective.\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\nNothing has taken place over the past 4 years, even as a porous \nsanctions regime and illicit oil revenues have enriched the regime. \nOver this time, Saddam Hussein's threat to the world has grown without \nhindrance.\n  Regrettably, some of the very same permanent members of the Security \nCouncil whose vote for a new resolution on Iraq we are now courting \nactively conspired against rigorous weapons inspections in Iraq during \nthe 1990s, for reasons that had more to do with their narrow commercial \ninterests than with the world's interest in getting rid of the menace \nposed by Saddam Hussein's weapons of terror.\n  The threat is not new. Saddam Hussein has been in gross violation of \nthe terms of the cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf war since that \nwar's end, as a host of United Nations Security Council resolutions \npassed since 1991 can attest. As The Economist has written:\n\n       He has treated inspections as a continuation of the Gulf \n     War by other means.\n\n  After years of stymied efforts to enforce the inspections regime, the \ninternational community effectively sanctioned Saddam's impunity after \nit became clear he would never allow intrusive inspections, and once it \nbecame apparent to many Americans that the only way to end his defiance \nwas to end his regime. The withering under U.N. Security Council \nauspices of the international inspections regime over the course of a \ndecade, and Iraq's decision not to even consider renewed inspections \nonly under the threat of force today, make clear that unvarnished faith \nin the ability of the U.N. Security Council or a new corps of \ninspectors to disarm Saddam's regime is misplaced.\n  Over the course of this debate, the Senate will consider amendments \nthat would require Security Council authorization before the United \nStates could act to enforce a decade of Security Council resolutions, \nand that would narrow the focus of American policy to Iraq's \ndisarmament, rather than against the range of Saddam's offenses against \nhis people and his neighbors and the continuing threat his regime \nitself poses to American national security.\n  These debates will be important. I believe the President's position \nwill prevail. Congress cannot foresee the course of this conflict and \nshould not unnecessarily constrain the options open to the President to \ndefeat the threat we have identified in Saddam Hussein. Once Congress \nacts on a resolution, only the President will have to make the choices, \nwith American forces likely deployed in the region to carry out his \norders, that will end the threat Saddam Hussein's weapons and his \nambitions pose to the world. Congress should give the President the \nauthority he believes he needs to protect American national security \nagainst an often irrational dictator who has demonstrated a history of \naggression outside his borders and a willingness to use weapons of mass \ndestruction against all enemies, foreign and domestic.\n  This is not just another Arab despot, not one of many tyrants who \nrepress their people from within the confines of their countries. As \nNew Yorker writer Jeffrey Goldberg, who recently traveled across \nnorthern Iraq, recently wrote in Slate:\n\n       There are, of course, many repugnant dictators in the \n     world; a dozen or so in the Middle East alone. But Saddam \n     Hussein is a figure of singular repugnance, and singular \n     danger. To review: there is no dictator in power anywhere in \n     the world who has, so far in his career, invaded two \n     neighboring countries; fired ballistic missiles at the \n     civilians of two other neighboring countries; tried to have \n     assassinated an ex-president of the United States; harbored \n     al Qaeda fugitives . . . ; attacked civilians with chemical \n     weapons; attacked the soldiers of an enemy with chemical \n     weapons; conducted biological weapons experiments on human \n     subjects; committed genocide; and . . . [weaponized] \n     aflotoxin, a tool of mass murder and nothing else. I do not \n     know how any thinking person could believe that Saddam \n     Hussein is a run-of-the-mill dictator. No one else comes \n     close . . . to matching his extraordinary and variegated \n     record of malevolence.\n\n  In light of Saddam Hussein's record of aggression, prohibited weapons \ndeployment, and consistent rejection of every international obligation \nimposed on him, I believe the burden of proof in this debate must rest \non those who believe inspections could actually achieve the disarmament \nof Iraq, rather than on those of us who are deeply skeptical that \ninspections alone could accomplish our common goal. History shows that \nwe will most likely not disarm Iraq without changing the regime in \nBaghdad--a regime whose continued existence is predicated on possession \nof weapons of mass destruction. As arms control experts Gary Milhollin \nand Kelly Motz have noted:\n\n       Unless the Iraqi dictator should suddenly and totally \n     reverse course on arms inspection and everything that goes \n     with it, or be forced into early retirement--in other words, \n     unless Saddam Hussein's Iraq ceases to be Saddam Hussein's \n     Iraq--inspections will never work.\n\n  Similarly, given the Security Council's failure to enforce its own \narticle 7 resolutions against Iraq, which are backed by the threat of \nforce and have the sanctity of international law, I believe the burden \nof proof in this debate must rest on those who can defend the Council's \nrecord with regard to Iraq and can convince the rest of us that the \nCouncil's judgment, rather than that of our Commander in Chief, should \nbe the final authority on a matter that so directly affects American \nsecurity.\n  Important participants in this debate support the President's \ndetermination to use military force to bring about Iraq's disarmament \nbut would constrain the President's authority to act against Iraq to \nuphold Security Council resolutions related to repression within Iraq, \nIraq's support for terrorism, and other issues. This approach would \nlimit the President's authority to achieving only Iraq's disarmament \nand would explicitly oppose a comprehensive challenge to his tyrannical \nregime. I believe those who hold this view have an obligation to \nexplain why they would constrain the President's authority to use \nmilitary force in ways he believes would tie his hands and raise \nunacceptably high the threshold for ordering military action to defend \nthe national security of the United States.\n  Others will argue that Saddam Hussein can be deterred--that he is a \nrational actor who understands that acting on his ambitions will \nthreaten his regime. But deterrence has failed utterly in the past. I \nfail to see how waiting for some unspecified period of time, allowing \nSaddam's nuclear ambitions to grow unchecked, will ever result in a \nstable deterrence regime. Not only would deterrence condemn the Iraqi \npeople to more unspeakable tyranny, it would condemn Saddam's neighbors \nto perpetual instability. And once Iraq's nuclear ambitions are \nrealized, no serious person could expect the Iraqi threat to diminish. \nAgain, the burden in this debate rests on those who believe American \npolicy has actually been successful in containing the threat Saddam's \nregime poses to the world.\n  There is no greater responsibility we face as Members of this body \nthan voting to place the country on a course that could send young \nAmericans to war in her defense. All of us must weigh our consciences \ncarefully. Although we may hold different views of how to respond to \nthe threat posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq, the very fact that we are \nholding this free debate, and that the fate of nations and peoples \nother than our own will be determined by the outcome of our actions, \nserves as a reminder that we are a great Nation, united in freedom's \ndefense, and called once again to make the world safe for freedom's \nblessings to flourish. The quality of our greatness will determine the \ncharacter of our response.\n  I want to again thank my colleagues for the introduction of this \nresolution. I think it will take place at some time within the next few \nminutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I am proud to follow my colleague from \nArizona, who has been an outspoken Senator on the issue of our \nrelationship to Iraq and to the current regime, constantly questioning, \nappropriately so, the role of Saddam Hussein and the risk he presents \nto our country.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, if the Senator will yield, I ask for one \nminute to say to my good friend, Senator McCain, his leadership on this \nissue, in helping with the drafting of this resolution and working \nparticularly with Senator Lieberman and Senator Bayh, has been \ninvaluable.\n  I wanted to get into a colloquy with Senator McCain, but I was drawn \naway\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\nfrom the floor for a moment. Maybe we will have that colloquy a little \nlater.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Let me thank the Senator from Virginia for those comments, \nand certainly thank him for his leadership on this resolution. I also \nappreciate the leadership of the Senator from Arizona.\n  I am one of those who early on in August, and into early September, \nspoke with some degree of hesitation because I thought it was important \nwhat is happening today happen; that our country become fully engaged \nin this debate; and that the President make his case before the world \nand before the American people. That has happened.\n  As we know, for more than a decade Saddam Hussein has defied the \ninternational community, flagrantly ignoring and violating dozens of \nU.N. resolutions. Today, intelligence has produced beyond doubt that \nSaddam Hussein continues to acquire and produce chemical and biological \nweapons. It is also very apparent this dictator continues his quest to \ndevelop nuclear weapons.\n  Last night, our President made that most important speech to the \nNation. Much of what was spoken last night was the reality of the risk. \nWe should make no mistake, the acquiring of weapons of mass destruction \nby Saddam Hussein is a very clear, imminent, and present danger to the \nUnited States, our allies, and to the stability of the Middle East. To \ndo nothing in response to this buildup of weapons and this threat would \nbe irresponsible on the part of our Nation and this body. We cannot sit \nback and wait on an aggressive act of terrorism to occur and \nconsequently be forced into a position where we must face our fellow \nAmericans and explain a horrific act that could have been prevented. It \nwould be imprudent and irresponsible as a Senator of the United States, \nwho is sworn to protect the freedoms of this great Nation and to defend \nour fellow countrymen.\n  In this new century and in a post-9/11 era, it is clear we face a new \nthreat. Unfortunately, this new threat requires a course of action \npreviously not undertaken in order to deter this menace to our freedoms \nand to our peace. However, we must take this new course to defend our \nNation and our allies responsibly and with assurance. Remember, this is \na regime that ordered the use of chemical weapons against its own \npeople; invaded two neighbors; committed genocide against more than \n50,000 northern Iraqis; drove 2 million refugees into neighboring \ncountries; launched ballistic missiles into different countries; \ndestroyed over 4,000 villages in Iraq, and on a daily basis fires at \nU.S. and coalition aircraft patrolling the United Nations no-fly zones.\n  As a matter of fact, since the year 2000, Iraq has fired upon U.S. \nand British aircraft over 1,600 times. This year alone, Iraq has fired \non the United States and Great Britain 406 times. These acts are the \ntip of the iceberg of a long list of violations as Saddam Hussein \nattempts to provoke the United States and her allies. As a result, it \nis clear and evident we have a moral obligation to the international \ncommunity to halt further threats and attacks by this dictator. Since \nSeptember 11, 2001, many in Congress have asked the question: Why did \nthe events of this day, September 11, 2001, occur? And more \nimportantly, how could these tragedies have been prevented?\n  Let me say that again. Many Senators, and I am one of them, have \nasked how September 11 could have been prevented.\n  As the goal of congressional investigations into our intelligence \ncommunities is aimed at preventing these incidents in the future, so, \ntoo, is the opportunity before us to prevent attacks by a rogue regime. \nIn the future, I am certain no Senator wants to be placed in the \nposition where we will have to call an investigation and ask why a \ntragedy has occurred at the hands of Saddam Hussein, and why it was not \nprevented when we knew it could happen and we had the opportunity to do \nsomething about it.\n  In order to avoid an ugly predicament, the option of prevention is in \nplace today. Today we must ask ourselves, In the future, do we want, \nonce again, to pose the same question that has now haunted us for over \na year? When the civilian population of our country becomes the target \ninstead of our men and women in uniform, then an offensive role of \nforeign policy is demanded over what I believe is currently a defensive \nor a reactionary form of foreign policy.\n  Since World War II, the United States has been the leader of the \ninternational world. We have made decisions, taken calculated risks, \nand engaged ourselves where no other nation would. However, at the end \nof the day, we have always led and/or brought along our allies. Once \nagain, it is now evident the time is here for the United States to \nlead. It is prudent for our allies to follow. I believe most of them \nknow that.\n  Had we known the events of last year were going to occur, we would \nhave made every effort to stop them, to save the loss of thousands of \nAmerican lives. I am certain the people of this Nation and this body \nwould have called for and demanded all types of preemptive actions to \nstop the atrocities instead of, as we did, helplessly watching them \noccur. We were locked in what I believe was a post-cold war mindset \nthat, in part, denied the obvious and rested on the false premise it \njust simply could not happen in this country.\n  Like previous warning signs seen throughout history, we are again \nwitnessing the ominous warnings that Saddam Hussein intends to threaten \nthe Middle East region of the world and the United States. In light of \nthis, I cannot sit back, in good conscience, and wait for Saddam \nHussein to improve his weapons of mass destruction before he occupies \nand threatens foreign countries, or worse, harms Americans and American \ninterests and American friends.\n  As a free and democratic Nation, we have a responsibility that \nrequires a thoughtful, open approach. As we embark on a new path to \ndefend this Nation currently, we are, as the President did last night \nand, of course, a few weeks ago, addressing the United Nations, \nconsulting with Congress and now working with and having had the \nresolution just presented to the Congress, forced or helped produce the \ndebate in the Senate. It is evident by this process and by the steps \ntaken, any decision we make will not be in haste. I am confident the \nmanner in which our citizens will be informed will set a new precedent \nfor future Congresses and for future administrations.\n  This body, this Nation, and this President are methodically weighing \nthe options on the table and assessing the threats we face. We have to \ninclude we want and need international support. Fortunately, we \ncurrently have the support of some of our closest allies. I do not want \nto stray from working with the United Nations, of course. We will work \nwith them, and we are. Right now, Colin Powell is pursuing a new \nresolution out of the Security Council. At the same time, I recognize \nin the end, in the defense of this Nation, it is the responsibility of \nthis President and of this Congress to make sure that happens. It is \ncritically important that in the end, if you abide by the concept \nwritten in the book, ``The Law of Nations,'' then we have no recourse \nbut to act ourselves, if we believe a failure to act would cost lives, \nput our freedoms at risk, and put our citizens at risk.\n  While Article 51 of the United Nations charter is not so clearly \ndefined, we have seen in recent history preemptive action taken by \nnations that were upheld by the U.N. For example, in 1962, President \nKennedy took preemptive measures during the Cuban missile crisis by \nswiftly imposing a naval quarantine on Cuba to halt the delivery of \noffensive weapons by the Soviet Union. In 1967, Israel launched \npreemptive attacks on several Arab States after Iraq, Saudi Arabia, \nJordan, and Syria began moving troops to the Israeli border.\n\n  In 1991, the United States committed to liberate Kuwait. In 1991, the \nUnited States was then, as we are now, leading an effort. By the time \nthe conflict in Iraq began, we had the support of the international \ncommunity to carry out our objective.\n  I am confident, should we decide to use force, by the time the United \nStates and her closest allies engage Iraq, we will again have the \nsupport of the international community.\n  It is called the responsibility of leadership. It is recognized as \nthe role we play in the world today. I say this because the \ninternational community realizes the evidence is clear when it\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\ncomes to Saddam Hussein. In addition, Saddam Hussein will once again \nviolate U.N. resolutions, further invalidating that body, and denying \nweapons inspectors access in a way that should be open and complete and \nwithout any form of restriction.\n  I do not take this vote lightly when it comes, as men and women \nacross the State of Idaho and across the country are put in harm's way. \nFor those who have decided to wear the uniform of our armed services, I \nwant to assure the people of Idaho and the United States, any decision \nmade regarding the use of force will be made with confidence, in \nconsultation with Congress, and with the interests of the security of \nthis great Nation; foremost in all of our minds.\n  I believe the justification for engagement has been made and the \noption to use force will be granted. I believe we must still have as an \nend game, an exit strategy, a recognition of the role we play in a \npost-Saddam-Hussein Iraq, if that is to occur, and I believe this \nPresident, along with quality people he has placed around him, will \ncontinue to consult with this Congress as those strategies are \ndeveloped. I am confident we will pursue all means, as is evident today \nby the efforts of this administration. But in the end, there is the \nmost important responsibility for the Senate of the United States to \nplay. That is to do what we are doing here, to speak out on it, to \nallow the American people to know all the differences that occur as it \ncomes to facing a most important issue like this.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia for the leadership he has \ndemonstrated. He recognizes the significance and the importance of this \ndebate and the decision that will ultimately be made in the course of \nthis week as we stand in support of the Commander in Chief and the \nPresident of the United States, in full consultation with the Congress, \nas we shape a foreign policy that is a policy of decades to come, in \nrecognition that for the first time in this Nation's history, it is the \ncitizen, not the soldier, who becomes the target of the new wars. With \nthat, a new form of foreign policy, a new relationship, and a new \ndialog for this country has just begun.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd \nbe recognized for up to 15 minutes at 12:15 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Did the Senator wish to make a remark?\n  Mr. WARNER. I wanted to reply for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield, without losing my right to the floor, to the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to thank our colleague and compliment him on a \nvery fine recitation of the facts relating to the vote we will soon \ntake.\n  The Senator raised the important question of the preemptive issue. \nThat has been an issue on the minds of a number of our colleagues. If \nhe would allow me, I ask unanimous consent to have printed, following \nmy remarks, a list of the times the Senator enumerated, the times the \nPresidents of the United States, going back as far as 1901, have \ninitiated action preemptively to protect the security interests of this \ncountry. They have done it under the well-recognized international law \nor maxim of anticipatory self-defense.\n  With the advent of high-tech now, with so many other changed factors \nthroughout our 215-year history of this Republic and this body of the \nSenate, there have to be changes. The Senator was right on point of the \nneed this time to recognize those changes and to understand better this \ndoctrine of taking preemptive action, if that is necessary to protect \nthe security interests of this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Questions: Has the United States ever conducted \n     ``preemptive'' military operations before?\n       Yes: Panama (Colombia)--1901; Dominican Republic--1904, \n     1914, 1965; Honduras--1912; Nicaragua--1926; Lebanon--1958; \n     Cuba (Naval Quarantaine)--1962; Grenada--1983; Libya--1986; \n     Panama (Just Cause)--1989; Somalia--1992; Sudan/Afghanistan--\n     August 1998; Iraq (Desert Fox)--December 1998; and Kosovo--\n     March 1999.\n       International law recognizes a concept of ``anticipatory \n     self-defense'' if a country is imminently threatened.\n       And there are other examples--but the bottom line is that \n     confronting or striking Iraq is not preemptive. We have been \n     in conflict with Iraq for twelve years and they have never \n     complied with original terms for ending conflict.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  I agree. This country, this Commander in Chief, and we as Senators \ncannot be denied the right to take preemptive action when clear \nevidence indicates that the citizens of our country are at risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I see the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut wanted to speak. Does he wish to speak at this point?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. I wonder if \nthe Senator--I know the Senator wishes to speak for more than 15 \nminutes--if he would allow me to speak for not more than 7 or 8 minutes \nnow, without yielding his right to the floor thereafter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, as the debate continues, I want to \naddress myself to some of the history and also to some of the threat \ntoday. This is a most interesting book that somebody gave me, that is \nmost timely. It came out very recently. I don't know the exact date. It \nis called ``The Threatening Storm: The Case for Invading Iraq.'' It is \nwritten by Kenneth Pollack, who worked for the Central Intelligence \nAgency. In the period of 1990, he was one of only three who earlier in \n1990 were advising their superiors, and then ultimately the President \nof the United States, that an Iraqi attack against Kuwait was imminent, \nit was going to happen. Over time, he worked for the National Security \nCouncil under President Clinton. He is now at the Saban Center, a think \ntank here in Washington associated with the Brookings Institution.\n  This is a most compelling piece of work. It speaks history here. It \ntalks about the great history--the Senator from West Virginia is in the \nChamber--the great classic history of Iraq. This, after all, is the \nplace where the Biblical Garden of Eden grew, along beside the Tigris \nand the Euphrates. It is the place where Abraham, the father of the \nthree great monotheistic faiths was when God called out to him and \nfound his heart steadfast. Of course, in succeeding times it has had \ngreat periods of progress and leadership--unfortunately, not in recent \ntimes.\n  But as we deal with Saddam today--those of us, including myself, who \nfavor the resolution we have offered as an amendment, a substitute \ntoday--we tend to recite phrases about what a brutal dictator Saddam \nis, and his ambitions. He has used weapons of mass destruction. I think \nin this debate from time to time we have to go back to the details.\n  There is a brief biography, in this book, of Saddam, of the radical \nupbringing he had, of the extent to which he fell under the so-called \npan-Arabist influences, to create a power that would gain control over \nthe entire Arab world. I want to read one quote from this book--again, \n``The Threatening Storm'' by Kenneth Pollack:\n\n       Saddam considers himself a great man of history, someone \n     marked to accomplish great deeds. In his vast personality \n     cult he is constantly compared with great figures of Iraq's \n     past.\n       Saddam believes himself destined to be the new leader of \n     the Arabs, and he makes it apparent that this role will be a \n     political-military role, meaning that he will achieve his \n     position through some combination of conquest and acclaim. \n     Addressing a unit of the Republican Guard, Saddam proclaimed \n     that the honor of the Arab nation could not be achieved \n     unless ``Iraq's arm reached out [beyond Iraqi territory] to \n     every point in the Arab homeland.'' He has worked assiduously \n     to make Iraq strong so that it can dominate the region \n     militarily, acquire new territorial prizes, and become the \n     champion of the Arabs. Saddam has said often and loudly that \n     his goal is to create a new Arab union of some kind, headed \n     by a powerful Iraq, that will be a new superpower.\n\n  This is based on a thorough research of Saddam's history, of his \nstatements,\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\nof his actions. Why did he invade Iran in the 1980s? Why did he invade \nKuwait in the early 1990s? It is all part of realizing this ambition. \nWhy has he developed weapons of mass destruction and used them, as this \nbook points out--not once. There was a terrible genocide at Halabja. \nBut he used chemical weapons repeatedly, and indeed experimentally, \nagainst the Kurds. Hundreds of thousands of people were killed. Against \nthe Iranians--hundreds of thousands of people killed.\n  I read somewhere today--elsewhere; I forget where it was--that Saddam \nis the first person since Hitler who has used chemicals for the \npurposes of mass death.\n  So this history is chilling. I do not manufacture it. It is there. It \nis why it is so critically important to bring this madman back within \nthe constraints of the United Nations resolutions and the peace that he \nagreed to at the end of the gulf war.\n  Should Saddam be allowed to continue to develop these weapons of mass \ndestruction and become the controlling hegemonic power he has long \ndreamed of becoming in the Arab world, Lord protect us. Lord protect \nthe Arab world, when you think of the brutal dictatorship he has \nrepresented--no freedom, no opportunity for his people. And what about \nthe rest of us, with Saddam in control of so much of the world's oil \nsupply?\n  So this history is very current as we consider all the options we \nhave tried over the decade since the gulf war to disarm this dangerous \ndictator, and why those of us who have sponsored this resolution \nbelieve that the moment has come, as the President has said, \neffectively to say to Saddam: Either disarm or we are going to be \nforced to go to war to disarm you. We don't want to do this. But you \nrepresent such a danger to your neighbors, among whom we have such \nstrong allies whose support is so critical to us, whose energy supply \nis so critical to our economy and that of the rest of the world, that \nif you don't disarm, we are going to have to take military action to do \nthat.\n  That is the history, the chilling history that affects the present \nand is why the four of us, and others now who have cosponsored this \nresolution, have done so--to prevent this man from achieving his evil \nends.\n  There have been many thoughtful statements on the floor. Mr. Stevens, \nthe senior Senator from Alaska, spoke yesterday. Here is a proud, \npatriotic American, a veteran of World War II. He analogized this \ndictator we are facing to Hitler. Remember the lessons he was hearing \nin high school of the dangers represented by Hitler and the extent to \nwhich, if we didn't stop him then, we would have to stop him at a much \nhigher price later on. I think the balance we have to strike here in \ndeciding how to act is a similar balance. Do we act now, or do we act \nlater, at much greater cost in blood, in treasure?\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, may I just add to my colleague's \nremarks--he referred to Senator Stevens. He was in the Chamber a few \nmoments ago talking with me. We shared those days because I was of that \ngeneration.\n  Saddam Hussein possesses, today, an arsenal of weapons far more \ndangerous to the whole world than Hitler ever possessed. That was \nbrought out in the colloquy yesterday. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from West Virginia for yielding \nme time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I thank and commend all those Senators who have been \nspeaking in support of the resolution that will soon come before the \nSenate for a decision by the Senate. I think they have rendered a \nservice. I commend Mr. Lieberman. I commend Mr. Warner. And I commend \nthose others who are cosponsors of the resolution. I commend them on \ntheir high level of argumentation they have put forth. This is what the \ncountry needs. The country needs to hear more of this, and I have only \nthe utmost admiration for those who feel as they do in support of this \nresolution.\n  The Senate is the anchor of the Republic, and it is here on this \nbattlefield many of the country's great Senators have expounded their \nviews and taken sides, one way or the other, on the great issues that \nhave come before the Nation over this period of more than 200 years.\n  I have listened, as best I could, to the various Senators who, for \nthe most part this morning, have spoken in support of the resolution, \nS.J. Res. 45, which will be at least soon attempted to be amended by \nS.J. Res. 46.\n  Madam President, I am not against just any and every resolution of \nthis nature. I could very well be for a resolution. If this debate were \nto go on for a while, or perhaps to go until after the election, giving \nus time to debate it thoroughly, giving Senators time to amend it, \nmodify it, to change it, it might very well be I, too, could support a \nresolution. After all, that is what we should strive for. We should \nstrive for a national consensus.\n  If this country is going to engage in a military conflict in the near \nfuture, it should not be a slapdash resolution that in its makeup \nlooks, for all intents and purposes, as though it were just thrown \ntogether, it was a cut-and-paste operation.\n  I would hope we could come to a conclusion, after ample debate, that \nwe could join hands across the aisle, join hands between the two \nparties, join hands with the executive branch. I would hope we could do \nthat. And I do not think that is beyond the realm of possibility.\n  I think it would be possible to develop a resolution which might get \na unanimous vote in this Senate, but it would take time. It cannot be \nthis resolution which would be unanimous because it will not be \nunanimous.\n  My concerns about this resolution are, in the main, two--two \nconcerns. Getting into further detail, I can express several concerns. \nBut in the main, I would say my concerns are two in number.\n  One, this resolution authorizes the President to determine and \nauthorizes the President to use military forces as he will, when he \nwill, how he will, and wherever he will, as long as the thread is tied \nto Iraq, and beyond that--I do not have the resolution in front of me--\nas long as it is tied, by the thread, to ``defend[ing] the national \nsecurity of the United States against the continuing threat posed by \nIraq; and (2) enforc[ing] all relevant United Nations Security Council \nResolutions regarding Iraq.''\n  Madam President, I can talk in considerable detail and at \nconsiderable length with respect to the ``whereas'' clauses and with \nrespect to the authorization section, section 3. Suffice it to say this \nis a blank check, this authorization paragraph is a blank check, given \nover to the Chief Executive, not just this one but Chief Executives who \nwill succeed him. There is no sunset provision. There is no termination \nunder this authorization. It can go on and on and on until Congress \nsees fit to terminate it.\n  So it is open-ended. It is a blank check. And it cedes the \ndecisionmaking power of the Congress under the Constitution to declare \nwar. It cedes that to a Chief Executive--for the moment, Mr. George W. \nBush. Succeeding him, who knows? But it is open-ended.\n  If Congress is going to waive that part of the Constitution which \ngives power to the Congress to declare war--and I am not sure Congress \ncan waive that--but if it is going to, why don't we at least have a \nsunset provision? Why don't we at least have a cutoff at which time the \ncession of that power is no longer existent? Is that asking too much?\n\n  No. 1, my opposition to this resolution in the main is because \nCongress is ceding--lock, stock, and barrel--its power to declare war, \nhanding that over to a Chief Executive and, by its own terms, as much \nas to say, that President will determine that. He will use the military \nforces of these United States--that means the Marines, the Air Force, \nthe Army, the Navy, all the military forces of this country--he shall \nuse all of the military forces of this country in whatever ways he \ndetermines, wherever he determines, whenever he determines, and for as \nlong as he determines. That is the way it is written--lock, stock, and \nbarrel.\n  Congress might as well just close the doors, put a sign over the \ndoors and\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\nsay: ``Going fishing.'' Put a sign on the Statue of Liberty up here: \n``Out of business.'' That is exactly, that is precisely what we are \nabout to do, if we vote for this resolution as it is currently written. \nIf there is anybody who disagrees with me, they can try to show me \nthat. But they cannot refute the words written in this resolution. All \nthe ``whereases'' constitute nothing more than figleaves, beautifully \ndressed, beautifully colored, pretty figleaves, with sugar on them.\n  My second objection in the main is that Congress is being stampeded, \npressured, adjured, importuned into acting on this blank check before \nCongress goes out for the election. Doesn't that make this somewhat \nsuspect? Recall, it was only in late August, around August 23, I \nbelieve it was, I read in the newspaper where the President was \nconcerned about the intensified talk that was going on with reference \nto his plans in respect to an attack on Iraq. Secretary Rumsfeld, in \nthat same newspaper report, referred to it as a ``frenzy.'' So even the \nPresident, 6 weeks ago, was seeking to allay the concerns of the people \nin Washington, people all over the country, with respect to any \n``plans'' that he might have to attack Iraq. In other words, he was \nsaying: Cool it.\n  Well, that was just 6 weeks ago. Then all of a sudden, the whole \nfocus of attention in this country seems to be directed several \nthousand miles away from these shores to a country called Iraq, to \nwhich the distinguished Senator from Connecticut correctly alluded as \nthat great land between the two great rivers, the old Biblical country \nof Mesopotamia.\n  So those are my two concerns. Here we are, with all of this pressure \nto act, act now. I am somewhat mystified by the rush pell-mell to \nembrace this resolution which, as I understand it, is pretty much the \nadministration's handicraft, and the House may be about to vote on the \nsame.\n  I wonder what has gotten into our Democratic leaders that they would \nembrace this kind of thing. They have a right to do that. Every Senator \nhas a right to vote any way he wants, any way his good sense is \ndirecting him. But I have been mystified at the rush, at the frenetic \nactivity on the part of leaders of the Congress, of the other body. \nThey embraced this thing down there on the White House lawn.\n  We should take more time. The American people have questions that \nthey want answered. I have had more than 9,000 telephone calls in the \nlast 5 days that my office has been open, more than 9,000 coming from \nall over the country, virtually all urging the Senate to slow down, to \nask questions, and to fully consider what we are about to do. I hope \nmore people will call. They don't need to call me. They know what my \nposition is. But I hope they will call the Members of Congress, Senate \nand House Members, Republicans and Democrats, call all the Members. \nUrge them to stop, look, and listen, look at what we are about to do. \nWe are about to put beyond the reach of Congress the decision to \ndeclare war.\n\n  I listened to the President's speech. I didn't hear anything new. I \ndidn't hear anything that I hadn't already heard prior to this time. He \ndemonized Saddam Hussein. That is quite all right with me. I think \nSaddam Hussein is lower than a snake's belly myself. I wouldn't shed \nany tear if anything happened to him. That is not the question. We have \nknown these things.\n  I asked the CIA Director myself, within the last 2 or 3 weeks in my \noffice and in room 407: You are not a policymaker, but you are the \nexpert with respect to intelligence. What is there that you can tell \nme, what is there that you can tell Congress that is new that indicates \nwe wait beyond this election at our peril? What is it that is new that \nwe haven't known? I am talking to the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  I said: What is it that is new that we haven't known 2 months ago, 6 \nweeks ago, 3 months ago? They don't have anything.\n  I asked Secretary Rumsfeld. And he will say: Oh, I will tell you what \nis new, September 11 of last year.\n  Well, of course, that is over a year old. What is so new that it \nrequires this Senate and the House of Representatives to vote before we \ngo out for the election? Why so much interest in the election? That is \nnot by my choice that the administration is pushing for a vote before \nthe election. That is not my choice; that is their choice. And I am not \nsure but that this effort on their part might be turned against them in \nthe election. I think if the American people are fully aware of what \nthis administration is advocating, fully aware of what we are about to \ndo, the people of this country will rise up. They will let their voices \nbe heard.\n  They have questions. ``What is this going to cost me?'' they will \nsay. Mr. John Q. Citizen will say: What is this going to cost me? What \nabout my son? What about my daughter? What about my grandson? How many \nAmerican lives are going to be lost if we invade Iraq? What is going to \nbe the cost? What is going to happen to Iraq after its defeat? Who is \ngoing to run the government of Iraq then? Are we going to have American \nfighting men and women in Iraq for 2 months, 6 months, a year, 2 years, \n5 years, 10 years? Answer these questions, Mr. Administration.\n  Tell me, also, what is going to happen to homeland security. Already \nthe focus is being shifted away from homeland security. I can see it.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Not just yet.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understood the time was 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe I have these 15 minutes now under a previous \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I simply want to finish----\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, of course, we go into recess at 12:30.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not yield at the moment. I will be happy to yield in a \nmoment. The Senator has been on the floor all morning--he and his \ncompatriots over here who are boosting this unfortunate resolution. So \nI want a few minutes now, and then I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. For one short question.\n  Mr. BYRD. Then what is the focus? What about homeland security? What \nmight happen on the southern border, on the northern border of this \ncountry, in the ports of this country, at the airports of this country? \nWhat might happen? The American people today are concerned about the \nsafety right here in this area, the safety of their own schoolchildren. \nThey are concerned about these things that are going on all around us. \nWhat is going to happen to homeland security? I don't hear much about \nit over this last couple weeks or more. This attack on Iraq we have \nbeen talking about--the President says: If you do not do it, I will. If \nyou don't do it, we will. Well, this concerns me.\n  What kind of a face are we going to present to the world with this \nkind of cowboy, macho attitude? What kind of face are we presenting to \nthe world? Does the world still see us as a law-abiding Nation that \nlives by the rule of law? Is that what we recommend to other countries? \nAre we a country that loves liberty, freedom, justice, the rule of law, \nor is this going to make us look like a bully? I used to play a tune on \nmy fiddle called ``The Bully of the Town''--``I am looking for the \nbully of the town.'' Is that the kind of face Uncle Sam is going to \npresent to the world? It sounds like it when the President says to the \nU.N.: If you don't do something, we will.\n  Madam President, I am simply saying we ought not have this vote \nbefore this election. This election is going to distract members from \nconcentrating, from focusing on the question of war or peace. It is \nalready doing it. It is already doing it.\n  So there are lots of questions the American people want answered. \nWhat about the economy? Is this going to affect the American economy? \nWhat about my job? What about my health insurance? What about us older \nfolks? What about prescription drugs? You do not hear much about that \nnow. Everything is tuned to Iraq. The American people are being led to \nbelieve something may happen tomorrow--and something may happen right \nhere within our own shores. But they are being led to believe Saddam is \nsuch a threat we don't dare wait until after the election. Saddam \ndoesn't present that kind of imminent threat to this country. He \ndoesn't have these kinds of weapons\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\nthat he would level at this country before the election. Now, something \ncould happen in our midst before the election. It can happen tonight. \nIt can happen today. It has been happening in this area over the past \nseveral days, with a sniper taking six lives, and he shot eight \npersons.\n\n  People are concerned about issues here at home. We should not try to \ndivert their attention to a threat. I don't say Saddam is not a threat. \nI say he is not the immediate threat the administration is trying to \nmake him out to be at this point. We have some time. We ought to \nutilize it. We cannot let Saddam Hussein continue to have weapons, such \nas biological and chemical weapons. We cannot let him acquire weapons \nof mass destruction. But there is some time, and I think it is very \nimportant we get the United Nations involved here, and the President \nhas made a good start in that direction. He made a fine statement when \nhe spoke to the U.N. He put the burden on them. He laid it at their \ndoor. They have been recreant in their duty.\n  We should utilize the time we have to let the U.N. marshal its forces \nand try to get other countries to assist this country in carrying the \nburden. Eleven years ago, the cost of that war was $61.1 billion, and \nother countries helped shoulder the expenses, with the exception of \nabout $7.5 billion. We ought to be seeking to get others' help.\n  We ought to let the inspectors go back in and have restrictions such \nthat they will have a full and free opportunity to inspect wherever \nthey want, wherever they think they should. So I am for all that. I am \nnot one who says Saddam is not a threat; he is a threat, but he has \nbeen a threat for many years. I think it is a disservice to the \nAmerican people to insist their elected representatives in the House \nand Senate showdown on this fateful decision before the election. Now, \nthat is highly suspect. To those who are pushing it, I have to say it \nis suspect.\n  Why do they want this vote before the election? I am not the one who \ndetermines when the election will fall. We know it is going to take \nplace on November 5. Where is the threat that is so imminent to this \ncountry we have to declare war here and now, before the election? It is \na distraction. Our Senators and House Members need to be concentrating \non the matter, debating it, debating other matters. There are many more \nmatters that cry out for the attention of this country. Why should we \nnot be giving attention to them and not be distracted in this vote by \nwhat may happen to me on November 5, if I vote this way or that way? \nThat is not right. It is wrong. It is not doing right by the people of \nthis country. They are entitled to better than that.\n  So I have two main concerns. One, we are ceding the constitutional \nauthority to declare war, and it is open-ended, a blank check. Mr. \nPresident, here it is, you can have it. We will just go fishing. You \ntake it and we are out of it. We are out of business. We are out of \nbusiness for the next year or 2 years or as long as this piece of \npaper--this blank check--is in effect. You have it. We are cheating the \npeople back home when we vote for that kind of resolution.\n  Madam President, I have much more to say, but I told the Senator from \nVirginia I would be glad to yield. I do that now, without losing my \nright to the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I simply say to my colleague, most \nrespectfully, I feel this was not a cut-and-paste job. Senators \nLieberman, Bayh, McCain, myself, and other Senators have contributed. \nSenator Lott had an open-door policy to engage persons on this issue.\n  I draw your attention, most respectfully, to section 3, authorization \nfor the use of force.\n  This is not a blank check. It restricts this authority clearly to \nIraq, and if I might read it: Authorization. The President is \nauthorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States as he \ndetermines to be necessary and appropriate in order to, one, defend the \nnational security of the United States against the continuing threat \nposed by Iraq; two, enforce all relevant United Nations security \nresolutions regarding Iraq.\n  That is a very clear mandate, and once those two criteria are met, \nthis authority ceases.\n  Madam President, my understanding is that at the hour of 12:30 p.m., \nthe Senate will stand in recess.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I most respectfully say to my colleague, \nI am under firm instructions on this side--so many Senators are \ngathering at the caucuses who otherwise would follow this important \ndebate. I will be happy to resume with Senator Byrd----\n  Mr. REID. If my friend, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nwill yield, I have a unanimous consent request, about which I have \nspoken with the Senator from West Virginia, for Senators to speak this \nafternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, can we \npossibly accommodate my colleague from West Virginia so he can finish \nthis lineup, and I will be prepared to come to the floor with him, can \nI suggest, at the hour of 2 o'clock?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator wishes to speak at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would love to do that.\n  Mr. REID. If necessary, I will preside at 2 o'clock, but we have \npresiders starting at 2:15 p.m.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from West \nVirginia be recognized for 10 minutes beginning at 5 after the hour.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I can \nfinish in 10 minutes now.\n  Mr. REID. I understand that, but the other side has objected to that.\n  Mr. BYRD. After 2 o'clock, I might be constrained to talk longer.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, given that opportunity, can we agree \nthen the 10 minutes expires--I am about to join the Secretary of State, \nMr. Colin Powell--at the hour of 12:42 or 12:43 p.m.? If that is \ncorrect, that will be fine.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I ask \nunanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m., in addition to Senator Byrd \nspeaking now for 10 minutes, Senator Mikulski speak; at 2:35 p.m, \nSenator Gregg; Senator Jeffords at 3 o'clock; there will be a \nRepublican at 3:20 p.m.; Senator Kennedy at 3:40 p.m.; a Republican at \n4 o'clock; Senator Carper at 4:20 p.m.; a Republican at 4:50 p.m.; \nSenator Feingold at 5:30 p.m.; a Republican 6 o'clock; and one of the \ntwo, Reid/Reed, at 6:30 p.m.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, for how long am I recognized now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I call the Senate's attention to an article in the Philadelphia \nInquirer of October 6 entitled ``Allied Support On Iraq Exaggerated, \nOfficials Say'':\n       President Bush and some of his top aides, including Defense \n     Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld, have exaggerated the degree of \n     allied support for a war in Iraq, according to senior \n     officials in the military and the Bush administration.\n       These officials, rankled by what they charge is a tendency \n     by Rumsfeld and others to gloss over unpleasant realities, \n     say few nations in Europe or the Middle East are ready to \n     support an attack against Iraq unless the United Nations \n     Security Council explicitly authorizes the use of force.\n       In the latest sign that international support for the \n     administration's plans is soft, key ally Turkey said Friday \n     that it would participate in a campaign against Iraq only if \n     the world body blessed it.\n       ``An operation not based on international law cannot be \n     accepted,'' a Turkish presidential spokesman said after a \n     meeting of top Turkish civilian, military and intelligence \n     officials in Ankara.\n       The backing of Turkey, which borders Iraq's north, is vital \n     because it hosts air bases at Incirlik and elsewhere that \n     would be necessary to conduct a major air campaign against \n     Iraq and protect the ethnic Kurdish population in northern \n     Iraq from Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's retaliation.\n       ``Turkey is the key,'' a senior administration official \n     said.\n       Turkey, which also has a large Kurdish population, is \n     concerned that Iraq's Kurds would try to form their own mini-\n     state and that a war with another Muslim country could \n     aggravate tensions between Islamists and secularists in \n     Turkey and damage the Turkish economy.\n       Turkey is not alone: No country near Iraq has agreed to \n     serve as a launching pad for a U.S. strike without U.N. \n     authorization, the senior official said. He and others spoke \n     on condition of anonymity.\n       As they have tried to persuade Congress to give Bush broad \n     war-making authority,\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\n     Rumsfeld and other officials have sought to create the \n     impression that there is widespread international support for \n     the Iraq endeavor. That, one top official said, ``is at best \n     premature and at worst deceptive.''\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the total article from \nthe Philadelphia Inquirer of October 6 be printed in the Record at the \nclose of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I quote another article from the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, this one October 8, 2002, entitled: ``Officials' \nPrivate Doubts On Iraq War'':\n       While President Bush marshals congressional and \n     international support for invading Iraq, a growing number of \n     military officers, intelligence professionals and diplomats \n     in his own government privately have deep misgivings about \n     the administration's double-time march toward war.\n       These officials say administration hawks have exaggerated \n     evidence of the threat that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein \n     poses--including distorting his links to the al-Qaeda \n     terrorist network; have overstated the amount of \n     international support for attacking Iraq; and have downplayed \n     the potential repercussions of a new war in the Middle East.\n       They say that the administration squelches--squelches--\n     dissenting views that intelligence analysts are under intense \n     pressure to produce reports supporting the White House's \n     argument that Hussein poses such an immediate threat to the \n     United States that preemptive military action is necessary.\n       ``Analysts at the working level in the intelligence \n     community are feeling very strong pressure from the Pentagon \n     to cook the intelligence books,'' said one official, speaking \n     on condition of anonymity.\n       A dozen other officials echoes his views in interviews with \n     the Inquirer Washington Bureau. No one who was interviewed \n     disagreed.\n\n  How much time do I have left, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four and a half minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Continuing the article:\n\n       They cited recent suggestions by Defense Secretary Donald \n     H. Rumsfeld and National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice \n     that Hussein and Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda network were \n     working together.\n       Rumsfeld said Sept. 26 that the U.S. government had \n     ``bulletproof'' confirmation of links between Iraq and al-\n     Qaeda members, including ``solid evidence'' that members of \n     the terrorist network maintained a presence in Iraq.\n       The facts are much less conclusive. Officials said \n     Rumsfeld's statement was based in part on intercepted \n     telephone calls in which an al-Qaeda member who apparently \n     was passing through Baghdad was overheard calling friends or \n     relatives, intelligence officials said. The intercepts \n     provide no evidence that the suspected terrorist was working \n     with the Iraqi regime or that he was working on a terrorist \n     operation while he was in Iraq, they said.\n       Rumsfeld also suggested that the Iraqi regime had offered \n     safe haven to bin Laden and Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed \n     Omar. While technically true, that, too, is misleading. \n     Intelligence reports said the Iraqi ambassador to Turkey, a \n     longtime Iraqi intelligence officer, made the offer during a \n     visit to Afghanistan in late 1998, after the United States \n     attacked al-Qaeda training camps with cruise missiles to \n     retaliate for the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and \n     Tanzania. But officials said the same intelligence reports \n     that bin Laden rejected the offer because he did not want \n     Hussein to control his group.\n       In fact, the officials said, there is no ironclad evidence \n     that the Iraqi regime and the terrorist network are working \n     together, or that Hussein has ever contemplated giving \n     chemical or biological weapons to al-Qaeda, with whom he has \n     deep ideological differences.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of this article from the \nPhiladelphia Inquirer, dated October 8, 2002, be printed in the Record \nat the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BYRD. The President indicated he would lead a coalition, and I \nhope he will. I hope he will continue to work until he gets a solid \ncoalition together. But if, as the President claims, America will lead \na coalition against Iraq, it certainly appears that we have much work \nto do. The first article I read from the Philadelphia Inquirer bears \nout a clear message: We have asked the United Nations to act and we \nshould give the United Nations that opportunity.\n  Last night, the President of the United States asked Congress to \nfully consider the facts in this debate, but I believe that many of the \nfacts are still unclear. We have many questions that demand answers, \nand we need the time to find those answers.\n  So I suggest we try to get the facts, and the representatives of the \nAmerican people in Congress need the facts, the clear, unadulterated \nfacts, before Congress votes on the resolution.\n  The questions I have are the same questions the American people have. \nA poll published last Sunday in the New York Times reports that a \nmajority of Americans think that Congress is not asking enough \nquestions about Iraq policy. By a 2-to-1 margin, those polled would \nprefer to see U.N. inspectors have more time to do their job. Sixty-\nfive percent of those polled think it is better to wait for allies \nbefore any attack on Iraq--in other words, not go it alone.\n  Obviously, the American people are far from convinced that we must \nattack Iraq. I think as time goes on, if this matter is fully debated, \nwe will find a reverse in the polls from what we have been seeing \nlately. We are going to find that the American people are not all that \nready to invade Iraq all by themselves; not all that ready to put the \nU.N. aside and say we will go it alone--if you do not do it, we will--\nand not all that ready to send their boys and girls, their men and \nwomen, their loved ones, to war in a foreign land without leaving it up \nto Congress as to when war should be declared.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 6, 2002]\n\n           Allied Support on Iraq Exaggerated, Officials Say\n\n                         (By Warren P.

That, one top \n     official said, ``is at best premature and at worst \n     deceptive.''\n       The defense secretary told a House of Representatives \n     committee Sept. 18 that Bush aides ``know for a fact'' that \n     the United States would not be fighting Iraq along if it \n     failed to obtain a U.N. resolution. ``There are any number of \n     countries that have already announced their support,'' he \n     said.\n       Bush said Thursday that if the United Nations and Iraq \n     didn't eliminate Hussein's weapons of mass destruction, ``the \n     United States in deliberate fashion will lead a coalition to \n     take away the world's worst weapons from one of the world's \n     worst leaders.''\n       Several officials said that while those statements were \n     technically true, there was a coalition yet. Diplomats said \n     privately that only staunch ally Britain and Bulgaria--a \n     member of the U.N. Security Council that wants to join the \n     U.S.-led NATO alliance--had said they were willing to act \n     without United Nations cover.\n       Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has been working \n     intensively to persuade other U.S. Security Council members \n     to back a tough resolution that would force Iraq to accept \n     strict new rules for inspections or face a U.S.-led invasion. \n     He has run into stiff resistance, particularly from France \n     and Russia, both of which hold veto power on the council.\n       Along with those countries, the United States presumably \n     would need an OK to use\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\n     military bases in Persian Gulf countries such as Kuwait, \n     Oman, Bahrain and Qatar. In Qatar the United States has been \n     extending a runway to accommodate more combat planes, and \n     some war planners hope to persuade Jordan to let U.S. and \n     British special forces attack suspected missile bases and \n     weapons facilities in western Iraq from its territory.\n       None of those countries has told Washington it will be \n     forthcoming without U.N. support, the officials said.\n       One senior military officer called Rumsfeld's comments \n     ``misleading.''\n       '' `Fine,' `locked in,' `positive,' `concrete'; those words \n     aren't being used over here,'' another Pentagon officer said.\n       Some analysts said that if the confrontation with Iraq came \n     to war, most countries would choose to join in rather than \n     risk displeasing the United States or missing out on the \n     spoils.\n       ``You will have regimes which, if we force the issue, will \n     support us,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a military expert at \n     the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a \n     conservative center for national-security studies. But those \n     countries want diplomatic cover, he said.\n       Some allies also want assurances on other issues, Cordesman \n     said.\n       Turkey, for example, wants debt relief for its teetering \n     economy along with promises that there will be no independent \n     Kurdish state in Iraq. Russia wants a free hand to pursue \n     alleged terrorists in neighboring Georgia, Iraq to pay \n     roughly $8 billion in debt, and Washington to lift Cold War-\n     era trade restrictions.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n             [From the Philadelphia Inquirer, Oct. 8, 2002]\n\n                 Officials' Private Doubts On Iraq War\n\n      (By Warren P.

Many of them have long experience in the \n     Middle East and South Asia, and all spoke in similar terms \n     about the unease with the way the U.S. political leaders were \n     dealing with Iraq.\n       All agreed that Hussein was a threat who eventually must be \n     dealt with, and none flatly opposed military action. But, \n     they say, the U.S. government has no dramatic new knowledge \n     about the Iraqi leader that justifies Bush's urgent call to \n     arms.\n       Some lawmakers have voiced similar concerns after receiving \n     CIA briefings.\n       Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D., Ill.) said some information he \n     had seen did not support Bush's portrayal of the Iraqi \n     threat.\n       ``It's troubling to have classified information that \n     contradicts statements by the administration,'' Durbin said. \n     ``There's more they should share with the public.''\n       Several administration and intelligence officials defended \n     CIA Director George Tenet, saying Tenet was not pressuring \n     his analysis but was quietly working to include dissenting \n     opinions in intelligence estimates and congressional \n     briefings.\n       In one case, a senior administration official said, Tenet \n     made sure that a State Department official told Congress that \n     the Energy and State Departments disagreed with an \n     intelligence assessment that said hundreds of aluminum tubes \n     Iraq tried to purchase were intended for Baghdad's secret \n     nuclear-weapons program. Analysts in both departments \n     concluded that the Iraqis probably wanted the tubes to make \n     conventional artillery pieces.\n       Other examples of questionable statements include:\n       Vice President Cheney said in late August that Iraq might \n     have nuclear weapons ``fairly soon.'' A CIA report released \n     Friday said it could take Iraq until the last half of the \n     decade to produce a nuclear weapon., unless it could acquire \n     bomb-grade uranium or plutonium on the black market.\n       Also in August, Rumsfeld suggested that al-Qeada operatives \n     fleeing Afghanistan were taking refuge in Iraq with Hussein's \n     assistance. ``In a vicious, repressive dictatorship that \n     exercises near-total control over its population, it's very \n     hard to imagine that the government is not aware of what's \n     taking place in the country,'' he said. Rumsfeld apparently \n     was referring to about 150 members of the militant Islamic \n     group Ansae al Islam (``Supporters of Islam'') who have taken \n     refuge in Kurdish areas of northern Iraq. However, one of \n     America's would-be Kurdish allies controls that part of the \n     country, not Hussein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Levin \namendment in terms of determining our action in Iraq.\n  As a graduate of West Point, the Presiding Officer knows how great a \ndecision it is for the U.S. Congress to decide about war. Now this \nSenate is considering the gravest decision we will ever be called upon \nto make, which is to give the President unlimited authority to go to \nwar, to make a decision to send American military men and women in \nharm's way. I say to my constituents, to the people of this country, \nand to the military, I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  I have listened to the President and his advisers make their case. I \nhave consulted with experts and wise heads. I have participated in \nhearings and briefings as a Member of the Senate, and particularly as a \nmember of the Intelligence Committee. I have listened very intently to \nmy own constituents. I know that the decision we are about to make will \naffect the lives of America's sons and daughters, and the future of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  But first, let me say a word about our troops. Each and every member \nof our military is part of the American family. Their service is a \ntremendous sacrifice and also a great risk. These are ordinary men and \nwomen, often called upon to act in a very extraordinary way, and they \nhave never failed us. Whatever the Nation asks them to do,\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\nI know they will do it with bravery, fortitude, and gallantry.\n  Therefore we, all Americans, owe them a debt of gratitude. But we owe \nthem even more. The Congress owes it to them to choose the wisest, most \nprudent course in this matter. As Senators, we must keep in mind the \nmen and women of our military.\n  That is why I support Senator Levin's resolution on Iraq. I support \nthat because it meets my principles. Have all diplomatic and other \nnonmilitary means been exhausted? The Levin resolution turns to the \nUnited Nations and its Security Council to make a decision in terms of \nthe enforcement of its own resolutions. It calls for international \nlegitimacy, international cooperation, international support, and, I \nmight add, international resources. It urges the Security Council to \nfill President Bush's request to demand Iraqi disarmament and to \nauthorize the use of a multinational military force if Iraq refuses to \ncomply. If the U.N. refuses to act under the Levin amendment, Congress \nwould then promptly consider whether America should act alone.\n  Senator Levin's is not the only resolution before the Senate. As I \nhave looked at all of them, I asked questions. First, what really is \nSaddam Hussein's intent?\n  Second, does he have the means to accomplish this intent? Does he \nhave weapons of mass destruction: chemical, biological, and nuclear?\n  Third, how grave and imminent is the threat? Is the Iraqi threat best \nmet by a unilateral approach or a vigorous international response?\n  Finally, what are the consequences of our action? What will our \nmilitary face in Iraq? What will be the impact on Iraq and the Middle \nEast? What does this mean to the war on terrorism?\n  These are the kinds of questions I am asking myself so I can make a \nwise decision.\n  But make no mistake, I firmly believe that Saddam Hussein is \nduplicitous, deceptive, and dangerous. I despise him. Saddam is a \nbrutal, totalitarian dictator and history shows us how dangerous Iraq \nis under his rule. He invaded Kuwait and used chemical weapons against \nhis own people. I do believe he has developed chemical and biological \nweapons, and I also believe he is pursuing nuclear weapons, defying the \nwill of the international community and also denying the agreement that \nhe made at the end of the gulf war.\n  I also really do not believe Saddam is going to change. The question \nthen is, what does this mean for the future? I think Iraq does have the \ngrim and ghoulish means to carry out its evil plans. I think if we look \nat declassified CIA reports and the British white paper, we can see \nthat Iraq does continue to develop and produce and stockpile chemical \nand biological weapons, and is trying to get the technology and \nmaterials to produce nuclear weapons. So these threats cannot and must \nnot be ignored.\n  Therefore, what is the best way to proceed? My analysis further \nindicates that Saddam Hussein just doesn't threaten the United States \nor our assets or our people abroad. He threatens the entire region. He \nalso threatens treasured allies. And because the threat is greater than \nourselves, we must bring the international community with us, to share \nthe responsibility and the burden of stopping these threats.\n\n  This is why I support the Levin amendment. It is our best chance to \nforge a vigorous international response, and to also have the backing \nof a multinational military response.\n  The Levin amendment requires four things. It urges the U.N. Security \nCouncil to promptly adopt a resolution demanding access to U.N. \ninspectors to destroy Iraq's missiles and weapons of mass destruction. \nWe know that works. When the inspectors were in Iraq, they destroyed \nmore weapons of mass destruction than we did during the gulf war.\n  The Levin amendment authorizes member states to use necessary and \nappropriate force if Iraq refuses to comply. I understand the use of \nforce might be necessary. It also very clearly asserts and affirms the \nU.S. right to self-defense.\n  It authorizes the President to use armed force to fulfill the U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution, provided the President determines that \ndiplomacy was tried and exhausted first. It also tells us not to \nadjourn so Congress can further consider action if the U.N. fails.\n  That is what we are looking at. The consequences of committing \nAmerican troops to war in Iraq are very serious and they must be \ncarefully reviewed.\n  The question is, will our American troops be welcomed with flags or \nwill they be welcomed with land mines? Our troops could face an Iraqi \nmilitary entrenched in cities instead of the open desert warfare of the \ngulf war. Iraq could use chemical and biological weapons right on our \ntroops as we are engaged in battle. They could also do this against \ntheir own Iraqi civilians.\n  This is why I believe America should not face these threats alone. If \nwe go in, we should not go in by ourselves. If the threat is so real, \nthe world should take it seriously and then vote to be able to come \nwith us.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. When I finish, yes.\n  America cannot face this situation alone. The support and cooperation \nof allies would enable us to share the risks and the cost. We need \ninternational legitimacy, international support, and international \nmanpower.\n  What happens when we win the war? Military victory is only the start \nof U.S. engagement in Iraq. Fostering a new regime could take decades. \nMost people don't realize that Iraq is an artificial construct, formed \nin 1920 by a League of Nations mandate after the first World War. Iraq \nhas no unifying history or culture or religion or language: Its \npopulation is deeply divided on ethnic and religious lines.\n  The end of Saddam Hussein could mean the start of a civil war. \nFostering the creation of new government in Iraq will not be easy. \nThere is no real opposition group ready to take over because Saddam's \ntotalitarian regime does not tolerate opposition.\n  If Saddam is overthrown--we have to be prepared for what happens \nnext. Will American troops become an army of occupation or will Iraq \nfall into chaos and civil war?\n  America cannot face this situation alone. The support and cooperation \nof allies would enable us to share the risks and the costs.\n  War on Iraq could also have unintended consequences for the Middle \nEast. Some optimists see war in Iraq leading to democratization and \npeace in the Middle East. They predict the overthrow of undemocratic \nregimes in Iran, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other countries. But there is \na real risk that attacking Iraq would unify Arab countries and the \nwider Muslim world against us. We are already seeing signs of \ncooperation between Sunni and Shi'ite extremists and terrorist groups.\n  A mandate from the United Nations would mean the international \ncommunity against Saddam instead of the United States against Iraq. \nOther countries in the region would join our coalition, rather than \nobstructing or opposing us.\n  I also worry that unilateral action could undermine the war on \nterrorism. Some special forces are already being withdrawn from the \nefforts to hunt al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Intelligence resources would \nbe re-directed to cover Iraq, reducing our focus on Afghanistan and \nPakistan. Arab and Muslim states may reduce their intelligence \ncooperation against al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. The focus of \nour top military and civilian leaders could shift away from bin Laden \nand al-Qaida. There are other issues.\n  An international coalition helps address the impact of war in Iraq on \nthe war on terrorism. By sharing the burden during and after a war, \nmore of our troops and resources can pursue the war on terrorism by \nkeeping together the global coalition against terrorist groups.\n  I want to conclude by thanking President Bush for engaging in \nintensive diplomacy at the U.N. I know the Bush administration is being \naggressive at the U.N. and in the key states, including Russia, China, \nand France. I applaud the President for this.\n  President Bush also made it clear that the U.N. has a responsibility \nto address Iraq's threat to international peace and security. I \nabsolutely agree with him on this. But also I agree we have to get the \nUnited Nations Security Council authorization to form an international \ncoalition.\n  We cannot fail to act if action is necessary, but we must take the \ntime to\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\nsee if we can minimize the danger and also build a coalition to share \nthe risk. An international coalition would do that.\n  The Senate faces difficult decisions on how to address the Iraqi \nthreat. I believe the Levin amendment is by far the strongest option. \nIt endorses the President's speech to the United Nations, strengthening \nthe U.S. position in multilateral diplomacy and authorizing the use of \nforce only if authorized by the U.N. Security Council without ruling \nout the possibility that Congress will authorize the unilateral use of \nforce if that decision becomes necessary. Most importantly, the Levin \nresolution presents the best hope for the United States to achieve \ninternational support and a multinational military coalition to address \nthe Iraqi threat to peace and security.\n  Therefore, I look forward to voting for the Levin amendment. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in doing that because I believe the way to \ndeal with this issue is international support and a multinational \nmilitary coalition, should force be necessary.\n  Before I yield the floor, I turn to the Senator from Colorado, who \nhad a question.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I say to the Senator from Maryland, I did have a \nquestion. I just finished a bipartisan press conference with the \nSecretary of State. He said the diplomats, our negotiators at the \nUnited Nations, felt they needed the strongest position possible in \norder to make their negotiations end in a successful way. I was struck \nby your comments and your support for the Levin amendment. I wonder if \nyou could respond to his comments that we just had, about 12:30 or so.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I say to the Senator, I did not hear his comments at \nthe press conference.\n  I applaud Secretary Powell. I think his is a vigorous effort to try \nto resolve the situation through diplomatic means, to send a message to \nSaddam that he should voluntarily disarm and let the inspectors in.\n  That might not work. But it is then up to the U.N., as the President \nsaid when he spoke to them, to take responsibility; to therefore \nauthorize action to enforce their own resolutions so the United States \nof America is not doing this all by ourselves. It is not America versus \nSaddam. It should be the international community against Saddam \nbecause, I think you would agree, he is a despicable cad.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would agree with that. But I think the point was being \nmade, if we have a strong resolution, it would be less likely we would \nbe out there by ourselves. If we had some weaker position, and we went \nin----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Going where, sir? Going to the U.N. or going back to \nSaddam? I am sorry, who is negotiating with whom? Are you talking about \nthe U.N. negotiating with Saddam or Secretary Powell negotiating within \nthe U.N.?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am talking about Secretary Powell and our diplomats \nnegotiating within the United Nations, negotiating with members of the \nSecurity Council. The feeling is we need to have a strong resolution in \norder to make those negotiations successful.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I see. I thought you were talking about sending a \nmessage to Saddam. No. I understand. I believe the Levin amendment is a \npretty muscular amendment, saying back to the U.N., you passed those \nresolutions, you should really step up to those resolutions, and \nputting the pressure back on them; and also saying, we are not going to \nadjourn until we hear what you are going to do. And we will be ready to \nrespond promptly.\n  So I think the Levin amendment is a fairly muscular amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will now yield to the Senator from New \nHampshire, a good friend, and somebody who does a great job. I yield to \nhim 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. I \nappreciate his courtesy, and I appreciate his leadership on the most \nimportant resolution. His leadership has had an integral impact on how \nthis resolution was designed, and he has been a leader on addressing \nwhat is obviously the major national security issue which we confront \nas a Nation today.\n  I--like many Americans, hopefully--have followed the debate in this \nChamber. I have been interested in the tenor and tempo of the debate. I \nbelieve it has obviously been serious and substantive in its approach \nto how we address the question of this resolution, which will authorize \nthe President to take such action as is necessary in order to protect \nour Nation relative to Iraq, and to work with the United Nations in \nthat undertaking.\n  One of the things, however, I have also noted is there is almost a \nsophistry being presented here. For example, I heard one presentation, \ntalking about whether or not we were pursuing preventive war versus \npreemptive war, in which there was almost a rather nice dissertation of \nwhat I would call political science 101 on the difference between \npreemptive war and preventive war, and whether or not we, as a Nation, \nhad a right to pursue a preventive war versus a preemptive war.\n  I would simply point out we are at war. We are not initiating war. We \nare not in the process of striking an enemy by whom we have not been \nstruck. Two Embassies in Africa were attacked. Hundreds of people died. \nAn American ship in Yemen was attacked. Many sailors died. And, of \ncourse, on September 11, thousands of Americans died in America as a \nresult of an attack.\n\n  We are at war. We did not ask for it. We did not initiate it, but we \nhave no choice but to respond to it. In responding to it, we must have \nour eyes open. We are a Nation which inherently believes in the better \nnature of people. We inevitably give people the benefit of the doubt. \nIt is our culture, and it is one of our strengths. Regrettably, in this \nwar, giving people the benefit of the doubt--people who have a track \nrecord of either hating us, attacking us, or confronting us \nmilitarily--may end up costing us even more lives.\n  I think we need to review the enemy's purpose. Let's begin with al-\nQaida and bin Laden, and use his own words.\n  bin Laden, in an interview that was published in January 1999--it \noriginally appeared in Time--made the following statement:\n\n       Hostility toward America is religious duty.\n\n  He went on to say, in February 1998:\n\n       The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies, \n     civilians and military, is an individual duty of every \n     Moslem, who can do it in any country in which it is possible \n     to do it.\n\n  ``Civilians and military.''\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We, with Allah's help, call on every Moslem, who believes \n     in Allah and wishes to be rewarded, to comply with Allah's \n     order to kill Americans and plunder their money.\n\n  And most recently, in a tape recently released just a week ago:\n\n       The youth of Islam are preparing something to strike fear \n     in your hearts----\n\n  Referring to America----\n\n       and will target the vital sections of your economy until \n     you renounce your injustice and hostility.\n\n  This is an enemy who has called to arms the people who believe in him \nand follow him for the purposes of killing Americans as defined by his \nown language: ``civilian and military.'' That is the enemy we confront \nin al-Qaida.\n  And what is the relationship to Iraq?\n  First off, we must look at the history of our relationship and of \nIraq's relationship in the area of military activity. Saddam Hussein \nhas attacked his neighbors, neighboring nations twice. He has \nmercilessly--mercilessly--suppressed his own people, especially the \nKurdish minority within Iraq. He has invaded Iran and Kuwait.\n  He has also developed and used weapons of mass destruction. ``Weapons \nof mass destruction'' is a terribly antiseptic term. But what it means \nis, he is essentially willing to spread disease which will kill \nthousands--tens of thousands--of people in order to obtain his purpose. \nAnd he has done it. He has used biological weapons. He has used \nchemical weapons against the Iranians and against the Kurdish people in \nhis own country, killing literally thousands of people.\n  Of course, we went to war with Iraq in the early 1990s. So our \nhistory with Iraq is significant, as we recognize they are governed by \nan outlaw and, as a result, have been a nation functioning outside of \nthe civil discourse of organized nations.\n  But why is it important we confront them at this time and in this \ncontext?\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\nIt is important because of the weapons of mass destruction which they \nhave. If this were the world prior to 1980, let us say, when weapons of \nmass destruction were not so readily available, or nations which had \nthem were governed by governments which had at least some modicum of \nresponsibility, then you might not look at a tyrant such as Hussein and \nsay you needed to do anything: Let him, regrettably, do his harm to his \nneighbors and his nation. It is not affecting us.\n  The problem is, after September 11, we, as a country, cannot take \nsuch an isolationist view, for we know there is an enemy out there \ncalled al-Qaida that has stated, unequivocally, their purpose is to \nkill Americans and destroy our society and culture. And we have seen \nthem take action to do that on September 11, and in Africa at our \nEmbassies, and at the USS Cole.\n  We also know there is another nation out there, run by a tyrant, who \nis a murderous individual, who has weapons which are capable of \nexacting massive--massive--amounts of damage and loss of life, if used.\n  The threat, obviously, is that the two should be joined or that the \ntyrant should just unilaterally use these weapons. Why is that threat \nlegitimate? It is legitimate because there is significant common sense \nwhich tells us that it may be joined.\n  There have been reports not by American news media or by American \nintelligence services but by Arab sources which have made it clear that \nthere is a cross-fertilization between the Hussein government and al-\nQaida. Reports appearing in a Karachi newspaper, the Ummat, on November \n22 carried an article saying that Saddam Hussein has offered asylum to \nthe top Taliban and al-Qaida leadership, including Osama bin Laden and \nMullah Omar. In this regard, a delegation led by a senior official in \nthe Iraqi Government, Taha Hussein, met with Mavlana Jalal ud-Din \nHaqqani--I hope I pronounced that correctly, but considering his \npurposes, I don't really care--in Qatar and conveyed Saddam Hussein's \noffer to him.\n  If the report is true, then it is at least the second time Saddam \nHussein has offered bin Laden asylum. A report in the Christian Science \nMonitor cited Arab sources which it considered to be legitimate that, \naccording to Hassan Mohammed, who claims to have worked for two decades \nfor Iraq intelligence services, graduates of an Iraqi school were \nintimately involved in training both Assad al Hassan and al-Qaida \ncells, and the quote is:\n\n       My information is that the Iraqi Government was directly \n     supporting al-Qaida with weapons and explosives.\n\n  There are more and more reports like this. It is also logical, \nlogical because Osama bin Laden and his people have made it clear that \nthose who consider us an enemy are their allies. Therefore, Iraq is a \nnatural ally to them, and vice versa.\n  So the possibility that a weapon of mass destruction which has been \ndeveloped--and we know they have been developed within Iraq, biological \nand chemical weapons--could fall into al-Qaida hands or people \nrepresenting the same concepts of al-Qaida is distinct.\n  We also know that Iraq is moving forward with a nuclear program, that \nthey wish to have a nuclear bomb, and that they may well have it, if \nthey are able to get fissile material within a year; if not, within 3 \nor 4 years. They are much further down the road toward obtaining \nnuclear weapons than we even anticipated when we had the war with them \nin the early 1990s. That was terminated then but has been restarted.\n  So what are we to do about this? The U.N. has passed 16 resolutions, \nthe basic purpose of which is to try to disarm Saddam Hussein and his \ngovernment, specifically in the area of weapons of mass destruction. \nThere is no civilized nation today that does not understand the threat \nthat is represented by having a government headed by a tyrant such as \nSaddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction.\n  So the U.N. has made a conscientious effort to address this with \nthese 16 resolutions. Of course, Saddam Hussein has ignored those, lied \nabout what he is doing, and he ejected the inspectors, which leads us \nto the point we are at today.\n  This resolution has as its fundamental purpose the disarmament of \nSaddam Hussein, taking away his weapons of mass destruction. If, as a \ncorollary to that, a regime change occurred in Iraq, that would be for \nthe betterment of the world, I suspect. But the vital purpose here is \nto terminate the capacity to have and to use weapons of mass \ndestruction, either by Iraq or by a client of Iraq or by an ally of \nIraq or by al-Qaida specifically.\n\n  It is a totally legitimate national security purpose that we should \npursue. The President has outlined the need to accomplish this. What he \nhas essentially said, and appropriately so, is that we will support the \nU.N. effort to accomplish this. But if the U.N. is unable to accomplish \nit, then our national security is so important, so overriding, that we \nshould take action with our allies to accomplish this. That is the only \nreasonable approach when you confront a threat of this significance.\n  There are some in this body who have essentially said we should \npursue what I call the good intentions approach. That is an American \ntrait--that we do give people the benefit of the doubt. But the good \nintentions approach in this area--hoping that things will work out \nthrough a policy of containment--has not worked.\n  We know for a fact that Hussein and his people have ignored the 16 \nresolutions and that they are developing weapons of mass destruction, \nand they actually possess them. We know for a fact that they may well \nuse them. To wait and rely on good intentions would be an error of \npolicy which might lead to the death of many Americans. We can't afford \nthat risk. We must insist, as the President has said, on the \ndisarmament of the Hussein regime; specifically, the disarmament of \ntheir weapons of mass destruction, in a manner which is absolutely \nconfirmable, where we know without question that it has occurred and \nthat those weapons have not been moved into other places of hiding or \ninto other hands, which may cause greater harm.\n  What the resolution before us does is give the President the \nauthority to accomplish those goals. To fail to give the President the \nauthority to accomplish those goals would be, in my opinion, an act of \ngross negligence, a failure of our responsibility as a government to \ndefend our people.\n  We are at war. We have been attacked. Americans have been killed. And \nif Mr. bin Laden and his people have their way, more will be killed.\n  If we are to defend ourselves, we must be assured that the most \nthreatening weapons they can use will not be used against Americans. \nTherefore, we must take action relative to Iraq. This resolution \nempowers the President to accomplish that. That is why I intend to vote \nfor it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New \nHampshire for a very fine statement. I notice that our colleague from \nNorth Carolina has arrived in the Chamber, and we have Senator Jeffords \nscheduled to speak at 3. I ask the Senator from North Carolina, does he \nneed a minute or two to make a comment?\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair, but I cannot use the time now.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was speaking to the manager of the bill, \nSenator Allard. He is scheduled to speak after Senator Jeffords, who is \nnot here. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Allard be recognized for \n20 minutes and that Senator Jeffords follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. President, today, I rise in strong support of S.J. Res. 46, the \nbipartisan joint resolution to authorize the use of the U.S. Armed \nForces against Iraq.\n  First, I want to praise the President for his leadership and for \nreaching out to all Members of this body. I am proud\n\n[[Page S10081]]\n\nto be an original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 46 with Senators Lieberman, \nMcCain, Warner, Bayh, Domenici, Helms, Hutchison, Landrieu, and Miller. \nThese Senators are leaders of the Senate, and I am proud to be \nassociated with them on this important matter.\n  Also, I want to commend the leadership of the other body for their \nleadership in brokering this agreement between the administration, the \nSenate, and the House.\n  I know this debate will be vigorous in nature and serious in tone, \nwhich is exactly how such a debate should take place. One of our most \nsolemn duties as Senators is when we are called upon to cast a vote on \nwhether to send our men and women in uniform into harm's way. Quite \nsimply, this is one of the most serious votes any Member will make.\n  I remember, as a new Member of Congress in 1991, one of my first \nvotes was whether to go to war in the Persian Gulf. Just like in 1991, \nvoting on this resolution will be a tough vote. But that is why we are \nhere--to take a stand, state what we believe, and make the tough votes. \nIn the end, I hope this debate will show that the Senate, despite any \ndisagreements, is united in its resolve against Saddam Hussein.\n  Mr. President, the United States has basically been at war with Iraq \never since the Persian Gulf conflict. In April 1991 and August 1992, \nthe northern and the southern no-fly zones were established in order to \nenforce United Nations Resolution 688. Since then, U.S., British, and \ncoalition aircraft patrolling these no-fly zones have been fired upon \nby Iraq more than 2,500 times and over 400 times this year alone. \nHowever, despite the daily threat in the no-fly zones, our pilots have \nonly fired back in response 44 times.\n  Saddam Hussein has repeatedly defied sixteen United Nations \nresolutions which were designed to ensure that Iraq would no longer be \na threat to international peace and security. Plus, the United Nations \nSecurity Council has issued 30 statements regarding Saddam Hussein's \nviolations of these 16 resolutions. At this time, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a list provided by the White House of the 16 United \nNations Security Council Resolutions and a list of Council statements \nregarding the violations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  U.N. Security Council Resolutions and Council Statements Regarding \n                               Violations\n\n\n        defied un security council resolutions by saddam hussein\n\n     UNSCR

After the Persian Gulf conflict, the international \ncommunity levied economic sanctions and established the ``Oil for \nFood'' program. However, these sanctions have largely eroded due to the \nlack of resolve by the international community and the reality of \nIraq's substantial illicit trade. Turkey and Jordan import Iraqi oil \nvia truck routes, Iran escorts oil tankers through territorial waters, \nan Iraq-Syrian pipeline is the largest export method of Iraqi oil, with \nan Iraq-Jordan pipeline scheduled to be operational in 2005.\n  The United States attempted to garner support for ``Smart Sanctions'' \nin early 2001, but this attempt met tepid reception by the \ninternational community. Russia, China, and France have negotiated \nsubstantial contracts with Iraq which would be executable upon lifting \nof U.N. sanctions. Under the Oil for Food program, food import levels \nexceed and oil revenue is comparable to pre-Gulf war levels. The \nprogram experiences periodic progressive adjustments in its export \nceiling in response to growing international concern about the Iraqi \nhumanitarian condition.\n  However, Saddam Hussein consistently circumvent's the economic \nsanctions and attempts to thwart the oil for food program. Saddam's \nregime has exported thousands of barrels of oil each day in violation \nof UN resolutions and he completely disregards the humanitarian well-\nbeing of his own people. By illegally exporting this oil, he has \ndeprived the Iraqi people billions of dollars in food and medicine \nwhich would have been allowed under the program.\n  The living conditions of the Iraqi people are intolerable. Saddam \nHussein has expanded his violence against women and children, withheld \nfood and medicine from his own citizens, and violated the basic human \nrights of the Iraqi people.\n  Mr. President, some have blamed the oil for food program and the \neconomic sanctions for these conditions. But let us be very clear, the \nreason for these intolerable conditions and why we are debating this \ntopic today lay at the feet of Saddam Hussein and his regime. To quote \nSecretary of State Powell from a Foreign Relations Committee hearing on \nSeptember 26, ``Iraq stands guilty. It convicts itself by its \nactions.''\n  The threat of Saddam Hussein is real and is growing. Iraq enjoys a \nsizable military advantage over all Gulf States except Iran. Iraq's \n424,000 military personnel outnumber the combined personnel total of \nall U.S. Gulf allies. Iraq continues to pursue weapons of mass \ndestruction, and is attempting to acquire a nuclear capability. \nAccording to recent reports, it is estimated that if Iraq were to \nobtain fissile material then Saddam Hussein could build a nuclear bomb \nwithin months. United Nations Special Commission has identified gaps in \naccounting for Iraq's current chemical stockpiles and capabilities and \nhas not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical precursors and \n1000's of delivery warheads. UNSCOM also reported that Iraq has \nunderstated their declarations regarding the extent of its biological \nagents.\n  Again, I would like to quote Secretary Powell from the same hearing, \nwhen he stated:\n\n       We can have debates about the size and nature of the Iraqi \n     stockpile. We can have debates about how long it will take \n     them to reach this level of readiness or that level of \n     readiness with respect to these weapons. But no one can doubt \n     two things: one, they are in violation of these resolutions--\n     there's no debate about that; and secondly, they have not \n     lost the interest to develop these weapons of mass \n     destruction. Whether they are one day, five days, one year or \n     seven years away from any particular weapons, whether their \n     stockpile is small, medium or large, what has not been lost \n     is the interest to have such weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  Secretary Powell also made it clear that we aren't alone in our \nconcern regarding the threat of Saddam Hussein. Referencing Arab \nleaders and their thoughts regarding Saddam, Secretary Powell added, \n``There is no question in their minds that he's a threat to regional \nstability and peace. There is no question in their minds that he is a \nthreat to the region and has demonstrated previously his willingness to \nuse weapons of mass destruction. And there is no doubt in their minds \nthat he continues to have the intent to develop these weapons of mass \ndestructions.''\n  So what now--what do we do? Do we hope that Saddam Hussein goes \ngently into the night or do we finally stand up to this dictator and \nlet the world know that Saddam Hussein can no longer thumb his nose at \nthe international community.\n  We only need to go back a few weeks to see Saddam's duplicity. On \nSeptember 16, 4 days after the President's speech at the U.N., the \nIraqi government announced it would unconditionally allow the return of \nU.N. inspectors. However on September 20, Iraq backpeddled on its \nprevious announcement by stating that the definition of ``unconditional \naccess'' means no ``presidential sites'' and 24 hours notice before any \ninspection.''\n  My reaction to this new definition of ``unconditional'' by Iraq is \nbest summed up in an October 3 Denver Post editorial when it stated, \n``Saddam, there you go again.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article entitled ``Saddam \nMust Open Palaces'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Denver Post, Oct. 3, 2002]\n\n                        Saddam Must Open Palaces\n\n       Saddam, there you go again. Pardon the paraphrasing of \n     Ronald Reagan, but Saddam Hussein's offer to allow weapons \n     inspectors back into his country under current United Nation \n     rules--the same rules he has willfully and flagrantly \n     violated for years--is pure smoke-and-mirrors diplomacy.\n       Under those rules, Saddam's palaces would be off limits to \n     inspectors.\n       Any inspection of Iraq must be unfettered. Otherwise, \n     what's the point?\n       It's simply Saddam trying to stay one step ahead of the \n     United States, with catch-me-if-you-can stall tactics.\n       The Iraqi dictator has been spending billions since the \n     Persian Gulf War building what the U.S. government believes \n     to be dozens of mammoth desert palaces. Meanwhile, his people \n     starve. (Saddam cleverly blames\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\n     U.N. sanctions for keeping food and medicine out of his \n     country, yet somehow finds the marble and gold to build \n     palaces.)\n       Who's he trying to fool?\n       Well, France, Russia and China for starters. Those three \n     permanent, voting members of the U.N. Security Council have \n     not yet backed the United States' push to require open \n     weapons inspections, destruction of any weapons of mass \n     destruction and the use of military force if Iraq doesn't \n     comply.\n       President Bush was right in going to the United Nations to \n     remind its members how Saddam has consistently and brazenly \n     laughed off its rules.\n       It was a big step toward building a much-needed world \n     consensus for striking Iraq. But if getting U.N. Security \n     Council approval requires us to work under old rules, such as \n     those where palaces are off limits, the world, and those \n     three countries, must know the United States will act without \n     them.\n       The U.N. can't fall for Saddam's old tricks.\n       Congress on Wednesday was moving forward with a strongly \n     worded resolution that gives Bush authority to attack Iraq if \n     diplomatic measures fail.\n       Bush, in turn, must certify to Congress before an attack, \n     or within 48 hours, that diplomatic and other peaceful means \n     alone aren't enough to protect Americans.\n       ``We will not leave the future of peace and the security of \n     America in the hands of this cruel and dangerous man,'' Bush \n     said Wednesday from the White House Rose Garden.\n       As he spoke, he was flanked as usual by Republicans, but \n     also by what seems to be a growing number of Democrats.\n       Perhaps it's the approaching election. Or perhaps, as we \n     hope, it's the morning briefings with congressional leaders \n     where Bush is privately detailing why he considers Iraq an \n     imminent threat.\n       For whatever reason, one of his potential rivals in 2004 \n     strongly foreshadowed Wednesday that soon both parties will \n     be singing with ``one voice,'' as Bush predicted last week.\n       Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said the administration has \n     exhausted all non-military means to disarm Saddam.\n       ``They've not worked,'' he said. ``The moment of truth has \n     arrived for Saddam Hussein. This is his last chance.''\n       We've heard that before. Let's hope this time it's true.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to quote a few passages from the \neditorial:\n\n       Any inspection of Iraq must be unfettered. Otherwise, \n     what's the point? It's simply Saddam trying to stay one step \n     ahead of the United States, with catch-me-if-you-can stall \n     tactics.\n\n  Later in the editorial it states:\n\n       President Bush was right in going to the United Nations to \n     remind its members how Saddam has consistently and brazenly \n     laughed off its rules. It was a big step toward building a \n     much-needed world consensus for striking Iraq. But if getting \n     U.S. Security Council approval requires us to work under old \n     rules, such as those where palaces are off limits, the world, \n     and those three countries (France, China, and Russia), must \n     know the United States will act without them. The U.N. can't \n     fall for Saddam's old tricks.\n\n  I hope the United Nations Security Council will devise a new tough \nresolution which will demand ``unconditional and unfettered'' access to \nall sites. I do not want to have to use force to disarm Saddam Hussein. \nHowever, I also will not allow the United Nations or any permanent \nmember of the Security Council with veto power, to control our national \nsecurity policy. And that is why I support this resolution.\n  S.J. Res 46 does not advocate force, but it does not preclude it. It \nuses force as the last resort, the very last. The resolution basically \nstates that the President is granted authority to use force if he \ndetermines that:\n\n       (1) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or \n     other peaceful means alone either (A) will not adequately \n     protect the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq or (B) is not likely to \n     lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions regarding Iraq, and\n       (2) acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with \n     the United States and other countries continuing to take the \n     necessary actions against international terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations, including those nations, \n     organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed \n     or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September \n     11, 2001.\n\n  I believe Secretary Powell clarified the administration's position \neven further regarding the use of force during the September 26 hearing \nby stating, ``Yes, he [the President] wants the authority to carry out \nthose resolutions where he believes force is the appropriate way to get \nimplementation of those resolutions. I think it unlikely the President \nwould use force--if he [Saddam Hussein] complied with the weapons of \nmass destruction conditions, it seems very unlikely that anybody would \nbe using force to comply with any of the other resolutions.''\n  Much of this debate is about when to pass this resolution. Should we \npass a resolution before the United Nations acts or should we wait \nuntil after the United Nations acts? I believe this Senate should act \nprior to the United Nations to show that we speak with one voice in the \nimportance of disarming Saddam Hussein. I agree with Secretary Powell \nand former Secretary of State Albright when they both stated that the \nUnited States would be in a much better position to prevail in the \nUnited Nations if the administration had a congressionally approved \nresolution in their pocket.\n  Passing this resolution in no way precludes the United Nations from \nacting, nor should it lessen the resolve of this administration to gain \nsuch support, but I believe a vote on this resolution will show our \nresolve to the world that we want the United Nations to act. However, \nif the United Nations is determined to follow the same course it has \nover the last 10 years, then Saddam Hussein must understand that the \nUnited States will act alone. On August 20, 1998, President Clinton \naddressed the Nation and said, ``The risks of inaction to America and \nthe world would be far greater than action, for that would embolden our \nenemies, leaving their ability and their willingness to strike us \nintact.'' I do not want us to use force, but I also cannot and will not \nsit idly by and hope that Saddam Hussein does nothing while the U.N. \ntalks, and talks, and talks.\n  I believe President Bush summed up our task at hand during his speech \nlast night in Cincinnati when he stated:\n\n       We did not ask for this present challenge, but we accept \n     it. Like other generations of Americans, we will meet the \n     responsibility of defending human liberty against violence \n     and aggression. By our resolve, we will give strength to \n     others. By our courage, we will give hope to others. By our \n     actions, we will secure the peace, and lead the world to a \n     better day.\n\n  Mr. President, I end on a personal note about this Senate. As I look \nacross the aisle and see the ``Conscience and Historian of the \nSenate'', the wonderful senior Senator from West Virginia--with whom I \nfind it a honor to serve--and as I see Members of this Senate debate \nand disagree on this resolution, it is during these debates I am in awe \nof this great country and this great institution. Unlike so many other \nnations, we can debate war and peace and at the end of the day there is \nno fracture in the fiber of democracy that makes America great. It is \nthis which we all wish for Iraq and for the Iraqi people. I look \nforward to the day when real democratic elections occur and when the \nvoices of the Iraqi people, which have been silenced for too long, will \nbe heard.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont who is speaking \nnext.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. President, I have come to discuss, not unexpectedly, the \nsituation in Iraq and what our country ought to do in response to that \nthreat.\n  As has happened many times before when faced with a potential threat \nto our national security and to the security of our allies, we must \ncarefully evaluate that threat, and decide how best to deal with it.\n  It is imperative we not make a rash decision that will have lasting \nconsequences for generations to come.\n  I am very disturbed by President Bush's determination that the threat \nfrom Iraq is so severe and so immediate that we must rush to a military \nsolution. I do not see it that way.\n  I have been briefed several times by Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, CIA \nDirector Tenet, and other top administration officials. I have \ndiscussed this issue with the President. I have heard nothing--\nnothing--that convinces me that an immediate preemptive military strike \nis necessary or that it would further our interests in the long term.\n  Saddam Hussein's desire to acquire weapons of mass destruction is of \ngrave concern. Based on the information that has been provided to me by \nthis administration, I believe this threat is best dealt with in the \ncontext of the United Nations.\n  The U.N. must move aggressively to ensure unfettered inspections and \nbolster its efforts to stop the proliferation\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\nof materials that can be used in the production of weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I urge the U.N. Security Council to take immediate and strong action \nto deal with Iraq and its infractions. Should Iraq fail to comply with \nthe United Nations resolutions, it is incumbent on the United States to \naggressively work with member nations to develop a means to bring Iraq \ninto compliance.\n  But at this time, I cannot in good conscience authorize any use of \nmilitary force against Iraq other than in the context of a U.N. \nSecurity Council effort.\n  If we receive information that the threat is more imminent, or if the \nUnited Nations' effort fails, then the President should come back to \nCongress for consideration of the next step.\n  Providing the President with authorization at this time for \nunilateral U.S. military action would undercut U.N. Security Council \nefforts to disarm Iraq.\n  We must ensure that any action we take against Iraq does not come at \nthe expense of the health and strength of our Nation, or the stability \nof the international order upon which our economic security depends.\n  I spoke at length on the Senate floor last week about pressing \nproblems that will determine the future strength of our Nation:\n  Grossly inadequate funding for education, declining access to \naffordable health care, degradation of our environment, and erosion of \npension security for many hard-working Americans.\n  Saddam Hussein is as bad a dictator as they come. His past actions \nspeak volumes about his true intentions. But is the only solution to \nthis dilemma a military solution? Experience tells us otherwise. Ten \nyears of containment through enforcement of two no-fly zones and U.N. \neconomic sanctions have prevented Saddam Hussein from rebuilding his \nmilitary to any significant extent especially with respect to our \nsecurity. His military strength remains significantly weaker than when \nhe moved against Kuwait more than a decade ago.\n  There is much speculation about his weapons of mass destruction \nprogram, but no evidence that he has developed a nuclear capability, \nand less that he could deliver it. While there is talk of cooperation \nbetween Iraq and al-Qaida, and I don't doubt that there has been some \ncooperation, I have not seen any hard evidence of close cooperation. \nThere is, however, a great deal of evidence of Saddam's paranoia and \nhis distrust of all but his closest inner circle. He has wiped out any \nviable political opposition and tightly holds all the reins of control. \nEven if he were to develop a nuclear capability, which he does not \nhave, I have a hard time believing that Saddam Hussein would turn these \nweapons over to any organization, particularly a terrorist \norganization, after he has paid so dearly to acquire them.\n  Our greatest problem, it seems to me, is that we have very little \ngood intelligence on what is going on inside Iraq. We know that Saddam \nHussein's intentions are bad, but we don't have a clear picture of what \nhis capabilities actually are, or if a threat exists. Clearly, we need \nto get United Nations inspectors on the ground immediately. The \ninspectors must have unfettered access to all suspected sites in Iraq. \nThis is proving to be a major challenge for the United Nations, but the \nUnited Nations is much more likely to succeed if the United States is \nsquarely behind its efforts, and not standing off to the side, secretly \nhoping that it will fail.\n  We should give the United Nations the opportunity to step forward and \ndeal with Iraq and its infractions. In my estimation, the United States \nstands to gain much more if we can work with the United Nations to \ndeliver a multilateral approach to disarming Iraq, even providing \nmilitary force, if necessary. If the United Nations fails to press for \nthe disarmament of Iraq or is blocked in its efforts, then I would \nexpect the President to come back to Congress for further discussion of \nthe alternatives.\n  In view of this threat from Saddam Hussein, which I believe is \nmissing, I urge the Congress not to adjourn sine die upon completion of \nits work this fall, but to be ready to return to session at any time \nprior to the New Year if further action against Saddam Hussein should \nbecome necessary.\n  We must also work with the United Nations to stop the flow of those \nmaterials needed for producing weapons of mass destruction. There is a \ngreat deal more that we could do to tighten international \nnonproliferation regimes. Rather than supporting and empowering \ninternational efforts to stop the flow of nuclear materials and force \ngreater transparency in chemical and biological commercial production \nfacilities, the Bush administration has undercut these efforts and \nrefused to participate in attempts to strengthen existing \nnonproliferation regimes. For example, last fall, at the Biological \nWeapons Convention review conference, the Bush administration scuttled \nefforts by our closest allies, most notably Great Britain, to \nstrengthen the international biological weapons inspection regime.\n  The administration has actively undermined efforts to monitor and \nverify the existing international moratorium on nuclear weapons \ntesting.\n  Additionally, we should be putting more resources into the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram, which has had some success at preventing the export from the \nformer Soviet Union of nuclear weapons materials and scientific know-\nhow. Saddam Hussein is not the only deranged dictator who is willing to \ndeprive his people in order to acquire weapons of mass destruction.\n  Just think of what progress we could make on nonproliferation if we \nwere to put one fraction of the cost of a war against Saddam Hussein \ninto efforts to prevent the emergence of the next nuclear, chemical, or \nbiological threat. Strong efforts at strengthening international \nnonproliferation regimes would truly enhance our Nation's future \nsecurity.\n  In our preoccupation with Saddam Hussein, we must not lose sight of \npotential crises in several other areas of the world. The India-\nPakistan nuclear confrontation and the standoff over Kashmir have \ndemanded a great deal of American effort during the past year. We \ncannot rule out a re-emergence of this nuclear threat. The conflict \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians continues to claim lives and \nthreaten the stability of the region. Without U.S. prodding and even \ndirect involvement, there is little chance that a peace process could \nresume there. War with Iraq could have an inflammatory effect upon that \nsituation, and potentially risk the security of Israel as well. A war \nwith Iraq would diminish our focus on bringing stability to \nAfghanistan, risking a return of anarchy to an area we have just given \nAmerican lives to stabilize. While Pakistan has stood with us this \nyear, a lessening of U.S. attention to Afghanistan could significantly \nundercut our influence in Islamabad. And the larger war on terrorism, \nour top concern just a few months ago, would take a back seat to a \nprotracted war with Iraq and a major reconstruction effort. Yes, we \nmust worry about Saddam. But we must not do so in a manner that reduces \nour ability to deal with these other threats.\n  I fear that this administration is, perhaps unwittingly, heading us \ninto a miserable cycle of waging wars that isolate our Nation \ninternationally and stir up greater hatred of America. This cycle will \ngenerate more enemies, while undercutting our support from a broad \ncoalition of allies--coalitions that have proven to be the hallmark of \nall successful peacemaking efforts in recent years.\n  We owe it to the American people not to rush into a war, but to work \nwith the institutions that we fought so hard to develop for just this \neventuality. If multilateral efforts fail, then the President should \ncome back to Congress for consideration of the next course of action. I \ncannot support a resolution that puts this Nation on a path to war \nwithout first exhausting diplomatic efforts. Now is the time to put the \ninternational system to work for us, and consider unilateral military \naction only as a last resort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are running ahead of time with our \nscheduled speakers. I have not had an opportunity to speak to the \nmanager of the bill, but I have spoken to the staff. Senator Kennedy \ncomes to speak automatically at 3:40. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Cleland be recognized at 3:30 for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S10085]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Senator from Connecticut will speak \nfor the next 10 minutes or so, and then we will be on schedule for our \n3:30 speaker.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, as one of the four lead sponsors of the \namendment in the nature of a substitute resolution, I appreciate very \nmuch the thoughtfulness of my colleagues in addressing the resolution \nwe put forward, including those who have expressed reservations or \nobjection to it. I will take a few moments to respond to a few of \nthose, as time allows.\n  One of the concerns expressed was that our resolution essentially \nprovides the President with a blank check and, at its worst, according \nto the critics, is in derogation of the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  Respectfully, I object to both of those descriptions. Let me take the \nfirst, which is the question of the Constitution. The Constitution says \nin article I, among the powers enumerated in section 8 that the \nCongress of the United States is to have, is the power to declare war. \nThat is stated. Incidentally, in the same clause there are other \npowers: To grant letters of marque and reprisal and make rules \nconcerning captures on land and water.\n  Though the Congress of the United States, for various reasons, has \nnot formally declared war since December of 1941, that is the effect of \nthe resolution before the Senate, to authorize the President to take \nmilitary action to put American troops into combat, into war. That is \nthe extent of the description in the Constitution.\n  The authority that would be given to the President under our \nresolution is entirely within that constitutional grant to the \nCongress, which is to give the President the authority to defend the \nnational security of the United States--and again, no blank check \nhere--against the continuing threat posed by Iraq. It is targeted to \nthat particular point, based on the conclusions about Iraq's danger to \nthe United States stated in the preamble or the whereas clauses. \n``And''--not ``or''--and this authority is given not only to protect \nthe security of the United States against the threat imposed by Iraq \nand to enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions \nregarding Iraq.\n  So one may disagree with the conclusions that those who are \nsponsoring this resolution have reached about the clear and present \ndanger Iraq under Saddam Hussein represents to America's national \nsecurity, but I respectfully do not think anyone can convincingly claim \nthis resolution is in any sense unconstitutional. It is well within the \nauthority granted to the Congress under article I of the Constitution. \nNor is it, in any sense, a blank check. It is circumscribed by the \nterms I have just described, ``and''--not ``or''--two grounds of \nauthority. It is not a blank check. It is a check that can only be \nspent within the parameters set out in those two clauses.\n  I might add, the Congress also is given by the Constitution the power \nto appropriate funds. That is the ultimate power that Congress has, to \nmake sure this is not a blank check either in terms of what the money \ncan be spent for or how much money can be spent.\n  Questions have been raised about the urgency of this matter and the \ntiming of the request by the President for this authority. I said \nearlier today and I will say briefly again that in the case of this \nSenator, I have believed now for more than a decade that we have been \nmuch too patient--in fact, have been in error at the end of the Persian \nGulf war for not moving to remove Saddam Hussein from power when his \nmilitary was in disarray. We knew what his goals were, what his record \nwas. We knew by statements he made that he had the ambition to be the \nleader of the Arab world, the modern-day Saladin, to have Baghdad \nbecome the capital of the Arab world, of the Persian Gulf. That, of \ncourse, would be terrible for the Arab world, terrible for the world, \nand terrible particularly for the United States of America.\n\n  Over the last decade, for those who believe we are acting \nprecipitously in passing and offering this resolution, we have tried \neverything else to get Saddam Hussein to keep the promise he made at \nthe end of the gulf war. We have tried sanctions, embargoes, \ninspections, trade restrictions, the Oil for Food Program, even limited \nmilitary action. None of them has worked.\n  I repeat briefly some of the history. In February of 1991 after the \nIraqi military was vanquished in the Persian Gulf war, Saddam Hussein, \neffectively to preserve his leadership of that country, signed an \nagreement accepting all U.N. Security Council resolutions passed after \nhis invasion of Kuwait as a condition for the termination of \nhostilities. That included Resolution No. 687 which required that \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction be ``destroyed, removed or rendered \nharmless.'' In that Resolution 687, it goes on to require that \ninspectors be allowed into Iraq.\n  Saddam Hussein systematically withheld information, used every \navailable method of deception. I have an article from Time magazine of \nSeptember, 1995, 7 years ago, which describes how much we knew about \nthe deception that Saddam Hussein--the cheating and retreating, as the \narticle said, that Saddam Hussein had gone through to frustrate the \nwill of the United Nations and how much we have learned in admissions \nthat were made as the United States mobilized forces to invade Kuwait: \nThat the Iraqis had admitted they had begun filling 191 bombs and Scud \nmissile warheads with deadly biological agents such as anthrax and \nbotulism toxin, which were to be mounted on missiles, planes, and drone \naircraft and dropped on enemy troops, fewer than half of whom had \nreceived the appropriate germ warfare vaccinations.\n  One Iraq report, reading from the article in Time magazine 7 years \nago, stated that shortly before invading Kuwait in August of 1990, \nSaddam ordered a crash program to have a nuclear weapon built by April \nof 1991.\n  Interestingly, a month before this article was printed in Time \nmagazine, Baghdad rushed to give some documents to the U.N. to jump \nahead of Saddam's son-in-law, Hussein Kamel al-Majid, who had defected. \nHe had been a senior general in charge of the nuclear and biological \nweapons program. Hussein, according to the article, knew he could not \nkeep him quiet, so he decided to try to make points with the U.N. by \nproducing a flood of information. It was devastating in its content in \nterms of the deadly toxins of which he was developing an enormous \ninventory.\n  Of course, we know since the inspectors were ejected in 1998 and \nSaddam has now had, after his deception of the years that preceded, 4 \nyears to build up his inventory which our intelligence and allied \nintelligence confirm has grown, remains, and is today more threatening \nand more powerful in terms of weapons of mass destruction, \nunconventional, than he had ever been before.\n  I want to go back to one final quote. On February 15 of 1991, as we \nhad won a victory in the gulf war, Saddam said:\n\n       Every Iraqi child, woman, and old man knows how to take \n     revenge. They will avenge the pure blood that has been shed, \n     no matter how long it takes.\n\n  That is undoubtedly why Saddam tried to assassinate former President \nBush in 1993. That is why our State Department continues to designate \nIraq under Saddam as a state sponsor of terrorist groups that have \nkilled Americans. That is why we cannot rest until he is disarmed, \nwhich is the purpose of this resolution--disarm or face military \naction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I find it the height of irony in the \nmidst of our discussion on potential war with Iraq and potential use of \nforce and committing young Americans into harm's way--and I indicated \nmy support yesterday for the bipartisan resolution that would authorize \nthe use of force to go after weapons of mass destruction in Iraq--I \nfind it ironic in the midst of this debate about whether to commit \nAmerican forces to a national objective somewhere in the world, that in \nthe Washington Post yesterday an article was entitled ``New Pension \nBenefits Imperil Defense Bill. In Cost-Conscious Move, Bush Vows to \nVeto Entire Budget if Item Isn't Eliminated.''\n  The message in the article is disturbing to me because the item \nreferred to is something called concurrent receipt.\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\n  I might say currently under law there is an untenable situation \nwhere, if someone has served 20 years in the American military and \nadditionally gets wounded in that service, they cannot draw their \nretirement which they have earned and their disability compensation \nwhich they are entitled to, concurrently. They cannot do that. So I \nfind it ironic in the midst of the time when the President is calling \nupon us to authorize the use of force somewhere in the world, he is \nopposing the use of concurrent receipt or the ability of our troops, \nour servicemen and women who have served 20 years or more and get \nwounded in that effort, to draw those entitlements concurrently. He \nopposes that and has threatened to veto the almost $400 billion defense \nauthorization bill because of that one item. That is unconscionable.\n  This article says the President has threatened to veto the defense \nauthorization bill for fiscal year 2003 in order to block the Defense \nDepartment from paying veterans and military retirees the very \ncompensation they have earned.\n\n  I am puzzled. I am flabbergasted by the President's position and the \nveto threat. He goes on television one night and threatens war to \naccomplish our national objectives, and the next moment says he is \ngoing to veto the entire defense authorization bill which would help \npay for that very war because he doesn't agree with the Senate's \nposition here, where we stand foursquare behind those who have gone in \nthe military, served more than 20 years, and gotten wounded.\n  I can't understand it. Surely, with all the benefits and quality-of-\nlife provisions we have in our laws supporting our military families, \nand authorizing weapons systems, and passing, as we passed in this \nbody, a defense authorization bill of $393.4 billion--that the \nPresident has threatened to veto this package over a question that \nought to be a nonstarter, a no-brainer, is very alarming. The fact is, \nif somebody serves in the American military 20 years or more and gets \nwounded in that service, what they are actually entitled to is not \nauthorized.\n  I challenge anyone who opposes the repeal of the concurrent receipt: \nJust what are we talking about here? What is the cost to our military \npersonnel who put their lives on the line? And what is the cost to our \nNation when nobody else wants to do that because we are not giving them \ntheir just due? We have to address this issue and protect our military \nretirees and veterans. To ignore it is actually the height of \nhypocrisy, and dishonors the very men and women who serve in uniform.\n  How can we as a Nation, in good conscience, in a matter of hours, ask \nour military men and women to put their lives on the line in the future \nif they know this country will not take care of them?\n  That is idiotic. The defense authorization bill is in conference \nbetween the House and the Senate. It is my hope we can find the right \ncompromise that will make sure we take care of our veterans and \nretirees. I urge that the House and Senate adopt legislation that will \naddress this issue, and I ask the President and the Secretary of \nDefense rethink their position and stand up for our veterans and \nmilitary retirees who are unfairly affected by the current law. We need \nto change it.\n  This body stood foursquare behind them. As a matter of fact, one of \nmy combat veterans in this great body here, fellow Vietnam veteran \nSenator John Kerry from Massachusetts, he and I and others are sending \na letter to the President of the United States, urging him to recant \nthat position on threatening to veto the very defense authorization \nbill we will need to go to the very war he is trying to crank up.\n  I see this as the height of irony. At one moment we are threatening \nto put our young Americans into harm's way. At the other moment the \nPresident said he is going to veto the entire defense authorization \nbill because of one item. What is that one item we are paying at the \nrequest of this great body? Those who serve 20 years or more and get \nwounded, they get their just due.\n  I appreciate my colleague, Senator Reid from Nevada, for pushing this \nissue and bringing it to national attention as the chairman of the \nPersonnel Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee. We feel very \nstrongly in our committee and in the Armed Services Committee of this \nbody on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I worked on this situation a long time. I appreciate the \nSenator from Georgia coming, lending your prestige, I underscore that, \non this very important issue. As the Senator said, this is a simple \nissue, whether someone who has put in his time in the military, whether \nit is 10 or 20 or whatever years it is--20 or 30--whatever it is, and \nthen, I say to my friend from Georgia, the distinguished Senator, then \nfinds himself, because he has a disability--it could be 100 percent or \nwhatever percent disability--he has to make a choice. He can't get both \npensions, both of which are earned.\n  If there were ever an example of how a country owes this to these \npeople, this is it. I say to my friend from Georgia, thank you very \nmuch. The Senator from Georgia, I know, as I do, goes to VFW halls and \nthe other veterans' organizations, and we see there large numbers of \nWorld War II veterans. I am not happy to say this, but a thousand are \ndying every day. These men--and very few women, from World War II; as \nwe went back, there were more women involved--deserve this. As in \nKorea. I have a friend the Senator from Georgia knows, who was my high \nschool teacher, the Governor of the State of Nevada, who lost a limb in \nKorea. He had to make a choice. He cannot do both. He spent time in the \nAir Force, in the Marines, in the Army and, under this goofy law he \ncannot draw both pensions if, in fact, he was entitled to them.\n  This is just senseless. So I appreciate very much the Senator from \nGeorgia recognizing the importance of this and lending his prestige.\n  No one can come and speak on veterans' matters with more authority \nthan the Senator from Georgia. I say to the Senator, not only have you \nreceived injuries, but you are also the person who ran the Department \nof Veterans Affairs. You have seen it from all sides. I appreciate very \nmuch your being here, helping on this legislation the conference \ncommittee must approve. It is simply just unfair if they do not.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CLELAND. I do.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I apologize for not hearing the Senator's entire remarks. \nOn what I heard at the end, I fully concur.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator use his microphone?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I beg your pardon.\n  Does the Senator actually believe the President would veto this? I \nmean, the President speaks so glowingly and lovingly--and I believe he \nmeans it--about our veterans and our responsibilities and our \nobligations. If you laid out to the American people what we are talking \nabout here, they would understand this just does not make sense.\n  Most people--who are not veterans, who are not disabled, who do not \nparticipate in any way--I think assume the law is as you and Senator \nReid and myself and others are trying to change it.\n  I ask the Senator, A, do you really believe the President would veto \nthis? And, B, what is the real reason for the veto? I mean, is there \nsomething I am missing here?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is right in his sense of being absolutely \ndumbfounded by this. I am absolutely perplexed. I would certainly hope \nthe President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, would not \nveto a defense authorization bill worth $394 billion, that this body \npassed, on a spurious issue that it costs money to pay those who fight \nour wars. It sure does, especially those who get wounded in our wars. \nIt sure does. If we can find the money for war, certainly we can find \nthe money to take care of those who fight our wars. It is just as \nsimple as that to me.\n  So I thank the Senator from Delaware for his question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could, because I have been aligned \nwith the distinguished Senator from Nevada, Senator Levin, and others \non both sides of the aisle, together with our colleague from Georgia, \nabout this concurrent receipt--this Senator knows of no time the \nPresident of the\n\n[[Page S10087]]\n\nUnited States has directly spoken to this issue. Thus far, only the \nindividuals who are working in the budgetary matters at OMB have. As \nyou mentioned yesterday, I say to the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Chu, who \nis a principal adviser to the Secretary of Defense, had made comments.\n  At this point in time I find no foundation to associate the President \npersonally with this decision. Furthermore--and then I will yield right \naway--being an active member of the conference of the four principals \nbetween the House and the Senate, the targets are moving back and \nforth. There is the Senate version, there is the House version, and \nthere is the amended Senate version. There is also one Senator McCain \nand I have talked about, and that is, should we move forward on \nconcurrent receipts, we would do it in the context of the Purple Heart \nwinners and those who have injuries that are directly associated with \nhaving served in combat zones. That may not be to the liking of all of \nus, but all types of options are being explored.\n  I know at this time no basis of fact that the President is personally \ninvolved.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not know what is the proper procedure \nat this time. The Senator from Georgia has the floor. But with the \npermission of the Chair and the Senator from Georgia, I would like to \ndirect a question to my friend, the distinguished ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator will recall yesterday, on the floor, I said, I \ndo not think the President knows what the people are saying. I think if \nthe President really knew what people were saying--we are robbing Peter \nto pay Paul on people who have injuries, people who are disabled \nbecause of their service in the military--I do not think the President \nwould do that. I hope not. That is what I heard coming from the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, that I do not think this is \nPresident Bush's personality; at least I hope not.\n  I say, though, to my friend, as I said yesterday, I really do believe \na person who is injured in combat--and I cannot speak from experience, \nas can my friends, such as Senator Kerry, Senator Inouye, and Senator \nCleland, what combat is like. I do not really know. But I do know \npeople who have disabilities in the military. No matter how they \nreceived those disabilities, I believe they are entitled to that \ndisability payment. I think it may be an easy way out for some to just \nsay: Well, if you are injured in combat, you are entitled to your \ndisability pay, but if you are injured on the back lines by a tank \nrunning over you, or a truck hitting you, or falling off a truck doing \nwork to take care of those people on the front lines, then you are not. \nBut I say, whether that person is 3,000 miles away or 30,000 miles away \nfrom the front lines, I think they are entitled to that compensation \nfor disability just as well as someone else. That is a comment I make \nto my friend from Virginia prior to your making a decision in that \nconference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend he is very correct \nand accurate, as always, in what he stated yesterday as not being \nassociated to the President personally.\n  I say to the Senator, I associate myself with your goal of having \nbroader concurrent receipts. But I am faced, as the ranking member of \nthe committee, with the reality of the situation. We will have to \nascertain exactly: Is there a line at which the executive branch will \naccept some version of concurrent receipts? And we just have to bring \nthat back to our colleagues.\n  Because if we were to experience a veto--I am not suggesting in any \nway it has been communicated other than through the staff to this \nSenator--our bill would go down. Twelve months of work by the Armed \nServices Committee would go down. Many benefits, pay raises for the men \nand women of the Armed Forces, new weapons--it all goes down on this \none issue.\n  I say to the Senator, I share with you--I find it very hard to think \nthat could come about. But, nevertheless, all of us having been here \nmany years, under several Presidents, know there are junctures in \nconferences when this does happen. It is our responsibility--and I \nassume it--to try and ascertain, is there some form? And then we bring \nit back to our colleagues. If there isn't, then I think we should all \nrecognize the situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond very quickly.\n  Senator Byrd has been here--and I say this with dignity and respect--\nand he has given us so many lectures on the Constitution. I have \nlistened. I believe in the Constitution. We are a separate and equal \nbranch of Government. The President cannot tell us what happens in \nconference. He can offer his opinion.\n  I say this, as I said yesterday, the President cannot sustain a veto \non this matter. He cannot sustain a veto. I would put up before this \nbody, any time, my veterans compared to the people who surround the \nPresident.\n  So I say to my friend from Virginia, a man of courage, integrity, \nand, as I said yesterday, a gentleman, hang in there. We are the third \nbranch of Government. We deserve to be able to do what we have passed \nin this body. We cannot let the administration cow us on this because \nwe are right. If he vetoes it, we will override the President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak 2 minutes \non this point--just 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I have been here 30 years. This is the most \nridiculous thing I have ever heard. This is absolutely mind-boggling. \nThis is brain dead. We have a roughly $400 billion defense bill. We may \nbe asked to go to war. And some bureaucratic functionary, somewhere in \nthe bowels of OMB--if that is what is to be believed--is suggesting \nthat we hold up this bill because they do not want to allow disabled \nveterans to have concurrent receipt of their disability and their \nmilitary pension. That is brain dead.\n  And, Mr. President--you are not listening; but I hope your staff is \nlistening--stop this. Stop this. Stop this. It makes no sense, Mr. \nChairman, to yield to blackmail that they'll veto this bill when the \nSenate has overwhelmingly voted for concurrent receipt. If you yield to \nthis, Mr. Chairman, I will be dumbfounded--dumbfounded. I know you've \nworked a whole year. I have worked a whole year, and up to 8 years, on \nlegislation.\n  But I can't believe you'd even listen to somebody who would say this. \nWhy wouldn't you pick up the phone and call up the President and say: \nMr. President, is this the deal? Is this the deal? Tell me straight up, \nboss. What is the deal? Because if it is, it is outrageous.\n  So I suggest we just pick up the phone and call the President. You \nhave a close relationship with him. Call him. Ask him. Ask him. I pray \nto God he would not even think of saying to you: No. I will veto a $400 \nbillion bill at the same time while nailing the veterans. Call him. \nPhone home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, point of parliamentary inquiry: What is \nthe business currently pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Lieberman amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry, under the order now before the \nSenate, we are on the Lieberman amendment. It is my understanding the \nSenator from Massachusetts is entitled to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is entitled to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4857 To Amendment No. 4856\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  My purpose is to offer an amendment to the Lieberman amendment which \nis in the nature of a substitute. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. WARNER. Could I inquire of the leader, before he departs the \nfloor, regarding the order that is in now, we are dealing with matters \nrelating to debate on Iraq; the nature of this substitute amendment is \nwhat?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It will add an additional authority to the President \nrelative to the use of force.\n  Mr. WARNER. This is an amendment to the matter that is pending before \nthe Senate?\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is an amendment to the matter pending before the \nSenate, yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see. Could I ask my colleague: We have been trying to \nwork in a very cooperative way, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, \nSenator Reid and myself, on the timing of these things. Has this matter \nbeen taken to the leadership?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have discussed it with Senator Daschle.\n  Mr. WARNER. And his views on it are?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I do not know what his views are.\n  Mr. WARNER. I see. Could I ask the distinguished majority whip about \nthe procedure at this point in time? I know on this side we have tried \nvery hard to stay within the framework, although it is not clearly \nestablished, but the framework as to how this Iraq debate would go on \nand the timing of the introduction.\n  Mr. REID. I would say to my friend from Virginia, the Senator from \nFlorida wants to offer the amendment and then leave the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will not debate the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. He has a right sometime today to offer the amendment. The \nSenator from Connecticut is aware of his wishing to offer this. He has \na right to offer it, but it is just a question of when he would do it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I don't dispute the rights. I am just trying to stay \nwithin the framework of the guidance being given by our respective \nleadership on the management of this matter.\n  Mr. REID. The reason he did it this way is so we would not interrupt \nthe order in effect.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then the amendment would become the pending business, \nwould it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I asked the question as to whether or not it would become \nthe pending business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be reported, and it will \nbecome the pending business.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is that the desire then?\n  Mr. REID. I guess we should have mentioned it to you. I apologize we \ndidn't do that. I think there was wide knowledge he was going to do \nthis sometime today.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am asking then if I might just have time to consult \nwith our leadership, recognizing the Senator has a right, so I could \nget such instructions as my leader may wish to contribute.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the clerk is going to \nreport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4857 to amendment No. 4856.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide substitute language that includes an authorization \n for the use of the United States Armed Forces to defend the national \n   security of the United States against the threat posed by certain \n                    foreign terrorist organizations)\n\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq and International \n     Terrorists Resolution''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.\n\n       The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by \n     the President to--\n       (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security \n     Council all relevant Security Council resolutions applicable \n     to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and\n       (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security \n     Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, \n     evasion, and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies \n     with all relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the \n     Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be \n     necessary and appropriate in order to--\n       (1) defend the national security of the United States \n     against the continuing threat posed by Iraq;\n       (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions regarding Iraq; and\n       (3) defend the national security of the United States \n     against the threat posed by the following terrorist \n     organizations:\n       (A) The Abu Nidal Organization.\n       (B) HAMAS.\n       (C) Hizballah.\n       (D) Palestine Islamic Jihad.\n       (E) Palestine Liberation Front.\n       (b) Presidential Determination.--In connection with the \n     exercise of the authority granted in paragraph (1) or (2) of \n     subsection (a) to use force, the President shall, prior to \n     such exercise or as soon there after as may be feasible, but \n     not later than 48 hours after exercising such authority, make \n     available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and \n     the President pro tempore of the Senate his determination \n     that--\n       (1) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or \n     other peaceful means alone either (A) will not adequately \n     protect the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq, or (B) is not likely to \n     lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions regarding Iraq; and\n       (2) acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with \n     the United States and other countries continuing to take the \n     necessary actions against international terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations, including those nations, \n     organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed \n     or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September \n     11, 2001.\n       (c) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution.\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 4. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) The President shall, at least once every 60 days, \n     submit to the Congress a report on matters relevant to this \n     joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the \n     exercise of authority granted in section 3 and the status of \n     planning for efforts that are expected to be required after \n     such actions are completed, including those actions described \n     in section 7 of Public Law 105-338 (the Iraq Liberation Act \n     of 1998).\n       (b) To the extent that the submission of any report \n     described in subsection (a) coincides with the submission of \n     any other report on matters relevant to this joint resolution \n     otherwise required to be submitted to Congress pursuant to \n     the reporting requirements of Public Law 93-148 (the War \n     Powers Resolution), all such reports may be submitted as a \n     single consolidated report to the Congress.\n       (c) To the extent that this information required by section \n     3 of Public Law 102-1 is included in the report required by \n     this section, such report shall be considered as meeting the \n     requirements of section 3 of Public Law 102-1.\n\n  Mr. REID. Senator Graham will speak on this at a later time. The \nSenator from Virginia, the manager of the bill, will ask for 2 minutes \nnow. Regarding the order in effect that was gotten earlier today, I ask \nunanimous consent that we eliminate the times when the Senators are to \nappear. It just hasn't worked. Somebody finishes 10 minutes early, or 5 \nminutes late, and it throws everything off kilter.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that following the statement of the \nSenator from Virginia, Senator Wellstone be recognized for 5 minutes, \nand Senator Kennedy for 15 minutes; that we then have a Republican \nSenator for 20 minutes; Senator Carper for 20 minutes; a Republican for \n30 minutes; and then that we have Senator Dodd for 30 minutes and a \nRepublican for 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have just been handed the amendment of \nthe distinguished Senator from Florida. I have looked it through. We \nwill have a debate on it in due course. I must bring to the attention \nof the Senate that in the course of the drafting of the resolution by \nmy good friend from Connecticut, myself, Senator McCain, and\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\nSenator Bayh, we took into consideration a lot of things and counseled \nwith the administration.\n  The point I wish to make is that, at first glance, this amendment \nseems to restore, in some sense, the original words of S.J. Res. 45, \nwhich I read:\n\n       The President is authorized to use all means that he \n     determines to be appropriate, including force, in order to \n     enforce the United Nations Security Council resolution \n     referenced above, to defend the national security interests \n     of the United States against a threat posed by Iraq . . .\n\n  This is the key part:\n\n       . . . and restore international peace and security in the \n     region.\n\n  My recollection is that, in the negotiation, the Democrat side of the \naisle was strongly in opposition to that last phrase in S.J. Res. 45 \nand, therefore, Senator Lieberman and I and others took it out when we \ndrafted ours, S.J. Res. 46. I just make that observation, and I find it \na bit perplexing. Nevertheless, I have had the opportunity to state my \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor on this. Under the time agreement, our \ntwo colleagues are to speak. I suggest the Senator address the Chair as \nto his desire.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it was our intention to maintain the \namendment in all respects, other than adding the language that begins \non page 2 at line 23 and runs through page 3 at line 4. That was our \nsole intent in offering the amendment in the form that we have done so. \nIf there had been negotiations of which we were unaware that altered \nthe underlying amendment, at the appropriate time it would be my \nintention to offer an amendment to make it conform to the proposal that \nadds what yourself and others have currently agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. At the appropriate time, we will address that. I thank my \ncolleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a short time today \nabout the Iraq resolution, and tomorrow I will have a chance to speak \nat greater length. I thank Senator Kennedy for allowing me to precede \nhim. I also tell my colleague from Georgia that his speech on the \nconcurrent receipt was powerful and, having spent the whole day with \nveterans yesterday, is absolutely right. It is critically important \nthat this defense appropriations bill go through with that provision.\n  Mr. President, I did not have a chance to hear the President speak \nlast night, but I read the transcript. I think it is important that the \nPresident focus on obtaining international support. The military option \nshould only be considered as the last option. I believe that people \nwere glad to hear that last night in Minnesota and in the country.\n  The problem is that the actual resolution before us goes in a \ndifferent direction. What this resolution does is give the President \nthe authority for a possible go-it-alone, unilateral military strike \nand ground war. I think this would be a mistake. We should not go it \nalone.\n  There is a critical distinction between going it alone and taking \naction in conjunction with our allies. Our focus should be going to the \nUnited Nations Security Council and asking for a resolution that makes \nit clear to Saddam Hussein that he must disarm. Saddam must give arms \ninspectors unfettered access. And, if he does not comply with this new \nUN resolution there will be consequences, including the use of \nappropriate military force. But we must do this together with our \nallies. We must bring the international community on board. This \nresolution allows for a preemptive, unilateral strike, which I believe \nwould be a huge mistake.\n  When Secretaries Kissinger and Albright testified before the Foreign \nRelations Committee, I asked both of them about the consequences of \ngoing alone versus working with the international community. First I \nasked: Shouldn't the goal be disarmament, and shouldn't we make every \neffort to try to make disarmament happen before taking military action?\n  They both were in agreement. Secretary Kissinger said: Yes, we need \nto play this out.\n  No one trusts Saddam Hussein. Everybody knows he is a brutal \ndictator. That is not the point. The point is how to proceed; how to do \nthis the right way. The focus should be on disarmament and getting the \nsupport of our allies in the international community.\n  I do not think we should be approving a preemptive, unilateral strike \nby the United States, going it alone, or only with Great Britain.\n  I asked the former secretaries what the differences would be. They \nspelled out hugely different consequences between our going it alone, \nif, in fact, military action was necessary, versus taking action with \nour allies.\n  The former secretaries made the following points. If we take \nunilateral military action Saddam Hussein will have a better chance of \nuniting the world community against us, rather than vice versa. \nMoreover, there could be grave consequences in the Near East and South \nAsia that could include energizing other radical elements and \nincreasing support for al-Qaida. Would this not play into the hands of \nthe radicals? This is a big question if we go it alone.\n  What about our men and women, our sons and daughters who would be put \nin harm's way? What would the consequences be on the ground for them if \nwe go it alone versus with our allies?\n  What about this war against terror? As a father and grandfather of \nsix children I take al-Qaida very seriously. Unfortunately \ninternational terror is a part of the world in which we now live. Will \nwe have the same international cooperation to fight international \nterror if we go it alone? In many parts of the world we need the \ncooperation, assets, and on-the-ground intelligence of our allies for \nthe continued war on terror. I think going it alone, a preemptive \nmilitary strike, perhaps a ground war, could very well undercut that \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I have one more point. I am not going to talk at \nlength about my interaction with people in Minnesota over the last \nseveral days since I announced my opposition to the first resolution, \nbut I will tell my colleagues this: Many people have come up to me, and \nI had great discussions with people in Minnesota. I cannot thank them \nenough.\n  I do not really know what the breakdown is in terms of X percentage \nthis way or that way, but I will say that the people in Minnesota and \nour country are worried about this issue. They are worried about us \ngoing it alone. They are worried about what might happen to our sons \nand daughters in Iraq. They far prefer we work together with our \nallies. They far prefer we have international support and that the \nfocus be on disarmament.\n  I believe that is the direction in which we should go. That is not \nwhat this resolution before us asks us to do. Therefore, I will vote no \non this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend President Bush for taking his \ncase against Iraq to the American people last evening, and I agree with \nthe President that Saddam is a despicable tyrant who must be disarmed. \nAs many of us had hoped, the President has now clearly given the Iraqi \nregime an opportunity to avoid war. The President himself says he has \nnot yet decided war will be necessary. In this situation, it would be \nwrong for Congress to act now to authorize the President to go to war \nbefore the steps the President has outlined are exhausted.\n  The most solemn responsibility any Congress has is the responsibility \ngiven the Congress by the Constitution to declare war. We would violate \nthat responsibility if we delegate that responsibility to the President \nin advance before the President himself has decided the time has come \nfor war.\n  The President acknowledged last night there are major risks in going \nto war. I do not believe these risks have been adequately described to \nthe American people.\n  General Wesley Clark, the former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe, \ntold the Armed Services Committee on September 23 if you are talking to \nthe mothers and the loved ones of those who die in that operation in \nIraq, you\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\nwant to be sure using force and expending American blood and lives and \ntreasure is the ultimate last resort, not because of the sense of \nimpatience with the arcane ways of international institutions or \nfrustrations from the domestic political process of allies.\n  As the Senate continues to debate the use of military force against \nIraq, we must do all we can to assess the potential costs of such a war \nin blood and treasure. The American people deserve to know what a \nconflict in Iraq might be like. They deserve to know how many \ncasualties there might be. They deserve to know the true preparedness \nof our troops to fight in a chemical or biological environment. If they \nare in the National Guard or Reserves, they deserve to know how a \nconflict in Iraq will affect them and whether they are likely to be \ncalled up for duty.\n  Many Reservists who were initially recalled for the war in \nAfghanistan have been either demobilized or extended for a second year. \nThey are concerned about what the impact of war against Iraq will have \non their families and on their jobs. Many employers, who are struggling \nin the current sagging economy, are also deeply concerned about the \nstability of their workforce. These patriotic Americans are willing to \nsacrifice, but they deserve to know all reasonable alternatives to war \nhave been exhausted.\n  None of us can foresee the course of events that will unfold if we go \nto war. Before Congress acts, the administration has an obligation to \nexplain to the Congress and the American people the potential \nconsequences of war. As of now, it has not.\n  The President is asking Congress to delegate its constitutional power \nto declare war before he has decided we need to go to war, but he has \nnot adequately explained what this war will look like. How many ground \ntroops will be required? How many casualties can we expect to suffer? \nHow well can we respond to the use of chemical or biological weapons \nagainst our troops? How will postwar occupation and reconstruction in \nIraq be conducted? How will our ongoing military operation in \nAfghanistan be affected, and what will the impact be on the overall war \nagainst terrorism?\n  Today, our service men and women are helping to combat terrorism in \nAfghanistan, the Philippines, the Nation of Georgia, and elsewhere \naround the world.\n  Our purpose is clear; defend our country against the clear and \ncompelling threat to our security posed by al-Qaida. I strongly support \nthe President in the war against al-Qaida and the al-Qaida terrorists. \nI am proud of the achievement of our Armed Forces in the war against \nterrorism.\n  Some argue that America's vastly superior military force can easily \ndefeat the Iraqi army, but many of us are concerned that the very \nstrength and success of our Armed Forces in the gulf war and in \nAfghanistan will lull America into thinking if war with Iraq becomes \nnecessary, it will be a bloodless war with few casualties.\n  The gulf war was fought in the desert a decade ago with an \noverwhelming superiority of forces in a strong coalition of the United \nStates and other nations. They achieved one of the most decisive \nvictories in the history of warfare. The experts I have consulted \nbelieve that a new war with Iraq will not be as easy, especially if we \ndo not have the support of a coalition of nations.\n  Some defense analysts contend the Iraqi regular army is plagued with \nlow morale and poor equipment and may well surrender at the first sight \nof American might. Other experts believe, however, that unlike the \nregular Iraqi army, up to 100,000 Republican Guard and special \nRepublican Guard troops of Iraq will defend Baghdad and remain fiercely \nloyal to Saddam Hussein.\n  Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution believes the Iraqi \nRepublican Guard forces could make a U.S. military attack very \ndifficult. He estimates that our military casualties could be as high \nas 5,000. By comparison, in the gulf war, just under 400 U.S. service \nmembers lost their lives.\n  Many believe our Armed Forces may need to occupy Baghdad, which has \nover 5 million residents. Testifying before the Armed Services \nCommittee on September 23, GEN Joseph Hoar, former commander in chief \nof the U.S. Central Command, discussed the potential horrors of urban \nwarfare. He said in urban warfare you could run through battalions a \nday at a time. All of our advantages of command and control, technology \nand mobility are, in part, given up and you are working with corporals, \nsergeants, and young men fighting street to street. It looks like the \nlast 15 minutes of the movie ``Saving Private Ryan.''\n  Despite the risks of urban warfare, the administration has avoided \nquestions about how a military operation in Iraq may unfold. We have \nnot been told how many ground troops we will need or, again, how many \ncasualties we can expect. The Joint Chiefs should provide Congress with \ncasualty estimates for a war in Iraq as they have done in advance of \nevery past conflict. These estimates should consider Saddam's possible \nuse of chemical or biological weapons against our troops.\n  Unlike the gulf war, many experts believe Saddam would resort to \nchemical and biological weapons against our troops in a desperate \nattempt to save his regime if he believes he and his regime are \nultimately threatened.\n  In the September 19 hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, General Myers, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \ncited a long list of improvements that have dramatically increased the \ncombat effectiveness of our forces since the gulf war. He said our \ntroops now have improved ability to protect themselves against chemical \nor biological attacks.\n  However, the General Accounting Office published a report on October \n1 which clearly suggests that our forces are not adequately prepared \nfor a chemical or biological attack. The report concluded that although \nthe Defense Department has taken significant actions to provide such \nprotection, serious problems persist. This is what the GAO report \nfound: Chemical and biological defense training continues to be a \nproblem; medical readiness of some units to conduct operations in a \ncontaminated environment remains questionable; some units are \ncritically short of required protective gear.\n\n  One Air Force wing has only 25 percent of the protective masks \nrequired and only 48 percent of required patient decontamination kits.\n  If Prime Minister Blair is correct in saying that Iraq has the \ncapability to launch chemical or biological warheads in 45 minutes, \nwhat sense does it make to put our soldiers in the path of that danger \nwithout exhausting every reasonable means to disarm Iraq short of war?\n  We do not know whether the military will be able to adequately \nprotect our service men and women from a chemical or biological attack, \nand this issue should be explained to the American people.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported last week that in addition to \nchemical and biological chemical deficiencies, there are other notable \ngaps in the Pentagon's planning. Civilians working at port facilities \nin the Persian Gulf region, where our forces will be unloading \nwarfighting equipment, have not all received the proper protective gear \nor training for a chemical and biological attack.\n  The Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs have \nnot adequately answered such questions about the military operation in \nIraq. They both say there will be risks to a conflict, but they have \nnot adequately and fully discussed those risks with Congress and the \nAmerican people.\n  The Bush administration has also repeatedly claimed that we can fight \na war in Iraq without undermining the war against terrorism, but last \nyear, on June 21, 2001, testifying before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Secretary Rumsfeld cited significant problems in military \nreadiness. He said we have underfunded and overused our forces, and we \nare steadily falling below acceptable readiness standards. Yet last \nmonth, on September 19, when asked about military readiness in the \nArmed Services Committee hearing, Secretary Rumsfeld said recent \ndefense budget increases, coupled with the recall of reservists and \nshifts in the assignment of existing personnel, have reduced the stress \non our forces.\n  He did not explain how the budget increases, which only recently took \neffect, could have reversed the starkest estimate of readiness he \nprovided to the Armed Services Committee last year. In fact, experts \nsay that most of the growth in operations and maintenance spending over \nthe past decade\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\nhave been for infrastructure-related programs, not military readiness.\n  General Myers, in his September 19 testimony, agreed that the U.S. \nmilitary was stretched in some key areas. He said if our operations on \nthe war on terror are expanded, we will be required to prioritize the \ndeployment of unique units in high demand such as special operation \nforces and combat rescue forces. He also said our coalition partners \nmay facilitate our combined operations by having similar units of \nforces. That, of course, assumes we will have a coalition in terms of a \npotential conflict.\n  Before the Senate Armed Services Committee 2 weeks ago, the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs admitted that because of the high demand placed on \nsome of our forces that coalition partners are necessary to mitigate \nthe risk of war in Iraq.\n\n  Two weeks ago, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs admitted that because \nof the high demand on some of our forces that coalition partners are \nnecessary. The way we are going to get the coalition forces is by going \nto the United Nations and gaining their support for the disarming of \nSaddam, and if action is necessary in the future.\n  War against Iraq may well undermine the ongoing war against al-Qaida \nand our continuing operation in Afghanistan by draining resources from \nour Armed Forces that are already stretched thin. In Afghanistan, U.S. \nforces continue to search villages, caves, and potential hideouts. The \nsearches are now being conducted by the 82nd Airborne, not the elite \nspecial operation forces which are being recalled in preparation for a \npotential invasion of Iraq.\n  Many of us in the Senate are aware of these concerns with the \nReserves and National Guard. We have heard them firsthand. Already, the \nNation has mobilized and demobilized thousands of reservists and \nNational Guardsmen to support the current war on terrorism. \nMassachusetts reservists and reservists from across the country are \nproviding training, intelligence, and security support around the \nworld.\n  Almost 1,500 National Guardsmen from Massachusetts alone are deployed \nto support the war on terror. Citizen soldiers are now serving in \ncritical security positions throughout the United States and in \nAfghanistan. They have distinguished themselves for their patriotism \nand superior service. They have proven ready to meet the challenge of \nfighting the war on terrorism, despite outdated equipment and funding \nshortfalls.\n  The phenomenal performance of our forces in the war on terrorism \nattest to their resolve. But how long can we sustain this high level of \noperation? Approximately 11,000 of our reservists from across the \nNation have been recalled for a second year to support the war on \nterror. This is the first time in decades that we have needed to take \nthis measure to enhance our military strength. Not even in the gulf war \ndid we recall reservists for over a year. If we open a second front in \nIraq, we may be forced to recall even more.\n\n  Additionally, due to critical shortages of special operations \npersonnel, pilots, intelligence specialists, and security personnel, \nanother 22,000 service members, a number about as high as the entire \ngulf war, have been involuntarily retained on active duty as part of \nthe current war on terrorism. If we embark upon a premature or \nunilateral military campaign against Iraq or a campaign with only Great \nBritain as our ally, our forces will have to serve in even greater \nnumbers for longer periods of time with graver risks.\n  There is no doubt that Saddam Hussein is a despicable tyrant. The \ninternational community must work together to disarm him. But the war \nagainst terrorism and our wider interests in the region and the world \ndemand a course that relies on war only as a last resort after all \nreasonable alternatives have been fairly tried.\n  I have no doubt our forces will prevail in any conflict with Iraq. \nBut Congress and the American people deserve to know the true risk of \nwar with Iraq. The administration has the responsibility to state what \nthe real costs of such a war may be. We need that information now, \nbefore--not after--Congress exercises its constitutional responsibility \nto declare war.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. If I could ask my colleague a question. It seems to me \nthe risk is only magnified by the passage of time--whether it is weeks, \nmonths, or years--if we do not act.\n  I draw to my colleagues' attention what the President said in \naddressing the Nation last night:\n\n       Approving this resolution does not mean that military \n     action is imminent or unavoidable.\n\n  I paraphrase that he has not sought by this a declaration of war. War \nis the last option. The decision has not been made.\n  Continuing, the President said:\n\n       The resolution will tell the United Nations and all nations \n     that America speaks with one voice and is determined to make \n     the demands of the civilized world mean something.\n\n  Congress will also be sending a message to the dictator of Iraq that \nhis only choice is full compliance and the time remaining for that \nchoice is limited.\n  I draw the Senator's attention to a document entitled ``Joint \nResolution'' distributed by the chairman of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and the chairman of the committee on which my distinguished \ncolleague and I serve. While this document is not at the desk, it \npurports to be in the form of an amendment and is under some \nconsideration. I presume that because that is what was distributed by \nmy good friend and colleague, Senator Levin.\n  From page 4, I read the following:\n\n       Authorization for use of United States Armed Forces \n     pursuant to a new United Nations Security Council resolution.\n\n  The question I ask for my colleague is in regard to section A:\n\n       Pursuant to a resolution of the United Nations Security \n     Council described in section 22, after the enactment of this \n     Joint Resolution and subject to subsection B, the President \n     is authorized to use the Armed Forces of the United States in \n     destroying and rendering harmless weapons of mass \n     destruction, [et cetera.]\n\n  I read that as putting in the hands of the United Nations a veto on \nthe actions taken by this body, a veto on the President's ability to \nuse, as he has been given by the Constitution, the Armed Forces of the \nUnited States to protect at any time he deems necessary the security of \nAmerica.\n  Does the Senator support such a concept that the United Nations would \nhave a veto at any time in this situation? The President has gone to \nthe U.N. asking that they take action to enforce the 16 resolutions \nthat have been ignored by Saddam Hussein, defied by Saddam Hussein, and \nthey are now looking at a 17th, a framework for perhaps a new \ninspection regime, but this current draft of a proposed amendment \nimplies that the U.N. has to act before our President can utilize the \nforces given to him by the Constitution of our country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has asked a number of questions in his \ncomments. I will do my best to respond.\n  As the Senator has rightfully pointed out, the President has not \ndecided on the course of war. If the President has not decided that we \nhave an imminent threat from Saddam Hussein, we have a serious threat. \nIt is a very important threat. For all the reasons that have been \noutlined on the floor during the course of this debate about Saddam \nHussein, we understand that. But the President of the United States has \nnot made a judgment that it is an imminent threat to the United States.\n  He has not made a judgment that he is prepared to go to war today. If \nthat is so, which is what he stated last night, why in the world are we \nsaying, in the Senate of the United States, we will give him this power \nwhen he has not made up his mind he wants to use it, without any \nlimitation on time--no sunset of this? That is No. 1. So I am opposed.\n  Second, on the question of the Senator from Virginia, in referring to \nthe Levin amendment, that conforms with the constitutional authorities \nI have discussed, that we have done in other periods. That does not \nhappen to be my position. I believe in a two-step approach. I believe \nthe Security Council should have a tough resolution with unfettered \ninspections and we ought to galvanize the international community. I \npersonally believe the way we galvanize the international community is \nby demonstrating we believe the international community has the \nresponsibility and obligation to take action.\n  I believe if we go ahead and take action as being proposed by the \nSenator\n\n[[Page S10092]]\n\nfrom Virginia, that will be unilateral, where the President says: I \nhave not made up my mind whether there is a necessity for war. I am not \neven prepared to say we are in an imminent threat. If we had an \nimminent threat from Saddam Hussein, he obviously would have a \nresponsibility to take action in order to protect the American people.\n  What we are saying to the Security Council is: We are just going to \nhave something over here on the side in case you people up there are \nnot going to be serious.\n  I would like to challenge the Security Council the way the President \nof the United States did. I commend President Bush for finally going to \nthe Security Council, challenging the Security Council. That is the way \nto go. The Security Council takes every step, uses every opportunity, \nand finally comes back and says: There is no alternative, there is an \nimminent threat.\n  We should be at our desks at that time in making the judgment we will \nhave to make about committing American forces--a two-step approach for \nthose reasons.\n  I have difficulty in accepting the concept that we are going to \neffectively give to the President of the United States the authority \nwhen he has stated, as the good Senator stated, he has not made up his \nown mind.\n  Lastly, part of the trouble we have been in over the period--and I \nhave great respect for my colleague, and he knows he is my friend and \ncolleague--the debate has been about the resolutions, but not about the \nwar. We are debating the resolutions. My good friend from Florida is \ntalking about changing the resolutions. We ought to be talking about \nwhat the implication is going to be in terms of the conflict and the \nwar. The American people ought to understand that more clearly. That is \nan issue where the administration has failed the American people.\n  What are the best estimates?\n  What should we expect are going to be needed in terms of the forces?\n  What is the best judgment in terms of how Saddam Hussein will react?\n  What will be the enormous impact it will have in our battle against \nterror around the world?\n  What will it do in terms of inflaming the Muslim world if the United \nStates has a go-alone policy, which this resolution will permit?\n  Will it be effectively a breeding area for al-Qaida terrorists?\n  We ought to be debating those issues. We do not do that. We have been \ndebating the technicalities of these resolutions.\n  I know the Senator has--as I have--listened to many debates, not only \non the technicalities but the broad issues of war and peace as well. \nBut it is my regret that we are going to be faced with a cloture motion \nhere to try to insist on a vote on this in another 2 days when we have \njust barely talked about the issues of war and peace and haven't had \nthat kind of informed debate and haven't had that kind of information \nthat is available to us. That is part of my deep concern about where we \nare on the floor of the Senate now.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. \nIndeed, we have worked together many times. We work together.\n  I strongly differ. I think our President has clearly said--first \nbefore the United Nations and as late as last night--that there is \nimminent danger to our Nation from Saddam Hussein and his possession of \nweapons of mass destruction. We clearly have a difference on that.\n  I strongly believe that this resolution, if it is to be brought \nbefore the Senate, will place a veto power in the hands of the United \nNations. I cannot be a part of that. I will certainly oppose it as \nstrongly as I know how.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Would the Senator be willing to change the words? I \ndon't have it here. Would he be willing to change the words to include \n``an imminent threat'' from the language that is included in the \nresolution which talks about a grave threat or continuing threat?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will say at this point in time, Senator \nLieberman and I, and Senators McCain and Bayh drafted this resolution \nafter listening to the suggestions of many Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle. At this point in time, if any Senator has talked about \nchanges, then the format by the Senator from Florida I expect should be \nfollowed by way of a formalization of the amendment. But at this point \nin time, we have other colleagues who are anxious to speak.\n  I will give three quotes from President Bush's speech to the Nation \nlast night about the imminent threat posed by these weapons of mass \ndestruction:\n\n       In 1995, after several years of deceit by the Iraqi regime, \n     the head of Iraq's military industries defected. It was then \n     that the regime was forced to admit that it had produced more \n     than 30,000 liters of anthrax and other deadly biological \n     agents. The inspectors, however, concluded that Iraq had \n     likely produced two to four times that amount. This is a \n     massive stockpile of biological weapons that has never been \n     accounted for, and is capable of killing millions . . .\n       Alliances with terrorists could allow the Iraqi regime to \n     attack America without leaving any fingerprints . . .\n       We've also discovered through intelligence that Iraq has a \n     growing fleet of manned and unmanned aerial vehicles that \n     could be used to disperse chemical and biological weapons \n     across broad areas. We are concerned that Iraq is exploring \n     ways of using UAVs for missions targeting the United States.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have listened with a great deal of \ninterest to this presentation. I think there are a couple of clear \npoints one can make in response, and then I will comment.\n  We have been dealing with Saddam Hussein with our men and women in \nuniform for 12 years. We have been occupying positions in the Middle \nEast. We have been flying over the regions that Saddam has. We are \nflying the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq. We had weapons \ninspectors in there for the 12 years, until they were kicked out 4 or 5 \nyears ago. After Saddam was kicked out of Kuwait, after there was a \nUnited Nations agreement, and after basically he agreed to an \narmistice, and after inspectors, he said: I will take out all weapons \nof mass destruction, and I will turn them over to the international \ncommunity. And he has not done that. We know that. He has failed to do \nthat.\n  We have had economic sanctions against Iraq for a period of years \nnow. They have not worked. There is such a sieve in the region that he \nis able to get oil out and goods in without any problem.\n  We have worked with the United Nations. We had some 16 resolutions \nthat passed through the United Nations. It is as if some of the debate \non the floor is that we are just now starting to try to deal with \nSaddam Hussein, when I think you have to look back over the past 12 \nyears. We have been dealing with this dictator and this despot for 12 \nyears in every way conceivable.\n  I think the conclusion most people have is that 12 years ago we \nshould have gone into Baghdad and removed him at that time. That is the \nreal conclusion people come to. Yet, for reasons of the Congress or the \ninternational community--whoever you want to say in that point of \ntime--there was no agreement to kick him out.\n  Since that time, it has not changed. He is the same guy who has these \nweapons of mass destruction. It has just gotten worse in that period of \n12 years.\n  I would analogize it to having cancer. If you have cancer, you have a \ncouple of options: You can deal with it. You can go in and have surgery \nto remove the big areas that are spreading. You can try to contain it \nfor a period of time through different therapies. Or you can ignore it \nand just say: It does not affect me today. I am fine today.\n  Saddam Hussein has chemical weapons. He has biological weapons. He is \nworking on nuclear weapons. He has missile capacity to deliver all of \nthese.\n  That is the cancer that exists. We can say we feel fine today; we are \nfine. What if he decides to launch any one of those? What if he does it \nnot at military targets but at civilian targets, at one of our allies, \nor even at us? Are we fine then? I can just see us having a commission \nafter that period of time asking: Why didn't we catch these terrorists? \nWe were working on Iraqi soil before they attacked the United States. \nWe should have gone in there. Did we not know enough? Were we not \nsufficiently concerned about it in a similar way that we are having \nhearings now about why we didn't do things prior to September 11? Did \nwe see the\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\nclues and the situation building up prior to the Twin Towers and the \nPentagon being hit? Did we not see this coming?\n  Let us apply that same standard to Saddam Hussein and the nexus he \nprovides between the weapons of mass destruction and terrorists. They \nare clearly there. I just articulated the weapons of mass destruction \nthat he has. He is also working on such things as smallpox. We think he \nmay be trying to do something with that. He is working on all sorts of \nthings. Yes. Weapons of mass destruction.\n\n  What about the terrorist connection that is there? Abu Nidal's \norganization was headquartered there for a period of time. He just \ndied, or he was killed recently, for whatever reason. Al-Qaida \nleadership is in Iraq. Hussein has worked closely with a number of \nterrorist organizations in and on his soil. They are there. You have \nthe mix of these two sitting side by side--a toxic mix that the United \nStates cannot countenance.\n  I respect a number of people who think this isn't the way we do \nthings. Democracies have real difficulty declaring war. That is a very \ngood thing. This is just something we don't like. We want somebody to \ncome and hit at us first, before we go on to war. You can look through \nthe history of the United States and the acts where we were hit and \nthen we responded. That is the way we are most comfortable in dealing \nwith these tough, difficult issues about whether you go to war with a \nforeign nation. It is good that we wrestle with that and with this \nsituation.\n  It is like in the old television show ``Gunsmoke.'' At the end of the \n``Gunsmoke'' episode every week, it ended the same way: Matt Dillon \nwalks out on the main street of Dodge City. The bad guy walks out on \nthe street on the other end. They stare at each other for a little \nwhile. The bad guy has a chance to walk off, if he wants to. He also \ngets to draw first. He draws first. Then Matt Dillon draws. The bad guy \ngoes down. There is a sense of fair play and honor about that. There is \na set of rules. The bad guy gets to shoot first, but you are going down \nin the process. If you are going to do that; you have a chance to walk \naway. If you decide not to, that is your choice.\n  That is the way we like to do things, because there is a sense of, Do \nwe really want to bother somebody else to this degree? Is this the \nright thing to do?\n  Saddam Hussein doesn't operate that way. The terrorists today don't \noperate with those same sorts of rules of decorum in operation, and the \nrules of boxing, if you will.\n  These are people who don't go out on Main Street with Matt Dillon. \nThey sneak around behind buildings and try to get at innocent people \nand women and children. They don't go straight at our military. They \nattack people in civilian positions. Their object is to disrupt. It is \nnot to protect a nation state. It is not to confront the military. It \nis to kill as many civilians as they can.\n  Can we afford, in that type of atmosphere and that new way of \noperating, to have terrorists force us to sit back and say: OK? Are we \ngoing to wait until somehow they attack us, or try to get botulism in \nour food supply, or try to get anthrax into a broad area of the United \nStates, or one of our allies, or try to make a weapon with smallpox, \nand then we will go at them?\n  The cost of doing that is to spread a cancer; the deaths of many \npeople. This is not something we can countenance. It is not something--\nwhen my primary duty and the primary duty of the elected Members of \nthis body is to provide for the national defense--that we can \ncountenance. It is not something we can do.\n  I want to read from some testimony Henry Kissinger gave 2 weeks ago \nbefore the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that his entire testimony be printed in the \nRecord after my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, former Secretary Kissinger is probably \none of the best minds, if not the best mind, in foreign policy in the \nworld. He dealt with the cold war. He was directly involved in that, \nand he has been a very astute student. And now he is a student of what \ntakes place today in the war on terrorism that we have. Listen to just \na couple paragraphs of what he says about these weapons of mass \ndestruction in the hands of a country that also works with and provides \nsupport and housing for terrorists. He says this:\n\n       If these capabilities remain intact--\n\n  That is, weapons of mass destruction--\n\n     they will become an instrument--actual and symbolic--for the \n     destabilization of a volatile region.\n\n  There he is speaking of the entire Middle East.\n\n       And if Saddam Hussein's regime survives both the Gulf War \n     and the anti-terrorism campaign, this fact alone will \n     compound the existing terrorist menace.\n\n  He points out in this statement that he thinks going at Iraq will \nhave a very positive impact on terrorism, and if we do not go at Iraq, \nour war against terrorism will just devolve into an intelligence \noperation, and that would be the likely continued status of it.\n  He handles another argument. I will read another quote from Secretary \nKissinger:\n\n       It is argued that dealing with weapons of mass destruction \n     in Iraq weakens the war against terrorism. The opposite is \n     more likely to be true. Eliminating such weapons in Iraq is \n     an important aspect of the second phase of the anti-terrorism \n     campaign. It demonstrates American determination to get at \n     the root causes and some of the ultimate capabilities of what \n     is, in essence, a crusade against free values.\n\n  That is what Secretary Kissinger goes on to say in this presentation. \nHe argues that this is an essential part of the war against terrorism, \nif we are to effectively deal with this terrorist threat and the \nproblem that we have. And not to overrepeat this, but I do not think \none can overrepeat it. It is a little bit like a doctor's prescription \ndealing with your health where you are, and here are the possible \nproblems you have.\n  Here is what we know that Saddam Hussein has.\n  Gaps identified by UNSCOM in Iraqi accounting and current production \ncapabilities strongly suggest that Iraq maintains stockpiles of \nchemical agents, probably VX, sarin, cyclosarin, and mustard.\n  UNSCOM reported to the U.N. Security Council in April 1995 that Iraq \nhad concealed its biological weapons program and had failed to account \nfor 3 tons of growth material for biological agents.\n  In 2001, an Iraqi defector reported visiting some 20 secret \nfacilities in Iraq for chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n  Saddam continues to pursue nuclear weapons, and has used chemical \nweapons against his own people, as well as his neighbors.\n  I do not think I need to remind people about what he has done in his \nregion. He has attacked Iran, invaded Kuwait, and he has launched \nmissiles at Saudi Arabia and Israel. That is why we will have had, and \nhave today, strong allies in the region opposed to Saddam Hussein \ncontinuing.\n  I want to look at the positive, the upside of dealing with Saddam \nHussein. We have a lot of difficulty, a lot of potential problems to \ndeal with, but what happens if you get Saddam Hussein out of power?\n  I think there are significant, positive steps moving forward in that \nregion.\n  It is interesting to note that from 1920 until the late 1950s, Iraq \nhad a constitutional monarchy, a bihouse parliament that had authority \nover budgets and ministers. They have a history of some democracy. It \nwas not the level of democracy we have, but they have that in their \nhistorical background.\n  Ten percent of the world's oil supplies are located in Iraq. They \nhave an educated urban population. They will embrace and encourage and \nmove forward with democracy on a rapid basis. Now, it is not going to \nbe completely free of any hitches, but I think the potential in \ndeveloping an active, vibrant, working democracy in Iraq is \nsignificantly greater and higher than what we are seeing in the \nsituation in Afghanistan, which is moving forward but with a lot of \ndifficulty. They do not have the natural resources to build. They do \nnot have a historical basis of democracy with which to work. They have \na number of warlords in the area, which does not exist in Iraq.\n  There is reason to believe that the upside potential with Iraq, and \nthe\n\n[[Page S10094]]\n\nspread of democracy and human rights and religious freedoms and \npluralism will be significant in Iraq. And that will spread throughout \nthat region. These are a set of values, of human values, for which the \nUnited States stands and has stood for years, and we have been very \npositive in this. Yet we have not pushed this set of values generally \nin that region of the world, in the Islamic region of the world.\n  There is something like 49 countries and 2 democracies in that region \nof the world. And a number of people wonder why there is the push for \nhuman rights, democracy, and religious freedom everywhere else and not \nthere. And we have kind of hemmed and hawed and ``well, I don't know,'' \nand we have allies there, and we are dependent on the oil, and we don't \nwant to upset things in the region.\n  The truth is, we need to stand for the things there that we stand for \neverywhere else. And if we do that, and push that in Iraq, it is going \nto be a flower that will bloom there in the desert. It is going to show \nthe way to a number of countries. It is going to involve the people. \nAnd the people are going to be able to grow and possess that beauty of \nliberty that they seek and know and want. We will be able to help put \nit forward and move it into action in that region.\n  These are very difficult times for us. There are difficult times in \nthe region. But I think the question clearly before us is whether we \nshould move forward. I think the answer is definitely yes, that we \nshould move forward.\n  This is a time for us to be very humble and wise about what we need \nto do and definite about how we move forward. We do not make this \nchoice lightly, nor without the understanding that with this action \ncomes difficult consequences to some of our finest citizens in the \nArmed Forces and potentially of terrorist attacks to our allies and to \nus.\n  We would do well to remember the words of Psalm 140:\n\n       Grant not, God, the desires of the wicked one; do not grant \n     his conspiracy fruition. . . .As for the head of my \n     besiegers, let the mischief of their own lips bury them.\n\n  Once again, we have come to deal with a very difficult situation \nwhere we are called upon to stand up to the threats of evil and \ntyranny--something we have had to do many times in the history of this \nwonderful Nation. As daunting as this is, it is not a responsibility we \ncan shirk. Saddam has made the case against himself. He has buried \nhimself with his own lips and his own actions. We cannot ignore this. \nAnd we should not put off for another year, or a few, a difficult \nmatter that will only get worse. If we do not take this action now, we \nare unlikely to any time in the near future. Now is the time for us to \nact.\n  I support the bipartisan resolution authorizing the President to use \nforce in Iraq. I hope all the American public is praying for us, and \npraying about this for wisdom, for protection, for limited loss of \nlife, and for the right thing to be done.\n  This is a tough moment. It is a different stage for us. It is a ways \nand means of handling something we have not done in the past where we \ngo in and try to take care of a situation before it kills many people. \nWe need those prayers for wisdom and wise action.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, this bipartisan \nresolution authorizing the President to use force in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\nStatement of The Honorable Henry A. Kissinger Before the Senate Foreign \n                Relations Committee, September 26, 2002\n\n       Mr. Chairman, Congress is considering one of the most \n     consequential expressions of its views since the end of the \n     Cold War: what action the United States should take to deal \n     with the threat posed by illegal stockpiles of weapons of \n     mass destruction in Iraq and their potential growth. \n     President Bush has reaffirmed America's commitment to a \n     cooperative would order by asking the United Nations to \n     rectify Iraq's defiance of a large number of U.N. resolutions \n     mandating the destruction of these stockpiles as well as \n     Iraq's flagrant breach of its pledge to do so as a condition \n     for the suspension of the Gulf War in 1991. But were the \n     world community, by fudging its response, to opt for the risk \n     of a greater threat in the future, can American and a \n     coalition of the like-minded acquiesce in stockpiles of \n     weapons of mass destruction in Iraq? Thus the Committee will \n     need to consider not only the risk of action but also the \n     consequences of inaction.\n       The Iraqi stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction will be \n     growing in an international environmental in which their \n     danger merges with the threat of terrorism. For on September \n     11, 2001, the world entered a new period in which private, \n     non-state organizations undertook to threaten national and \n     international security by stealth attacks. The controversy \n     about preemption is a symptom of the impact of this \n     transformation. At bottom, it is a debate between the \n     traditional notion of sovereignty of the nation-state \n     prevalent since the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648 and the \n     adaptation required by both modern technology and the nature \n     of the terrorist threat.\n       Osama bin Laden's base was on the territory of a national \n     state, though his was not a national cause. Highly \n     disciplined operatives are scattered around the globe, some \n     on the soil of America's closest allies and even within \n     America itself. They enjoy financial and organizational \n     support from a number of states--most frequently from private \n     individuals ostensibly not under the control of their \n     governments. Bases for terrorists have been established in \n     several countries, usually in areas where the governments can \n     plausibly deny controls are actually not in control, such as \n     in Yemen, Somalia, or perhaps Indonesia and Iran.\n       Having no territory to defend, the terrorists are not \n     subject to the deterrent threats of the Cold War; having as \n     their aim the destruction of social cohesion, they are not \n     interested in the conciliating procedures and compromises of \n     traditional diplomacy.\n       Unlike the previous centuries, when the movement of armies \n     foreshadowed threat, modern technology in the service of \n     terror gives no warning, and its perpetrators vanish with the \n     act of commission. And since these attacks are capable of \n     inflicting catastrophic damage, traditional notions of \n     sovereignty have to be modified with respect to countries \n     that harbor terrorist headquarters or terrorist training \n     centers. The problem of preemption is inherent in the nature \n     of the terrorist challenge.\n       The accumulation of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in \n     violation of U.N. resolutions cannot be separated from the \n     post-Afghanistan phase of the war against terrorism. Iraq is \n     located in the midst of a region that has been the hotbed of \n     the special type of global terrorist activity from which the \n     attack on the United States was organized. And the \n     consequences of weapons of mass destruction have many \n     similarities to those of terrorism. They can be used without \n     warning; their impact is catastrophic. In some circumstances, \n     their origin can be uncertain. If the world is not to turn \n     into a doomsday machine, a way must be found to prevent \n     proliferation--especially to rogue states whose governments \n     have no restraint on the exercise of their power.\n       Cold War principles of deterrence are almost impossible to \n     implement when there is a multiplicity of states, some of \n     them harboring terrorists in position to wreak havoc. The \n     Cold War world reflected a certain uniformity in the \n     assessment of risk between the nuclear sides. But when many \n     states threaten each other for incongruent purposes, who is \n     to do the deterring, and in the face of what provocation? \n     This is especially true when that which must be deterred is \n     not simply the use of weapons of mass destruction but the \n     threat of them.\n       Suicide bombing has shown that the calculations of jihad \n     fighters are not those of the Cold War leaders. The concern \n     that war with Iraq could unleash Iraqi weapons of mass \n     destruction on Israel and Saudi Arabia is a demonstration of \n     how even existing stockpiles of weapons turn into instruments \n     of blackmail and self-deterrence. Procrastination is bound to \n     magnify such possibilities.\n       The existence and, even more, the growth of stockpiles of \n     weapons of mass destruction in Iraq poses a threat to \n     international peace and stability. The issue is not primarily \n     whether Iraq was involved in the terrorist attack on the \n     United States. The challenge of Iraq is essentially \n     geopolitical and psychological. Its policy is implacably \n     hostile to the United States, to neighboring countries, and \n     to established rules that govern relations among nations. It \n     possesses growing stockpiles of biological and chemical \n     weapons, which Saddam Hussein has used in the war against \n     Iran and on his own population. Iraq is working again to \n     develop a nuclear capability. Saddam Hussein breached his \n     commitment to the United Nations by preventing the operation \n     of the international inspection system he had accepted on his \n     territory as part of the armistice agreement ending the Gulf \n     War. There is no possibility of a direct negotiation between \n     Washington and Baghdad and no basis for trusting Iraq's \n     promises to the international community. By what reasoning \n     can the world community--or America--acquiesce in this state \n     of affairs?\n       If these capabilities remain intact, they will become an \n     instrument--actual and symbolic--for the destabilization of a \n     volatile region. And if Saddam Hussein's regime survives both \n     the Gulf War and the anti-terrorism campaign, this fact alone \n     will compound the existing terrorist menace.\n       By its defiance of the U.N. Security Council resolutions \n     requiring it to give up weapons of mass destruction, Iraq has \n     in effect asserted the determination to possess weapons whose \n     very existence compounds the terrorist threat immeasurably. \n     Global terrorism cannot flourish except with the support of \n     states that either sympathize or acquiesce in its actions. To \n     the extent that\n\n[[Page S10095]]\n\n     these countries observe the flouting of U.N. resolutions, the \n     weakening of international norms, and the defiance of \n     America, they feel less restrained in acquiescing in or \n     ignoring terrorist activities. For the nations of the world \n     to accept the existence of growing stockpiles of weapons of \n     mass destruction where the new form of terrorism has been \n     spawned is to undermine restraint with respect not only to \n     weapons proliferation but to the psychological impulse toward \n     terrorism altogether.\n       The campaign in Afghanistan was an important first step. \n     But if it remains the principal move in the war against \n     terrorism, it runs the risk of petering out into an \n     intelligence operation while the rest of the region gradually \n     slides back to the pre-9/11 pattern, with radicals encouraged \n     by the demonstration of the world's hesitation and moderates \n     demoralized by the continuation of an unimpaired Iraq as an \n     aggressive regional power. In short, the continuation of \n     illegal proliferation, the global dangers which it involves, \n     the rejection or infeasibility of a viable inspection system, \n     and the growth of terrorism require action, preferably \n     global, but as an ultimate resort of America's, together with \n     those countries prepared to support it.\n       It is argued that dealing with weapons of mass destruction \n     in Iraq weakens the war against terrorism. The opposite is \n     more likely to be true. Eliminating such weapons in Iraq is \n     an important aspect of the second phase of the anti-terrorism \n     campaign. It demonstrates American determination to get at \n     the root causes and some of the ultimate capabilities of what \n     is, in essence, a crusade against free values. Enforcing U.N. \n     resolutions in Iraq does not compete with the capabilities \n     needed to pursue the second phase of the anti-terrorism \n     campaign. In all likelihood, such action will strengthen it \n     by additional deployments to the region.\n       Nor should it weaken the cooperation of other countries in \n     the anti-terror campaign. Assisting in this effort is not a \n     favor other countries do for the United States but ultimately \n     for themselves. And what exactly will they decline to support \n     without risking their entire relationship to the United \n     States? The fight against terrorism will take many years. To \n     wait for its end before acting is to guarantee \n     that stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction multiply.\n       At the same time, while reserving the option to act in \n     concert with only the nations it can convince, the United \n     States is wise to appeal to cooperative action of the world \n     community. As the most powerful nation in the world, the \n     United States has a special unilateral capacity and, indeed, \n     obligation to lead in implementing its convictions. But it \n     also has a special obligation to justify its actions by \n     principles that transcend the assertions of preponderant \n     power. It cannot be in either the American national interest \n     or the world's interest to develop principles that grant \n     every nation an unfettered right of preemption against its \n     own definition of threats to its security. The case for \n     enforcement of established resolutions should be the opening \n     move in a serious effort of consultation to develop \n     fundamental principles that other nations can consider in the \n     general interest.\n       The United Nations is therefore challenged to come with a \n     control system that eliminates existing weapons of mass \n     destruction in Iraq--together with procedures to prevent \n     their being rebuilt. the control system must go far beyond \n     the inspection system negated by Saddam Hussein's evasions \n     and violations. It must prevent any possibility for local \n     authorities to harass informants or to impede free access to \n     the inspectors. It should be backed by standby authority and \n     perhaps a standby force to remove any obstacle to \n     transparency. Moreover, any system of inspection must be \n     measured against the decline in vigilance that accompanied \n     the previously flawed system's operation. Nor can it be \n     achieved at the price of lifting sanctions while Sad Dam \n     Hussein stays in office. For that would provide the Iraqi \n     regime with the means of rearmament as a reward for ending \n     its violations. Indeed, the rigorous measures required to \n     implement the U.N.'s own resolutions are almost surely \n     incompatible with Hussein's continuation in power.\n       In the end, enforcement of U.N. resolutions should be \n     coupled with a program of reconstruction for Iraq. Because of \n     the precedent-setting nature of this war, its outcome will \n     determine the way U.S. actions will ultimately be viewed. And \n     we may find more nations willing to cooperate in \n     reconstruction than in enforcement, if only because no \n     country wants to see an exclusive position for America in a \n     region so central to international political and economic \n     stability.\n       Reconstruction will require dealing with how to preserve \n     the unity and ensure the territorial integrity of a country \n     that is an essential component of any Gulf equilibrium. A \n     federal system to enable the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish \n     ethnic groups of Iraq to live together without domination by \n     one of them is surely appropriate. But any serious planning \n     would have to consider the means to prevent autonomy from \n     turning to independence, which, in the case of the Kurds, \n     would put Turkish support for the military phase at risk. And \n     all this would have to take place in the context of a \n     government capable of resisting pressures from the remnants \n     of the old regime or from neighboring countries determined to \n     destabilize the emerging system.\n       The United States has put forward a reasoned definition of \n     the dangers: the possession of weapons of mass destruction by \n     governments that have demonstrated their willingness to use \n     them, have professed hostility toward America or its allies, \n     and are not restrained by domestic institutions. Can the \n     world community reject that definition of the danger?\n       However the issue of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq is \n     resolved, the longer-range goal must be to devise a system \n     for dealing with new attempts by additional countries to \n     acquire weapons of mass destruction or biological and \n     chemical weapons. We are only at the beginning of the threat \n     of global proliferation. The nations of the world must face \n     the impossibility of letting such a process run unchecked. \n     The United States would contribute much to a new \n     international order if it invited the rest of world, and \n     especially the major nuclear powers, to cooperate in creating \n     a system to deal with this challenge to humanity on a more \n     institutional basis.\n       Congress has an opportunity to vindicate a system of \n     international order. I urge you to give the President the \n     authority to enforce the appropriate U.N. resolutions \n     together with the world community if at all possible, in \n     concert with like-minded nations if necessary.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. We have had excellent cooperation in the management of \nthis very important matter. Senators have been forthcoming. I note that \nthe Presiding Officer is now scheduled to speak. Is there a means by \nwhich we could accommodate him? I would be happy to sit in the Chair. \nBut I also observe the presence of another Senator who immediately \nfollows the distinguished Senator. We could perhaps flip.\n  If I might suggest that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is prepared to recognize the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will recognize the Senator from Montana then.\n  Mr. President, while we are waiting for the Senator from Montana to \naddress the Senate, I want to thank our colleague, Senator Brownback, \nfor an excellent statement. I was privileged to follow it, and it is an \nimportant contribution to this debate.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Virginia.\n  I thank my good friend from Delaware, whose kindness and generosity \nis as good as the size of his State is small, in allowing me to speak \nnow. And I understand the Presiding Officer may get some relief in a \nlittle bit and will be able to make his statement.\n  As we get into a debate such as this, every time we spend a lot of \ntime going over and saying about the same thing. We know who Mr. \nHussein is.\n\n  I congratulate the President for an excellent speech on Monday night. \nNot only did it complement his words before the United Nations, some \nwould construe the speech as a statement of war. I think that is not \nthe case. I had an opportunity to hear our Secretary of State, General \nPowell, put it very well when he said it was ``a statement of what we \nintend to do.''\n  We know and we have seen this man operate who claims the Presidency \nof Iraq, going way back to the time he attacked Iran, then his actions \nagainst a neighbor, Kuwait. And since then, Saddam Hussein has deceived \nthe world for over a decade.\n  He has violated 16 U.N. resolutions without consequence. He has \nstockpiled weapons of mass destruction and has a clear intention of \nobtaining nuclear weapons. His brutal regime has used these weapons on \nhis own people. On one occasion this dictator used sarin, VX, and \nmustard gas agents to kill 5,000 innocent civilians in a single day.\n  He has abused the U.N.-established Oil-for-Food Program, weaponizing \nhis oil to finance his fanaticism. All this time he has bankrupted his \nown country. Saddam has amassed black market revenues of $6.6 billion \nsince 1996. I tell the American people this is not an Oil-for-Food \nProgram. It is oil for terror.\n  Peace in our time, how long have we been kicking that phrase around? \nAnd it is still with us. It is in peril again and will be so long as \nSaddam Hussein is in power with the most destructive weapons in history \nin his hands.\n  Evidence of Saddam Hussein's complicity in and sponsorship of \ninternational terrorism is ample. He praised the September 11 attacks, \ncalling them ``God's punishment'' in his government-controlled press. \nAl-Qaida terrorists are known to be hiding and harbored in Iraq. He \ncontinues to play\n\n[[Page S10096]]\n\nhost to networks and has ordered acts of terror on foreign soil. And \nthe worst of all worlds, though, is that he paid Palestinian families \nof Palestinian suicide bombers $25,000 as a reward for mass murder.\n  We know he violated U.N. sanctions and resolutions for inspections in \nthat country, and now we are going back to the U.N. again for another \nresolution. There is one pitfall that we do not want to fall in again. \nBy allowing new weapons inspections with conditions makes a mockery of \nour capacity for trust. He will exploit every opportunity to conceal \nand lie about what he has and where he has it--not only from us here in \nthis country, but from the rest of the world. And the rest of the world \nshould be outraged. What else is new?\n  He has a known record. Rather than playing the role of appeasers with \na terrorist regime, the world community must vigorously pursue \nenforcement and compliance of those United Nations resolutions. If the \nUnited Nations Security Council cannot enforce its own authority and \nprove itself relevant and effective, then President Bush has no choice \nbut to take whatever action he deems necessary to protect America from \navowed enemies.\n  I understand fully the seriousness of committing our military, our \nmen and women, in harm's way. I also understand the seriousness of the \nsituation, not only just for Americans but for those freedom-loving and \nthose freedom-desiring nations and societies around the world. I see a \nthreat that overrides my fears and most of my concerns. We must act to \ndepose a brutal regime and religious extremist who hates our freedoms \nand would do us harm.\n  I know America's intent is never to dominate other nations but to \nliberate them. We have a strong historical track record there. Our \nintent today with Iraq should be no different--to bring liberty and \ndemocracy to the Iraqi people who suffer arbitrary imprisonment, \nexecution, torture, starvation, gang rape, and mutilation at the hands \nof this tyrant.\n  It is a changed world. It is a different time. Let me tell you that \nSeptember 11 did not make it this way. September 11 gave us a horrible \nand graphic picture of the dangers of a changed and smaller world. No \nlonger can we look the other way when the bully on the other side of \nthe world pushes us and others around.\n  By today's standards, Saddam Hussein has been the bully on the block, \nright here at home. No longer can the international community simply do \nnothing.\n  How can we idly stand by and allow this monster to hide behind the \nveil of sovereign nation status? My conscience cannot allow it. There \nare no national boundaries when it comes to ferreting out and ending \nhuman injustice and suffering. We do have a responsibility to our \nfellow man. We always have. We also have an absolute right to defend \nourselves.\n  Monsters are not going to be given a free hand to inflict unending \nsuffering and death upon their own people and others, nor shall they be \nallowed to export terrorism or provide solace for terrorists. As \nAmericans, we have a moral and ethical obligation to assure that each \nglobal member conducts themselves in an acceptable manner. Depending \nupon the magnitude of the offense, the remedy is different.\n  Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime has committed such severe \natrocities that the world community can no longer stand idly by and do \nnothing. We cannot turn a blind eye.\n  A new world requires a new philosophy regarding defense. This new \nphilosophy has been evolving for over a decade, ever since the end of \nthe cold war. Deterrence and containment no longer suffice.\n  In this new age, this smaller world, we can no longer look the other \nway because a conflict is on the other side of the world. It is just \nlike a conflict in our own neighborhood. There is no other side of the \nworld anymore. It is just down the street.\n  So not only do we have a right, but a duty to protect ourselves and \nfreedom-loving people around the world. The world community needs to be \ninvolved in making sure our partners in the world community treat their \ncitizens and other nations fairly and with respect. If nations fail to \ndo this and rise to a certain level of threat, just like kids at home, \nthese nations must be dealt with. This is an evolving sense of \nconscience, and mine cannot sit back and wait until there is another \nstrike.\n  Three-thousand people died on September 11, 2001. I do not want to \nsee the tragic loss of American life again because of our inaction. It \ncannot happen to me, my children, or their children, or any innocent \nlife.\n  So what do we do with a leader who has so blatantly violated 16 U.N. \nresolutions over the last decade, has invaded neighboring countries, \nand has tortured and killed his own people? Do we sit idly by and \nwatch? That has never been the American way. America has never stood \nparalyzed by inaction when its citizens are threatened. Does Saddam \npose a threat to this country's livelihood and to the American people? \nI believe he does.\n  September 11 also taught us another lesson--how fragile our freedoms \nare, especially when you inject fear. Also, we found out how fragile \nour economy was. He clearly has growing and increasingly sophisticated \nbiological and chemical weapons capabilities, which strikes fear into \nthe heart of every citizen on this planet. He has used them in the past \nand has the intent to use them again. He also actively continues his \nefforts to acquire nuclear weapons.\n  To those who still do not see the link between Iraq and the terrorist \nattacks on America and American interests, I say look again. The \nabsence of an obvious link does not mean that one link does not exist. \nTo those of us who study and learn from history, there should be no \nquestion what we need and should do. Hussein is a monster and a threat \nto the United States as we know it. Congress must speak with one united \nvoice. The Nation must speak with a united voice. The world community \nmust speak with one united voice. Those who resist speaking with a \nstrong, united voice have a very short memory. The security of this \ncountry is the responsibility of each and every one of us who live \nhere. If this great Nation wants to stand by and pacify, I tell you we \nwill get hit again.\n  We have heard lots of speeches and seemingly a lot of logic that \nwould say this is a wrong thing to do. I can remember when another \nPresident by the name of Theodore Roosevelt said, ``Speak softly, but \ncarry a big stick.'' With Saddam Hussein, we have tried to speak softly \nand, so far, it has not worked. He has not responded to any U.N. \nresolution, sanctions, or even oil for food. So people like Saddam \nHussein and Osama bin Laden, who hate Americans, hate our system, hate \nwhat free people have built here, will find a soft spot somewhere else \nat a later time--another vulnerability--and they will seize upon this \nopportunity to attack us once again.\n  That is what a blind eye creates. So I will vote for this resolution. \nI would even like to see it stronger because I think it strengthens the \nhands of our Secretary of State as he maneuvers his way through \ndeveloping a new resolution in the world community called the United \nNations. It also sends a very strong message to the rest of the world \nthat all of us have a responsibility when a cancer falls upon the face \nof our planet. I will vote for this one and even a stronger one if I \ncould get it.\n  Once again, speak softly, but carry a big stick.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. CANTWELL). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I hold the Senate seat of the late Wayne \nMorse. Senator Morse lost his job in 1968, and many have attributed his \nloss to his outspoken opposition to the Vietnam war. Wayne Morse's \nelection loss makes his words from that era no less true today.\n  In a 1966 debate on the role of the Senate with respect to the great \nissues of war and peace, Senator Wayne Morse said:\n\n       This is what the United States Senate is for. It is what \n     the Founding Fathers created the Senate to do--take the long-\n     range view of actions prompted in national councils that may \n     be warped by some strong passion or momentary interest.\n\n  It is the long-term interest of our country, Madam President, that \nWayne Morse so presciently focused on in 1966 that leads me to outline \nthe following conclusion that I have made with respect to the Iraq \nresolution.\n\n[[Page S10097]]\n\n  Saddam Hussein is the bad actor here and the United States of America \nis the good actor. I believe the authorization of a unilateral \npreemptive military attack based on the information now available will \ncause much of the world, unfortunately, to lose sight of this reality. \nThis perception in a region racked by poverty and already marked by a \ndeep mistrust in American foreign policy could foster decades, possibly \neven centuries of undeserved hatred of our great Nation that will \nthreaten our children and our grandchildren.\n  Protecting our children and grandchildren after a unilateral \npreemptive attack on Iraq will require a staggering financial \ncommitment from our National Government. Given the pressing financial \nneeds here at home for public safety, for education, for health, where \nare the funds going to come from after our Nation wins such an \nengagement with Iraq?\n  Protecting our children and grandchildren after a unilateral \npreemptive attack on Iraq will require an American policy of energy \nindependence--especially independence from Middle East oil. We are a \nlong way from there, and on some issues, such as saving energy and the \ncrucial transportation sector, it seems that now we have been going \nbackward.\n  Protecting our children and grandchildren after a unilateral \npreemptive attack on Iraq will require a plan for rebuilding confidence \namong many of the countries that stood with us during the gulf war \nconflict, but do not stand with us today. Many of those countries do \nnot believe diplomatic and other steps have been fully exhausted. If \nour Government cannot convince them of that, it is certainly going to \nbe tough to restore faith after a unilateral, preemptive attack.\n  For many weeks now, I have waited and listened patiently, I feel, for \nthe administration to make its case for the resolution. I serve on the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. I followed this issue very closely, and \nI believe neither partisan politics nor the pressures of an anxious \npublic should be factored into a decision of this magnitude.\n  Instead, I see my duty as an elected representative of the great \nState of Oregon to listen, to inquire dispassionately, and make the \ndecision I believe to be in the best interest of Oregon and this great \ncountry, and leave the judgment to history and the voters as to whether \nI made that judgment in the right way.\n  In approaching the decision about whether to vote to authorize the \nmilitary option this measure calls for, I laid out some criteria on \nwhich to base my decision.\n  My criteria were: If our security agencies were to provide me with \ncompelling evidence of a significant threat to our domestic security if \nHussein's Iraq is not defeated militarily, I would be willing to grant \nauthority for the use of force. But I am unwilling to give my approval \nfor a first-strike, unilateral attack until and unless there is \nassurance under the resolution that before such an attack, the \nadministration exhausted all other reasonable means to accomplish our \ngoals.\n  Second, I am convinced it is essential to have a workable plan to \ncontain the situation if Iraq attacks Israel and Israel enters the \nconflict.\n  And third, I am concerned there has to be a showing such an attack \nwill not make our Nation less safe by setting us back in the war on \nterrorism.\n  The President has made a compelling case--I believe a sincere one--\nregarding the danger posed by Iraq under the rule of Saddam Hussein, \nbut his argument--and I say respectfully--does not meet the criteria I \nhave laid out.\n  First, I am not convinced, regarding a clear and present threat, \nSaddam Hussein currently imposes a clear and present threat to the \ndomestic security of the Nation. While my service on the Senate \nIntelligence Committee has left me convinced of Iraq's support of \nterrorism, suspicious of its ties to al-Qaida, I have seen no evidence, \nacts, or involvement in the planning or execution of the vicious \nattacks of 9/11.\n  While Iraq has aided terrorism for many years, there are any number \nof regimes who have aided terrorism, including some with far more \ndirect links to Osama bin Laden's network of terror. In this regard, I \nnote the first conclusion in the Central Intelligence Agency's \ndeclassified letter to Chairman Bob Graham of Florida dated October 7 \nof this year which states that at present, Iraq does not appear to be \nplanning or sponsoring terrorism aimed at the United States.\n  Yet, had the administration met this threshold test, in my view, it \nhas still not met the rest of what I consider to be prudent criteria. \nWhile the President has stated his desire to seek alternative means to \naccomplish his goals before beginning a military strike, to grant the \nPresident the authority to conduct a first-strike war before first \nwitnessing the exhaustion of those efforts is to abdicate the \nobligations of this body in its most sacred role. The Founding Fathers \nsurely envisaged a more challenging inquiry when granting the Congress \nthe responsibility of authorizing armed conflict.\n\n  On my second point, while I am not privy to the administration's war \nplans, I am of the belief the administration is satisfactorily \npreparing for a potential enlargement of the conflict with Israel or \nother allies. I am concerned this issue has not been adequately \naddressed.\n  I do believe the administration needs to outline in further detail \nhow they would address issues with respect to the enlargement of the \nconflict, and I want to make clear I do not believe that point has been \naddressed clearly and fully to date. The possibility this conflict \nwould be enlarged with an attack on Iraq to one that involves Israel is \none I think needs to be laid out and laid out clearly.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly for my purposes, I reached the \nconclusion that pursuit of a first-strike war, absent any credible sign \nSaddam Hussein is preparing to wage war against our Nation or other \nnations, will leave this Nation less secure than before. I believe we \nhave to look at greater length at these key questions, and I do not \nbelieve that has been done to date.\n  It is the sacred duty of the Senate to focus and act upon the long-\nterm interests of our beloved Nation. Saddam Hussein is an extremely \ndangerous and extremely despicable man. Time and again, he has \ndemonstrated that to his enemies, as well as his own people. He lives \nin a part of the world where there is no shortage of dangerous and \ndespicable men who pose a threat to the security of the United States. \nIn my service on the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have not seen \nsatisfactory evidence he is any more despicable than the threat \npresented by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran.\n  In summary, those are the central questions. Making sure we have \nexhausted all of the diplomatic opportunities before one considers a \nfirst strike, making sure we are ready to deal with the region after a \nfirst strike and one that, in my judgment, we are clearly going to win, \nthe unanswered questions of what happens when there is an attack on \nIraq and the possibility of enlarging the conflict to Israel--these \nquestions have not been addressed, and they have not been addressed \nfully.\n  There is no question in my mind Saddam Hussein represents a very real \nthreat to this country and to the world, but I do not want to, in the \ndays ahead, compound the problems we already face with Hussein in the \nregion by authorizing a unilateral, preemptive military strike at this \ntime, and that is why I will oppose the resolution.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, while I disagree with the thesis of our \ndistinguished colleague, the Senator from Oregon, I do respect his \nviews on it. I wonder if I might engage him in a brief colloquy.\n  This doctrine of preemptive attack unilaterally, clearly the Senator \nknows the President is diligently working with the United Nations, with \nthe Secretary of State--the Secretary of State visited here with a \ngroup of us at midday today and held a press conference, and he \nindicated progress is being made. For the moment, we have to accord the \nadministration at least clear support for trying hard to gain a \ncoalition of nations and a new resolution in the Security Council which \nhopefully will be much stronger than anything we have seen before, and \ncould act as a deterrent to the use of hostilities for a period of \ntime, and hopefully, who knows, the regime may have a change of heart \nand cooperate.\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\n  Cooperation is a keystone to any successful inspection regime. But \nback to the preemptive--and I have shared this with others--in my \nresearch, the United States, under a number of Presidents, has directed \nmilitary action in the following: Panama in 1901; Dominican Republic in \n1904, 1914, 1965; Honduras, 1912; Nicaragua, 1926; Lebanon, 1958; Cuba, \nthe naval quarantine, 1962, President Kennedy--clearly that was a \npreemptive threat and action by our President--Grenada, 1983; Libya, \n1986; Panama, that was just cause in 1989; Somalia in 1992; Sudan, \nAfghanistan, August of 1998. You recall the bombing raids we did at \nthat time. Iraq, that was Desert Fox in December of 1998, and I \nremember well as ranking member going over and talking with then-\nSecretary of Defense Cohen, a valued friend and colleague in the Senate \nof many years. And Kosovo in March of 1999.\n  Now, they fit the description of the preemptive type strikes my \nesteemed colleague from the great State of Oregon has enumerated. They \nwere done under the concept, which is tried and true in international \nlaw, recognizing ``the anticipatory self-defense if a country is \nimminently threatened.''\n  I think the Senator pointed out he feels President Bush has indicated \nthis country is imminently threatened. So there are some examples. I do \nnot think this contemplated action by the President--he says he has \nmade no decision to use force, but then again I point out we have been \nin a state of hostility with Iraq for some time. I point out our \nairplanes, our brave pilots, together with Great Britain, have been \nengaged in enforcing a resolution of the United Nations.\n  Here are two nations flying missions, clearly trying to enforce the \nresolutions. We are fortunate even though they have been shot upon many \ntimes by ground fire directed at the aircraft, some 60 times in \nSeptember of this year alone--our military has been engaged in this \nconflict with Iraq for 12 years. So I think it is a continuation of the \nconflict to which we refer in this resolution.\n  I ask my good friend if he has any views with regard to my points.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank my distinguished colleague for the chance to \nfurther discuss this. My colleague makes a good point that clearly last \nnight in the President's speech, and further today, he made it clear he \nwas interested in trying to mobilize world opinion, and I think all of \nthat is extremely constructive.\n  At the same time, the letter to Senator Graham that now has been \ndeclassified--I sit on the Senate Intelligence Committee--makes it \nclear the CIA does not believe, as of October 7 of this year, the \nthreat is imminent. That is why I think we have now reached the point \nwhere we are debating whether there is a continuing threat, which \nclearly Saddam Hussein is, or whether there is an imminent threat. It \nwas the imminent threat I really set out as one of the thresholds I \nthought was relevant for supporting this resolution.\n  As the Senator could hear from my speech, A, I do not doubt the \nPresident's sincerity; B, I thought what he said last night was clearly \na step in the right direction, and he elaborated on that further today.\n  On this matter with respect to the nature of the threat, for me what \nhas been dispositive has been the now-declassified letter from the CIA \nwhere the CIA did not believe, as of October 7, the threat was \nimminent. I thank my distinguished colleague because he makes a number \nof good points, and always does.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Could the Senator direct himself to the point made by the \nSenator from Virginia, that our aircraft have been fired upon in \nenforcing resolutions 60 times in the month of September of this year \nalone? The total firings by ground-to-air missiles on our aircraft--\nfortunately, they have not hit or brought down an airplane as yet--is \nthat not engaging in combat, in war?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator again makes a legitimate point, but what we \nare talking about now, it seems to me--and this is what the CIA is \ntalking about in their letter of October 7--is an imminent threat to \nthe American people. It is very clear that conflict is a hostile one. \nIt is one that must be countered. It is being countered today. I do not \ntake a backseat to any Member of the Senate in terms of supporting our \ntroops, our military, in terms of countering that conflict. But the \nquestion for the Senate then becomes whether a conflict like that \nshould translate into support in this body for a resolution that would \nauthorize a unilateral preemptive strike.\n  In spite of all of the attacks which the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia has mentioned--and they are very serious ones--as of October 7 \nof this year, the CIA did not believe there was an imminent threat to \nour country. I assume in making that judgment before the Intelligence \nCommittee, if they had felt the attacks the Senator was talking about \nare dispositive, they would not have written that letter.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I guess I am missing something, but \ndrawing on my own modest experience in the military, where I for a \nperiod was communications officer in the 1st Marine Airwing, living \nwith aviators who were being shot at every day, to me they are American \ncitizens. I think Americans are being shot at as that fire is trying to \ninterdict their aircraft. They may not be home in the United States--\nperhaps they would like to be--but they are out there pursuant to \norders of the Commander in Chief. It is not just President Bush. It was \nPresident Clinton. To me, that is hostility. To me, Americans are \ninvolved. Great Britain likewise is flying with their brave pilots. \nSomehow I am missing it.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, I want our people who are in harm's way, as the \nSenator has outlined, to be able to counter that very hostile attack. \nThey are doing so today under existing law and it is an effort I \nsupport. In spite of those attacks, the Central Intelligence Agency \nstated at present Iraq does not appear to be planning or sponsoring \nterrorism aimed at the United States which, after 9/11, was the stated \nconcern that was vital to our national security.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, was the Senator among the group that was \nbeing briefed in S-407 this afternoon from 2:00 to 3:00?\n  Mr. WYDEN. I was not, but I will tell the Senator I have probably sat \nin more briefings, as a Member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, on \nthis point than just about any Member of this body. I have kept fully \nabreast of this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I would ask unanimous consent that the letter to which \nSenator Wyden referred be printed in the Record. Is that possible?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is declassified.\n  Mr. WARNER. I beg your pardon?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is declassified.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has been speaking to it and reading excerpts \nfrom it. I am unfamiliar with the letter.\n  I am not familiar--I heard the Senator addressing a letter from the \nCIA. I was under the assumption it was a declassified document. Is it a \nclassified document?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It is a declassified document.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator has been referring to a classified document, \nis that it?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Throughout this afternoon, I have been speaking from a \ndeclassified document.\n  Mr. WARNER. I apologize to the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I have mentioned on several occasions it was declassified. \nI take my responsibilities as a Member of this committee very \nseriously.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am not challenging the Senator. I was not able to hear \nhim as he spoke. I tender an apology. Since the Senator referred to the \nletter, and if it is declassified, perhaps it should be a part of the \nRecord so those who are following this debate can read the letter in \nits entirety.\n  Mr. WYDEN. It would be possible to do that and have that made a part \nof the Record. I appreciate the Senator's thoughtfulness. We all have \nstrong views on this. The Senator from Virginia is an expert on \nnational security and military affairs. That happens to be an area \nwhere I believe reasonable people may differ. I look forward to working \nclosely with my colleague.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  While I was in Florida this weekend, I had a number of people say \nthey had been listening to the debate in which the Senator from \nVirginia and the Senator from West Virginia had both engaged. They \nfound the quality of the debate to be excellent, and they were looking \nforward to the continuation of the debate.\n  On grave matters of war and peace, as the Senate is considering this \nresolution, I add my comments. They are addressed to perhaps one of the \ngravest things we discuss in a constitutional body such as this. That \nis, authorizing the sending of Americans into harm's way--moms and \ndads, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters--into combat. We must \ndetermine whether the situation in Iraq threatens the United States \nsufficiently enough to send Americans into harm's way, and put American \nlives at risk.\n  I have spoken with many citizens across Florida. I understand the \nconcerns and the reservations many of them have.\n  We must use force only as a last resort. That is what this resolution \nis about; it is authorizing the use of force.\n  I remain convinced that the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq poses a \nclear and increasing danger to the national security interests of the \nUnited States. We must disarm its arsenal of chemical and biological \nweapons. We must halt the development of nuclear weapons. Ultimately, \none way or another, those weapons of mass destruction have to be taken \nout. If it means taking out Saddam Hussein along with them, then so be \nit. Our hope is that this threat can be dismantled by means less \nthan the use of force, and discussions in the United Nations toward \nthat goal are underway now. But if those efforts in the U.N. are not \nsuccessful, we cannot sit and do nothing as the danger grows.\n\n  On a regular basis, Saddam's troops fire on the United States and \nBritish aircraft seeking to enforce the no-fly zones created to protect \nthe Kurds in the north and the Shi'ites in the south. These no-fly \nzones exist to keep Saddam contained and to prevent him from acquiring \ntechnologies aimed at further enhancing his military capability.\n  At the conclusion of the Persian Gulf war in 1991, U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 687 set forth the conditions for peace. The cease-\nfire conditions required Iraq to disarm all weapons of mass \ndestruction, fully declare and disclose all weapons of mass \ndestruction, and not seek to further acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. That was in 1991--11 years ago.\n  Those terms have been clearly violated by Saddam Hussein. When a \ncountry willfully violates cease-fire terms which end war, a state of \nconflict continues to exist. The regular hostilities endured by \ncoalition pilots in the no-fly zones make that state of conflict even \nmore acute.\n  Saddam Hussein seeks regional hegemony. He seeks control of the oil \nsupply of the Middle East. That is his end game. He wants to control \nall of those vast reserves so that he can have his fingers in a \nstranglehold around the industrialized world of planet Earth. He \nassociates with known enemies of the United States. He has paid \ncompensation to suicide bombers aimed at undermining the peace process \nin the Middle East. And Saddam seeks at every turn to flout \ninternational law and the will of the United Nations. His \naggressiveness and thirst for war and blood are evident by his own \nactions and brutality, past and present, against his own people and \nagainst his neighbors.\n  It is time now to complete the job that was left undone in 1991 when \nwe failed to completely disarm and remove Saddam. The longer he remains \nin power, the longer he delays, obfuscates, and lies--all the while he \nstrengthens his arsenal. Weapons of mass destruction must be removed \nfrom Saddam Hussein, and the Iraqi people need to be liberated from his \nbrutal grip. This is not a fight we can enter alone. We must pursue \nthis cause with as much international support as is possible. The \nrevised resolution makes this clear.\n  Yesterday, I had the privilege of speaking to several hundred at \nCentral Command Headquarters at MacDill Air Force Base along with the \nCommander in Chief, GEN Tommy Franks. I brought words of a grateful \nnation to those men and women in uniform, and to all of our coalition \npartners who are part of this effort in going after the terrorists. \nThat international support is critical to our successful prosecution of \nthe war against terrorism, and that international cooperation is \ncritical as we now approach military hostilities in Iraq.\n  Our European allies are starting to come around. It is very important \nthat our Arab friends in the region do come around. The United States \nneeds the world community to support us in eliminating these threats of \nweapons of mass destruction. As we consider engaging in a military \nconflict, we need this international support so as not to hurt our \nefforts in the war against terrorists in 30-some countries, nor hinder \nour efforts to try to strike a peace accord in the Middle East.\n  Madam President, the President has asked the Congress to authorize \nthe use of American troops in Iraq for these purposes. He presented his \ncase to the American people last night.\n  As it exists now, the Lieberman resolution clearly has been improved \nenormously from the draft resolution sent to us several weeks ago by \nthe White House which, in essence, was nothing more than a blank check. \nNow it requires that the President must certify that diplomatic and \nother peaceful means will not adequately protect the national security \ninterests of the United States, or that diplomatic and other peaceful \nmeans will not lead to the enforcement of the United Nations Security \nCouncil resolutions on Iraq. The President must certify those \nconditions.\n  It also has language regarding the United States' responsibility in \nplanning for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq--an Iraq that the United \nStates, after Saddam Hussein, had best not abandon, as we did after the \nSoviets got licked in Afghanistan and tucked their tail between their \nlegs and left--and we left also. That created a vacuum in Afghanistan \nand allowed the terrorists to fill that vacuum. In the post-Saddam \nHussein Iraq, we don't want that same thing to occur. The United States \nmust be there for the long run to give military, diplomatic, and \neconomic security assistance to ensure that the Free World's interests \nare clearly protected in an Iraq after Saddam Hussein.\n  It was good that President Bush addressed the United Nations on \nSeptember 12, and sought broad-based support from the international \ncommunity. Secretary Powell will and must continue efforts at getting \nstrong language--strong language--in a United Nations Security Council \nresolution that clearly spells out the actions Iraq is required to take \nand the consequences if it fails to do so. Such a resolution would \nstrengthen the U.S. position and help us gain support from our Arab \nfriends in the region. We must keep the focus on Saddam Hussein and the \nresolutions regarding weapons of mass destruction that he has ignored.\n  The Lieberman resolution also requires the President to report \nregularly to the Congress on ongoing operations in Iraq and the \nadministration's plans, specifically, as I mentioned, for the post-\nSaddam Hussein Iraq and ensuing reconstruction. All of the additions \nthat have been included in the Lieberman resolution have clearly \nimproved upon the blank check that was sent here early on as a draft \nfrom the White House.\n  Having detailed plans in place will be crucial to ensuring that after \nSaddam Hussein, Iraq does not disintegrate into a permanent source of \ninstability in the Middle East which would pose a serious threat to \nU.S. national security interests.\n  The current resolution also is improved from earlier drafts because \nit also makes reference to Navy CAPT Scott Speicher of Jacksonville, \nFL, the American pilot still missing since the first night of the gulf \nwar when he was shot down over Iraq. Through a series of mistakes, the \nUnited States walked away from a downed pilot.\n  We have kept at this, over and over, in the Armed Services Committee \nand the Foreign Relations Committee, and have been talking to world \nleaders asking them to task their intelligence apparatus for word on \nCaptain Speicher.\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\nHe is still considered Missing In Action. He was first declared Killed \nIn Action. The Department of Defense changed that to Missing In Action. \nThe Department of Defense is reportedly considering a change in status \neven from Missing In Action.\n  He is the only American among the thousands who are still unaccounted \nfor at the hands of Saddam Hussein--thousands, I might say, going back \nto the Iran-Iraq war.\n\n  I appreciate the fact that the majority leader worked to ensure that \nthe request of Senator Pat Roberts and myself to make reference to \nCaptain Speicher was honored. It is honored in this resolution. It is \nmy hope that our upcoming efforts and actions in Iraq will make \nprogress towards resolving the fate of Captain Speicher.\n  You can just imagine what it is like for that family back in \nJacksonville--a family with children that has not heard the fate of \ntheir father for the last 11 years.\n  This resolution, in my view, asserts the role of Congress granted by \nthe Constitution and the War Powers Act. We have heard hours of \ntestimony from senior administration officials and outside experts \nrepresenting many different views on the subject. I have sat through \nhours of testimony in the two committees I have the privilege of \nserving on--the Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services \nCommittee--that have delved in detail into this subject in preparation \nfor our coming to this floor in this debate.\n  We have heard those hours of testimony in both classified and \nunclassified form. My office, as well as all of our offices, has \nreceived thousands of calls, letters, and e-mails. I have heard those \nvoices. I share those concerns.\n  The threat posed by Iraq grows with each passing day. Since September \n11 of a year ago, we can't wait to protect ourselves against the \nthreats of weapons of mass destruction and regimes hostile to the \nUnited States with their links to terrorism. We must not leave \nourselves exposed to an attack, which, after it comes, we will wish we \nhad acted to prevent.\n  That is why I come to this floor to announce my support of the \nLieberman-Warner-McCain-Bayh resolution authorizing the President to \nuse force in Iraq. It is the right thing to do, and it is in the vital \nnational security interests of the United States.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me this time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I wish to speak on this resolution.\n  First, I compliment my friend and colleague, the Senator from \nFlorida, Mr. Nelson, for his speech and for his tenacity in trying to \nremind everyone about the condition of Naval Aviator Speicher. I think \nthat keeps pressure on our Government, other governments, and the Iraqi \nGovernment to disclose his whereabouts and his status. Whether he is \nalive remains to be seen.\n  I appreciate my colleague from Florida for continuing to press that \nissue. I join with him. I know the President of the United States is \nalso pushing that issue. I appreciate his effort as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield? I just wish to \nexpress my profound appreciation for the support of the Senator from \nFlorida for the Lieberman-Warner-McCain-Bayh resolution. He is a valued \nmember of the committees here in the Senate. Certainly he has worked \nhard on our committee. I listened carefully as he stated the case. He \nstated it clearly. I join with my colleague from Oklahoma in commending \nhim for the fight on behalf of that brave airman, Captain Speicher.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator from Oklahoma yield for one \ncomment so I can respond to the distinguished Senator from Virginia?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Certainly.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner. \nHe told us how he and Senator Nunn were leading our Armed Services \nCommittee 11 years ago as the Nation was preparing for the gulf war and \nhow important it was in Senator Warner's mind that the Record be laid \nout so a record would be there as to why the Congress should vote to \ngive the President the authority to unleash the military might in \nKuwait and going after Iraq.\n  I thank Senator Warner and Senator Levin, the chairman, for how they \nhave laid that predicate, and Senator Biden and Senator Helms, and, in \nhis absence, Senator Lugar, in the Foreign Relations Committee. They \nlaid that predicate with lengthy hearings, and provided access to \nclassified information we have had in those two committees, which \nhelped me to draw the conclusions I have drawn in support of this \nresolution.\n  So I particularly thank the great Senator from the Commonwealth of \nVirginia for his leadership.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my colleague. I share the same \nsentiments towards the distinguished Senator from Florida.\n  Madam President, in 1990-1991, Chairman Sam Nunn and I, as ranking \nmember, had nine hearings. It is interesting, in the first hearing we \nhad Secretary of Defense Cheney and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff Colin Powell. Isn't that interesting? And then in the ninth \nhearing were the same two witnesses, Cheney and Powell. And today, of \ncourse, I shared briefly a press conference with now-Secretary of State \nPowell and had lunch with now-Vice President Cheney. So that same team \nis together that was together under the first George Bush, ``Old 41,'' \nas we say.\n  So I thank the Senator for that.\n  We did lay before the Senate a record. We have put a record before \nthe Senate of hearings in the two committees to which you have \nreferred. I had hoped we would have had more hearings in our committee, \nbut for reasons best known to our chairman, apparently, that was not \npossible. I very much wanted to have all four of the military chiefs. \nThey don't want to sit this thing out. They are heavily involved. I was \nhopeful we could have had them, and then also the CINC, General Franks, \nwho has the leading responsibility in the area of operation. But, \nunfortunately, no matter how hard we tried, it did not come to pass. My \nchairman, I respect whatever his views are on that.\n  Senator Kennedy raised the question, why we did not have more facts. \nI just say that there were some of us who wanted to go on and have some \nadditional hearings, but it was not possible.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DAYTON). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the colloquy.\n  Just for the information of my friend from Florida, I was also here \nin 1991, and, unfortunately, Senator Nunn did not support the \nresolution in 1991. There was a partisan divide, for whatever reason. \nOne, the resolution passed with bipartisan support. I tell my friend \nand colleague that. But at that point in time, the Democrat leader at \nthe time, Senator Mitchell, was opposed to the resolution. Many \nDemocrats opposed it, although several Democrats did support it.\n  It passed, if my memory serves me correctly, 52 to 47. It was one of \nthe first votes we had in early January of 1991. And it was one of the \nmost important votes that this Senator has cast. I believe, probably \nthis Thursday, the Senate likewise will be casting one of the most \nimportant votes we will cast.\n  I appreciate the support of my friend and colleague from Florida for \nthis resolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of \nthe joint resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I likewise would like to compliment my \ncolleague, Senator Warner, because he has been leading the debate, \ncertainly on this side of the aisle, but, frankly, on both sides of the \naisle. Senator Warner has carried the debate on this side almost all of \nFriday, almost all of Monday, a great deal of today, and I am sure \ntomorrow and Thursday.\n\n  He has also been joined by Senator Lieberman as a principal sponsor, \nas well as Senator McCain, Senator Bayh, and others. I compliment them.\n  I heard some people debating this resolution as if they had not read \nit. Senate Joint Resolution 46 is well written. It is supported by the \nadministration. There was a lot of time spent in putting this \nresolution together. Sometimes we legislate without reading. Sometimes \nwe talk to people without listening.\n\n[[Page S10101]]\n\n  I encourage my colleagues to read the resolution. I hope it will get \na unanimous vote.\n  I looked at the resolutions we have passed in the last many years \ndealing with Iraq. Going back to the resolution we passed in 1991, I \nremember that resolution very plainly. A few days before that \nresolution passed, I was in Israel. Saddam Hussein was making \nstatements like: If war broke out, Israel would burn. It would be \nconsumed with fire. He was making all kinds of statements against the \nUnited States, against Israel, against any potential ally.\n  As the previous administration, President Bush 1, was putting \ntogether an international coalition, Saddam Hussein was threatening \nanybody in that coalition. Congress debated, for months. You might \nremember that Kuwait was invaded in August of 1990. President Bush made \na very strong statement. He said: This invasion will not stand. And he \nmade that statement: You are going to be removed from Kuwait, one way \nor another. Frankly, he made that strong statement, and he backed it \nup. He sent 550,000 United States troops to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to \nbuild the military force and, in the next 6 months, built an \ninternational coalition that was unprecedented, unbelievably strong and \npowerful, with a number of countries, Arab and other countries, \nneighbors and from across the world, to stand up to Saddam Hussein's \ninvasion of Kuwait and to kick him out of Kuwait.\n  That war was fought. It was very successful. And then President Bush \nstopped the war at that point because we achieved the U.N. resolution \nobjectives, kicking Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait.\n  Then there were several resolutions that were passed, to which Saddam \nHussein and the Iraqi Government agreed, that called for their \ndisarmament and inspections. They agreed to these resolutions. We also \npassed resolutions that said we would use military force, if necessary, \nto compel compliance. And the United Nations, subsequent to that, \nbeginning in 1991, all the way through 1998, passed 16 resolutions \ntelling Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Government: You must comply with \nthese resolutions.\n  We went to war, developed an international coalition to force him out \nof Kuwait and to force him to disarm, and he agreed. Unfortunately, he \ndid not live up to his agreement. He lied. He did not comply. He was \ndefiant in his noncompliance.\n  As a result, he continued to build weapons of mass destruction. And \nthe United Nations passed resolutions saying: You must comply, and, if \nnecessary, we will use force. I could put in all these resolutions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe resolution that passed Congress, the Iraqi Breach Of International \nObligations, because it is about a four-page summary, a short summary, \nbut it is a resolution we passed on July 31, 1998, Public Law 105-235, \nand talks about the Iraqi breach of international obligations.\n  I will not read it all, but basically the Iraqi Government totally \nfailed to comply with the U.N. resolutions. The essence of the \nresolve--and I will read it--\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n       That the Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable \n     breach of its international obligations, and therefore the \n     President is urged to take appropriate action, in accordance \n     with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, \n     to bring Iraq into compliance with its international \n     obligations.\n\n  That is the key phrase. This is what passed Congress in 1998. That \nwas our unified statement that we made in 1998, that resolved we will \n``bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations,'' and \nwe will use ``appropriate action,'' i.e., military action, if \nnecessary, to get him to comply.\n  That resolution passed the Senate unanimously--unanimously--with no \nopposition.\n  It had very strong support. I am looking at some of the statements \nmade. I will just read part of one made by President Clinton on \nFebruary 17, 1998 regarding Iraqi noncompliance. He made this speech to \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Pentagon dealing with Iraq. It is \nvery relevant today, as it was in 1998. This is President Clinton:\n\n       Now, let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply, \n     and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route \n     which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this \n     program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press \n     for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the \n     solemn commitments that he made?\n       Well, he will conclude that the international community has \n     lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on \n     and do more and rebuild an arsenal of devastating \n     destruction.\n       And some day, some way, I guarantee you, he'll use the \n     arsenal. And I think every one of you who's really worked on \n     this for any length of time believes that, too.\n\n  President Clinton continued:\n\n       If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would \n     follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow by the \n     knowledge that they can act with impunity, even in the face \n     of a clear message from the United Nations Security Council \n     and clear evidence of a weapons of mass destruction program.\n\n  I mention this. This was from President Bill Clinton, a very strong \nstatement. I read that statement. I am kind of proud of him and I think \nhe was exactly right. Though his rhetoric was pretty strong, his \nactions, unfortunately, were not. He said, we are going to compel \ncompliance. The Congress passed a resolution saying, we will do what is \nnecessary to compel compliance. But we didn't follow up.\n  I will read to you a statement made by Senator Daschle on the floor, \nthe Democrat leader at the time. This was made on February 12, 1998:\n\n       . . . Iraq shall not be permitted to develop and deploy an \n     arsenal of frightening chemical and biological weapons under \n     any circumstances.\n\n  Skipping a couple paragraphs:\n\n       The United States continues to exhaust all diplomatic \n     efforts to reverse the Iraqi threat. But absent immediate \n     Iraqi compliance with Resolution 687, the security threat \n     doesn't simply persist--it worsens. Saddam Hussein must \n     understand the United States has the resolve to reverse that \n     threat by force, if force is required. And, I must say, it \n     has the will.\n\n  I think Senator Daschle was right. I could go on. I have quotes from \nVice President Gore, other prominent leaders in Congress at the time. \nWe passed a strong resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the 1998 resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Public Law 105-235\n\n       A joint resolution of the 105th Congress finding the \n     Government of Iraq in unacceptable and material breach of its \n     international obligations.\n       ``Whereas hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on \n     February 28, 1991, and the conditions governing the cease-\n     fire were specified in United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 686 (March 2, 1991) and 687 (April 3, 1991);\n       ``Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 \n     requires that international economic sanctions remain in \n     place until Iraq discloses and destroys its weapons of mass \n

Presidential \n     Statement demanding Iraq end its interference and on June 21, \n     1997, United Nations Security Council Resolution 1115 \n     threatened sanctions on Iraqi officials

international obligations, and therefore the President is \n     urged to take appropriate action, in accordance with the \n     Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring \n     Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.''\n       Approved August 14, 1998.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Later in 1998, the U.N. weapons inspectors were kicked \nout of Iraq. We bombed them. Then nothing happened. Since 1998, for the \nlast 4 years, we haven't had any weapons inspectors in Iraq. They have \ndone exactly as President Clinton forecasted they would do. They have \ncontinued to build their weapons of mass destruction, and they have \nbeen emboldened by our lack of action, by the lack of will.\n  As a matter of fact, in all those years, the Oil-for-Food program \ngrew. At that point he was exporting a little bit of oil for food. That \nfigure has quadrupled in the last few years. Every 6 months it was \nrenegotiated. And due to pressure from a lot of countries it was \nrenegotiated; yes, we don't want the Iraqi people to suffer so we will \nallow them to sell more oil. Saddam Hussein has abused that program and \nexported a lot more oil. He has basically been producing almost all he \ncan.\n  He has taken that money and put it back into his weapons of mass \ndestruction. He is not taking care of his people. We have Congressmen \nwho were in Iraq last week talking about how pitiful it is that some of \nthe kids are living in the hospitals and so on. Saddam Hussein has made \nbillions off of oil, most of it illegally, but instead of using that \nmoney for the health and well-being of the Iraqi people, he has used it \nto build weapons of mass destruction.\n  President Clinton was pretty insightful of what would happen. \nUnfortunately, during his term, things got worse. The inspectors were \nbasically kicked out of Iraq. They were denied access. There is a long \nlitany. I will insert in the Record a list of Iraqi noncompliance with \nthe arms control inspectors, how they basically stopped them from doing \ntheir job. They did a decent job on occasion because they would get \nsome insights from a defector, but Saddam Hussein's mistress was \nlaughing about the fact Saddam Hussein would laugh that he would \ncontinue to conceal these weapons and basically defy the United Nations \nand the United States.\n  We have had a change in the United States. Now we have President \nBush, who said we should enforce the U.N. resolutions. We should stand \nup to Saddam Hussein. Things have changed. September 11 of last year \ndid change things. It made us aware we are vulnerable to terrorists. \nSaddam Hussein has coalesced, has financed, has trained terrorists. The \nidea he is building these weapons of mass destruction and they might be \ndistributed to potential terrorists is just not acceptable.\n  What needs to be done? Frankly, what needs to be done is to enforce \nthe existing U.N. resolutions and to reaffirm them. Some people have \nsaid: We don't think President Bush should just\n\n[[Page S10103]]\n\nmove unilaterally. The world community signed off on those U.N. \nresolutions, and at the time we gave those U.N. resolutions the use of \nforce, if necessary, to compel compliance. What has changed?\n  In 1998, we reaffirmed the use of force, if necessary, to compel \ncompliance. Are things better now than they were in 1998? He kicked the \narms control inspectors out, and they are building all kinds of \nweapons. I don't see how anything is better. Things are worse, just as \nPresident Clinton predicted they would be.\n  We have rewarded his noncompliance. The international community has \nrewarded his noncompliance, and the United Nations has basically fallen \ninto a group that lost its prestige and the status of being able to \nsay: The world community is making a statement. This will not stand.\n  They have allowed it to stand. They have allowed it to be neutered, \nto be ineffective. Now we have a President Bush who went to the United \nNations and said: These resolutions are still in effect. We need to \nenforce them. There is a real danger out there. It is a danger not to \nus, the United States, but to the world.\n\n  Many people in this body have said: I don't want him to move \nunilaterally, but let's do it in conjunction with the United Nations. \nPresident Bush didn't have to do that, but he did. He went to the \nUnited Nations and made a very strong speech. He is working to rebuild \nthe international coalition that dissipated, if not disappeared, during \nthe Clinton administration. The Clinton administration inherited the \nstrongest, largest international coalition maybe ever assembled against \na tyrant in Saddam Hussein in 1990 and 1991. By the year 2000, that \ninternational coalition was totally gone.\n  Saddam Hussein was producing all the weapons he wanted. There were no \narms control inspectors. It really deteriorated over those 8 or 9 \nyears.\n  President Bush is trying to rebuild it. He made the speech to the \nUnited Nations. He has contacted Members of Congress. He has brought \nmany of us into the White House. He made a speech last night to the \nAmerican people as well as to Congress.\n  People said: We want Congress to speak on this so we will be united. \nHe came to Congress. He asked for a resolution. We are going to give \nhim a resolution. We are going to show the Congress is behind the \nPresident, I hope with an overwhelming vote, an overwhelming vote.\n  What have we learned since 1991? Many people who voted no on the \nresolution in 1991 said: Let's give the sanctions a chance. I think we \nhave had a little period of understanding now that Saddam Hussein \ndoesn't care about sanctions and he doesn't care about U.N. \nresolutions. He doesn't care about pieces of paper. He does care about \nforce. He respects force.\n  He misjudged the will of President Bush 1. He misjudged the will of \nthe United States, earlier in his invasion and also in events that led \nup to the war in 1991.\n  I think he understands, too, that President Bush is very forceful. He \nmeans exactly what he says. If there is any chance to have a peaceful \nresolution in Iraq, it will only be after we pass this resolution, and \nhe understands quite well that we will use force, if necessary, to \ncompel compliance. Maybe then he will have a change of behavior. If \nnot, he will pull the U.N. around and play them like a fiddle and try \nto do some type of diplomatic dance, never to do anything. He did that \nquite successfully for years.\n  He will not be successful with President Bush and this team. \nPresident Bush has assembled a team--I respect President Bush greatly \nfor the speeches he has made and for his courageous positions but also \nfor the team he has put together. His Vice President, Dick Cheney, is \nformer Secretary of Defense, and he has dealt with Saddam Hussein. His \nSecretary of State, Colin Powell, was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nin the war in 1991. Secretary Rumsfeld is well respected by our \nmilitary leaders and around the world. President Bush has put together \na great team--one that probably wasn't designed for this problem, but \nit could not be more experienced and ready to take on this enormous \nchallenge. I have great confidence in their ability to be able to do \nthe job.\n  Is it without risk? No. Sure, there is risk involved. There is a lot \nthat is involved. But doing nothing is a greater risk. Doing nothing is \na much greater risk. If we want to have any hope of a peaceful \nresolution or to have this happen successfully without military \nconflict, it will only be after Saddam Hussein realizes the United \nStates is behind our President, our Commander in Chief, and that we \nwill enforce these resolutions. These resolutions don't have to be \npieces of paper that are going to be ignored; they are the rule and \neffect of law. I hope the international community comes together.\n  The U.N. passing a strong resolution is much greater after they see \nthe Congress speak with one voice and pass overwhelmingly a resolution \nstating we believe the existing resolutions should be enforced. We do \nnot think it is satisfactory to have Saddam Hussein--a person who used \nchemical weapons against his own people, who fought wars with Iran, who \nhas invaded Kuwait, and who lobbed missiles against Saudi Arabia and \nthe Israeli people, we don't think it is satisfactory for that person, \nthat regime, to be able to develop and continue to manufacture tons and \ntons and tons of chemical and biological weapons, and work on nuclear \nweapons that could threaten millions of people--millions of people.\n  That is not satisfactory. It needs to be stopped. I believe this \nPresident will do it. I think this resolution will be a big step in the \nright direction.\n  I want to make one final comment, and this is to the Iraqi people. \nThey have suffered enough under Saddam Hussein. This is really for the \nliberation of the Iraqi people, just like getting rid of the Taliban in \nAfghanistan was liberation for the Afghan people. They have been \nsuppressed for too long. This tyrant, this dictator who executed people \nhimself and had relatives executed, and countless people who might be \nhis political opponents have been executed--he needs to go.\n  In 1998, this Congress said we are for a regime change in Iraq. We \nwere for it in 1998. We are for it now. In my opinion, we will not \nreally have a return to a peaceful, growing, prosperous Iraq until \nthere is a regime change. We will not have any confidence that there is \nany peaceful outlook for Iraq as long as Saddam Hussein is in the area. \nThis Congress spoke in 1998 strongly and unanimously for regime change. \nI still think that is needed. The point I want to make is that if \nmilitary conflict breaks out, it will not be a war with the Iraqi \npeople. The war is with the leadership of Iraq, the unelected leader, \nSaddam Hussein, the tyrant who continues to oppress his people, \nbasically stealing their money and using it to build weapons of mass \ndestruction for his purposes, which is not for the well-being of the \nIraqi people, but, frankly, for his desire to build a military machine \nthat can threaten us. That is not acceptable.\n  I believe this resolution, when it passes--and I hope it does \noverwhelmingly--will send a strong signal to the world and to Saddam \nHussein that these resolutions can, should, and will be enforced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nhis very strong statement on behalf of the resolution Senators Warner, \nBayh, McCain, I, and others have put before the Senate. I also thank my \nfriend and colleague from Florida, Senator Nelson, for his strong \nstatement on behalf of the amendment we have offered. I think together \nthey form bookends that are bipartisan and quite strong in endorsing \nour resolution, and also in responding to some of the complaints, or \nquestions, or criticisms about it that have been made in this first day \nof direct debate on it, which I do want to do a little bit more of \nmyself.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I compliment the Senator for his leadership on this. I \nhave actually read the resolution. I think it is a very good product, \nbipartisan, due in large part to the Senator's leadership. I remember \nworking with him on the 1991 resolution, as well as Senator Warner and \nmany others who were on the floor 11 years ago. So I thank my friend \nand colleague from Connecticut. We have had the pleasure of working \ntogether on many issues, and this is\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\none of the most important. The Senator's leadership is very notable and \ncommendable, and I thank him for it.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind words. \nI remember our work together in 1991. We are older and maybe wiser. In \nany case, I am proud to be working with the Senator and others on both \nsides of the aisle in a good cause.\n  I want to say, as he talked about reading the resolution--and I think \nthat is important and I hope all our colleagues will read it--not just \nthe ``resolved'' part, but the ``whereas,'' the preamble.\n  There have been suggestions here and there that either this \nresolution we have adopted was sort of patched together in a hurry, or \nthat the White House just dictated it. The good news is this resolution \nis the result of a bipartisan, bicameral, House-Senate negotiation with \nthe White House in a spirit of accommodation and compromise as part of \na desire to go forward together. Some significant changes were made in \nthe resolution from the original draft sent by the White House that \nwere requested by Members of Congress, including particularly Members \non the Democratic side of the aisle.\n  I just want to mention very briefly those changes. They include, \nfirst, support for and prioritization of American diplomatic efforts at \nthe U.N. Just so there would be no doubt that what we were authorizing \nor intending to authorize was a unilateral, go-it-alone, ``don't care \nwhat anybody else says in the world'' military strike at Saddam \nHussein, it is not that. In fact, at the heart of this resolution is \nthe authority given to the President to enforce United Nations \nresolutions in great number, which have been consistently ignored, \nviolated, denied, and deceived by Saddam Hussein over the decade.\n  While Congress is only able to authorize the President, as Commander \nin Chief, to take military action, the clear implication that I read \ninto our resolution--but more than that, the clear statement of \nintention of the President should we face the moment we hope we do not \nface, when either Saddam does not respond to the U.N. or the U.N. \nitself refuses to authorize action to enforce its resolutions, then I \nthink the President has made clear, and those of us who are sponsoring \nthe resolution have made clear, that the United States will not go it \nalone and we will not have to, as a result of the decision to go to the \nU.N., as a result of the consultation with allies in Europe and Asia, \nin the Middle East and elsewhere in the world, as a result of the \ndiscussion and debate here and what I hope will be strong bipartisan \nsupport of this underlying resolution.\n\n  If we come to that moment where we have no other choice but war, then \nit is clear that we will have allies in good number at our side. That \nwas one of the items we added to the resolution.\n  We also limited the scope of the authorization to Iraq and \nresolutions of the United Nations related to Iraq. The initial language \nsubmitted by the White House had a third clause which would justify \nmilitary action, and that was to give the President authority to take \nmilitary action to restore international peace and security to the \nregion. That was a good step forward to grant the President authority \nbut to limit the authority.\n  I take it also to be a limitation on duration, although some have \nspoken today and in previous days about the fact that this is \nunlimited. This is limited to the duration of authority necessary to \naddress the current and ongoing threats posed by Iraq. When those \nthreats are over, the authority is gone. Because the connection between \nsections 1 and 2 of the material parts of the resolve clause, which is \nthe conditions that would justify military action, are joined by the \nword ``and'' and not by the word ``or,'' I think it is meant to clarify \nthat this authority applies only to the relevant United Nations \nresolutions regarding Iraq.\n  There was another significant change. We also asked the White House \nand they agreed to put in language that requires the President to \nsubmit to Congress a determination, prior to using force, that further \ndiplomatic means will not protect the national security of the American \npeople or lead to enforcement of U.N. resolutions--another way, \nconsistent incidentally with the gulf war resolution of 1991, to make \nit clear in this resolution that the policy of the United States is not \nto go to war first but to go to war last, after all other means of \nachieving Saddam's disarmament have failed.\n  We also require the President to submit to Congress a determination, \nprior to using force, that taking military action against Iraq is \nconsistent with continuing efforts by the United States and other \nnations to take the necessary actions against international terrorists \nor terrorist organizations.\n  Justifiable concern was expressed that somehow a potential war \nagainst Iraq would interrupt, disrupt, deter the ongoing war on \nterrorism.\n  As I said, I think the two are connected because Saddam is a \nterrorist and supports terrorism and has had contacts with al-Qaida, \nbut this makes clear the President has to make a determination publicly \nto Congress that these two are not in conflict and then requiring the \nPresident to comply with the War Powers Act which mandates regular \nconsulting and reporting procedures.\n  I spoke earlier this afternoon and said to my colleagues I did not \nunderstand why there were some who said this resolution was somehow in \ncontravention of the Constitution. One might disagree with the \nevaluation we sponsors of the resolution have made about the danger of \nIraq under Saddam or of the imminence of the threat, but clearly the \nlanguage of this resolution is not only within the power that Congress \nis given by the Constitution to declare war, to authorize military \naction, but also, by complying with the War Powers Act, embraces the \nlater section of article I that says Congress is empowered to adopt \nlegislation to implement the powers the Constitution gives.\n\n  Finally, there is a requirement that the President report every 60 \ndays to Congress on military operations and on the planning for close \nof conflict activities, such as reconstruction and peacekeeping. It is \nnot too soon to begin to plan for that now. I had occasion to speak on \nthis subject last night at the Wilson Center here in Washington.\n  The bottom line is the ultimate measurement of the success of war is \nthe quality of peace that follows. We have an obligation not just to, \nif necessary, tear down the dictatorship that Saddam has built in Iraq, \nbut to help the Iraqi people build up a government that will follow in \na better life, better economy, and more freedom for themselves, and \nthis reporting requirement will be an incentive for that to happen.\n  Obviously, I hope and trust our colleagues will read the resolution \nin full. I want my colleagues to understand a significant process of \nnegotiation went on between Democrats and Republicans in the House and \nthe Senate and the White House before this resolution, which the \nPresident does support, was introduced into the Senate.\n  I see my friend from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Will my friend yield?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I will be happy to yield to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding.\n  Madam President, I wish to express again my appreciation for his \nleadership on this very important subject. He is recognized in the \nSenate as somebody who is an expert on Middle East affairs, and a lot \nof us lean on his opinion as we go through these debates.\n  I am sure the President appreciates the Senator from Connecticut \nsitting down and working with him in a bipartisan manner.\n  I compliment the Senator publicly for his fine work on this \nresolution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I say to my friend and colleague from \nColorado, he is very gracious. I appreciate it. It is an honor to have \nthis opportunity to be involved in this very important debate and to do \nso across party lines. I thank him for his thoughtful advocacy of this \nresolution and of a strong U.S. presence in this region generally. I \nappreciate it.\n  Madam President, not seeing anyone else who wishes to speak at this \ntime, I want to begin to respond to some of the thoughtful questions \nthat were raised by the Senator from Oregon, and to some extent by the \nSenator from Massachusetts, about the imminence of the threat that Iraq \nrepresents and the basic question of, why now? what is the rush?\n  For my own part, as I said earlier today, the question for me is, why \nnot\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\nearlier? In other words, not, why now? but, why not earlier? We have \ngone through almost 11 years since the gulf war, since the armistice, \nthe cease-fire agreement by which Saddam committed himself to adhere to \nthe various U.N. resolutions and then proceeded rapidly to violate \nalmost all of them, to play a cat-and-mouse game with the U.N. \ninspectors, testified to by so many of them, including the most \nmemorable to me, Richard Butler, the Australian who headed the UNSCOM \ninspectors during the nineties, saying--and he used the word ``lies.'' \nHe said the Iraqis under Saddam kept telling lies about what they had \nand did not have.\n  The record sadly shows--and there is now an indisputable record in \nthis regard--that they have a growing inventory of very deadly toxins, \nbiological, and chemical weapons.\n  We say with some glibness, because we say it so much, that Saddam is \nprobably the only leader of a country in the world today who has used \nchemical weapons. He has, and used them not just once but several times \nagainst the Kurdish people, citizens of Iraq, and on some occasions \nactually having medical personnel nearby to follow up, not to help \nthose who were attacked, but to use them as if they were test objects, \nto see to what extent they were hurt or how they were killed. That is \nhow brutal and inhumane this regime is.\n  All the time this deceit and deception was going on, we tried \neverything over and over to stop the violations of the U.N. agreements. \nNothing worked--inspections, sanctions, Food for Oil, trade \nrestrictions, and even limited military action.\n  That is why we come to this point where we have said enough is \nenough. There is no question, in terms of is this imminent, that the \nevents of September 11, 2001, have affected our judgment. I say for \nmyself they have affected my judgment. I have said now that I have felt \nthis way about Saddam for a long time.\n  In 1998, former Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator McCain, Senator Lott, and \nI cosponsored the Iraq Liberation Act based on the constant deception \nand violation of the U.N. inspection team, kicking them out of Iraq. \nThat act declared it American policy to no longer just contain Saddam, \nbut because of the danger that he was brewing within his borders with \nchemical and biological weapons, ballistic missiles and unmanned aerial \nvehicles which he could deliver on targets near and far, that we had to \nadopt a new policy to change the regime. That was adopted into law in \n1998.\n  So as for myself, I have had this feeling about Saddam and his \npotential to use these weapons to expand his control of the Arab world. \nThis is what I referred to earlier in the day in the incredibly timely \nbook that has just come out by Kenneth Pollack, an expert on Iraq, \ncalled ``A Threatening Storm.'' In that book, Mr. Pollack tells the \nlife story of Saddam through the Baath Party, so-called pan-Arabic \nviews, and the extent to which his dream and his ambition is to be the \nnew Saladin of the Arab world and control the entire Arab world.\n  So that is what these weapons are for, and his Arab neighbors are the \nnearest and most immediate targets of that, many of whom are very good \nallies of ours and from whose countries we receive much of the oil that \nfuels our economy, as well as the economy of the rest of the world.\n  So this has been building. Yet September 11, 2001, has had a profound \neffect on all of us. Speaking for myself, it has had a profound effect \non me.\n  We look back and we say we knew what Osama bin Laden was saying; we \nknew his hatred for the United States; we knew he had struck at the two \nAmerican embassies in Africa; we knew he had attacked the USS Cole.\n  We made some attempt to strike back at him, but now having \nexperienced the horror of September 11, 2001, don't we wish we had \ninvaded Afghanistan, overthrown the Taliban, and disrupted al-Qaida \nbefore September 11, 2001? Of course, we all do. The will was not \nthere, notwithstanding the warnings.\n  So in terms of imminence, this resolution uses the phrase \n``continuing threat,'' that we authorize the President to use the Armed \nForces of the United States to defend the national security of the \nUnited States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.\n  When we put together Saddam's hatred for the United States--I quoted \nearlier today, February 15, 1991, in defeat, after the gulf war, Saddam \nsaid:\n\n       Every Iraqi child, woman, and old man knows how to take \n     revenge. They will avenge the pure blood that has been shed, \n     no matter how long it takes.\n\n  Surely, that was one of the reasons he attempted to assassinate \nformer President Bush on a visit to Kuwait; why he, according not to \nthis Senator or any other Senator but according to our own State \nDepartment, is one of seven nations on the State Department list of \nstate sponsors of terrorism who has supported terrorist groups that \nhave killed Americans.\n  So I read the word ``continuing threat'' as contained in our \nresolution to hold within it implicitly the words ``grave and \nimminent'' that some of our colleagues have said they wish were there.\n  The record shows that. The experience of September 11, 2001, shows \nthat. I do not want to look back on some dark day in the near or not so \nnear future, after some terrorist group supported by Saddam, or Iraq \nitself, has struck at allies of ours in the region or at American \nforces there or at Americans in the United States itself, which he is \ncapable of doing, and say I wish we had taken action against him before \nhe acted against us. We do not ever want to face a moment like that \nagain.\n  So I believe the record before us, recited in some detail in the \npreamble, the whereas clauses of our resolution, argues loudly that the \ncontinuing threat referred to in the literal wording of the \nauthorization clause is both grave and imminent and calls out for the \naction and the strength that this resolution requires.\n  The best way to achieve peace is to prepare for war. That is what has \nbeen said so many times in the past, particularly when dealing with a \ndangerous dictator like Saddam Hussein--and through his agents--an \naggressor, a brutal killer himself.\n  There is no substitute for strength. We are a strong Nation and we \nare marshaling that strength before the United Nations, before the \nworld community and directly to Saddam Hussein, hoping the message will \nget through and he will disarm without requiring the U.N., or an \ninternational coalition led by the United States, to disarm him. That \nis our hope. That is our prayer. But we will not achieve it unless our \nintentions are clear and strong.\n  There is a wonderful sentiment, an insight that I read a while ago \nfrom GEN Douglas MacArthur, obviously a great soldier but also a great \nstudent of warfare. MacArthur once said, and I quote: The history of \nfailure in war can be summed up in two words, ``too late''--too late in \ncomprehending the deadly purpose of a potential enemy; too late in \nrealizing the mortal danger; too late in preparedness; too late in \nuniting all possible forces for resistance; too late in standing with \none's friends.\n  It is a brilliantly insightful and moving quote, and remarkably \nrelevant to the challenge that our resolution puts before our \ncolleagues--too late in comprehending the deadly purpose of a potential \nenemy, that is the case we are making, the continuing threat of Saddam \nHussein, grave and imminent; too late in realizing the mortal danger--\nthat is the point that he continues to build an inventory of chemical \nand biological weapons that pose literally a mortal danger, the danger \nof killing Americans in great number if we do not stop him.\n  In the colloquy I had earlier today with the Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Warner, I expressed that there has been a lot of debate leading up \nto this resolution about whether Saddam has nuclear capacity and when \nhe will achieve it. Is it going to be a year, 6 years, 10 years? I do \nnot know, but I do know he possesses biological weapons today, deadly \nbiological weapons, with the capacity to deliver them with ballistic \nmissiles, and now increasingly sophisticated and small unmanned aerial \nvehicles, which when taken together could, in the worst nightmare \nscenario, create as much or more devastation and death than the kind of \nprimitive nuclear weapon he will sooner or later possess. So that is \nthe mortal danger in MacArthur's warning.\n  Too late in preparedness, well, that is what we are authorizing the \nPresident,\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\nas Commander in Chief, and our military to do. Too late in uniting all \npossible forces for resistance. We are working now with our allies, \nwith the Iraqi opposition, finally, 4 years after the Iraq Liberation \nAct authorized our government to begin working with the broad-based \nIraqi opposition to Saddam Hussein.\n\n  Finally, too late in standing with one's friends. Here we are talking \nabout our friends in the Middle East and the Persian Gulf. Good \nfriends. Arabs, mostly, but also obviously Israelis. I say ``Arabs \nmostly'' because if you follow the line of Saddam's ambitions, they are \nto control the Arab world. That is what the invasion of Iran was about, \nthat is what the invasion of Kuwait was about.\n  If we give him the opportunity, that is what future invasions, using \nchemical, biological, and potentially nuclear weapons, will be about.\n  It is time to stand with our friends in that region. I repeat, the \nhistory of failure in war can be summed up in two words: Too late. Too \nlate in comprehending the deadly purpose of a potential enemy. Too late \nin realizing the mortal danger. Too late in preparedness. Too late in \nuniting all possible forces for resistance. Too late in standing with \none's friends. This resolution is our way of saying to the American \npeople, to the United Nations, to our allies in the Middle East and to \nSaddam Hussein, this time we cannot, we must not, and we will not wait \nuntil it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I will make a few brief comments. I \nassociate myself completely with the statement made by the Senator from \nConnecticut. I thought they were thoughtful comments. I also think \nSenator Nickles from Oklahoma, who spoke prior to him, did a nice job \nof laying out for the Senate this issue, whether we should move forward \nwith the resolution the President has requested.\n  I believe the President seeks to avoid conflict. I don't think there \nis anyone in this Chamber who wants to see us go into a conflict as a \nfirst option. We are very much concerned about the lives of our men and \nwomen who serve in the military. We certainly do not want to put them \nat risk unnecessarily.\n  The question occurs, if Saddam Hussein fails to comply, are we \nprepared to use force? I look at it this way. Historically, if we look \nat Iraq and what has been happening, I don't think anyone can deny \nthere is a buildup. We either address it now or we address it later. I \nam of the view the sooner we address this problem, the less the risk \nwill be. If we continue to let the problem grow, it increases the risks \nto our men and women in the military who may be called into battle as a \nresult of noncompliance with Iraq. Hopefully we do not reach that \npoint.\n  I compliment the President on his leadership. It is the kind of \nleadership we need at this time. It is a judgment call. It is what \nevery Senator has to make a decision about in his own mind, whether \nthis is the right thing to do. The longer we hold this up, the risk is \nmagnified. That puts the neighbors of Iraq at risk, it puts countries \nall around the world at risk.\n  There is no doubt in my mind Saddam Hussein has the capability of \nusing weapons of mass destruction. He is capable mentally of doing \nthat. He has done it before. He has used it on his own. If he can use \nit on his own, he would certainly be willing to use it any place else. \nIf we look at biological weapons, there is not much doubt he has the \ncapability to use biological weapons. Their threat is extremely \nserious. That is another threat that will continue to grow. We know he \nis out there trying to develop nuclear capability. That expands even \nmore my concerns about an expanding risk as we continue to delay \naction.\n  We need to move forward. We need to move forward quickly. The sooner \nwe get this resolved, the sooner we get the support from the United \nNations, we can move forward, give the President that option, a final \noption, that, if necessary, he will go in, even unilaterally, to \nprotect the interests of the United States, to protect the Americans, \nand, if necessary, protect our friends and allies in the Middle East.\n  There is a quote in the President's speech last night I will restate. \nHe says approving this resolution does not mean military action is \nimminent or unavoidable. The resolution will tell the United Nations \nand all nations that America speaks with one voice and is determined to \nmake the demands of the civilized world mean something. Congress will \nalso be sending a message to the dictator in Iraq that his only choice \nis full compliance. That is key.\n  The time remaining for that choice is limited. We need to act \nquickly. I am glad we have this before the Senate. We should have had \nit earlier than this week, but hopefully we will get it out this week \nand move forward.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4856, As Modified\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I have a technical modification of the \namendment that we offered earlier, and it is at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 4856), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the resolving clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This joint resolution may be cited as the ``Authorization \n     for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Since in 1990 in response to Iraq's war of aggression \n     against and illegal occupation of Kuwait, the United States \n     forged a coalition of nations to liberate Kuwait and its \n     people in order to defend the national security of the United \n     States and enforce United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions relating to Iraq:\n       Since after the liberation of Kuwait in 1991, Iraq entered \n     into a United Nations sponsored cease-fire agreement pursuant \n     to which Iraq unequivocally agreed, among other things, to \n     eliminate its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \n     programs and the means to deliver and develop them, and to \n     end its support for international terrorism;\n       Since the efforts of international weapons inspectors, \n     United States intelligence agencies, and Iraqi defectors led \n     to the discovery that Iraq had large stockpiles of chemical \n     weapons and a large scale biological weapons program, and \n     that Iraq had an advanced nuclear weapons development program \n     that was much closer to producing a nuclear weapon than \n     intelligence reporting had previously indicated;\n       Since Iraq, in direct and flagrant violation of the cease-\n     fire, attempted to thwart the efforts of weapons inspectors \n     to identify and destroy Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \n     stockpiles and development capabilities, which finally \n     resulted in the withdrawal of inspectors from Iraq on October \n     31, 1998;\n       Since in 1998 Congress concluded that Iraq's continuing \n     weapons of mass destruction programs threatened vital United \n     States interests and international peace and security, \n     declared Iraq to be in ``material and unacceptable breach of \n     its international obligations'' and urged the President ``to \n     take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution \n     and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into \n     compliance with its international obligations'' (Public Law \n     105-235);\n       Since Iraq both poses a continuing threat to the national \n     security of the United States and international peace and \n     security in the Persian Gulf region and remains in material \n     and unacceptable breach of its international obligations by, \n     among other things, continuing to possess and develop a \n     significant chemical and biological weapons capability, \n     actively seeking a nuclear weapons capability, and supporting \n     and harboring terrorist organizations;\n       Since Iraq persists in violating resolutions of the United \n     Nations Security Council by continuing to engage in brutal \n     repression of its civilian population thereby threatening \n     international peace and security in the region, by refusing \n     to release, repatriate, or account for non-Iraqi citizens \n     wrongfully detained by Iraq, including an American \n     serviceman, and by failing to return property wrongfully \n     seized by Iraq from Kuwait;\n       Since the current Iraqi regime has demonstrated its \n     capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction \n     against other nations and its own people;\n       Since the current Iraq regime has demonstrated its \n     continuing hostility toward, and willingness to attack, the \n     United States, including by attempting in 1993 to assassinate \n     former President Bush and by firing on many thousands of \n     occasions on United States and Coalition Armed Forces engaged \n     in enforcing the resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council;\n       Since members of Al Qaida, an organization bearing \n     responsibility for attacks on the\n\n[[Page S10107]]\n\n     United States, its citizens, and interests, including the \n     attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, are known to be \n     in Iraq;\n       Since Iraq continues to aid and harbor other international \n     terrorist organizations, including organizations that \n     threaten the lives and safety of American citizens;\n       Since the attacks on the United States of September 11, \n     2001, underscored the gravity of the threat posed by the \n     acquisition of weapons of mass destruction by international \n     terrorist organizations;\n       Since Iraq's demonstrated capability and willingness to use \n     weapons of mass destruction, the risk that the current Iraqi \n     regime will either employ those weapons to launch a surprise \n     attack against the United States or its Armed Forces or \n     provide them to international terrorists who would do so, and \n     the extreme magnitude of harm that would do so, and the \n     extreme magnitude of harm that would result to the United \n     States and its citizens from such an attack, combine to \n     justify action by the United States to defend itself;\n       Since United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     authorizes the use of all necessary means to enforce United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 660 and subsequent \n     relevant resolutions and to compel Iraq to cease certain \n     activities that threaten international peace and security, \n     including the development of weapons of mass destruction and \n     refusal or obstruction of United Nations weapons inspections \n     in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     687, repression of its civilian population in violation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolution 688, and \n     threatening its neighbors or United Nations operations in \n     Iraq in violation of United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 949;\n       Since Congress in the Authorization of Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1) has \n     authorized the President ``to use United States Armed Forces \n     pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     (1990) in order to achieve implementation of Security Council \n     Resolutions 660, 661, 662, 664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674, \n     and 677'';\n       Since in December 1991. Congress expressed its sense that \n     it ``supports the use of all necessary means to achieve the \n     goals of United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 as \n     being consistent with the Authorization of Use of Military \n     Force Against Iraq Resolution (Public Law 102-1),'' that \n     Iraq's repression of its civilian population violates United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 688 and ``constitutes a \n     continuing threat to the peace, security, and stability of \n     the Persian Gulf region,'' and that Congress, ``supports the \n     use of all necessary means to achieve the goals of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 688'';\n       Since the Iraq Liberation Act (Public Law 105-338) \n     expressed the sense of Congress that it should be the policy \n     of the United States to support efforts to remove from power \n     the current Iraqi regime and promote the emergence of a \n     democratic government to replace that regime;\n       Since on September 12, 2002, President Bush committed the \n     United States to ``work with the United Nations Security \n     Council to meet our common challenge'' posed by Iraq and to \n     ``work for the necessary resolutions,'' while also making \n     clear that ``the Security Council resolutions will be \n     enforced, and the just demands of peace and security will be \n     met, or action will be unavoidable'';\n       Since the United States is determined to prosecute the war \n     on terrorism and Iraq's ongoing support for international \n     terrorist groups combined with its development of weapons of \n     mass destruction in direct violation of its obligations under \n     the 1991 cease-fire and other United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions make clear that it is in the national security \n     interests of the United States and in furtherance of the war \n     on terrorism that all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions be enforced, including through the use of \n     force if necessary;\n       Since Congress has taken steps to pursue vigorously the war \n     on terrorism through the provision of authorities and funding \n     requested by the President to take the necessary actions \n     against international terrorists and terrorist organizations, \n     including those nations, organizations or persons who \n     planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks \n     that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons \n     or organizations;\n       Since the President and Congress are determined to continue \n     to take all appropriate actions against international \n     terrorists and terrorist organizations, including those \n     nations, organizations or persons who planned, authorized, \n     committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on \n     September 11, 2001, or harbored such persons or \n     organizations;\n       Since the President has authority under the Constitution to \n     take action in order to deter and prevent acts of \n     international terrorism against the United States, as \n     Congress recognized in the joint resolution an Authorization \n     for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40); and\n       Since it is in the national security of the United States \n     to restore international peace and security to the Persian \n     Gulf region.\n\n     SEC. 3. SUPPORT FOR UNITED STATES DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS.\n\n       The Congress of the United States supports the efforts by \n     the President to--\n       (1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security \n     Council all relevant Security Council resolutions applicable \n     to Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and\n       (2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security \n     Council to ensure that Iraq abandons its strategy of delay, \n     evasion and noncompliance and promptly and strictly complies \n     with all relevant Security Council resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Authorization.--The President is authorized to use the \n     Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be \n     necessary and appropriate in order to--\n       (1) defend the national security of the United States \n     against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and\n       (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions regarding Iraq.\n       (b) Presidential Determination.--In connection with the \n     exercise of the authority granted in subsection (a) to use \n     force the President shall, prior to such exercise or as soon \n     there after as may be feasible, but not later than 48 hours \n     after exercising such authority, make available to the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President pro \n     tempore of the Senate his determination that--\n       (1) reliance by the United States on further diplomatic or \n     other peaceful means alone either (A) will not adequately \n     protect the national security of the United States against \n     the continuing threat posed by Iraq or (B) is not likely to \n     lead to enforcement of all relevant United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions regarding Iraq; and\n       (2) acting pursuant to this resolution is consistent with \n     the United States and other countries continuing to take the \n     necessary actions against international terrorists and \n     terrorist organizations, including those nations, \n     organizations or persons who planned, authorized, committed, \n     or aided the terrorists attacks that occurred on September \n     11, 2001.\n       (c) War Powers Resolution Requirements.--\n       (1) Specific statutory authorization.--Consistent with \n     section 8(a)(1) of the War Powers Resolution, the Congress \n     declares that this section is intended to constitute specific \n     statutory authorization within the meaning of section 5(b) of \n     the War Powers Resolution.\n       (2) Applicability of other requirements.--Nothing in this \n     resolution supersedes any requirement of the War Powers \n     Resolution.\n\n     SEC. 5. REPORTS TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) The President shall, at least once every 60 days, \n     submit to the Congress a report on matters relevant to this \n     joint resolution, including actions taken pursuant to the \n     exercise of authority granted in section 4 and the status of \n     planning for efforts that are expected to be required after \n     such actions are completed, including those actions described \n     in section 7 of Public Law 105-338 (the Iraq Liberation Act \n     of 1998).\n       (b) To the extent that the submission of any report \n     described in subsection (a) coincides with the submission of \n     any other report on matters relevant to this joint resolution \n     otherwise required to be submitted to Congress pursuant to \n     the reporting requirements of Public Law 93-148 (the War \n     Powers Resolution), all such reports may be submitted as a \n     single consolidated report to the Congress.\n       (c) To the extent that this information required by section \n     3 of Public Law 102-1 is included in the report required by \n     this section, such report shall be considered as meeting the \n     requirements of section 3 of Public Law 102-1.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, we have been able to accomplish a great deal \ntoday on this most important resolution. I think the debate has been \npertinent. I think people have had a chance to express themselves \nwithout hindrance. We would hope that Senators would continue in the \nsame vein. With these two cloture motions that have been filed, we are \nhopeful and confident that the debate on this will be brought to a \nclose on Thursday morning and that following that we can complete work \non the resolution. We certainly hope so.\n  In the meantime, we would hope people who have amendments to offer \nwould do that and, if possible, we would like to have those amendments \nresolved prior to Thursday. If not, of course, if some of them are \ngermane, they will be carried over until after our cloture votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10108-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on behalf of the people of America, I \nthank President Bush and all Federal law enforcement agencies for the \nhelp, response, and support they have given to those who live in the \nCapital region as we face the threat of a predatory serial killer. The \nentire Nation knows six people have died. Some have been shot but are \nin recovery, like the 13-year-old boy who was so critically wounded \nyesterday. There is a serial killer out there. The President yesterday \nissued a statement extending his sympathies to those family members who \nhave lost loved ones. He also directed law enforcement to be as \nresponsive as possible.\n  As soon as the first dastardly and despicable deed occurred, Federal \nlaw enforcement, in terms of FBI and ATF, were there offering voluntary \nand informal assistance. Last night I spoke to FBI Director Mueller. \nThrough a request from the Montgomery County police chief, they are \nformalizing and coordinating this effort. So we in Maryland really want \nto extend our gratitude to the President, to Federal law enforcement, \nand to all of America that is sending their love and prayers to our \nregion.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. We talked together about the efforts your office, my \noffice, Senator Allen, and Senator Sarbanes, working as a team, in \nfielding calls. We urge people to come to us. I also speak for the \nMayor of the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia is grateful \nfor the quick response led by our President, led by the Attorney \nGeneral and others, to this crisis.\n  I have been privileged to live in this area throughout my entire \nlife. I was an assistant U.S. attorney one time. Never have I seen a \ncrime situation such as this. It has brought about the unity between \nthe regions to work to solve this problem. I join with my friend and \nthank her for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10108-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10108-S10111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL STROM THURMOND\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, throughout America's history, our Nation \nhas been blessed with leaders of rare courage, character, and \nconviction. The Senate for almost half a century has been fortunate to \ncount among its members an especially remarkable individual, Senator \nStrom Thurmond.\n  Earlier, I joined in paying tribute to Senator Thurmond's \nunparalleled record of public service both to his country and to his \nbeloved citizens of South Carolina. His extraordinary record of service \nspans almost 80 years.\n  We should also recall another aspect of service to his country--\nSenator Thurmond's heroic and selfless record of military service.\n  His distinguished military career spanned more than three decades, \ncommencing shortly after his 21st birthday when he was commissioned a \nSecond Lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve. When he retired in 1965, \nSenator Thurmond had risen to the rank of Major General, the highest \nrank then available to a Reserve Officer.\n  Inasmuch as he was serving as a South Carolina circuit judge at the \noutset of World War II, Mr. Thurmond was exempt from military service. \nBut, then First Lieutenant Thurmond did not hesitate: he volunteered \nfor duty the day the U.S. declared war against Germany, receiving a \ncommission in the Active Army and becoming a member of the First U.S. \nArmy.\n  While serving in the European theater, Strom served in all battles of \nthe First Army, fighting through France, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg, \nCzechoslovakia, and Germany. A lieutenant colonel at the time of the \nNormandy invasion--known forever as D-day--Strom volunteered for \ntemporary duty with The All-American Division, North Carolina's 82nd \nAirborne, with whom he would land on the first day of the invasion.\n  Senator Thurmond once recounted this experience with the 82nd:\n\n       On May 23, they informed us that they needed Civil Affairs \n     officers for temporary duty with the 82nd Airborne. Three of \n     us volunteered. . . . On May 29, our units headed for an \n     airfield near Newbury, where the three of us were briefed, \n     given final instructions, and assigned to various gliders. We \n     were to arrive with the 82nd in France on D-Day, June 6. The \n     primary mission of the 82nd and the 101st Airborne Divisions \n     was to keep enemy reinforcements from the invasion beaches. \n     One fifth of the American airborne soldiers were killed or \n     wounded that day, but we succeeded in accomplishing our \n     mission.\n       After we crossed the coast line of France we were subjected \n     to heavy anti-aircraft fire, soon thereafter the tow plane \n     cut us loose. Well, after that, we lost altitude fast. All I \n     could see rushing toward us were fields full of fences and \n     trees and crooked up gliders. As we came in to land, we hit a \n     tree and tore off one of our wings. The crash threw us into \n     another tree, and that clipped off our other wing. What was \n     left of us kept going until it plowed into a fence. We had \n     crash landed into an apple orchard.\n       We had landed within the German lines and as soon as we \n     touched the ground we were hit with enemy fire. I headed a \n     reconnaissance party with personnel from my glider to locate \n     a command post. I borrowed a jeep from an officer of the 4th \n     Infantry Division and made a reconnaissance of other nearby \n     gliders, trying to assist injured personnel in getting to the \n     rendevous. As soon as we had consolidated the group and set \n     up a temporary camp, we started to dig foxholes. We were \n     still being shelled, but not as heavily, along with \n     [receiving] small arms fire. I had busted up my left knee \n     when the glider had landed, so once we had taken care of more \n     urgent matters, I had the medics patch me up.\n\n  With typical humility, Senator Thurmond failed to note that he was \nawarded a Purple Heart for his injuries that day. In addition, he has \nbeen the recipient of numerous other decorations for heroism and valor, \nincluding 5 battle stars and 18 decorations, the Legion of Merit with \nOak Leaf Cluster, the Bronze Star Medal with V device, the Belgian \nOrder of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre.\n  In an effort to honor all soldiers of the 82nd Airborne and to \nacknowledge the spirit and actions of Major General Strom Thurmond \nduring his military career, I wrote to the Secretary of the Army this \npast April. My request was that Fort Bragg's new 82nd Airborne Division \nStrategic Deployment Facility--a key complex ensuring that Fort Bragg \nwill serve as the Army's principal power projection platform for years \nto come--be named in honor of Major General Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my letter of \nApril 19, 2002, and the Department of the Army's response of June 4, \n2002, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, needless to say, I am grateful to have \nreceived the Army's positive response and in September a ceremony was \nheld at the green ramp at Pope Air Force Base, adjacent to Fort Bragg. \nMore than 200 gathered to dedicate a premier facility,\n\n[[Page S10109]]\n\nto honor the 82nd Airborne, and to pay tribute to Major General \nThurmond's exemplary contributions as a soldier and a statesman.\n  On that occasion, many fine tributes were spoken. I was particularly \nmoved, though, by the words of the Under Secretary of the Army, the \nHonorable Les Brownlee. As a result of his distinguished service as \nmajority staff director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, where \nhe served under both Senators Thurmond and Warner, Secretary Brownlee \nis well known to many Senators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Brownlee's \nremarks from the September 16 dedication and a copy of a document \n``Thurmond Military Service Record'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nRemarks by Hon. Les Brownlee, Under Secretary of the Army at Dedication \n Ceremony, MG Strom Thurmond Strategic Deployment Facility, Pope AFB, \n                         NC, September 16, 2002\n\n       Congressman Hayes, thank you very much for your very \n     enthusiastic remarks to our soldiers here in the 82nd \n     Airborne Division.\n       I hope you forgive me if I don't mention everybody's name \n     again, since they have been mentioned a number of times \n     already. But I did want to recognize the soldiers of the 82nd \n     Airborne Division and the airmen of the 43rd Airlift Wing who \n     are here today and who I know will enjoy the benefits of this \n     marvelous facility.\n       I also wanted to recognize that not only did Congressman \n     Hayes play a pivotal role in this facility but Senator Helms \n     and his staff did as well, and I know that Senator Helms \n     insisted that this facility be named for his colleague, \n     Senator Strom Thurmond.\n       This year we will lose two giants out of the Senate. \n     Senator Thurmond and Senator Helms will complete their tenure \n     in the Senate this year but they will be sorely missed by the \n     Nation.\n       I want to recognize also the great work that was done by \n     everyone concerned in achieving this marvelous facility. It \n     is truly a wonderful example of the jointness and cooperation \n     that exists between the Army and the Air Force, and I want to \n     recognize and express our appreciation to our Air Force \n     comrades in arms.\n       I'm going also to pay a special tribute here to Mr. Duke \n     Short, Chief of Staff at the current time to Senator Thurmond \n     for almost thirty years. But more importantly, as \n     a lieutenant he was assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division \n     and served here at Fort Bragg. Duke, please stand. Please \n     join me in giving Duke a big round of applause for his \n     many years of outstanding service to the Nation and to \n     Senator Thurmond.\n       I spent some time last week with Senator Thurmond and \n     remarked that I was planning to borrow Duke Short from him \n     for a few hours so that he could participate in this \n     dedication ceremony. In typical Strom Thurmond fashion he \n     didn't blink an eye as he deadpanned ``that's fine . . . just \n     bring him back.''\n       As many of you know, I have had the distinct honor and \n     privilege of working directly for Senator Thurmond for many \n     years on the Senate Armed Services Committee, so I feel \n     especially grateful for the opportunity to say a few words \n     today. Senator Thurmond has been, and continues to be, an \n     inspiration for us all and I am certain he is both honored \n     and humbled by the dedication of this facility in his name.\n       Pay particular notice that this facility is dedicated to \n     Major General Strom Thurmond--no Senator Thurmond. This is \n     significant as it recognizes his military career and \n     accomplishments. But let's also take note of the \n     extraordinary list of important positions Strom Thurmond has \n     held throughout his life: Superintendent of Education for \n     Edgefield County, South Carolina State Senator, Circuit Judge \n     of South Carolina, Governor of South Carolina, Candidate for \n     President of the United States, United States Senator where \n     he served as chairman of the Armed Services, Veterans \n     Affairs, and Judiciary committees and as President Pro \n     Tempore, Major General in the Army Reserve, and the oldest \n     Senator, as well as the longest serving senator. On December \n     5th this year Senator Thurmond will be 100 years old and \n     still an active senator. What an impressive list--what a \n     marvelous life of public service.\n       In 1924 Strom Thurmond was commissioned as a second \n     lieutenant in the US Army Reserve. During World War II, \n     although exempt from military service due to both his age and \n     position as a judge, he took a four-year leave of absence \n     from a Circuit Judgeship in South Carolina in order to \n     voluntarily serve his country as a soldier. As a 43 year old \n     lieutenant colonel he served with the All Americans--the \n     82nd Airborne--and landed in a glider carrying 8 other \n     soldiers and a jeep as part of the D-Day invasion in \n     Normandy. His team reinforced parachute troops that landed \n     earlier that day and collectively routed the German forces \n     from the town of Ste. Mere-Eglise.\n       In fact, I remember discussing the glider operations with \n     Senator Thurmond. Riding a glider into battle is high \n     adventure, and the usual result was a crash-landing. That's \n     in fact how Senator Thurmond landed--a terrific crash that \n     wounded him and destroyed the jeep the glider was carrying. I \n     asked the Senator how he got out of the glider and into the \n     battle. He explained that the entire side of the glider was \n     torn open. ``All you had to do was to stand up and walk right \n     out the side!''\n       Four days after landing in the glider Lieutenant Colonel \n     Thurmond, armed with only a pistol, captured a German \n     motorcycle and commandeered it for his section's use.\n       Subsequently, Lieutenant Colonel Thurmond participated in \n     the liberation of Paris, the Rhine Campaign, and was among \n     the first Americans to liberate the Buchenwald concentration \n     camp. As a result of his actions, Strom Thurmond was awarded \n     the Legion of Merit--the Bronze Star for Valor, the Purple \n     Heart, and 5 Battle Stars. Although the war ended in Europe, \n     General Thurmond didn't return straight home. He volunteered \n     for and was transferred to the Pacific Theater at the \n     conclusion of combat in Europe and was preparing for the \n     final assault on the Japanese island of Okinawa when the war \n     ended.\n       In 1959 Senator Thurmond was promoted to the rank of Major \n     General, and retired from the Army Reserve in 1964 after 40 \n     years of active and reserve duty. Senator Thurmond obviously \n     knows the military, is a stalwart supporter of the Army, and \n     holds dear to his heart the soldiers, particularly the \n     paratroopers, of our Army.\n       At this time I have a letter from Senator Thurmond which he \n     asked that I read to you this morning:\n\n       Dear Friends: I am sorry that I am unable to join you today \n     as you dedicate the Major General Strom Thurmond Strategic \n     Deployment Center.\n       When the Commander-in-Chief needs to project American \n     military might quickly, he has no better option than the 82nd \n     Airborne Division. For more than the past fifty-years, ``The \n     All American'' has distinguished itself in military \n     operations around the world.\n       I think one of my proudest distinctions as a Soldier is my \n     association with the 82nd Airborne Division. A lot of things \n     have changed over the past 55 years that makes the \n     Paratrooper an even more efficient Soldier than he was in \n     1944. Thank goodness you do not use wooden gliders anymore. I \n     must confess that my one day only ride in that particular \n     aircraft is not one of my favorite memories. We can be proud \n     that today's Paratrooper is better equipped, better trained, \n     better armed and more lethal than the Airborne Soldiers of \n     any other generation or army. The military power that a \n     Regiment of 21st Century Paratroopers brings to bear in a \n     fight is nothing short of awe-inspiring to our allies, and \n     nothing less than terrifying to our enemies.\n       In addition to advances in weapons and tactics, there have \n     been considerable changes in quality of life for our \n     Soldiers. Investing in the well being of our Soldiers and \n     their families is not only a down payment toward readiness, \n     but it is simply the right thing to do. The Deployment Center \n     being dedicated today will give Paratroopers a modern, and \n     well designed, power projection platform.\n       That this facility is being named in my honor is a \n     recognition that is truly flattering and meaningful. I am \n     proud of this . . . and I am proud of my affiliation with the \n     82nd Airborne Division. I am very appreciative of this \n     distinction and I am always proud to do whatever I can to \n     help the fine men and women of our Armed Forces.\n       With best wishes and kindest regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond.\n\n       In December 1996 Senator Thurmond celebrated his 94th \n     birthday with the 82nd Airborne Division. He served as \n     honorary jumpmaster on a C-141 with the same unit he had \n     served with in 1944. Senator Thurmond said at the time \n     that he wanted to parachute into Normandy in 1944 but was \n     told that he was too old. Then, with his typical style, \n     Senator Thurmond stated ``Perhaps they will finally let me \n     jump and I'll get a pair of Airborne wings in celebration \n     of my 94th birthday!''\n       Almost five years ago I was honored to attend Senator \n     Thurmond's 95th birthday party. Throughout the party many \n     friends and well-wishers all remarked to the Senator that \n     they hoped that they could attend his 100th birthday party. \n     The Senator looked at each of them and said, ``well, if you \n     eat right, exercise, and take care of yourself there's no \n     reason why you can't be there.''\n       This Strategic Deployment Facility is a tremendous \n     testament to the spirit and tenacity of General and Senator \n     Thurmond. Strom Thurmond admires courage, toughness, and \n     perseverance--traits he believes, and I certainly agree with \n     him, are found in every soldier. The soldiers who pass \n     through this facility will be the standard-bearers of our \n     great Nation, and will undoubtedly live up to the ideals of \n     Strom Thurmond. The soldiers who train here, the soldiers who \n     will deploy from here, the soldiers who we send in harm's \n     way, will be better prepared to meet the challenges of \n     today's environment because of both this facility and the \n     lifelong dedication to the Nation rendered by Senator Strom \n     Thurmond--a man committed to our nation's security.\n       We have learned all too well the uncertainty of our world. \n     The threats to our Nation's interests are more complex and \n     diverse than at any time in our history. The stakes are high. \n     The United States must\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\n     safeguard our national interests and fulfill our world \n     leadership responsibilities as well. Today, the U.S. military \n     is protecting our Nation's interests both on the war front \n     and on the home front, and the call may come at any time, day \n     or night, for our valiant troopers to pass through these \n     portals and answer the call to battle.\n       As our military forces use this MG Strom Thurmond Strategic \n     Deployment Facility to protect and defend this great Nation, \n     I am confident that all of us, military and civilian, soldier \n     and family member, will always remember and live up to the \n     words of our President, George W. Bush, on 14 September \n     last year when he stated: ``America is a nation full of \n     good fortune, with so much to be grateful for. But we are \n     not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world \n     has produced enemies of human freedom. They have attacked \n     America, because we are freedom's home and defender. And \n     the commitment of our fathers is now the calling of our \n     time.''\n       A week later President Bush declared: ``We will rally the \n     world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will \n     not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail.''\n       The paratroopers who pass through this facility will never \n     fail us. They will continue to live to the high standards of \n     courage, valor, and selfless service demonstrated by Senator \n     Thurmond. I know that our soldiers of today and the future \n     will draw strength, resolve, and inspiration from this \n     facility and its namesake, and will continue to protect the \n     security of this great nation.\n       God bless each and every one of you and God Bless America!\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Thurmond Military Service Record--January 9, 1924-November 22, 1964\n\n       Strom Thurmond began his military career when he was a \n     Reserve Officers Training Corps cadet at Clemson Agricultural \n     College from 1919-1923. He was appointed an officer in the \n     United States Army Reserve, at the rank of 2nd Lieutenant, on \n     January 9, 1924, and received the rank advancement to 1st \n     Lieutenant on August 9, 1927. He enlisted in the army, \n     shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on \n     December 11, 1941. However, he did not actually enter the \n     service until April 17, 1942. He performed various military \n     duties with the Military Police, as Captain, in the United \n     States until October 26, 1943, when he was assigned to the \n     Civil Affairs Division (Section G-5) of the headquarters, \n     First Army, as Major and Lt. Colonel, which was formed on \n     October 23, 1943. He worked in the European (England, France, \n     Belgium, and Germany) and Pacific (Philippines and Japan) \n     theaters, and participated in the Normandy Invasion with the \n     Eighty-second Airborne Division. Thurmond was awarded five \n     battles stars, eighteen decorations, medals and awards, \n     including the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the \n     Bronze Star with ``V'' device, the Purple Heart, and the \n     French Croix de Guerre. He took official leave on October 19, \n     1945 to return to the South Carolina Circuit Court and was \n     officially discharged on January 20, 1946, with the rank of \n     Lieutenant Colonel. He then joined the U.S. Army Reserve \n     Corps and also became involved with the Reserve Officers \n     Association and the Military Government Association. Thurmond \n     served as the National Vice-President (July, 1953-June, 1954) \n     and President (June, 1954-July, 1955) of the Reserve Officers \n     Association and the President (December, 1957--c. December, \n     1958) of the Military Government Association. Thurmond \n     retired at the rank of Major General of the Army Reserves on \n     November 22, 1964, after forty years of service in the armed \n     forces.\n       Strom Thurmond served with the Civil Affairs Division \n     (Section G-5) of the First Army Headquarters during World War \n     II. The division's mission was to occupy, govern, and help \n     restore devastated, war-torn countries and their economies, \n     and usually arrived during large-scale combat operations. \n     Thurmond studied and used various military school instruction \n     material, i.e., military police, legal, G-5, European \n     geography and history, etc. in connection with his civil \n     affairs/military government training and responsibilities. \n     This material covered numerous directives and rules dealing \n     with civilians, displaced persons, welfare, finance, \n     background in formation on Germany and France, etc. Of \n     interest, and further study, is a report discussing the \n     activities of the First Army Civil Affairs Division during \n     the D-Day Invasion titled, Civil Affairs: Soldiers Become \n     Governors, by Harry L. Coles and Albert K. Weinberg and was \n     published by the Office of the Chief of Military History, \n     Department of the Army, Washington, DC: GPO, 1964 (SuDoc \n     number D114.7:C49).\n       From 1946 to 1959 Thurmond used the civil affairs/military \n     government training material and manuals he collected, along \n     with prior experience and knowledge, as he taught basic and \n     advanced officer courses to officers of the 352nd and 360th \n     Military Government Area Headquarters Units.\n       From 1948 to 1958 Thurmond was involved with the Reserve \n     Officers Association and the Military Government Association \n     in leadership capacities. In particular, Thurmond served as \n     President of the South Carolina Department of the Reserve \n     Officers Association and as the organization's National \n     President and Vice-President, and as the National President \n     of the Military Government Association, mentioned above.\n       On January 15, 1948, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, \n     Lieutenant Colonel Strom Thurmond was promoted to the rank of \n     Colonel in the United States Army Reserves (USAR). On \n     February 20, 1955, at Third Army Headquarters, Fort \n     McPherson, Georgia, Colonel Thurmond was promoted to the rank \n     of Brigadier General in the USAR by General A.R. Bolling. And \n     on April 25, 1960, at the Pentagon in Washington, DC, \n     Brigadier General Thurmond was promoted to the rank of Major \n     General in the USAR by General R.V. Lee, United States Army \n     Adjutant General, witnessed by Secretary of the Army Wilber \n     M. Brucker.\n       Senator Strom Thurmond (D-SC), as Colonel in the USAR, \n     organized the 360th Military Government Area Headquarters \n     (MGAH) Unit on October 1, 1950, and commanded it from that \n     date until January 3, 1954. During the four years Colonel \n     Thurmond commanded the 360th MGAH he received various \n     commendations including a superior rating by the South \n     Carolina Military District Headquarters, 3rd Army \n     Headquarters, and Army Inspectors from Washington, DC, rated \n     his the top reserve unit in 3rd Army area.\n       During the last two weeks of October 1956, Senator \n     Thurmond, as Brigadier General in the USAR, accompanied the \n     Assistant Secretary of Defense, Carter L. Burgess, on an \n     inspection tour of the Far East. Secretary Burgess, was \n     traveling in dual capacity as Assistant Secretary of Defense \n     and Vice-Chairman of the Defense Advisory Committee on \n     Professional and Technical Compensation, as a part of the \n     Gordiner Committee. They visited Air Force and Army personnel \n     on bases in Alaska, Japan, Okinawa, and Korea. Senator \n     Thurmond made a special point of greeting all servicemen & \n     women from South Carolina during his visits to each base.\n       The last two weeks of September 1957, Senator Strom \n     Thurmond, as Brigadier General in the USAR, and Congressman \n     LeRoy H. Anderson (D-MT), as Major General in the USAR, \n     during their active tours of duty, visited Air Force and Army \n     personnel at bases in France, Germany, and Italy. Again, \n     Senator Thurmond made an effort to visit with servicemen & \n     women from South Carolina.\n       From October 25 to November 7, 1959, Senator Strom \n     Thurmond, as Brigadier General in the USAR, attended a two-\n     week senior officer's course at the US Army Command & General \n     Staff College in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.\n       In November 1962, Senator Thurmond, as a Major General in \n     the USAR, toured US, German and Pakistani bases in Germany \n     and Pakistan with other member of the Congressional Command & \n     Operations Group consisting of member of Congress and their \n     congressional aids. Senator Ralph W. Yarborough (D-TX), a \n     Colonel in the USAR, was a member of the group as was Captain \n     Harry S. Dent, Senator Thurmond's Administrative Assistant.\n       In January 1964, Senator Thurmond, as a Major General in \n     the USAR, was one of the 84 students enrolled in the Special \n     Warfare School's Senior Officers Counterinsurgency & Special \n     Warfare Orientation Course at Fort Bragg, North Carolina \n     where he viewed various demonstrations and presentations \n     including scuba diving.\n       And in November 1964, prior to his retirement from the \n     military, Major General Thurmond, again with members of the \n     USAR Congressional Command & Operations Group, consisting of \n     members of congress and their congressional aids, visited \n     elements of the Southern European Task Force in Italy. The \n     purpose of the visit was to become familiar with the \n     organization and mission of the bi-national command. During \n     the latter part of his trip with the active duty group Major \n     General Thurmond also toured Wheelus Field in Libya.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 19, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas E. White,\n     Secretary of the Army, 101 Army Pentagon, Room 3E700, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: The Honorable Strom Thurmond has \n     established an unparalleled record of public service during \n     his almost 48 years in the United States Senate.\n       For the past 29 years, it has been my privilege to serve as \n     a colleague of Senator Thurmond's. During that time, his \n     leadership, dedication, and integrity have served as a source \n     of personal inspiration.\n       As Strom will soon be retiring from the Senate, I expect \n     there to be a number of tributes and dedications honoring \n     various aspects of his unprecedented service to our country. \n     I would like to ensure that his 36 years of dedicated service \n     to the United States Army are also recognized in an \n     appropriate manner.\n       As you are probably aware, Strom's remarkable record of \n     service to the Army began in 1924 when he was commissioned a \n     Second Lieutenant in the Infantry. An Army Reserve First \n     Lieutenant on the eve of World War II, Strom volunteered for \n     an active Army commission on the day the United States \n     entered the war against Germany (in spite of the fact that \n     his duties as a South Carolina Circuit Judge exempted him \n     from deployment). After receiving his commission, Lt. \n     Thurmond became a member of the First U.S. Army where he \n     would subsequently be attached to Fort Bragg's own 82nd \n     Airborne Division for the Invasion of Normandy. It was during \n     that operation that he sustained an injury that led to the \n     eventual award of a Purple Heart.\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\n       As a gesture of our country's gratitude for his remarkable \n     military and public careers and as an inspiration to the \n     soldiers who will pass through it in defense of our nation, I \n     request that the Army dedicate the soon to be completed 82nd \n     Airborne Division Deployment Staging Complex adjacent to Pope \n     Air Force Base's Green Ramp as the ``Major General Strom \n     Thurmond Airborne Operations Center.''\n       So dedicating this premier facility, designed by the Army \n     and the Air Force to ensure that Fort Bragg and Pope AFB will \n     function as the Army's leading Power Projection Platform for \n     many years to come, will serve as both an appropriate tribute \n     to Strom Thurmond's immeasurable contributions in service to \n     our country and as an inspiration to the courageous young men \n     and women who have committed their lives to the security of \n     our nation.\n       Mr. Secretary, I will appreciate your expeditious \n     consideration of my proposal as I am told that the facility \n     is expected to open in July.

Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the \nTaiwanese people in celebrating the 91st National Day of the Republic \nof China on October 10, 2002.\n  Taiwan is, and has been, a loyal ally and trading partner in Asia. \nIts people participate and fully subscribe to the principles of freedom \nand democracy. The Taiwanese people have worked with the United States \non issues ranging from endangered species, trademark infringements to \nglobal terrorism. They look to us for cooperation, guidance and \nprotection.\n  President Bush will soon be meeting with PRC President Jiang Zemin in \nthe United States. I ask my colleagues to join with me in urging \nPresident Bush not to enter into any agreement which would restrict \nTaiwan or compromise its growing democracy. Better relations with the \nPRC must not come at the expense of the 23 million people on Taiwan, \nwho must depend on America to defend their interests.\n  I am, however, pleased to see that on September 26 Congress passed \nthe Foreign Relations Authorization Act which contains a few Taiwan-\nfriendly clauses. While the act is not legally binding, this is a \ngoodwill gesture towards Taiwan by the United States. It is apparent \nthat Congress has reached a consensus that ``the Taiwan Strait issue \nmust be peaceful and must include the assent of the people of Taiwan.'' \nI totally agree with many of my colleagues that as long as the PRC has \nnot renounced the use of force against Taiwan, we must continue to help \nTaiwan defend itself by selling submarines, patrol aircraft, and \nadvanced destroyers to Taiwan. In addition, the PRC must be left with \nno doubt that we will provide military support to Taiwan if it is \nattacked. In fact, the PRC's military buildup in recent years has made \nit not only a threat to Taiwan but to other neighboring Asian countries \nas well.\n  Mr. President, the October 10 celebration should mark the continuance \nof the close cooperation in all areas between our two countries, as \nwell as the founding of a nation. Again, I congratulate Taiwan on the \noccasion of its National Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10111-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred on October \n20, 1999 in Barron, WI. A 22-year-old man was beaten to death with a \ntire iron because his assailants thought he was gay. The attacker, \nRaymond C. Welton, 33, lured the victim from a bar, then beat him while \nshouting anti-gay epithets, according to witnesses.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10111-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  CONGRATULATIONS TO KATHLEEN LEMMONS\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

BOYLE\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true military heroine who has honorably served our \ncountry for 25 years in the Air Force Nurse Corps: Col. Patricia E. \nBoyle. Colonel Boyle began her career as an intern and then staff nurse \nat Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio, TX. She quickly rose \nthrough the ranks and served at Air Force bases throughout the country, \nincluding Peterson Air Force Base, AFB CO, Vandenburg AFB, CA, Wright-\nPatterson AFB, OH, and Robins AFB, GA. In each assignment, she excelled \nand overcame every challenge, and was rewarded with greater \nresponsibilities and opportunities. Colonel Boyle has been recognized \nthroughout her career as a leader who could motivate others to give the \nbest they had to offer. Her talent for teaching and mentoring \npersonnel, as well as her creativity and skill in management were \ninstrumental in many of the successes the Air Force Medical Service \nenjoys today. Above all, she is a compassionate nurse who always put \nthe welfare of her patients first.\n  Colonel Boyle served with distinction as a fellow on my staff from \n1999 to 2000, and in this capacity greatly strengthened the acclaimed \nDepartment of Defense Tri-Service Nursing Research Program, among other \nhighly valuable efforts. In her follow-on assignment as director of \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nand Public Affairs in the Office of the Air Force Surgeon General, she \nworked tirelessly behind the scenes in the department of Defense to \nmake TRICARE for Life a reality for senior military retirees. The \nSurgeon General and his staff depended daily on her astute judgment and \nseasoned advice to meet the increasingly difficult challenges faced by \nour military departments today as they provide exemplary health care \naround the world in the 21st century. Colonel Boyle has made a \nsubstantial difference in the lives of our young troops and their \nfamilies everywhere, and has improved the lot of our retired military \npatriots who have sacrificed so much. She always went the extra mile to \nserve her country and her fellow man. Her performance reflects greatly \non herself, the U.S. Air Force, the Department of Defense, and the \nUnited States of America. I extend my deepest appreciation on behalf of \na grateful Nation for her dedicated service. Congratulations, Col. \nPatricia Boyle. I wish you Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10112-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HELEN VINCENT\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to set aside a few \nmoments today to reflect on the life of a remarkable Delawarean, Helen \nVincent, upon her passing at the age of 82. Helen was a good friend and \na woman who demonstrated tremendous courage and integrity. She was a \nwoman with a kind heart, diverse interests, great abilities, and \nboundless energy. In the way she lived her own life, Helen reminded \neach of us how good we can be.\n  In her 30 years in Newark, DE, Helen became a well- known political \nand civic activist who championed ethics and justice. She believed in \nthe democratic process and the value of honesty and integrity. A \nstaunch ally, she was a major figure in our successful efforts to clean \nup New Castle County politics. We are a better State and a stronger \nDemocratic Party because of her tireless efforts to infuse ethics into \npolitics and her refusal to be deterred.\n  Helen taught us all how to act responsibly, with vision and \ndetermination. She understood the inherent danger that comes from the \nsilence of good people. With her courage, she made it just a bit easier \nfor the rest of us to stand up and make our voices heard.\n  Like Helen, Lou Gehrig's disease works across boundaries, without \nregard to racial, ethnic or economic barriers. But while the disease \nseeks to weaken the body, it proved only to bolster Helen's spirit and \nresolve. In life, and in facing death, Helen Vincent exemplified grace \nand grit.\n  In the face of adversity, Helen seemed to always prevail. Even now, \nas we reflect on her life, she seems somehow to have triumphed again.\n  Helen's legacy will live on in the lives of those she helped to \nshape, in the halls of the institutions she served, and in the hearts \nof those of us who were lucky enough to call her their friend. She \nbelieved that we could all do a bit better, and inspired us to do just \nthat.\n  So I rise today to commemorate Helen, to celebrate her life, and to \noffer her family our support. Helen truly embodied the best of \nDelaware. She will be sorely missed by all Delawareans who cherish \nhonesty and integrity and who are committed to playing by the \nrules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10112-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in \nrecognition of October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n  Domestic violence continues to be one of the silent tragedies in our \nsociety. Because this topic can be uncomfortable to talk about, many \npeople choose to ignore it hoping that it will just go away. This is an \nunfortunate and, ultimately, harmful response.\n  Uncomfortable as it may be, we have to recognize that domestic \nviolence occurs far too often and it will continue to occur if we, as a \nsociety, fail to take appropriate measures to stop it. We can't know \nhow many occurrences of domestic abuse take place every year because so \nmany of them go unreported. However, estimates range from just under a \nmillion to as many as 3 million cases each year.\n  While this is a staggeringly high number, it represents only one \nstage in the cycle of abuse that will not end on its own. You see, the \nwomen who are abused in these relationships are not the only victims, \nin the vast majority of these cases, the woman is not the only one who \nis affected; the children in these families are also victimized.\n  A man who physically abuses his partner is likely to physically abuse \nhis children as well. But the abuse doesn't have to be physical for it \nto have a devastating and far-reaching impact. Simply witnessing this \nkind of abuse begins a cycle of violence that is often passed on from \none generation to the next.\n  We, as a society, have to do better to create an atmosphere in which \nabused women and children can escape from the abusive relationship. \nWhile we have not yet succeeded in addressing this scourge on our \nsociety, we have taken some important steps.\n  Passage of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was an important \nstep that has done much to address the problem. A number of other laws \nat both the Federal and State levels to prevent domestic abuse and \npunish those who abuse their domestic partners have been enacted over \nthe years.\n  There are steps being taken to combat domestic violence all over the \ncountry at the local levels as well. In my own State of New Mexico, the \nDona Ana County Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Task Force has \nrecently reconvened. This group, made up representatives from the law \nenforcement community, the criminal justice system, the religious \ncommunity, and those in the social services, is charged with helping \nall victims of domestic violence and sexual violence.\n  In Santa Fe, NM, the Rape Crisis Center will break ground later this \nmonth on a new facility. While I am saddened that we have such a need \nfor this facility, I am pleased to have had a part in making the center \na reality by securing $1 million in the fiscal year 2002 VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. I believe that it will provide a safe haven for \nthose who have no other way to escape the abuse they are living with.\n  While these are all important components in the fight against \ndomestic abuse, there is much that still has to be done.\n  We have an obligation to shine a spotlight on this dark secret. \nTaking this month to focus on this issue represents an important step \nin the fight against those who would terrorize their families.\n  It is my fervent hope that this step leads us to the day when no \nwoman or child has to live in fear in their own home. I remain \ncommitted to doing all I can to seeing that hope become \nreality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10112-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10112-S10113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THOMAS SEAY LAWSON\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

He was elected to \nthe first of five consecutive terms to the Alabama Supreme Court in \n1942.\n  Judge Lawson took a leave of absence from the Supreme Court to \nvolunteer for military service during World War II and served as a U.S. \nNavy officer aboard the U.S.S. Massachusetts, which was involved in \nmajor battles in the Pacific theater including Okinawa and Iwo Jima.\n  He also served for 38 years as a member of the University of Alabama \nboard of trustees and was president pro tem of the board for 10 years. \nHe was a member of the Alabama Academy of Honor. He was the grandson of \nThomas Seay, who served as Governor of Alabama from 1886 to 1890.\n  Judge Lawson earned his bachelor's degree from Davidson College and \nwas a graduate of the University of Alabama Law School. The university \nconferred upon him a Doctor of Humane Letters degree and Davidson \nCollege awarded him its Alumni Citation for Accomplishments in the \nField of Law.\n  He was a member of the Alabama Academy of Honor, Omicron Delta Kappa, \nSigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi Delta Phi, and a honorary member of Omicron \nKappa Upsilon. He also served as a\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\ncommissioner of the National Commission of Digestive Diseases of the \nNational Institute of Health. He was the first president of the Alabama \nLaw School Foundation.\n  Judge Lawson is survived by his wife Kathleen, his son Thomas Seay \nLawson, Jr., his daughter Jule, and many grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren.\n  Judge Lawson was a good friend, a patriarch of his community, a great \nleader of the State of Alabama, and a much-beloved family man. He will \nbe greatly missed by many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10113-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PETTUS RANDALL\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear friend, H. Pettus Randall III, of Tuscaloosa, AL. Pettus Randall \ndied on Saturday, September 7, at the age of 57.\n  Pettus was a native of Tuscaloosa, AL and attended the University of \nAlabama where he received bachelor's degrees in English and history. He \nattended New York University's Graduate School of Business and \ncompleted his law degree at the University of Alabama in 1971.\n  Following the death of his father, Henry Pettus Randall Jr., in 1976, \nPettus took over the publishing company that his father had started in \n1934. Pettus grew Randall Publishing Company from a $1 million a year \ncompany into the $70 million a year nationwide operation it is today. \nRandall Publishing Company employs more than 600 workers in 20 States \nand is one of the largest publishers in construction and trucking. It \nis among the 20 largest privately held U.S. publishing companies and \nwas rated the sixth-fastest-growing publishing companies in the United \nStates.\n  Under Pettus' management, Randall Publishing Company employees were \namong the first in the Nation to have 401(k) benefits and, as Randall \nPublishing Company grew, the growth of equity was shared with each \nemployee.\n  In the summer of 2000, I had the honor of introducing then-Governor \nGeorge W. Bush to Pettus at an event at Randall Publishing Company.\n  Pettus served as president of the West Alabama Chamber of Commerce \nand the Greater Tuscaloosa Kiwanis Club. He chaired State campaigns for \nthe Cancer Society and Christ Episcopal Church in Tuscaloosa. He worked \nwith United Way, Tuscaloosa Boys and Girls Clubs, March of Dimes and \nthe Tuscaloosa Association of Retarded Citizens.\n  Pettus and his wife, Catherine were recognized this year by the \nAlexis de Tocqueville Society for their contributions to the quality of \nlife in west Alabama. In May, he received the west Alabama Chamber's \nlifetime achievement award and was named Tuscaloosa County's citizen of \nthe year.\n  Pettus also found time to raise a family. He and Catherine raised \nthree exceptional children. Their daughter Jaynie Rogers attends an MBA \nprogram at Harvard. Their daughter Kate is a graduate of both \nVanderbilt and Cambridge Universities, and is about to join an \ninvestment management firm in Los Angeles. Their son Pettus IV attends \nPrinceton University.\n  Pettus Randall was a good friend, a patriarch of the Tuscaloosa \ncommunity, and a much-beloved family man.

A bill to encourage the establishment of Johnny Michael \nSpann Patriot Trusts; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Johnny \nMichael Spann Patriot Trusts Act. Members of the United States \nmilitary, CIA personnel, FBI personnel, and other Federal employees \ndefend the freedom and security of our Nation each day, often at high \nrisk to their own safety, and sometimes at the cost of their own lives. \nThis bill will help facilitate the flow of private charitable money to \nthe widows and orphans of our American servicemen, CIA officers, FBI \nagents, and other Federal employees who give their lives in the War on \nTerrorism.\n  In the days following the terrorist attacks of September 11, we \npassed the Victims Compensation Fund of 2001 to provide compensation to \nthe victims of those attacks. The September 11 Fund only covers those \nwho were injured or killed on September 11 as a result of the September \n11 attacks. It is estimated that the September 11 Fund will provide the \nfamilies of the September 11 victims with an average of $1.85 million \neach.\n  The September 11 Fund, however, does not cover military or government \npersonnel who have been killed while fighting against terrorists in the \nnew War on Terrorism after September 11, 2001. For example, it does not \ncover Alabama native Johnny Michael Spann and his family. CIA officer \nJohnny Michael Spann was the first American to give his life for his \ncountry in the War on Terrorism launched by President George W. Bush \nfollowing the September 11 terrorist attacks. Because individuals like \nMr. Spann are not included in the fund, their beneficiaries will \nreceive far less than the $1.85 million that the beneficiaries of the \nSeptember 11 fund will receive. Instead, family members of our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines killed in action while fighting \nterrorists will receive only relatively minor benefits currently $6,000 \nplus a small monthly payment. If the military man or women had \npurchased life insurance, the most the family can hope to receive is \n$250,000. CIA and FBI benefits are somewhat better, but still do not \napproach the $1.85 million mark. Now is the time to remedy this \ninequity and to meet the responsibility of taking care of the families \nof the military and government personnel who give their lives defending \nus from terrorism.\n  So today, I offer this bill to narrow the gap in the current \ncompensation system. This bill will facilitate and encourage private \ncharitable giving for the benefit of spouses and dependents of \nmilitary, CIA, FBI, and other Federal employees killed in the line of \nduty while combating terrorism. The bill will use no government monies \nand will not affect the September 11 Fund. Instead, the bill will allow \nprivate monies to fill in the gap.\n  If a Section 501(c)(3) charity meets the requirements of the bill, it \ncan designate itself as a ``Johnny Michael Spann Patriot Trust.'' The \nrequirements are: 1. Beneficiaries--The trust must benefit government \nemployees or contractors whose death occur in the line of duty and \narise out of terrorist attacks, military operations, intelligence \noperations, law enforcement operations, or accidents connected with \nactivities occurring after September 11, 2001, and related to domestic \nor foreign efforts to curb international terrorism, including the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force that we passed last year.\n  2. Tax Rules--The trust must qualify under existing tax rules for \ncharitable trusts or private foundations. Thus, contributions to the \nfund will be tax deductible.\n  3. Distrubutions--The trust must distribute at least eighty-five \npercent of funds collected to beneficiaries. Thus, administrative \nexpenses can be no more than fifteen percent, after the initial \norganizing expenses are made.\n  4. Audit--If contributions to the trust exceed $1 million, it must be \naudited by an independent certified public accountant.\n  5. McCain-Feingold--The trust must comply with the existing exemption \nin the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law for charities.\n  Once a trust meets the requirements, it will be entitled to two key \nbenefits. First, the Secretary of Defense will be authorized to contact \nthe Patriot Trusts on behalf of surviving spouses, thus eliminating the \nindignity widows often face when they are forced to go to a charity and \nask for money.\n  Second, the bill will ensure that federally elected officials can \nraise money for Patriot Trusts without any problem under the McCain-\nFeingold campaign finance law. This encouragement of Senators and \nCongressmen to raise money for the families of slain military, CIA, or \nFBI personnel should help build real resources to help families with \nreal needs.\n  Overall, this bill will help private charities provide a level \nplaying field for those who give their lives for our freedom and \nsecurity. It will address the current inequity between those who died \nin their office and those who died on the battle field defending \nAmerica, and it will seek a fair and patriotic way for charities to \nrecognize those who died defending their country against terrorism.\n  Who among us can look into the eyes of the widow of a soldier who \nlost his life fighting for his country and say, ``Sorry, you only get \n$6,000, but the widow of the securities broker in New York gets almost \n$2 Million.'' This bill takes a modest step toward ensuring fair and \nequitable treatment to all of those making the ultimate sacrifice, \ngiving their lives to protect the United States and her citizens \nagainst terrorists around the world.\n  It is our moral duty and obligation to assist these service members \nand federal employees who are giving their lives in service to our \ncountry. Helping charities fill the gap is the least that we can do.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Sessions and \nNickles in introducing the Johnny Michael Spann Patriot Trusts Act. \nThis legislation will facilitate private charitable giving for the \nbenefit of spouses of servicemen and other Federal employees who are \nkilled in the line of duty while engaged in the fight against \ninternational terrorism.\n  Many of us have fought for some time to achieve fair and expeditious \ncompensation for victims of terrorism. In 1996, we passed the Justice \nfor Victims of Terrorism Act, which authorized grants to states to \nprovide assistance and compensation to victims of terrorism. Two years \nago, we passed legislation directing the Justice Department to \nestablish a Federal compensation program for victims of international \nterrorism. And last year, in the wake of the September 11 attacks, we \nestablished a special fund to provide compensation to the many families \nwho lost loved ones on that terrible day.\n  I am proud of these legislative accomplishments. We should make every \neffort to help the innocent civilians whose lives are shattered by \nterrorist acts. At the same time, we must not forget those who are \nkilled while serving on the front line in the war on terrorism. Under \ncurrent law, beneficiaries of members of the U.S. Armed Forces get paid \n$6,000 only in death benefits from the Government, over any insurance \nthat they may have purchased. Moreover, these individuals may not be \neligible for payments from any existing victims' compensation program \nor charitable organization.\n  The Johnny Michael Spann Patriot Trusts Act will provide much needed \nsupport for the families of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor their country. The bill encourages the creation of charitable \ntrusts for the benefit of surviving spouses and dependents of military, \nCIA, FBI, and other Federal Government employees who are killed in \noperations or activities to curb international terrorism. In addition, \nthe bill authorizes Federal officials to contact qualifying trusts on \nbehalf of surviving spouses and dependents, pursuant to regulations to \nbe prescribed by the Secretary of Defense. This will help to inform \nsurvivors about benefits and to ensure that those who are eligible have \nthe opportunity to access the money. It will also spare grieving widows \nthe embarrassment of having to go to a charity and ask for money. \nFinally, for the avoidance of doubt, the bill makes clear that federal \nofficeholders and candidates may help raise funds for qualifying trusts \nwithout running afoul of Federal campaign finance laws.\n  While we have greatly improved our victims assistance and \ncompensation programs, we still have more to do. I urge my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to join in advancing this legislation \nthrough Congress before the end of the year.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on behalf \nof myself and Senator Allen to authorize the President to apply the \nindemnification authorities now available to the Department of Defense \nand other agencies for national defense purposes to those agencies \nengaged in defending our Nation against terrorism. This authority is \nneeded to enable America to access the best private sector solutions to \ndefend our homeland, particularly\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\nfrom those innovative small businesses who do not have the capital to \nshoulder significant liability risk.\n  There is an urgent need for this authority. For example, contractors \nwill not sell chemical and biological detectors already available to \nDOD to other Federal agencies and state and local authorities because \nof the liability risk. Some of our Nation's top defense contractors \nwill not sell these products because they are afraid to risk the future \nof their company on a lawsuit. In the meantime the American people are \nvulnerable. We should give the President the option that he currently \ndoes not have, of deciding whether the Federal Government should \nfacilitate these purchases. This legislation would do precisely that.\n  This liability risk has been a longstanding deterrent to the private \nsector freely contracting with the Federal Government to meet national \nsecurity needs. Congress has acted in the past to authorize the \nindemnification of contracts, particularly in times of war. On December \n18, 1941, less than two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the \nCongress enacted Title II of the First War Powers Act of 1941. By \nproviding authority to the President to indemnify contracts, this \nlegislation and its successor have enabled the private sector to enter \ninto contracts that involve a substantial liability risk. \nAdministrations since Roosevelt's day have used these authorities to \nindemnify or share the risk with defense contractors. This was required \nto jump start the ``arsenal of democracy'' in 1941. It was true in \n1958, when the nuclear and missile programs were facilitated by the \nindemnification of risks associated with the use of nuclear power and \nhighly volatile missile fuels. it is true today for technology \nsolutions required by agencies engaged in the war against terrorism.\n  This war is going to be different in many ways. For one, much of the \nNation's homeland defense activities are going to be conducted by State \nand local governments. It is thus imperative to ensure that State and \nlocal governments can access vital anti-terrorism technologies.\n  To facilitate this, this bill would require the establishment of a \nFederal contracting vehicle to which state and local governments could \nturn to rapidly buy anti-terrorism solutions from the Federal \nGovernment. The President would also be authorized, if he deemed it \nnecessary, to indemnify these purchases.\n  I want to emphasize two points. One, that this authority is \ndiscretionary. The President, on a case by case basis will decide \nwhether to indemnify contracts. I expect the President will use this \nauthority much like it has been used at the Defense Department, \ncarefully and thoughtfully, and only for those products that the \ngovernment cannot obtain without the use of the authority.\n  The second point I want to emphasize is that indemnification not in \nconflict with any efforts to limit or cap liability. I see these two \nefforts as complimentary. This legislation should not be seen as an \nalternative for tort reform, but merely as one tool that can be used by \nthe President to ensure that vitally needed technologies necessary for \nhomeland defense are placed into the hands of those who need them.\n  During World War II and all subsequent wars, conflicts and \nemergencies in which the U.S. has been involved, we have needed \ndomestic contractors to be innovative, resourceful and ready to support \nefforts at home and abroad. In 1941, the Congress wanted contractors to \nknow that if they were willing to engage in unusually hazardous \nactivities for the national defense, then the U.S. Government would \naddress the potential liability exposure associated with the conduct of \nsuch activities. Our position should be no different now.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 3079. A bill to authorize the issuance of immigrant visas to, and \nthe admission to the United States for permanent residence of, certain \nscientists, engineers, and technicians who have worked in Iraqi weapons \nof mass destruction programs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, last night the President of the United \nStates said something very important about United Nations inspections \nin Iraq. He said:\n\n       Clearly, to actually work, any new inspections. . .will \n     have to be very different. . . . To ensure that we learn the \n     truth, the regime must allow witnesses to its illegal \n     activities to be interviewed outside the country, and these \n     witnesses must be free to bring their families with them so \n     they are all beyond the reach of Saddam Hussein's terror and \n     murder. And inspectors must have access to any site, at any \n     time, without pre-clearance, without delay, without \n     exceptions.\n\n  The President is right on the money about the inspections. This is \nhow to get the information the world needs on Saddam Hussein's weapons \nof mass destruction programs. But how is the U.N. to do that?\n  Where will those weapons scientists and their families go, once \nthey've told the truth about Saddam's weapons programs? They can't go \nhome again. And at least in the short run, there will be no safe haven \nin the region for the people who reveal Saddam's most terrible secrets.\n  So where will those scientists go? Maybe some can go to Europe, \nalthough both al Qaeda cells and Saddam's agents have operated there. \nMaybe some can go to Canada, or to South America.\n  But if the United States wants the world to show resolve in dealing \nwith Saddam Hussein, then we should show the way by taking the lead in \nadmitting those Iraqis who have the courage to betray Saddam's nuclear, \nchemical and biological weapons programs.\n  We have a large country in which to absorb those people, and, for all \nour problems, we have the best law enforcement and security apparatus \nto guard them.\n  What we do not have is an immigration system that readily admits \nlarge numbers of persons who have a recent involvement with weapons of \nmass destruction, have recently aided a country in the so-called ``axis \nof evil,'' and are bringing their families.\n  I am introducing today, therefore, legislation to admit to our \ncountry those Iraqi scientists, engineers and technicians, and their \nfamilies, who give reliable information on Saddam's programs to us, to \nthe United Nations, or to the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  My esteemed colleague on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania, joins me in introducing this legislation, and I am very \npleased to have his support. This bill is not political. Rather, it is \na bipartisan effort to help the President succeed in forcing Iraq to \ndestroy all its weapons of mass destruction capabilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Why? Because those \nIraqis will deserve our protection. And equally important, because they \nwill not come forward unless we offer that protection.\n  Charles Duelfer, former Deputy Executive Director of UNSCOM, the \noriginal U.N. inspection force in Iraq, recently wrote an article \nentitled, ``The Inevitable Failure of Inspections in Iraq.'' He made \nthe following recommendations: First, inspectors should be mandated to \ninterview the few hundred key scientists, engineers, and technicians \nwho were involved in the previous weapons of mass destruction efforts \nand have them account for their activities since December 1998. The \nU.N. knows who these individuals are. If, as is suspected, Iraq has \nbeen continuing to develop weapons of mass destruction, some or most of \nthese people will have been involved.\n  Second, the conditions for such interviews must be changed. Iraqi \ngovernment observers must not be present. the previous UNSCOM agreement \nto the presence of such ``minders'' was a mistake. The fact that junior \nworkers would shake with fear at the prospect of answering a question \nin a way inconsistent with government direction made this obvious.\n  Third, and most important, the U.N. should offer sanctuary or safe \nhaven to those who find it a condition for speaking the truth. The \npeople are key to these programs. Access to the people under conditions \nwhere they could speak freely was not something UNSCOM ever achieved \nexcept in the rare instances of defection.\n  Mr. Duelfer concludes: I often summarized this problem to Washington \nby suggesting that, if UNSCOM had 100 green cards to distribute during \ninspections, it could have quickly accounted for the weapons programs.\n  Other experts, including Dr. Khidir Hamza, a former Iraqi nuclear \nweapons\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nscientist who testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \non July 27, have pointed out that by enticing scientists and engineers \naway from Iraq, we will also deprive Saddam Hussein of the very people \nhe needs to produce those weapons of mass destruction and long-range \nmissiles.\n  If we do, in the end, have to go to war against Saddam, then the \nfewer weapons scientists he has, the better.\n  Current law includes several means of either paroling non-immigrants \ninto the United States or admitting people for permanent residence, \nnotwithstanding their normal inadmissibility under the law.\n  These are very limited provisions, however, and they will not suffice \nto accommodate hundreds of Iraqi scientists and their families.\n  The legislation that I am introducing, the ``Iraqi Scientists \nLiberation Act of 2002,'' will permit the Secretary of State and the \nAttorney General, acting jointly and on a case-by-case basis, to admit \na foreigner and his family for permanent residence if such person: is a \nscientist, engineer, or technician who has worked in an Iraqi program \nto produce weapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver them, \nduring the years since the inspectors left and Saddam began rebuilding \nthose programs; is willing to supply or has supplied reliable \ninformation on that program to UNMOVIC, to the IAEA, or to an agency of \nthe United State Government; and will be or has been placed in danger \nas a result of providing such information.\n  The Attorney General will be empowered to set the rules and \nregulations governing implementation of this law, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of State and other relevant officials.\n  Finally, this legislation will be limited to the admission of 500 \nscientists, plus their families, over 3 years. If it works and we need \nto enlarge the program, we can do so.\n  The important thing for now is to give our country the initial \nauthority, and to give United Nations inspectors the ability to call on \nus when one of Saddam's nuclear, chemical or biological weapons experts \nis willing to help the world to bring those programs down.\n  It is hard to predict what we will achieve by opening our doors. Iraq \nwill surely object to giving UNMOVIC the inspection and interview \npowers that the President proposes. But if UNMOVIC does get into Iraq \nunder a stronger Security Council resolution in the coming weeks, then \nhaving this law on the books could help to undermine Saddam Hussein's \nweapons of mass destruction programs.\n  Even if inspectors never get in, a public offer of asylum for Iraq's \nscientists could lead some to defect, as Dr. Hamza did.\n  Last night the President called for inspections that protect the \nlives of those who are interviewed and their families.\n  We owe it to the President to do all we can to make that possible.\n  We owe it to the United Nations inspectors to give them every chance \nto succeed.\n  We owe to it Iraq's people and its neighbors to do everything we can \nto dismantle its weapons of mass destruction programs.\n  And we owe it to our own people to do all we can to achieve that end \npeacefully, and with international support.\n  This bill is a small step toward those ends, but it is a vital one. I \nurge my colleagues to give it their immediate attention and their \nconsidered support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my bill appear \nfollowing my remarks in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3079\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be known as the ``Iraqi Scientists Liberation \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President stated in substance the following to the \n     United Nations General Assembly:\n       (A) In 1991, the Iraqi regime agreed to destroy and stop \n     developing all weapons of mass destruction and long-range \n     missiles, and to prove to the world it has done so by \n     complying with rigorous inspections. Iraq has broken every \n     aspect of this fundamental pledge.\n       (B) Today, Iraq continues to withhold important information \n     about its nuclear program: weapons design, procurement logs, \n     experiment data, an accounting of nuclear materials, and \n     documentation of foreign assistance. Iraq's state-controlled \n     media has reported numerous meetings between Saddam Hussein \n     and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his \n     continued appetite for these weapons.\n       (C) Iraq also possesses a force of Scud-type missiles with \n     ranges greater than the 150 kilometers permitted by the \n     United Nations.\n       (2) United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) experts \n     concluded that Iraq's declarations on biological agents \n     vastly understated the extent of its program, and that Iraq \n     actually produced two to four times the amount of most \n     agents, including anthrax and botulinum toxin, than it had \n     declared.\n       (3) UNSCOM reported to the United Nations Security Council \n     in April 1995 that Iraq had concealed its biological weapons \n     program and had failed to account for 3 tons of growth \n     material for biological agents.\n       (4) Gaps identified by UNSCOM in Iraqi accounting and \n     current production capabilities strongly suggest that Iraq \n     maintains stockpiles of chemical agents, probably VX, sarin, \n     cyclosarin, and mustard.\n       (5) Iraq has not accounted for hundreds of tons of chemical \n     precursors and tens of thousands of unfilled munitions, \n     including Scud variant missile warheads.\n       (6) Iraq has not accounted for at least 15,000 artillery \n     rockets that in the past were its preferred vehicle for \n     delivering nerve agents, nor has it accounted for about 550 \n     artillery shells filled with mustard agent.\n       (7) For nearly 4 years, Iraq has been able to pursue its \n     weapons of mass destruction programs free of inspections.\n       (8) Inspections will fail if United Nations and \n     International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors do not have \n     speedy and complete access to any and all sites of interest \n     to them.\n       (9) Inspections will be much less effective if those \n     scientists, engineers, and technicians whom the inspectors \n     interview are monitored and subjected to pressure by agents \n     of Saddam Hussein's regime.\n       (10) As the President made clear in his speech to the \n     Nation on October 7, 2002, the most effective international \n     inspection of Iraq would include interviews with persons who \n     are unmonitored by Saddam Hussein's regime and who are \n     protected from it in return for providing reliable \n     information.\n       (11) The emigration from Iraq of key scientists, engineers, \n     and technicians could substantially disable Saddam Hussein's \n     programs to produce weapons of mass destruction and the means \n     to deliver them.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Iraq must give United Nations and International Atomic \n     Energy Agency inspectors speedy and complete access to any \n     and all sites of interest to them;\n       (2) United Nations and International Atomic Energy Agency \n     inspections in Iraq should include interviews with persons \n     who are unmonitored by Saddam Hussein's regime and who are \n     protected from it in return for providing reliable \n     information; and\n       (3) key scientists, engineers, and technicians in Saddam \n     Hussein's programs to produce weapons of mass destruction and \n     the means to deliver them should be encouraged to leave those \n     programs and provide information to governments and \n     international institutions that are committed to dismantling \n     those programs.\n\n     SEC. 4. ADMISSION OF CRITICAL ALIENS.\n\n       (a) Authority.--Notwithstanding the provisions of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), \n     whenever the Secretary of State and the Attorney General, \n     acting jointly, determine that the admission into the United \n     States of an alien described in subsection (b) is in the \n     public interest, the alien, and any member of the alien's \n     immediate family accompanying or following to join, shall be \n     eligible to receive an immigrant visa and to be admitted to \n     the United States for permanent residence.\n       (b) Eligibility.--An alien described in this subsection is \n     an alien who--\n       (1) is a scientist, engineer, or technician who has worked \n     at any time since December 16, 1998, in an Iraqi program to \n     produce weapons of mass destruction or the means to deliver \n     them;\n       (2) is in possession of critical reliable information \n     concerning any such Iraqi program;\n       (3) is willing to provide, or has provided, such \n     information to inspectors of the United Nations, inspectors \n     of the International Atomic Energy Agency, or any department, \n     agency, or other entity of the United States Government; and\n       (4) will be or has been placed in danger as a result of \n     providing such information.\n       (c) Limitation.--Not more than 500 principal aliens may be \n     admitted to the United States under subsection (a). The \n     limitation in this subsection does not apply to any immediate \n     family member accompanying or following to join a principal \n     alien.\n       (d) Expiration of Authority.--The authority granted in this \n     section shall expire 36 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULES AND REGULATIONS.\n\n       The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     State, is authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations \n     as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\n     SEC. 6. WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION DEFINED.\n\n       (a) In General.--In this Act, the term ``weapon of mass \n     destruction'' has the meaning given the term in section \n     1403(1) of the Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction \n     Act of 1996 (title XIV of Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2717; \n     50 U.S.C. 2302(1)), as amended by subsection (b).\n       (b) Technical Correction.--Section 1403(1)(B) of the \n     Defense Against Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 1996 \n     (title XIV of Public Law 104-201; 110 Stat. 2717; 50 U.S.C. \n     2302(1)(B)) is amended by striking ``a disease organism'' and \n     inserting ``a biological agent, toxin, or vector (as those \n     terms are defined in section 178 of title 18, United States \n     Code)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 3080. A bill to establish a national teaching fellowship program \nto encourage individuals to enter and remain in the field of teaching \nat public elementary schools and secondary schools; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Teaching \nFellows Act of 2002.\n  This year Congress passed, and the President signed into law the No \nChild Left Behind Act. This new law represents the most sweeping \nchanges to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, since it \nwas enacted in 1965. The Act underscores the importance of a good \neducation; it stresses the use of research-based teaching programs, \nincreases funds available to public schools, broadens local \nflexibility, and enhances accountability.\n  In focusing on these principles, we aim to change the way our schools \ndo business. This is important. While some schools are doing well, many \nare not. It is important that our low performing schools are given the \nassistance they need to improve, along with the knowledge that they \nwill be held accountable for turning themselves around and narrowing \nthe existing achievement gaps.\n  I have long championed the greater use of research-based programs in \ntroubled schools, specifically Comprehensive School Reform. Good reform \nprograms are a bargain for our schools and our children when we compare \ntheir costs to that of retention, special education and illiteracy.\n  However, I also realize that the best research-based programs cannot \nbe successfully implemented without a sufficient number of teachers in \nthe classroom. Statistics vary, but it is estimated that 1 million of \nthe Nation's 3 million teachers will retire in the next 5 years. \nSchools will need to hire over 2 million new teachers in the next \ndecade.\n  To help address this problem, my colleague Senator Bingaman and I are \nintroducing today the Teaching Fellows Act, legislation that aims to \nencourage the best and brightest to enter teaching.\n  The problem of teacher shortages is complex, and the problems States \nare experiencing in recruitment and retention vary. The bill we \nintroduce today encourages states to structure their scholarship \nprogram so that it addresses the individual needs of the State, and \nutilizes the best resources they have to offer.\n  Similar to the National Health Service Corps, selected students would \nreceive at least $6,500 per year toward college expenses, and in \nreturn, would incur an obligation to serve in an under-served area. In \nthis case, we require new teachers to teach five years in a low \nperforming public school.\n  The Teaching Fellows Act would set up a competitive process whereby \nstates could apply for matching, 75-25 percent, Federal grants to \nestablish or expand scholarship programs for prospective teachers. The \nproposal is based on one of the most successful teaching scholarship \nprograms in the Nation--that of State of North Carolina. There are two \nmain prongs to this act. The first is the teaching fellowship program, \nthis program would distribute grants to states for teaching \nscholarships that students could apply for after their senior year of \nhigh school or their second year of college. The bill also authorizes a \n``partnership program,'' aimed at community college students, \nparticularly those who are currently trained or training as teaching \nassistants. With encouragement, the hope is that these individuals \nmight go on to obtain four-year degrees to become licensed teachers. \nGrants would be available to states for partnership programs between \ncommunity colleges and four-year colleges to provide for the training.\n  Other approaches such as loan forgiveness programs and offering \nfederal stipends are important tools in our quest to recruit teachers. \nHowever, the strength of the Teacher Fellowship Act is the focus that \nwe place on the enrichment of these students. Qualifying States will \nhave developed programs that have designed a strong extra-curricular \nprogram that serves as a support system for new teachers.\n  It is estimated that up to 22 percent of new teaches leave within 3 \nyears--this figure is as high as 55 percent in urban or rural areas. \nNot only must we recruit more teachers, but we must encourage a more \ncomprehensive and supportive system of training.\n  Our bill is not a panacea to the problems of teacher recruitment and \nretention. However, I believe it is a step in the right direction. I \nhope that we will give more states and communities the incentive to \nwork with their institutions of higher education to more \ncomprehensively address the education of one our Nation's most \nimportant resources--that of teachers.\n  The successful education of our nation's children requires that we \nwork together at the Federal, State, and local levels to ensure that no \nchild is left behind.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my esteemed \ncolleague, Senator Lugar, in the introduction of the Teaching Fellows \nAct of 2002.\n  Earlier this year, the No Child Left Behind Act was signed into law. \nI was proud to be a member of the Conference Committee that ultimately \nwrote this important piece of legislation. This legislation includes \nimportant reform efforts and increased resources for schools that will \ngo a long way toward addressing many of the needs in our education \nsystem. I will continue to fight for increased appropriations for the \nprograms contained in this bipartisan legislation.\n  As we begin to consider reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, \nwe must continue to seek avenues for supporting our Nation's schools. \nProviding additional support for the training of new, high quality \nteachers is an important way to do that. Ultimately, improving the \nquality of education in our nation will require a comprehensive \napproach that includes raising standards and increasing school \naccountability. However, central to any effort to improve education are \nteachers. Being the son of two former teachers, I am well acquainted \nwith the challenges and the rewards that being a good teacher brings. \nBeing a parent and a community member, I also know how influential \nteachers can be in the lives of our children. Teachers not only pass \nalong knowledge and act as role models, but research shows that teacher \nquality is critical to student achievement.\n  Over the years, I have had the opportunity to meet with many of our \ndedicated and hard-working teachers in New Mexico. These personal \nexperiences have strengthened my belief that we need to do all that we \ncan to encourage the best and the brightest to enter and to remain in \nthis most important profession.\n  It is estimated that nearly a third of our Nation's teachers will \nretire over the next five years. In addition, large numbers of new \nteachers leave their jobs within a few years, particularly in rural and \nurban areas. These patterns could seriously jeopardize the quality of \nour children's education unless we take some steps to insure that there \nare enough trained people available to fill these positions. We must \nalso do what we can to support the preparation and training of these \nindividuals.\n  The Teaching Fellows Act would create two programs designed to \nencourage people to enter and to remain in the profession of teaching. \nFirst, the program would distribute grants to states for teaching \nscholarships. In return for at least $6,500 per year toward college \nexpenses, students would agree to teach in a low-performing school for \nfive years. This program would thus not only help teachers to prepare \nfor their profession but it would also insure that students in our \npoorest and most challenged schools have access to well-trained \nteachers.\n  Second, the bill would provide grants for individuals currently \nworking in\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\nour schools as instructional assistants or in other capacities to \nobtain four-year degrees to become licensed teachers. Grants would be \navailable to States for partnership programs between community colleges \nand four-year colleges to provide for this training. These programs \nrequire that states come up with 25 percent of the funding and students \nwill be required to stay in the state to teach for five years.\n  In conclusion, I would like to say that I am very excited about co-\nsponsoring a bill that seeks to recruit new teachers and to enrich \ntheir training experiences. Although this bill is only part of a larger \neffort to provide all American students with a quality education, it is \nan important component. Having well-qualified teachers available to \nteach, especially in the most impoverished districts, is something that \nwe owe to our children and ourselves. We, as parents and as \nlegislators, must do what we can to see that America's teachers are \nrecognized and supported as a crucial component in our children's \neducation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n           By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Snowe, \n             Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, \n             Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. \n             Thompson):\n  S.J. Res. 48. A joint resolution disapproving the rule submitted by \nthe Federal Election Commission under chapter 8 of title 5, United \nStates Code, relating to prohibited and excessive contributions; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution to \ndisapprove the Federal Election Commission's final regulations to \nimplement the title I soft money provisions of the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act, under the procedures established by the Congressional \nReview Act. The Commission's regulations, titled ``Prohibited and \nExcessive Contributions: Non-Federal Funds or Soft Money; Final Rule,'' \nwere published in the Federal Register on July 29, 2002, 67 FR 49064.\n  I wish I did not have to introduce this resolution. When President \nBush signed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 into law on \nMarch 27, 2002, the soft money campaign finance system should have met \nits demise. This system of unlimited soft money contributions to \nnational political parties, unlimited soft money fundraising by \nnational parties and Federal candidates and officeholders, and \nunlimited laundering of soft money into Federal elections by State \nparties had bred public cynicism about the workings of our institutions \nof government. At a minimum, the actions of Congress and the executive \nbranch were severely tainted by the specter of six-figure soft money \ndonations by special interests with a stake in legislation and policies \npending before the Federal Government.\n  Banning soft money wasn't an easy legislative or political endeavor. \nPowerful forces lined up to preserve a status quo that served them \nwell. But after a 7-year fight on Capitol Hill over campaign finance \nreform, Congress concluded that it could no longer abide the corruption \nand appearances of corruption caused by soft money. It sought \nfundamental change and a restoration of public confidence in our \ndemocracy by at last enacting the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n  Unfortunately, four unelected members of the Federal Election \nCommission thought they knew better. In writing rules to implement the \nparty and candidate soft money provisions of the new campaign finance \nlaw, these Commissioners proceeded to resurrect aspects of the soft \nmoney system that Congress had just banished. This exercise entailed \ngyrations of logic and rationalizations that flew squarely in the face \nof statutory language, legislative intent, and even interpretations of \nthe law urged by the Commission's own general counsel and professional \nstaff. At times during the soft money rulemaking process, this bloc of \nfour Commissioners appeared willfully blind to the language and purpose \nof the statute, as well as the Commission's own interpretive practices \nand precedents. Their actions were so brazen that one of the two \nCommissioners who voted to implement the law faithfully to Congress's \nintent told them, ``You have so tortured this law, it's beyond silly.''\n  The result was the adoption of agency regulations that undermine the \nthree fundamental components of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act: the \nprohibition on national parties' soliciting, directing, receiving, or \nspending soft money; the prohibition on Federal candidates' and \nofficeholders' soliciting, directing, receiving or spending soft money; \nand the prohibition on State parties' spending unregulated soft money \ndonations on activities affecting Federal elections. The loopholes \ncreated out of whole cloth by the Federal Election Commission operate \nseparately and in combination to permit the continuation of elements of \nthe soft money system.\n  While I will not today discuss each and every soft money regulation \nthat contradicts the statute and legislative intent, I will list some \nexamples of how four Commissioners substituted their own personal views \nfor the will of Congress--and left in their wake a campaign finance \nsystem too similar to the one we in this body set out to eliminate.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act states that national parties and \nFederal candidates or officeholders may not ``solicit'' or ``direct'' \nsoft money. These prohibitions on soliciting and directing soft money \nare critical to the integrity of our political system. The specter of \nnational parties soliciting six-figure donations from special interests \nwith a stake in legislation or policies pending before the executive or \nlegislative branches has tainted the decisions ultimately made on these \nmatters in Washington. Likewise, the soft money fundraising activities \nof Federal officeholders have led the public to suspect that those who \nserve in Congress or the White House are paying special heed to the \nwill of the wealthy few.\n  The new campaign finance law's prohibitions on soliciting and \ndirecting soft money are aimed precisely at this problem. As Senator \nCarl Levin, D-MI, said on the Senate floor on March 20, 2002, during \ndebate on the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act:\n\n       . . . [W]e have had enough of the solicitations by our \n     elected officials and the officers of our national parties, \n     soliciting huge sums of money by offering insider access to \n     government decisionmakers . . . Under this soft money ban, \n     public officials and candidates will be out of the soft money \n     fundraising business, and that's a very important step we \n     will be taking with this legislation. The official with \n     power, and the candidate seeking to be in a position of \n     power, won't be able to solicit huge sums of money and sell \n     access to themselves for their campaign or for outside groups \n     . . .'' (emphasis added).\n\n  The Federal Election Commission decided nonetheless to allow national \nparties and Federal officeholders to remain in the ``soft money \nfundraising business''--by adopting definitions of the terms ``to \nsolicit'' and ``to direct'' that invite widespread circumvention of the \nlaw.\n  To achieve this result, the Commissioners had to overrule the \nagency's own general counsel and professional staff. The draft final \nrules recommended to the Commissioners by the general counsel and \nprofessional staff appropriately defined ``to solicit'' as ``to request \nor suggest or recommend that another person make a contribution, \ndonation, or transfer of funds''--thus, a national party could not \nrequest, suggest or recommend that an individual or entity donate soft \nmoney. This definition was consistent with the Commission's \nlongstanding practice and understanding concerning what constitutes a \nsolicitation. As the Commission's associate general counsel explained \nto the Commissioners during the soft money rulemaking proceedings:\n\n       . . . the concept of solicitation is not something that is \n     new, in terms of the [Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of \n     2002]. It is something that has been in the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act for a very long time. It's been particularly \n     significant in terms of corporations and labor organizations, \n     in terms of the solicitations that they may do, and some of \n     the limitations on the frequency of their solicitations. With \n     that in mind, we do have a long history of advisory opinions, \n     and some very specific guidance in our campaign guides as to \n     what does and what does not constitute `to solicit.'\n       We based the definition that we came up with, with those \n     materials in mind, with the thought that just the common-\n     sense usage of the word, `solicit' would not mean something \n     different in the context of BCRA than what it has always \n     meant for purposes of the FECA. And we have looked at it \n     very broadly in the past, in terms of encouraging support \n     for, and providing information as to how to contribute, \n     and publicizing, the right to accept unsolicited \n     contributions from any lawful contributor. Those sorts of \n     factors. I think\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\n     it's an area of the law that's pretty clear and pretty \n     well-settled (emphasis added).\n\n  Putting aside the associate general counsel's explanation that the \nmeaning of ``to solicit'' is ``pretty clear and pretty well-settled'' \nin the law, four Commissioners apparently decided that a dramatic \nchange in course was somehow warranted with respect to implementing \nsoft money solicitation restrictions. A lame-duck, holdover \nCommissioner proposed an amendment during the rulemaking proceedings \nthat narrowed the definition of ``to solicit'' from ``to request or \nsuggest or recommend'' to ``to ask.'' In explaining this amendment, \nthat Commissioner repeatedly made it clear that he intended to narrow \nconsiderably the scope of the definition of ``to solicit'' contained in \nthe general counsel's draft, to eliminate the concepts of to ``suggest \nor recommend.''\n  The Commission's general counsel expressed strong reservations about \nthis amendment to narrow the definition of ``to solicit,'' stating the \nfollowing:\n\n       . . . [T]his is a pretty huge concept in the Act. You can't \n     solicit soft money. Certain actors can't solicit soft money \n     now under the law. And it doesn't seem to me to take a great \n     deal of cleverness to make a solicitation that is clearly \n     intended to encourage--to persuade a person to make a \n     contribution, without coming out and asking. And I think this \n     definition has the potential for great mischief . . . And I'm \n     concerned that this language creates a definition so narrow \n     that it would, frankly, be very easy to avoid.''\n\n  The Commissioner that offered the amendment narrowing the definition \nof ``to solicit'' replied, ``It indeed runs that risk.''\n  Despite the warnings of the Commission's general counsel, the \namendment was ultimately adopted. The result is to exclude all but the \nmost explicit ``asks'' for soft money from the new law's solicitation \nprohibitions. Because of this amendment, national parties and Federal \ncandidates and officeholders may ``recommend'' or ``suggest'' that a \ndonor contribute soft money. Far from being out of the soft money \nfundraising business, parties and candidates now stand to be in a more \nsubtle soft money fundraising business. That is hardly the fundamental \nchange in the campaign finance system that Senator Levin was discussing \non the Senate floor or that Congress as a whole sought in enacting the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act.\n  The Commission compounded the problem by essentially reading the \nprohibition on ``directing'' soft money out of the statute. The new \ncampaign finance law makes it illegal for national parties and Federal \nofficeholders or candidates not only to ``solicit'' soft money but also \nto ``direct'' soft money. The clear implication is that those terms are \nnot redundant. Specifically, ``to direct'' covers instances in which a \nnational party or Federal candidate suggests to whom an already willing \ncontributor should make a soft money donation, as opposed to initiating \nthe idea of the contribution, which amounts to a ``solicitation''.\n  The general counsel's draft properly assigned distinct meaning to the \nterm, ``to direct.'' It defined ``to direct'' as, ``to provide the name \nof a candidate, political committee or organization to a person who has \nexpressed an interest in making a contribution, donation, or transfers \nof funds to those who support the beliefs of goals of the contributor \nor donor . . .'' However, the same amendment that substantially \nnarrowed the definition of ``to solicit'' redefined ``to direct'' to \nmean, ``to ask a person who has expressed an intent to make a \ncontribution, donation, or transfer of funds, or to provide anything of \nvalue, to make that contribution, donation, or transfer of funds, or to \nprovide that thing of value.'' In other words, the Commission \nultimately defined ``to direct'' to mean nothing different from ``to \nsolicit.'' This will allow national parties and Federal officeholders \nto tell a willing donor where they should send their soft money--in \nviolation of the plain language of the statute.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act bans the receipt, solicitation, \ndirection, or spending of soft money not only by national party \ncommittees but also by any entities ``directly or indirectly \nestablished, financed, maintained or controlled'' by those party \ncommittees. This prohibits national party committees from spawning and \nin other respects significantly supporting ``shadow entities'' designed \nto carry on the raising and spending of soft money once those party \ncommittees can no longer accept soft money contributions themselves.\n  The soft money ban enacted by Congress will achieve its full effect \nonly if the Federal Election Commission applies it to all entities in \nfact ``directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or \ncontrolled'' by national party committees. If the Commission instead \nwillfully blinds itself to relevant information concerning a national \nparty's involvement with a given organization, the soft money ban could \nfall short of the coverage spelled out in the statute. Under that \nscenario, shadow entities set up by national parties could carry on the \nraising and spending of soft money under the false guise of \n``independence'' from the parties--including spending soft money on \ntelevision and radio sham ``issue ads.''\n  Unfortunately, four Commissioners opted for willful blindness rather \nthan a complete and accurate analysis of whether an entity was in fact \n``directly or indirectly established, financed, maintained or \ncontrolled'' by a national party. The explanation and justification \naccompanying the draft rules prepared by the Commission's general \ncounsel noted that ``certain actions that occur before the effective \ndate of BCRA have as much of an impact on whether an entity is \n`established, financed, maintained or controlled' by a sponsor as \nactions that occur immediately after BCRA's effective date.'' \nAccordingly, the draft rules proposed by the General counsel indicated \nthat the Commission should review conduct occurring before the law's \neffective date of November 6, in addition to conduct occurring after \nthat date, in determining whether a national party had established, \nfinanced, maintained or controlled an organization. Indeed, there is \nabsolutely no basis in the statute for concluding that the Commission \nshould review anything less than all of a party's conduct involving an \norganization in undertaking this analysis.\n  A Commissioner nonetheless offered an amendment containing an \ninvented ``grandfather clause.'' Under this amendment, a national party \ncould set up a shadow entity before November 6 to raise and spend soft \nmoney after that date--and yet the Commission would have to ignore that \nfact and any other pre-November 6 conduct in analyzing whether the \nshadow entity was ``established'' by a national party. The parties \ncould provide considerable support to these shadow entities prior to \nNovember 6 and indeed hold them out to donors as future soft money \nsurrogates for the parties. The Commission's general counsel strongly \nobjected to this bizarre idea, saying, ``. . . [I]t is hard to see how \nCongress imagined that an entity that . . . . was established a couple \nof days before the effective date of BCRA, is any less established . . \n. on November 10th, November 15th or December 1st.'' Still, the \nCommission adopted the amendment by a vote of four to two.\n\n  By adopting a ``grandfather clause'' invented out of whole cloth, the \nCommission invited schemes by the national parties to evade the new law \nby setting up surrogates prior to November 6th. Not surprisingly, the \nparties appear to be taking up the Commission's invitation. According \nto a Washington Post story of August 25, 2002, ``Both the Democratic \nand Republican senatorial campaign committees are exploring the \ncreation of separate soft-money funds.'' A National Journal article of \nSeptember 7, 2002 likewise stated, ``[E]ven some national party \ncommittees are looking at setting up, before November 5, new groups \nthat they say could legally raise soft money next year so long as they \ndo not coordinate their activities with the national committees.''\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act puts an end to soft money \nleadership PACs. Soft money leadership PACs are entities controlled by \nFederal officeholders or candidates that take in unlimited \ncontributions from corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals to \nfinance activities beneficial to their sponsors. These activities can \ninclude events and entertainment, contributions to State and local \nparties and candidates, fundraising and administrative costs, sham \n``issue ads,'' payments to consultants, and expenses for partisan get-\nout-the-vote efforts. According to a February 2002 report by\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\nPublic Citizen, 63 Members of Congress had their own soft money \nleadership PACs at that time. From July 1, 2000, until June 30, 2001, \nthe top 25 politician soft money leadership PACs collected more than \n$15.1 million in contributions.\n  The new law prohibits entities ``directly or indirectly established, \nfinanced, maintained or controlled'' by Federal officeholders or \ncandidates from soliciting or receiving soft money. As a matter of \nplain meaning and simple common sense, this language clearly covers \nofficeholder and candidate leadership PACs. Furthermore, this statutory \nstandard linking leadership PACs to their officeholder or candidate \nsponsors is deliberately broader than preexisting language under which \nthe Commission has treated leadership PACs as independent of Federal \nofficials. In sum, the new law was intended to bring about the demise \nof soft money leadership PACs--and was well-crafted to achieve that \nresult.\n  Despite the statutory language and clear legislative intent, the \nFederal Election Commission has left open the possibility of continued \noperation of officeholder and candidate soft money leadership PACs. If \nthe Commission considers a leadership PAC to be ``directly or \nindirectly established, financed, maintained or controlled'' by a \nFederal officeholder or candidate, it will not be permitted to receive \nsoft money. However, the Commission also decided that it would analyze \nwhether individual leadership PACs are so established, financed, \nmaintained or controlled by applying the same standards under which it \nhas always considered leadership PACs to be independent of Federal \nofficeholders and candidates. This decision threatens to delete an \nimportant element of the new law's soft money prohibitions.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act permits Federal officeholders and \ncandidates to ``attend, speak, and be a featured guest at'' State party \nfundraising events. However, these individuals may not expressly \nsolicit soft money at State party fundraising events.\n  The Commission's professional staff clearly perceived the line drawn \nby the law in terms of permissible Federal officeholder or candidate \nparticipation in State party fundraising events. Consistent with the \nstatutory language and legislative intent, the draft final soft money \nrules prepared by the general counsel and professional staff held that \nFederal candidates and officeholders could attend, speak at, or be \nfeatured guests at a State party fundraising event, but they could not \n``actively solicit funds at the event.''\n  Once again, the Commission overrode the draft regulations developed \nby its professional staff and departed from the statute. A Commissioner \noffered an amendment to permit Federal officeholders not merely to \nattend and speak at State party fundraising events but also to make \nexpress solicitations for soft money at those events. He characterized \nthis amendment as a ``total carve-out'' from the law's restrictions on \nsoft money solicitations by Federal candidates and officeholders. \nCommissioner Scott Thomas, who consistently voted against efforts to \nundermine and compromise the law, strenuously disagreed, saying, \n``[Congress] drafted the statute in a way that says in essence Federal \ncandidates are not to solicit soft money and the one part of \nCommissioner Toner's amendment that I just can't square with the \nstatutory ban is the last clause: the candidates and individuals \nholding Federal office may speak at such events without restriction or \nregulation.'' The amendment passed despite Commissioner Thomas's \nobjections.\n  This departure from the statutory text and legislative intent creates \na significant loophole that undermines Congress' effort to eradicate \nthe soft money system. Under this amendment, whatever is deemed to be a \nState party fundraiser essentially becomes a ``rules-free zone'' for \nsoft money solicitations. It is readily conceivable that Federal \nofficeholders and candidates will engage in unrestrained soft money \nsolicitations at any kind of event or gathering that is simply called a \n``State party fundraiser.'' Indeed, one could envision a State party \nholding its ``fundraiser'' in Washington DC's, Union Station, with the \nPresident and numerous Members of Congress in attendance to expressly \nsolicit unlimited soft money contributions for that state party. This \nresult is simply impossible to square with the text of the law and \nCongress's intent. The problem is compounded by the fact that the \nCommission elsewhere opened loopholes permitting State parties to spend \nunregulated, unlimited soft money donations on activities affecting \nFederal elections, again contrary to statutory text and legislative \nintent.\n  In general, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act does not merely ban \nnational parties and Federal officeholders from receiving, spending, \ndirecting, or soliciting soft money. The bill also prohibits State \nparties from spending unregulated soft money on activities that have a \nparticularly pronounced effect on Federal elections--defined in the \nstatute as ``Federal election activity.''\n  This portion of the law responds to an ongoing, significant problem. \nCurrently, State parties often use unlimited soft money donations, \nwhich are transferred to them by national parties or contributed \ndirectly to them, to help finance sham ``issue ads'' promoting or \nattacking clearly identified Federal candidates, voter mobilization \nactivities clearly benefitting Federal candidates, and other campaign \nactivities affecting Federal elections. This compromises the integrity \nof our democracy. If unregulated and potentially unlimited soft money \ndonations can be funneled through State parties into activities \nsupporting the election of Federal candidates, at a minimum, \nofficeholders appear beholden to the sources of those unlimited \ndonations.\n  To remedy this problem, the new campaign finance law requires State \nparties to use exclusively hard money contributions to finance public \ncommunications promoting or attacking clearly identified Federal \ncandidates, voter registration activity occurring within 120 days of a \nregularly scheduled Federal election that mentions a Federal candidate, \nand get-out-the-vote activity, voter identification, and generic \ncampaign activity mentioning a Federal candidate and conducted in \nconnection with an election in which a Federal candidate appears on the \nballot. It also requires State parties to use either exclusively hard \nmoney, or a combination of hard money and tightly limited and regulated \nnon-Federal funds, to finance voter registration, get-out-the-vote \nactivity, voter identification, and generic campaign activity that do \nnot mention Federal candidates.\n\n  The law does not permit the use of unregulated, unlimited soft money \ndonations by State parties for any of the specified ``Federal election \nactivities.'' Indeed, during floor debate over a number of years, the \nHouse and Senate repeatedly rejected substitute proposals that would \nhave allowed State parties to use unlimited soft money donations for \nthese activities. However, what was settled by Congress was reopened by \nthe Federal Election Commission. Through a series of amendments that \ndefied the statutory language, legislative intent, its own precedents, \nand simple common sense, the Commission opened the door for the use of \nunlimited soft money donations by State parties for certain activities \nthat clearly and significantly affect Federal elections. As such, the \nCommission preserved the status quo of the soft money system in a \nnumber of respects--clearly contrary to Congress's overriding purpose \nin enacting this law.\n  The statute does not permit State parties to use unregulated, \nunlimited soft money donations to finance ``voter registration \nactivity'' within 120 days of a regularly scheduled Federal election \nand ``get-out-the-vote activity'' conducted in connection with an \nelection in which a Federal candidate appears on the ballot. State \nparties must use exclusively hard money, or a tightly controlled mix of \nhard money and limited, regulated non-Federal donations, if no Federal \ncandidate is mentioned, to pay for these activities. The Federal \nElection Commission, however, permitted State parties to use \nunregulated soft money for these activities, by adopting unjustifiably \nnarrow definitions of the terms ``voter registration activity'' and \n``get-out-the-vote activity.''\n  The draft final rules prepared by the Commission's general counsel \nhad appropriately defined ``voter registration activity'' and ``get-\nout-the-vote activity'' to include not merely ``to assist'' individuals \nto vote or register to vote but also ``to encourage'' them to do so, \nconsistent with Commission precedent.\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\nFor instance, elsewhere in title 11 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \nspecifically, in 11 CFR 100.133, the Commission uses the heading \n``voter registration and get-out-the-vote activities,'' to describe \n``activity designed to encourage individuals to vote or to register to \nvote''. However, on a four-to-two vote, the Commission overrode its \ngeneral counsel and deleted the concept of ``encouraging'' people to \nregister to vote or to vote from the definitions of ``voter \nregistration activity'' and ``get-out-the-vote activity.''\n  This amendment departs from not only Commission precedent but also \ncommon sense. Under the amendment, a State party phone bank targeted at \nthe party's core voters, urging them to ``get out and vote this \nNovember'' because of key issues at stake, but not mentioning the \nlocation of a polling place or offering transportation assistance, \nwould not constitute ``get-out-the-vote activity'', and thus could be \nfinanced in part with unregulated, unlimited soft money. This is an \nabsurd result, contradicting common understandings of what constitutes \n``get-out-the-vote activity'' and perpetuating certain aspects of the \ncurrent soft money system. By failing to include all ``get-out-the-vote \nactivity'' and ``voter registration activity'' in its definitions of \nthose terms, the Commission violated the statute.\n  The Commission also failed to include all ``voter identification'' \nactivity in its regulatory definition of that term, violating the \nstatute and undermining its prohibition on the use of unregulated soft \nmoney by State parties for such activity. The draft final rules \nprepared by the Commission's general counsel had included ``obtaining \nvoter lists'' in the definition of ``voter identification.'' However, a \nCommissioner offered an amendment to delete voter list acquisition from \nthis definition, even though this is a commonly understood component of \nvoter identification activity. A lawyer from the Commission's general \ncounsel's office pointed out the problem with this amendment, noting \nduring the rulemaking:\n\n       In particular, I would note that the [definition of voter \n     identification proposed in the amendment] excludes--and I \n     know, by design--list acquisition, which is a key means of \n     identifying voters and, therefore, seemed to us to be voter \n     ID. And also a very significant part--component of campaign \n     spending.\n\n  Nonetheless, the Commission adopted the amendment by a four-to-two \nvote, allowing State parties to continue their current practice of \nusing unregulated, unlimited soft money donations to help acquire voter \nlists employed to identify likely voters in upcoming elections in which \na Federal candidate appears on the ballot.\n  As part of its mission to permit the continuation of aspects of the \nsoft money system at the State level, the Commission also constricted \nthe meaning of ``generic campaign activity'' from that provided in the \nstatute. The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act prohibits State parties \nfrom financing ``generic campaign activity'' with unregulated, \nunlimited soft money donations. It proceeds to specifically define \n``generic campaign activity'' as ``campaign activity that promotes a \npolitical party and does not promote a candidate or non-Federal \ncandidate''.\n  While the statutory definition covers ``campaign activity,'' the \nCommission adopted, again on a four-to-two vote, an amendment limiting \nthe corresponding regulatory definition to a ``public communication \nthat promotes a political party and does not promote a candidate or \nnon-Federal candidate.'' Notably, ``public communication'' is defined \nelsewhere in the statute and regulations to include only ``a \ncommunication by means of any broadcast, cable, or satellite \ncommunication, newspaper, magazine, outdoor advertising facility, mass \nmailing, or telephone bank to the general public, or any other form of \ngeneral public political advertising.'' Thus, the Commission overrode \nthe statute to permit State parties to use unregulated, unlimited soft \nmoney donations to send party promotion mailings that do not constitute \n``mass mailings'' and to engage in other party promotion activities \nthat do not rise to the level of a ``public communication'' as \nspecifically defined in the statute and regulations.\n  The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act specifies that its restrictions on \nState party use of unregulated soft money for get-out-the-vote \nactivity, voter identification, and generic campaign activity apply \nwhen these activities are ``conducted in connection with an election in \nwhich a Federal candidate appears on the ballot.''\n\n  For purposes of this rulemaking, the Federal Election Commission \nadopted an artificially and unrealistically short time window for \ndesignating State party get-out-the-vote activity, voter \nidentification, and generic campaign activity as having been \n``conducted in connection with an election in which a Federal candidate \nappears on the ballot'' and thus subject to the new law's soft money \nlimits. The Commission ultimately decided that these activities fell \nunder the statutory standard only if they occurred after ``the date of \nthe earliest filing deadline for access to the primary election ballot \nfor Federal candidates as determined by State law'' up until election \nday of an even-numbered year. As the Commission's professional staff \npointed out during the rulemaking proceedings, this filing deadline can \noccur as late as in August in certain States.\n  At the very least, it is difficult to reach the conclusion that State \nparty voter identification and generic campaign activities conducted at \nany point in even-numbered years are somehow not ``conducted in \nconnection with an election in which a Federal candidate appears on the \nballot.'' Federal candidates will be on the ballot in regularly \nscheduled primary and general elections that occur in those years. \nIndeed, that conclusion is a departure from relevant Commission \nprecedent.\n  In determining when a hard money match has been required for State \nparty generic voter drives, the Commission has long indicated that \nState party generic voter drive expenses incurred as early as the \nbeginning of a 2-year election cycle, e.g., January of 1995, for the \n1995-96 cycle, required partial hard money financing. The result of the \nCommission's arbitrary and incorrect interpretation of the statute and \ndeparture from its precedent in this instance is that State parties \nwill be able to use unlimited soft money to help finance certain \ngeneric party promotion activity and activities to identify likely \nvoters occurring in at least the same year, and sometimes considerably \nproximate to, Federal elections.\n  In conclusion, the cumulative effect of these provisions is to \nresurrect significant aspects of the current soft money system at the \nState level, directly contrary to statutory text and legislative \nintent. State parties will be able to use unregulated, unlimited soft \nmoney donations to help finance targeted, effective get-out-the-vote \nactivity closely proximate to Federal elections, the purchase of voter \nlists for voter identification purposes, generic party promotion \nactivity occurring in Federal election years, and other activities \ndirectly and substantially affecting Federal elections. Furthermore, \nunder other Federal Election Commission regulations shrinking the \nstatute, these unregulated soft money donations could be secured for \nState parties by national parties and Federal candidates and \nofficeholders.\n  Because of the Commission's truncated definition of ``to solicit,'' \nnational parties and Federal candidates and officeholders could \n``recommend'' or ``suggest'' that donors write large soft money checks \nto State parties for use on get-out-the-vote drives and other \nactivities on Federal elections. Indeed, Federal candidates could also \ntake advantage of the ``total carve-out'' invented by the Commission \nfor soft money solicitations at State party fundraisers, in order to \nexpressly ask donors to contribute unregulated soft money to State \nparties. Acting together, the Commission's various departures from the \nstatute would perpetuate many of the State party practices that have \nundermined public confidence in our political system and that Congress \nsought to eliminate.\n  The previously cited examples are not the only instances in which the \nCommission departed from the statute and legislative intent. For \ninstance:\n\n       The Commission allowed State parties to spend certain non-\n     Federal funds to raise funds ultimately used, in whole or in \n     part, to finance ``Federal election activity.'' This directly \n     violates the statutory language indicating that State parties \n     must use funds ``subject to the limitations, prohibitions, \n     and reporting requirements of this Act'' (i.e., hard money) \n     to pay the costs of raising funds\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\n     used for ``Federal election activity.'' A section-by-section \n     summary of the bill included in the Senate Congressional \n     Record on March 18, 2002 underscores the statutory hard money \n     financing requirement in this area: ``Sec. 323(c). \n     Fundraising Costs. Requires national, state, and local \n     parties to use hard money to raise money that will be used on \n     federal election activities, as defined by the bill'' \n     (emphasis added).\n       The Commission even rolled back certain state party hard \n     money financing requirements applicable prior to the \n     enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act. Previously, \n     state parties had to use at least some hard money to finance \n     the salaries of state party employees spending less than 25 \n     percent of their time on federal election activity. An \n     amendment by one Commissioner eliminated that hard money \n     allocation requirement, allowing state parties to finance \n     those salaries exclusively with soft money.\n       The Commission allowed state parties to use unregulated \n     soft money donations to help finance Internet websites and \n     widely distributed e-mails promoting or attacking clearly \n     identified federal candidates. In doing so, they disregarded \n     the statute's prohibition on state parties' using any soft \n     money for ``general public political advertising'' promoting \n     or attacking federal candidates. In fact, this decision \n     departed from Commission precedent--as the agency had \n     previously construed the term ``general public political \n     advertising'' to include Internet communications.\n       The Commission failed to include the concept of ``apparent \n     authority'' in its definition of who constitutes a party or \n     candidate ``agent'' for purposes of the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Reform Act, even though it acknowledged that apparent \n     authority is included in the settled common law meaning of \n     the term ``agent.''\n\n  Even this is not a complete list of the problems created by the \nCommission. However, the list is sufficient to demonstrate a pattern of \nstatutory distortion with a common theme: allowing soft money banned by \nCongress to creep back into our campaign finance system.\n  The agency that created soft money is clearly intent on saving it. A \nnumber of Commissioners have made no secret of their dislike for the \npolicy choices made by Congress in enacting the Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act. They are entitled to their opinions about the merits of the \nlaw. But they are not entitled to substitute their opinions for the \njudgment of Congress. This pattern of statutory distortion and \ncontradiction of legislative intent--always with the result of \nreintroducing soft money to the system--suggests that four \nCommissioners did not grasp the limits on their authority, or care much \nabout them.\n  With the enactment of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, Congress \nhonored the American people's desire for cleaner elections. Though I \nwish it were not necessary, it appears that we must act again to ensure \nthe public obtains the full benefits of this law. A Federal Election \nCommission that has failed the public time and time again should not \nenjoy the last word on the health of our democracy. So I urge support \nfor this resolution--to reclaim for Congress its role as the author of \nour Nation's laws; and to deliver the full campaign finance reform that \nthe American people deserve.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 48\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Federal Election \n     Commission relating to Prohibited and Excessive \n     Contributions: Non-Federal Funds or Soft Money, published at \n     67 Fed. Reg. 49063 (2002), and such rule shall have no force \n     or effect.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Arizona in \nintroducing a disapproval joint resolution pursuant to the \nCongressional Review Act, ``CRA''. An identical joint resolution is \nbeing introduced in the House of Representatives by supporters of \ncampaign finance reform in that body. If passed by the Senate and the \nHouse and signed by the President, this resolution would result in the \ndisapproval of regulations issued by the Federal Election Commission to \nimplement the core provision of the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan \ncampaign finance reform bill, the ban on soft money.\n  We are taking this step, reluctantly, because the rules transmitted \nto Congress are not faithful to the letter and the spirit of the bill \nthat we passed, and the President signed, just a few months ago. That \nbill was necessary because rulings over a period of years by the FEC \nhad created the soft money system. We cannot stand by while the same \nregulatory body thwarts the efforts of this Congress, and the strong \ndesire of the American people, to end that corrupt system of financing \ncampaigns in this country. We must send a clear message that we meant \nwhat we said when we passed campaign finance reform earlier this year.\n  No unelected body can be permitted to rewrite the law. No group of \nappointed officials can be permitted to punch loopholes in a law before \nthe ink is even dry on the President's signature. The role of the FEC \nis to implement and enforce the laws that Congress passes, not to pass \njudgment on them and revise them according to the Commissioners' own \nviews of the way that campaigns should be financed in this country.\n  As my colleagues are aware, section 402(c) of the new law required \nthe FEC to promulgate rules relating to Title I of the new law, the ban \non soft money, within 90 days of enactment of the law on March 27, \n2002. The FEC worked diligently to meet that statutory deadline. It \npublished proposed rules on May 20, 2002, received comments from \ninterested parties on May 29, 2002, held public hearings on June 4 and \nJune 5, 2002, and completed work on the rules themselves on June 25, \n2002. Incidentally, Senator McCain and I and Representatives Shays and \nMeehan filed extensive comments on the proposed rules. So the FEC had \nbefore it our views on the issues covered by the rules when it made its \ndecisions.\n  Let me first take a moment to outline a few of the deficiencies in \nthe FEC's rules, and then I will discuss our decision to invoke the \nCongressional Review Act. One of the central provisions of the McCain-\nFeingold bill was a prohibition of Federal candidates and officeholders \nsoliciting soft money. The President and members of Congress are now \nintimately involved in their parties' fundraising efforts. They spend \nhours at a time making phone calls to corporate CEOs and labor leaders \nasking for contributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars. One \nmember of this body commented to me after making one of those calls \nthat he felt like taking a shower. The White House coffees from 1996 \nand other ``donor service'' events were part of this soft money system.\n\n  This kind of fundraising demeans this body, it demeans the \nPresidency, it demeans public service. We knew if we were going to end \nthe soft money system, we had to call a halt to members of Congress \nraising these kinds of unlimited contributions.\n  The FEC took it upon itself to define the term ``solicit'' in our \nstatute. The General Counsel's office sensibly suggested a definition \nthat to ``solicit'' means to ``request, suggest, or recommend'' that a \ncontribution be made. The Commissioners decided that definition was too \nbroad so they amended the General Counsel's definition and said that \nsolicit only means to ``ask'' for a contribution.\n  There can be no question that our intent in this law was to broadly \nprohibit the involvement of Federal candidates and officeholders in the \nraising of soft money. The FEC's definition narrows that provision. As \nthe Commission's General Counsel said, ``it doesn't take great \ncleverness'' to figure out ways to request a donation without formally \nasking for one. The bank on Federal officeholders raising soft money is \nplainly compromised by this narrow definition. It is contrary to the \nclear intent of the Act.\n  In our prohibition of soft money fundraising, we included a narrow \nexception to permit federal officeholders to ``attend, speak, or be a \nfeatured guest at'' at a fundraiser for a State political party \ncommittee. The idea behind this exception was to allow Federal \ncandidates to be part of such fundraisers, even if the State party was \nusing the event to raise money that might not be legal under federal \nlaw. We did not intend that Federal candidates should be allowed to \nexpressly solicit soft money contributions at such fundraisers.\n  So what did the FEC do with this exception? In the words of one \nCommissioner, it created a ``rules free zone'' at these events. \nAbsolutely nothing is now out of bounds at any event deemed\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\nto be a State party fundraiser, members of Congress can not only attend \nand speak at a fundraiser, they can individually solicit corporate CEOs \nin attendance, they might even be able to make phone calls to other \ndonors from such fundraisers. Anyone who would have suggested on this \nfloor that the intent of the narrow exception in the bill was to create \na ``rules free zone'' would have been laughed out of town. But that is \nexactly what the FEC did.\n  The FEC also laid the groundwork for the national parties to transfer \ntheir soft money operations to other entities before the law takes \neffect. This was clearly not permitted by the law we passed. The soft \nmoney ban applies not only to the parties but to any entity ``directly \nor indirectly established, financed, maintained, or controlled'' by the \nparty or any party official. The idea here, as you can tell by the \nbroad language was to make sure that ban was difficult to evade.\n\n  The FEC went right to work on this language. It determined that any \naction taken before the bill becomes effective cannot be considered in \ndeciding whether an entity is established, financed, maintained, or \ncontrolled by the parties. Under this regulation, the parties can \ncreate shell entities this year, provide seed money and staff and donor \nlists for them, and inform all their soft money donors that this new \nentity is their favored recipient for soft money after the election. \nBut under the FEC's rules, none of those facts can even be considered \nin deciding whether this entity is ``established'' by the party, and \ntherefore subject to the ban on raising and spending soft money.\n  This is a strained reading of the law, to say the least. One \nCommissioner said with respect to the actions of the FEC's majority on \nthese rules: ``You have so tortured this law, it's beyond silly.'' This \nis clearly a prime example. How can an entity such as the one I \ndescribed not be considered to have been ``established'' by the party? \nYet that will be the result of the ``grandfathering'' that the FEC \nincluded in the regulations, a provision that is nowhere reflected in \nthe law itself, and that was simply made up by the FEC out of whole \ncloth.\n  There are many other examples of torturing this law, and we will \ndetail all of them when we consider the resolution. I think it is clear \nthat these problems go to the heart of the soft money ban. They are not \njust quibbles. They undermine the central provisions of the new law. \nThat is why we are seeking to invoke the Congressional Review Act. Some \nmay call that a draconian step because the CRA requires us to overturn \nthe entire regulation. But in our view, such action is appropriate. No \nrules are better than rules that create huge loopholes from the very \nstart.\n  Furthermore, it is our view that the FEC would remain under an \nobligation to promulgate new rules and that new rules that address the \nshortcomings that we identify in this debate will be permitted under \nthe CRA because they will not be ``substantially the same'' as the \nregulations that we disapprove with this resolution. The CRA would give \nthe FEC a full year from the date of enactment of the disapproval \nresolution to repromulgate the rules. But we expect that the FEC will \nact expeditiously in response to a clear message from Congress that \nthese rules are unsatisfactory. Indeed, the regulated community will \ndemand quick action, because it will want the guidance that regulations \nprovide. Otherwise, it will be required to abide by a statute without \nthe more specific guidance provided by regulations.\n  We take no pleasure in having to follow this course. But we worked \nfor seven years to pass this reform for the American people. Sixty \nSenators voted in favor of the bill when it finally passed the Senate \non March 20, 2002. We cannot turn our backs on the extra-legal action \nof the FEC. We must act to protect the reform that so many fought so \nhard for so long to enact.\n  When we passed the McCain-Feingold bill in March, I indicated that we \nwould continue to work for reform and to make sure that the new law was \nproperly implemented. I really did not expect to be back on the floor \nso soon. But I make no apologies for it. The FEC's rules cannot stand. \nI ask for my colleagues support for this disapproval resolution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Reed, Ms. \n Mikulski, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nDodd, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Torricelli, and Mrs. \n                                Boxer):\n\n  S.J. Res. 49. A joint resolution recognizing the contributions of \nPasty Takemoto Mink; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution passed \nlast night in the other body, along with my colleagues Senators Inouye, \nKennedy, and others, which continues our tribute to Congresswoman Pasty \nTakemoto Mink in the wake of her untimely passing on September 28, \n2002. The resolution honors a remarkable woman and her accomplishments \nfor equal opportunity and education by renaming after her a provision \nin law commonly known as Title IX that consists of few words but has \nhad incomprehensible and tremendous positive impact on the lives of \ncountless numbers of girls and women in our country. With our combined \naction, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 will now be known \nas the Pasty Takemoto Mink Equal Opportunity in Education Act.\n  As we honor our colleague, we can also recount some of the milestones \nin the 30-year history of Title IX and the efforts to establish \nstandards of equal opportunity of women. The progress we as a Nation \nhave made in 30 years has been remarkable, and we have Patsy and a few \nof her visionary colleagues to thank for the equal opportunities our \nchildren enjoy today. In 1970, the U.S. House of Representatives \nCommittee on Education and Labor held the first Congressional hearings \non sex discrimination in education. At those hearings, Patsy made the \nfollowing statement, ``Discrimination against women in education is one \nof the most insidious forms of prejudice extant in our nation. Few \npeople realize the extent to which our society is denied full use of \nour human resources because of this type of discrimination. Most \nlarge colleges and universities in the United States routinely impose \nquotas by sex on the admission of students. Fewer women are admitted \nthan men, and those few women allowed to pursue higher education must \nhave attained exceptional intellectual standing to win admission.'' She \nwent on to state, ``Our nation can no longer afford this system which \ndemoralizes and demeans half of the population and deprives them of the \nmeans to participate fully in our society as equal citizens. Lacking \nthe contribution which women are capable of making to human betterment, \nour nation is the loser so long as this discrimination is allowed to \ncontinue.''\n\n  In April, 1972, Congresswoman Mink introduced the Women's Education \nAct of 1972. On the day of introduction, on the floor of the other \nbody, she said, ``We need the input of every individual to continue the \nprogress we enjoy. All persons, regardless of their sex, must have \nenough opportunities open so that they can contribute as much to their \nlives and this society as they can.'' She further noted that, ``it is \nessential to the existence of our country that sincere and realistic \nattention to there realignment of our attitudes and educational \npriorities be made. I suggest that education is the first place to \nstart in a reexamination of our national goals.''\n  On June 23, 1972, Congresswoman Mink, working with Congresswoman \nEdith Green of Oregon and others on the then Education and Labor \nCommittee, saw their efforts on an important education package come top \nfruition as the Education Amendments of 1972 were signed into law. \nTitle IX was included in that package. Final regulations for Title IX \nwere issued on June 4, 1975. On June 17, 1997, President Clinton \nannounced that he issued an executive memo directing all appropriate \nfederal agencies to review their Title IX obligation and report their \nfindings within 90 days to the Attorney General. In all, although the \nreach of Title IX has been felt the most in the athletics arena, the \nlandmark statutes about gender roles in our society and helped to \ncorrect inequalities in areas such as educational attainment by women, \neducator pay, and the wide range of extracurricular activities enjoyed \nby female students of all ages. Much of this\n\n[[Page S10130]]\n\nwould not have been possible, were it not for the immense vision and \ndetermination of Patsy Mink.\n\n  Last Friday, I attended a most fitting and moving memorial service \nfor Patsy in Honolulu, Hawaii. I joined the senior Senator from Hawaii \nand many dignitaries from the other body, as well as many of Hawaii's \nother distinguished elected officials and thousands of Hawaii \nresidents, in attendance to pay tribute to Patsy Mink. Among the \neloquent speakers, University of Hawaii Assistant Athletics Director \nMarilyn Moniz-Kahoohanohano called herself, ``a living example of Mrs. \nMink's vision of quality for women.'' Marilyn recounted how she had \njust graduated from high school after the passage of Title IX, and the \nUniversity of Hawaii formed the Rainbow Wahine athletic teams. She \nrecalled, with joy, how she and her team placed second for the national \nvolleyball title and took pictures with Patsy on the steps of the \nCapitol. Marilyn's powerful words on Friday range true for many female \nathletes in Hawaii and around the country, as she said, ``Because of \nyou, we can play the game.''\n  I urge the Senate to act quickly on this resolution to honor the \ngroundbreaking efforts of Congresswoman Patsy Takemoto Mink on behalf \nof countless girls and women of America. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 49\n\n       Whereas Patsy Takemoto Mink was one of the Nation's leading \n     voices for women's rights, civil rights, and working families \n     and was devoted to raising living standards and providing \n     economic and educational opportunity to all Americans;\n       Whereas Patsy Takemoto Mink was a passionate and persistent \n     fighter against economic and social injustices in Hawaii and \n     across the Nation;\n       Whereas Patsy Takemoto Mink was one of the first women of \n     color to win national office in 1964 and opened doors of \n     opportunity to millions of women and people of color across \n     the Nation;\n       Whereas Patsy Takemoto Mink had unprecedented legislative \n     accomplishments on issues affecting women's health, children, \n     students, and working families; and\n       Whereas Patsy Takemoto Mink's heroic, visionary, and \n     tireless leadership to win the landmark passage of title IX \n     of the Education Amendments of 1972 opened doors to women's \n     academic and athletic achievements and redefined what is \n     possible for a generation of women and for future generations \n     of the Nation's daughters: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PATSY TAKEMOTO MINK EQUAL OPPORTUNITY IN EDUCATION \n                   ACT.\n\n       Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. \n     1681 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 910.

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \ncalling on the world community to reject, or continue to reject, calls \nfor an academic boycott of Israel and reaffirm its commitment to \nacademic freedom and cultural and scientific exchange. This legislation \nalso calls on the international educational establishment to reverse \nany actions it has taken in support of an academic boycott of Israel, \nand on the U.S. to support efforts to increase academic cooperation and \nencourage cultural and scientific exchange between the United States \nand Israel\n  In recent months I have been troubled by reports that a movement is \nbrewing to limit contact between European Governments, institutions, \nand academics, with their counterparts in Israel. Petition drives are \nunderway in Europe and elsewhere to encourage decision-makers and \nscholars to academically isolate Israel as a way of expressing \ndissatisfaction with Israeli policies regarding the Palestinian \npopulation.\n  Campaigns in support of an academic boycott are as counterproductive \nas they are unjustified. They breed intolerance, disrupt important \nscientific inquiries, and undermine efforts towards\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\npeace. Yet groups ranging from the Association of University Teachers, \na labor union in England, to the University of Lille in France have \nmade the unfortunate decision to allow their misguided political \nbeliefs to disrupt constructive academic collaboration with colleagues \nin Israel.\n  As you may be aware, in June of this year, two Israeli scholars were \ndismissed from the boards of translation journals based in Manchester, \nEngland. No one asserts that these two fine academics were dismissed \nfor incompetence or for poor scholarship. No one argues that the \nremarks or actions of these intellectuals reflected poorly on their \ninstitutions or on these publications. No one even claims that they \nwere dismissed for their political views. They clearly were not. \nRather, they were dismissed simply because of their nationality. They \nboth are Israeli citizens and carry Israeli passports.\n  What makes their dismissal all the more ridiculous is that one of the \nacademics discharged is Miriam Schlesinger, an Israeli human rights \nactivist who has been a consistent voice of dissent within Israeli \nsociety. As the former chair of Israel's chapter of Amnesty \nInternational, Professor Schlesinger has been highly critical of some \nof the Israeli policies that the boycott is also seeking to reverse. \nThe case of Miriam Schlesinger highlights an important fact seemingly \noverlooked by proponents of the boycott: in free societies, like \nIsrael, academics often provide a range of viewpoints, many of which \nwill differ from official government policy.\n  In addition to working against peace and cultural understanding, an \nacademic boycott will stifle meaningful scientific advancements. \nDespite the nascent quality of the campaign against academic exchange \nwith Israel, the announced boycott has already confounded research \nprojects intended to foster cooperation between Israelis and \nPalestinians in many important areas, including water resource \nmanagement and cancer treatment.\n\n  In fact, in one particularly shocking example, a Norwegian veterinary \nschool refused to provide an Israeli research center, Goldyne Savad \nInstitute of Gene Therapy at Hadassah Medical Center, with material it \nneeded to conduct an important medical study. This thoughtless \nbureaucratic decision disrupted research intended to develop new \ntherapies for treating anemic Palestinian children.\n  By passing this resolution, the Senate will join a growing chorus of \ninstitutions and publications that have condemned the practice of \nrestricting academic exchange with Israeli and academics and \ninstitutions. For example, an editorial in the well-respected British \nscientific journal Nature, argues that an academic boycott of Israel \nwill undermine regional progress. The article explains, and I quote, \n``Israel is a research powerhouse that, given an eventual improvement \nof relations with its neighbors, could rejuvenate science and \ndevelopment in the region through collaboration and training. Rather \nthan signing boycotts, which will achieve nothing, researchers \nworldwide can help the peace process concretely by actively initiating \nmore . . . collaborations and encouraging their institutions to do the \nsame.''\n  The European Union has already made it clear that an academic boycott \nis unhelpful at best and counterproductive at worst. Philippe Busquin, \nthe Commissioner for Research for the European Union, explained in an \nopen letter that sanctions against Israeli academic institutions would \nundermine efforts to create a constructive dialogue. In that letter, \nBusquin appropriately emphasized the role that European, Israeli and \nPalestinian institutions and scientists play in ``addressing critical \nregional issues such as agriculture or water management . . . which, is \ncertainly more effective than many well-intentioned words without any \nconcrete impact.''\n  Sharing ideas and learning about another culture leads to greater \ntolerance and understanding, while severing intellectual and cultural \nties only breeds ignorance and stultification. This senate must send a \nmessage that an academic boycott of Israel is not a catalyst for peace, \nbut rather an unwarranted impediment to progress in the region. Because \ncultural understanding and scientific advancement improve the human \ncondition, the US should seek to encourage cultural and scientific \nexchange between our country and our strongest ally in the Middle East, \nIsrael.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/08/senate-section/article/S10131-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4856.
