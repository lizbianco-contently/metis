Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to the consideration of the conference report \naccompanying H.R. 2299, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2299) ``making appropriations for the Department of \n     Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes,'' having \n     met, have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement \n     to the amendment of the Senate and the House agree to the \n     same, with an amendment, and the Senate agree to the same, \n     signed by a majority of the conferees on the part of both \n     Houses.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord on November 29, 2001.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under a previous order, there will \nnow be 60 minutes for debate.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise to bring before the Senate the \nconference report accompanying the Transportation appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 2002.\n  This conference agreement represents many weeks of negotiations with \nthe House and the administration, and I am proud of the progress it \nwill bring to our Nation's transportation system.\n  This conference agreement has already passed the House by an \noverwhelming margin of 371-11.\n  In total, the bill includes appropriations and obligation limitations \ntotaling roughly $59.6 billion.\n  While that is about $1.5 billion more than the fiscal year 2001 \nlevel, it is approximately $400 million less than the amount passed by \nthe Senate on August 1.\n  It was very difficult to pare $400 million out of the Senate bill, \nbut we did so while carefully looking out for the needs of all of the \ncritical agencies within the Department of Transportation as well as \nthe Members' individual priorities.\n  The conference agreement provides funding levels that are equal to or \nhigher than the operating accounts for agencies such as the Coast \nGuard, the FAA, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n  Several important safety initiatives--that were included in the \nSenate bill--have been maintained, including: the hiring of new \naviation safety and security inspectors, improvements to the Coast \nGuard's struggling search and rescue mission, and additional funding to \nincrease seat belt use across the nation.\n  The bill before us also includes a full $1.25 billion in funding to \nlaunch the transportation security act, which is the aviation security \nbill that was enacted just a few days ago.\n  The act required that the revenues from its user fees be appropriated \nbefore becoming available.\n  The security act includes many strict deadlines for the improvement \nof our aviation security system.\n  And we expect the DOT to meet those deadlines.\n  That is why we worked hard to get the $1.25 billion in user fees into \nthe hands of the Transportation Secretary in this bill as soon as \npossible--rather than wait for the Defense supplemental.\n  For highways, our bill includes $100 million more than the amount \nguaranteed under TEA-21.\n  The bill also fully funds the levels authorized under AIR-21 for the \nFAA's air traffic control improvements and airport grants.\n  When the Senate considered this bill, we spent a lot of time debating \nthe safety of Mexican trucks entering the United States.\n  While the conference agreement provides the administration \nflexibility in implementation, it carefully follows the safety \nprovisions of the bill that passed the Senate in August.\n  The safety requirements in this bill are considerably stronger than \nanything the administration had proposed, and anything that was \npresented to the Senate as an alternative during our debate this past \nsummer.\n  Let me mention quickly just a few of the safety provisions in the \nbill.\n  Licenses will be checked for every driver transporting hazardous \nmaterials and for at least half of all other Mexican truck drivers \nevery time they cross the border.\n  Mexican trucks will undergo rigorous inspections before they are \nallowed full access to our highways, and they will be reinspected every \n90 days.\n  And trucking firms will need to demonstrate that they have a drug and \nalcohol testing program, proof of insurance, and drivers who have clean \ndriving records before the first truck crosses the border.\n  There are many people to thank for their contributions to this bill.\n  The former chairman of the subcommittee and now its ranking member, \nSenator Shelby has been a stalwart ally and regular contributor to our \nefforts.\n  Congressman Rogers, the chairman of the House subcommittee is not \nonly an outstanding chairman, he is a true Kentucky gentleman as well.\n  I also want to thank Representative Sabo of Minnesota, the ranking \nmember of the House subcommittee, whose leadership on the Mexican truck \nissue was essential to our getting an outstanding safety regimen in \nplace.\n  As always, I thank Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens for their \nassistance throughout the process.\n  I also thank the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittee \nstaffs--along with some members of my personal staff who have worked a \ngreat many hours to bring together this conference agreement, \nincluding:\n  On the Senate subcommittee on Transportation appropriations, for the \nmajority: Peter Rogoff, Kate Hallahan, Cynthia Stowe, and Angela Lee;\n  For the minority: Wally Burnett Paul Doerrer, and Candice Rogers,\n  On the House subcommittee on Transportation appropriations, for the \nmajority: Rich Efford, Stephanie Gupta, Cheryle Tucker, Linda Muir, and \nTheresa Kohler;\n  For the minority: Bev Pheto;\n  On the chairman personal staff, Rich Desimone and Dale Learn;\n  On the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, Debbie \nHersman.\n  I thank all these people who spent a lot of time helping us to get to \nthis point. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I yield myself as much time as I \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of the fiscal year 2002 Transportation \nappropriations conference report before the Senate this morning. While \nI do not support every item, policy, program, or initiative in the \nconference report or statement of managers, I do support the package \nreported overwhelmingly from the conference committee and as just \ndescribed by the Senator from Washington.\n  This is the first year the Senator from Washington is chair of the \nTransportation Appropriations Subcommittee, and I believe that she has \naccounted herself well on this bill. This is a balanced bill.\n  Clearly, the Mexican truck issue reflects that balanced approach. I \nbelieve that the Senator from Washington did an admirable job of \nmanaging this issue through a lengthy debate on the Senate floor and \nthrough the conference committee negotiations with the House and the \nadministration.\n  The resolution of the Mexican truck issue allows for the safe opening \nof the border to Mexican trucks with appropriate inspections, \noversight, and audits of Mexican-domiciled trucks and trucking \ncompanies. This compromise kept the focus on truck safety and security \nat our border and never lost sight of the need to work with the \nadministration and the House to forge a workable solution.\n  Our approach on this issue was always to move the debate forward and \nallow a resolution based on safety standards rather than prohibiting \nany action by the department to manage the truck safety issues we face \nat our southern border. I think the conference report treatment of this \nmatter meets that test.\n  The FAA, the Coast Guard, and the Department's new Transportation \nSecurity Agency are all adequately, if not\n\n[[Page S12333]]\n\ngenerously, funded in this bill. The funding levels match the AIR 21 \nlevels for the FAA's two capital accounts, and the funding for FAA \noperations meets the President's budget request.\n  Accordingly, the conference report meets the TEA 21 transit funding \nlevels and increases the obligation limitation for highways above the \nTEA 21 firewalled levels. This funding commitment recognizes the \npriorities our colleagues in the Senate place on these accounts.\n  This is not only the first year of the Senator from Washington as the \nchair of this subcommittee, it is also the first year that Peter Rogoff \nhas assisted her on the bill as the majority clerk. The committee and \nthe Senator from Washington were both well served by Peter Rogoff--and \nhis staff, Kate Hallahan, and Coast Guard Commander Cyndi Stowe.\n  I also commend Wally Burnett and Paul Doerrer of my staff on the \ncommittee. They worked hand in hand with the Democrats. I believe that \nis why we are where we are today, on the verge of adopting this \nconference report.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the conference report and send \nit to the President for his signature, with the type of overwhelming \nmargin we saw in the other body of a 371-to-11 vote on the adoption of \nthis report.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has now turned to consideration \nof the conference report accompanying the Transportation and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002. The bill includes a \ncombination of appropriations and obligation limitations totaling \n$59.643 billion. That is $1.526 billion or 2.6 percent higher than the \nlevel provided for fiscal year 2001.\n  This is the ninth of the thirteen appropriations conference reports \nto come before the Senate. It is the ninth conference report that is \nwithin its 302 (B) allocation and it is fully consistent with the $686 \nbillion bipartisan budget agreement on discretionary spending for the \nthirteen bills.\n  When the President signed the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury, he placed into law a provision I and my colleague from Texas, \nSenator Gramm, championed here in the Senate. That provision served to \nguarantee that we appropriate every year on our Nation's highway system \nthe funds that are received into the Highway Trust Fund through fuel \ntaxes at the pump. I'm pleased to say that this year's Transportation \nbill, like every Transportation bill enacted since TEA-21, honors that \ncommitment. Indeed, this year, for the first time since 1998, the \nTransportation bill provides more money for highways than was assumed \nin the highway guarantee--$100 million more. This is made possible \nsince we still have an unobligated balance in the trust fund that \nexisted before TEA-21 was enacted. So I commend the managers of the \nbill, Senators Murray and Shelby, for making this significant \ninvestment in our Nation's highway infrastructure which is very much in \nneed of repair, restoration, and expansion.\n  As long as I have had the pleasure of serving on the Transportation \nSubcommittee, it has always operated in an open and bipartisan manner. \nI am pleased to see that this tradition has continued under the \nleadership of Senator Murray. She and Senator Shelby have cooperated on \nall aspects of this bill. Both of them were required to take on the \nvery contentious issue regarding the safety risks of Mexican trucks \ntraveling on our highways. We debated that issue for several days here \nin the Senate and took a total of three cloture votes during that \ndebate. Senators Murray and Shelby stood their ground on the floor of \nthe Senate and they prevailed. They then went to conference and \nnegotiated a compromise with the House that maintains the strong safety \nrequirements passed by the Senate but eliminates the threat of a veto \nagainst this bill.\n  I commend both managers and their respective staffs for a job well \ndone and I encourage all members to support the conference report.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my concern regarding \nan element on the Fiscal Year 2002 Transportation Appropriation \nConference Report. While I believe that this report, for the most part, \nspends funding according to statute and aids our Nation's \ntransportation system, I am very concerned about the distribution of a \nmajor funding category.\n  The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA 21, was \npassed by the Congress in 1998 by overwhelming margins. For the first \ntime receipts into the Highway Trust Fund were guaranteed to be spent \nfor transportation purposes. This is accomplished through the annual \ncalculation of Revenue Aligned Budget Authority, RABA, which makes \nadjustments in obligations to compensate for actual receipts into the \nTrust Fund versus the estimated authorization included in TEA 21 for \nthe fiscal year.\n  While I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has upheld the \nfirewalls in this conference report, I find the redistribution of RABA \nfunds to be unacceptable. Under TEA 21, RABA funds are to be \ndistributed proportionately to the States through formula \napportionments and also to allocated programs. This conference report \nis a radical departure from that and is a cause for great concern. \nStates receive less money in this conference report than is called for \nunder TEA 21. For that reason, this conference report is in violation \nof TEA 21.\n  I am dismayed to have to voice my concern regarding an otherwise \nbeneficial transportation bill. However, as an author of TEA 21 and a \nbeliever in its principles, I am saddened to see TEA 21 violated at the \nexpense of the States.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the \ntransportation appropriations conference report.\n  First, I wish to commend the Appropriations Committee members for \ntheir determination to protect our highways from unsafe Mexican trucks.\n  I am not eager for trucks to freely cross from Mexico into the United \nStates, for many reasons, but I am pleased that these trucks will at \nleast be required to pass a safety compliance review.\n  The remainder of my comments have to do with the portion of the \nconference report that funds the Federal-aid highway program.\n  As the ranking member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwith authorizing jurisdiction over the highway program, I am pleased \nwith the overall funding level for Federal-aid highways.\n  As my colleagues will recall, one of the major accomplishments of \nTEA-21, passed by Congress in 1998, was that for the first time, gas \ntax revenues into the Highway Trust Funds were guaranteed to be \npromptly returned to the States for transportation spending.\n  This guarantee is accomplished with a provision in TEA-21 called \nRevenue Aligned Budget Authority, or RABA as it is known.\n  RABA calculations compare actual gas tax receipts to our 1998 \nestimates, and guaranteed funding will go up or down depending on \nwhether we have more or less revenue in the Highway Trust Fund than \nTEA-21 anticipated.\n  Reflecting several years of a strong economy, gas tax receipts have \nbeen billions of dollars more than we anticipated in 1998.\n  This year, as guaranteed by TEA-21, the Federal-aid highway program \nis funded at almost $33 billion ($32.954 billion); an increase of about \n$1.2 billion over last year; which includes $4.5 billion from RABA \nfunds.\n  As I said, I am pleased with the success of these funding guarantees.\n  But I am concerned about the diversion of over $1.5 billion to \nproject earmarks instead of being distributed fairly under formulas \ndeveloped in TEA-21.\n  There are 590 project earmarks from the Highway Trust Fund, and 55 \nmore highway projects taken from the general fund.\n  I want to alert my colleagues to such extensive earmarking contained \nin this appropriations report.\n  This earmarking is mostly within discretionary programs created in \nTEA-21 and mostly funded with the RABA funds.\n  Almost a billion dollars in RABA funds are diverted away from the \nfair distribution that we agreed to in TEA-21, and are used for \nearmarks in this conference report.\n  This money does not get distributed evenly as authorized in TEA-21, \nbut there are winners and losers.\n  Some States get a lot of this money for projects, some get very \nlittle.\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\n  This process completely distorts the funding formulas we agreed to in \nTEA-21.\n  It also distorts the discretionary programs we created in TEA-21 for \nprojects that meet specified criteria.\n  For instance, one pilot program we created to fund local projects \nthat link transportation and community needs, for instance, was \nauthorized in TEA-21 at $25 million per year.\n  This year, that program has become the catch-all for project \nearmarks, with a total of 219 projects at a cost of $276 million.\n  This is incredible that a small discretionary program has grown to an \nearmarking account at over 10 times the authorized amount.\n  The Appropriations Committee began earmarking these TEA-21 accounts a \nfew years ago, over strong objections from the authorizing committees, \nand the practice has grown exponentially each year.\n  Indeed, the Appropriations Committee has begun the practice of \nsoliciting project requests, creating a terrible dilemma where the \nnumber of projects that Members submit far exceed any authorized \namounts.\n  And now Members have no choice but to compete for these discretionary \nfunds in the appropriations process.\n  I admit to requesting projects for my State that received funding \nonly because the pot of money grew so large, again from $25 million to \n$276 million.\n  The Appropriations Committee has gone further now than in recent \nyears toward making so many transportation project funding decisions.\n  I believe strongly that State and local agencies are responsible for \ntransportation planning and funding decisions.\n  I much prefer to send Highway Trust Fund dollars back to the States \nand I do not think Congress should pick and choose projects.\n  Where any fault for this situation rests with the framework in TEA-\n21, we will address it in the reauthorization of TEA-21.\n  Next year the Environment and Public Works Committee will begin \nhearings on reauthorization, and I know that there is a lot of concern \nabout this earmarking process.\n  I will vote in favor of this conference report for the good it \ncontains, but I am compelled to register my strong objections to the \nhundreds of highway projects that do not belong in an appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to take a moment while the \ntransportation appropriations conference report is pending before us to \nexpress my concern, as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which \nhas jurisdiction over the Federal transit laws, about a provision in \nthat report that attempts by report language to rewrite established law \nby reducing the Federal match for New Start transit projects from 80 \npercent to 60 percent. I am referring to language in the conference \nreport that would ``direct [the Federal Transit Administration] not to \nsign any new full funding grant agreements after September 30, 2002 \nthat have a maximum federal share of higher than 60 percent.'' The \nSenate Banking Committee will begin to consider transit reauthorization \nissues next year. In the meantime, we have not had the benefit of any \nhearings or other public debate on this issue that would justify such \nreport language.\n  Over 200 communities around the country, in urban, suburban, and \nrural areas, are considering light rail or other fixed guideway transit \ninvestments to meet their growing transportation needs. Recognizing \nthis increasing demand, Congress in 1998 passed the Transportation \nEquity Act for the 21st Century, which authorized almost $8.2 billion \nover 6 years to fund these New Starts projects.\n  The process for evaluating and awarding a Federal grant under the New \nStarts program is laid out in the Federal transit laws, found in \nsection 5309 of Title 49, United States Code. Section 5309(h) specifies \nthat ``[a Federal] grant for [a New Starts] project is for 80 percent \nof the net project cost, unless the grant recipient requests a lower \ngrant percentage.'' By including language in the conference report--not \nin the statute--directing the FTA not to sign new full funding grant \nagreements after September 30, 2002 with a Federal share greater than \n60 percent, the conferees are seeking to direct the FTA to act contrary \nto existing law.\n  Efforts to alter the Federal share would disrupt the level playing \nfield established when the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency \nAct--ISTEA--set forth the 80 percent Federal cap for both highway and \ntransit projects. ISTEA created a funding system by which communities \ncould choose between transportation modes based on local needs, not \nbased on the amount of Federal money available for the project. Seeking \nto lower the Federal match for transit projects while keeping the \navailable highway match at 80 percent has the potential to skew the \ndynamics of choice for local communities.\n  It is true that there is very strong demand for New Starts funding. \nThis is an issue which will be thoroughly considered as the transit \nlaws are reauthorized in less than two years' time. Given the \nimportance of the New Starts program to communities around the country, \nany proposal for dealing with this issue should be thoroughly \nconsidered. Report language directions to the FTA to act contrary to \nexisting law are not a constructive contribution to this thorough \nconsideration.\n\n\n                            bus replacement\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the conference report indicates that $5 \nmillion is provided for bus replacement in Iowa. But, it is my \nunderstanding that the intent was to allow these funds which have been \nallocated in a collaborative process involving the Iowa DOT and the \nlocal transit authorities to be used for bus replacement, bus expansion \nand for facility and equipment costs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senator from Iowa is correct \nregarding the allocation of these funds. The intention is that the \nfunds may be used for the authorized purposes that you noted.\n\n\n        funding of transportation security improvement measures\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I say to Senator Murray, I would like to confirm my \nunderstanding that between the funding you have included in the \nconference report for the Transportation Security Administration and \nthe funding included in the bill for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration's research, engineering and development, there are \nsufficient funds for the expanded use of existing technology and \nresearch and development of new technology to improve aviation \nsecurity. Is that correct?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. The funds appropriated are \nintended to cover those costs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask the Senator to ask the time be equally divided and \nrequest he retain the remainder of the time of the chairman and ranking \nmember toward the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the information of all Members, the \nmajority leader has indicated that the vote on this matter will occur \nat 12:30 today.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the quorum call \nwill be charged as previously specified.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, how much time am I allowed?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 8 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I shall not take all 8 minutes. I \nunderstand there is a long line of people\n\n[[Page S12335]]\n\nwishing to speak on this conference report later.\n  First of all, I compliment the chairman and ranking member from the \nSenate side. I think they have done an extraordinary job on the \nconference report. I appreciate the work they have done on a range of \nissues. I think the Senate owes them a debt of gratitude.\n  I could spend some long period of time talking about the important \nprovisions in this Transportation conference report. I know it took a \nlong while to get to this point. Senator Murray, chairing the \nsubcommittee on the Senate side, and others who have worked on this \nbill for some length of time undoubtedly wish this had been completed \nmuch earlier, but there were a series of things that prevented it from \nhappening. In any event, at the end of this session we have a \nconference report that contains a lot of important items for this \ncountry's transportation system. I compliment Senator Shelby and \nSenator Murray and thank them for their work.\n  I do want to say--and I will say it briefly--there are two items in \nthe conference report that provide some heartburn for me. The \nconference was required--or forced, I guess--to accept a provision \ndealing with the spending of $400,000 to put airport signs up that \ndescribe National Airport really as Reagan National Airport. This \nconference report, because the House insisted, requires the Metro \nAirport Authority to spend $400,000 changing signs so that people will \nnot be confused that they are at the airport when, in fact, the signs \nnow say ``National Airport.''\n\n  George Will had a little something to say about that in a piece in \nApril of this year. He said:\n\n       Travelers too oblivious to know they are at an airport, \n     when large, clear signs say they are, should be given those \n     little plastic pilot wings that are issued to unaccompanied \n     children taken into protective custody. The conservatives \n     want to get Congress to order Metro officials to spend \n     several thousand dollars to add Reagan's name to the station \n     signs and all references to the station on the maps.\n\n  He is talking about the station at the Metro stop.\n  He said:\n       Reagan had a memorable thing or two to say about bossy \n     Federal institutions meddling in local affairs.\n\n  I want to make the point that the House of Representatives has \ninsisted on this for some long while. I regret they forced their will \ninto this conference. I think it is a waste of $400,000 that probably \ncould have better been used, if the House had thought clearly about \nthis, for security.\n  We have a range of security needs, given post-September 11, on a \nrange of transportation systems. I would have much rather seen, if the \n$400,000 is to be spent, that it be spent on Metro security. I know the \nSenators from Washington and Alabama share my concern about that.\n  Let me make one additional point, and that is on the issue of Mexican \ntrucks. The House of Representatives had a provision that actually \nprohibited the Mexican trucks from coming into this country beyond the \n20-mile limit. The Senate provision was not as strong but was a pretty \ngood provision. I would have preferred a stronger provision. The \nprovision that came out of conference is weaker than both.\n  I understand the work that Senator Murray and Senator Shelby did. I \nam not here to criticize their work. I respect the work they did in \nconference to try to resolve this issue. They make the point--and it is \nan accurate point--that this is a restriction on funding for 1 year \nduring the appropriations year. So this issue will not be concluded \nwith this judgment in this conference committee. This issue will be a \npart of the interests of the authorizing committee, oversight by this \nsubcommittee, and also will be a part of the interest of others of us \nin the Congress who still believe it will be unsafe to have any \nwholesale movement of Mexican trucks beyond the 20-mile border limit.\n  It is interesting to me that we now have a limitation on the movement \nof Mexican trucks in this country, and yet Mexican truck drivers with \nMexican trucks have been apprehended in North Dakota, which, of course, \nis significantly beyond the 20-mile limit from the Mexican border. And \nit is true they have been apprehended in a good many other States as \nwell.\n  We have a lot of difficulties, problems, and concerns trying to merge \ntwo different kinds of economies with respect to transportation, two \ndifferent kinds of systems dealing with short- and long-haul trucks, \nand two different safety standards, different standards with respect to \nboth drivers and trucks.\n  I wish we had in fact had the House position, which originally came \nto conference with a prohibition until adequate safety standards were \nin place and adequate inspection opportunities were in place. That, \nregrettably, is not the case. And I am not here to suggest that our two \nSenators--Senator Murray and Senator Shelby--in any way weakened this \nprovision. I am here to say the conference itself forced that \nweakening. I think that will not and cannot be the last word on this \nsubject. Those on the authorizing committee and those of us who will \nreturn to this subject in the appropriations process next year will \nhave more to say.\n\n  But having spoken on both of those issues, let me again say to my \ncolleague, Senator Murray, and my colleague, Senator Shelby, they \noperate in good faith and do an extraordinary job. They run a \nsubcommittee that is very important to this country, especially again \nin relation to post-September 11, the issue of transportation, the \nsecurity of our transportation systems in the country.\n  Our transportation industry is so important to this country's \neconomy. There is no way you can overstate it. The appropriations bill \noffered to us today by Senators Murray and Shelby is an appropriations \nbill that I think the Senate will want to approve. This conference \nreport will get the Senate's approval today.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator will withhold, the \nChair recognizes the Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the time be \ndivided as before.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand under the UC I have 15 \nminutes; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has been reduced by a series of \nquorum calls. The Senator has 6 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Six minutes. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be \ngranted 4 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong opposition to \nthe conference agreement on H.R. 2299, the fiscal year 2002 \nTransportation appropriations bill approved by the House and Senate \nconferees last week.\n  I once again find myself in a position in which I must express strong \nconcerns with yet another appropriations bill. This measure, like the \neight appropriations bills approved by the Congress this year and like \nso often has been the case during recent years, continues what I \nbelieve is an inappropriate overreach by the appropriators in an effort \nto fulfill their own agendas at the expense of both current law and the \nwork of the authorizers.\n  They again are redirecting programmatic funding, funding that in many \ncases is authorized to be distributed by formula or at the discretion \nof the Secretary and based on competitive merit.\n  Instead of allowing the normal funding distribution process to go \nforward, the appropriators have earmarked that funding for pet projects \nfor the members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Before citing a host of examples of the pork barrel spending \nassociated with this conference report, I want to first address the \nvery important trade issue that the appropriators have tied to the \npending measure, that is, the North American Free Trade Agreement, \nNAFTA.\n  As my colleagues well know, provisions in both the House and the \nSenate versions of the Transportation appropriations bill proposed to \nrestrict the\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\nadministration's ability to abide by our obligations under NAFTA. As a \nresult of this fact, the Statement of Administrative Policy included a \nvery clear and direct veto threat stating that ``the Senate Committee \nhas adopted provisions that could cause the United States to violate \nour commitments under NAFTA. Unless changes are made to the Senate \nbill, the President's senior advisors will recommend that the President \nveto the bill.''\n  Several of us also strongly objected to the appropriators' actions. \nAs a result, we spent considerable floor time--nearly two full weeks in \nJuly--discussing the importance of NAFTA and our obligation to abide by \nour commitments to our trading partners.\n  At no time has the senior Senator from Texas or I argued that safety \nconcerns were not of considerable importance in this debate. In fact, \nit was our proposal offered as an alternative to the Senate version \nthat first called for an inspection of every Mexican truck similar to \nthe model used in the State of California at the border.\n  Indeed, the proponents of NAFTA have had one goal since this issue \nsurfaced in the DOT appropriations legislation this summer. From the \nbeginning, our goal has been to ensure the appropriators did not \nsucceed in their attempts through the DOT appropriations bill to \neffectively alter our solemn agreement with our neighbors to the South. \nIf our trading partners are subject to the whimsical mood of the \nappropriators, how can we ever expect any nation that we have executed \na trade agreement with, or one we are seeking to enter into trade \nagreements with, to have any faith that our word is true and we will \nabide by our agreements? If the appropriators' agenda had prevailed, I \nshudder to consider the consequences and the impact as we attempted to \nseek to negotiate new trade agreements or renewed ones.\n  After receiving assurances from the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee that he would work with the administration to \nensure the conference agreement would not include any provisions that \nwould prevent use from abiding by our NAFTA commitments, the senior \nSenator from Texas and I agreed to forgo some of our procedural rights \nand allowed the bill to go to conference without several additional \nvotes and the expenditure of additional floor time. While early into \nthe conference the Senate managers of the bill issued a release \nindicating a determination to provoke a Presidential veto, the \nappropriators finally agreed last week to incorporate provisions \nagreeable to the administration.\n  Upon hearing of the agreement with respect to Mexican trucks last \nweek, I raised reservations over some of the provisions that I felt \ncould be troublesome. However, in response to these concerns, the \nadministration has assured us the agreement is not in violation of \nNAFTA. Last Friday, November 30, the White House issued the following \nstatement of the President:\n\n       The compromise reached by the House and Senate \n     appropriators on Mexican trucking is an important victory for \n     safety and free trade. We must promote the highest level of \n     safety and security on American highways while meeting our \n     commitments to our friends to the South. The compromise \n     reached by the conferees will achieve these twin objectives \n     by permitting our border to be opened in a timely manner and \n     ensuring that all United States safety standards will be \n     applied to every truck and bus operating on our highways.\n\n  Moreover, I have received a letter from U.S. Trade Representative, \nRobert Zoellick, which states:\n\n       The Administration supports the agreement reached by the \n     House and Senate appropriators on Mexican trucking as fully \n     promoting highway safety and U.S. trade commitments. In \n     addition, it will permit the United States to meet the \n     commitments made to Mexico as part of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent a copy of that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, The United States \n           Trade Representative,\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to convey the \n     Administration's views on Section 350 of H.R. 2299, the \n     Department of Transportation's appropriations bill for fiscal \n     year 2002.\n       The Administration supports the agreement reached by the \n     House and Senate appropriators on Mexican trucking as fully \n     promoting highway safety and U.S. trade commitments. In \n     addition, it will permit the United States to meet the \n     commitments made to Mexico as part of the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert B. Zoellick.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Additionally, I note the conference report does include \nadditional funding to address the many safety related enforcement \nrequirements concerning Mexican carriers and drivers. While much of my \nstatement today will express disagreement to the actions of the \nappropriators, in this case I want to note for the record that they \nhave worked to provide sufficient funding to allow DOT to carry out the \nrequirements with respect to the Mexican trucking issue and enable the \nborder to be opened in a time-frame deemed appropriate by the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, enactment of this legislation will not be the end of \nour due-diligence to ensure we are allowed to open the border to \nMexican carriers and in turn, allow American carriers to do business in \nMexico. I intend to stay vigilant on this very important issue and will \nmonitor the administration's actions with respect to the border opening \nin my capacity as ranking member of the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation. I remain committed to doing all I can to \nensure the border is open consistent with our obligations under NAFTA \nwhile protecting the safety of the American traveling public.\n  Mr. President, this is a bittersweet victory for highway safety and \nfree trade. On the one hand the United States will be allowed to keep \nits promise to abide by its solemn treaty. Yet on the other hand, the \negregious process of pork barrel earmarking continues. Unless you are \nfrom a state with a member on the Appropriations Committee, your \nState's transportation dollars most likely will be reduced by enactment \nof this bill which in many cases redirects authorized funding programs \nfor the sake of the home-state projects of the appropriators.\n  I recognize that there are very important provisions in the \nlegislation, sections that appropriate funds for programs vital to the \nsafety and security of the traveling public and our national \ntransportation system over all. Yet despite that necessary funding, and \nthe fact that the legislation is not in violation of NAFTA, it once \nagain goes overboard on pork barrel spending.\n  It is so bad, in fact, yesterday's Wall Street Journal included an \narticle highlighting the very egregious actions of the appropriators to \nreduce state transportation dollars and direct those funds to earmarked \nprojects. The article is entitled ``Bill Gains To Cut State-Controlled \nHighway Funds.'' I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            Bill Gains To Cut State-Controlled Highway Funds\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Washington.--In a total display of patronage politics, \n     Congress is poised to remove nearly $450 million of federal \n     highway aid from state control to instead spend the money on \n     road projects selected by lawmakers.\n       The appropriations leadership added the provision to a \n     $59.6 billion transportation budget for fiscal-year 2002 that \n     was filed just before dawn Friday and rushed through the \n     House hours later, where it passed 371-11. Tight limits on \n     Senate debate all but ensure final passage this week, despite \n     complaints that lawmakers are tampering with funding formulas \n     laid out in the 1998 highway act.\n       Until the dust settles, it is difficult to say precisely \n     how individual states will fare, but three--Kentucky, \n     Alabama, and West Virginia--are clear winners. Rep. Hal \n     Rogers (R., Ky), who led the House negotiators, engineered \n     the arrangement and used it to corral extra dollars for his \n     state. Alabama had three votes at the negotiating table, \n     including Sen. Richard Shelby, the Senate's top GOP \n     negotiator. West Virginia needed only one, Sen. Robert Byrd, \n     chairman of the Appropriations panel and a master at \n     capturing highway money for his rural state. Among the four \n     largest earmarked highway accounts, Kentucky, West Virginia \n     and Alabama are promised $211 million, almost a fifth of the \n     $1.1 billion total.\n       Never before has the Appropriations leadership gone so far \n     in tampering with the 1998 highway act, which was built on \n     the premise that federal gas-tax receipts should be returned \n     quickly to the states regardless of other federal spending \n     priorities. The act\n\n[[Page S12337]]\n\n      even created a mechanism to adjust authorized highway \n     funding upward as revenue rose. In recent years, that pot of \n     money--identified by the title Revenue Aligned Budget \n     Authority, or RABA--has exploded, reaching $4.5 billion this \n     year.\n       Under the highway law, $3.95 billion was to be apportioned \n     among the states this year with the remaining $574 million \n     going to about 40 highway programs authorized in the highway \n     act and administered through the Transportation Department. \n     The bill would cut the state share to $3.5 billion and \n     combine the extra $450 million with the $574 million, \n     creating a $1 billion-plus pot.\n       The negotiators made wholesale changes in the priorities \n     set in the highway act, substituting projects they favor for \n     the ones preferred by the House and Senate transportation \n     committees that wrote the highway law. A $25 million \n     community-preservation pilot program, for example, ballooned \n     to $276 million, with virtually each dollar earmarked as to \n     where it should be spent.\n       The Bush administration had opened the door by proposing \n     changes in how RABA dollars are distributed. Negotiators said \n     the $3.5 billion apportioned to the states narrowly exceeds \n     the amount proposed in the president's budget, and an \n     additional $100 million has been added elsewhere to core \n     highway funds available to the states. There is little doubt \n     the deal was driven by pork-barrel politics. There were \n     bitter fights over unsuccessful Republican attempts to deny \n     money for vulnerable Democrats in conservative House \n     districts in Mississippi and Arkansas.\n       The bill would impose a much tougher safety regimen than \n     the White House had wanted for Mexican trucks that are due to \n     begin operating in the U.S. next year. The Transportation \n     Department expects to meet the requirements and open the \n     border by the spring--just a few months later than planned. \n     But the final settlement is a personal victory for Rep. \n     Martin Salo (D., Minn.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D. Wash.), the \n     two managers of the bill who had insisted lawmakers must \n     consider safety.\n       For Sen. Byrd, there will be more at stake than the \n     transportation bill. The West Virginia Democrat will be at \n     center stage again this week, which he is expected to force \n     Senate roll calls on adding more money for homeland security \n     to a pending Pentagon budget. Though the White House should \n     win an early procedural vote, Sen. Byrd appears prepared to \n     confront Republicans with the choice of accepting the money \n     or pulling down the entire military budget.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues, how much longer are \nwe going to let the appropriators subordinate the jurisdiction and \nresponsibilities of the authorizers? Didn't most of us think the multi-\nyear highway funding legislation, known as TEA-21, would essentially be \nthe law of the land through fiscal year 2003 with respect to highway \nfunding formulas and state apportionments? I guess we were wrong, given \nthe appropriations reprogramming maneuvers.\n  Let me again quote from the Wall Street Journal: ``The negotiators \nmade wholesale changes in the priorities set in the highway act, \nsubstituting projects they favor for the ones preferred by the House \nand Senate transportation committees that wrote the highway law.'' This \nis precisely why no projects should be earmarked by either the \nauthorizers or the appropriators and we should instead allow the states \nto fund the projects that meet the legitimate transportation needs of \ntheir states.\n  Mr. President, the Revenue Aligned Budget Authority--RABA--funds \nmentioned in the article are to be distributed proportionately to the \nstates through formula apportionments and to allocated programs. This \nconference report represents a fundamental departure from that \napproach.\n  To pay for some of the report's many earmarks, $423 million will be \nredirected from state apportionments, meaning the states lose 10.7 \npercent of RABA funds from the regular formula program. Further, \nanother $423 million will be redistributed from allocated programs in a \nmanner in which the appropriators have selected programmatic winners \nand losers. In fact, 24 of 38 highway funding programs will receive \nnone of the funding under RABA they were to receive before the \nappropriators' stroke of pen. But again, if you have the good fortune \nto reside in a state with a member in a leadership position on the DOT \nAppropriations Subcommittee, you are among the winners in this \nappropriations bill lottery. I ask unanimous consent that two charts \nprepared by the Federal Highway Administration to show the impact on \neach state and the allocated programs through the RABA redistributing \nwork of the appropriators be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION--ESTIMATED RABA DISTRIBUTION\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n            Federal-aid highway programs                   TEA-21            Conference           Difference\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nApportioned Programs...............................       3,968,764,800       3,545,423,946        (423,340,854)\n                                                    ============================================================\nAllocated Programs:\n    Federal Lands Highways Program:\n        Indian Reservation Roads...................          36,050,486          36,565,651            (484,835)\n        Public Lands Highways......................          32,249,049          31,815,091            (433,958)\n        Park Roads and Parkways....................          21,631,440          21,339,391            (292,049)\n        Refuge Roads...............................           2,624,255           2,586,593             (37,662)\n    National Corridor Planning & Devel. & Coord.             18,633,932         352,256,000         333,622,068\n     Border Infrastructure Pg......................\n    Construction of Ferry Boats and Ferry Terminal            5,059,012          25,579,000          20,519,988\n     Facilities....................................\n    National Scenic Byways Program.................           3,393,730           3,348,128             (45,602)\n    Value Pricing Pilot Program....................           1,464,300                   0          (1,464,300)\n    High Priority Projects Program.................         236,671,037                   0        (236,671,037)\n    Highway Use Tax Evasion Projects...............             666,113                   0            (666,113)\n    Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Highway Program....          14,642,998                   0         (14,642,998)\n    Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge.................          29,946,366                   0         (29,946,366)\n    Miscellaneous Studies, Reports, & Projects.....           2,503,665                   0          (2,503,665)\n    Magnetic Levitation Transp.

In addition to the RABA funding shell game, host of other \nactions by the appropriators merit concern. For example, section 330 of \nthe conference report appropriates $144 million in grants for surface \ntransportation projects while the Statement of Managers then earmarks \nthe entire allotment for 55 projects in 31 States. I should point out \nthat the Senate-passed version of the appropriations bill provided $20 \nmillion for these grants, not a dime of which was earmarked, while the \nHouse bill did not appropriate any funding for such grants. But through \nthe will of the conferees, the level of funding for surface \ntransportation projects grants are increased by $124 million and the \nconferees have recommended earmarks for every penny of the grant \nfunding instead of allowing it to be made available for distribution on \na competitive or meritorious basis.\n  Examples of these earmarks included in the Statement of Mangers \ninclude: $1.5 million for the Big South Fork Scenic Railroad \nenhancement project in Kentucky; $2 million for a public exhibition on \n``America's Transportation Stories'' in Michigan--this sounds like a \nvery critical and legitimate use of transportation dollars--and one of \nmy favorites, $3 million for the Odyssey Maritime Project in Seattle, \nWA. What makes this last one a highlight is that the ``Odyssey Maritime \nProject'' is not a surface transportation project of all. It is, in \nfact, a museum. But the sponsor of that project must not have wanted us \nto really know what the funding was being allocated for and instead \nchose to incorporate some cleaver penmanship to mask the true nature of \nthe so-called transportation project.\n  With respect to the Coast Guard, the conference report earmarks \n$2,000,000 for the Coast Guard to participate in an unrequested joint \nfacility that would locate a new air station in Chicago with a new \nfacility that would also house city and State facilities. The new \nmarine safety and rescue station is not justified, not requested, and \nin fact would provide duplicative air coverage already met by other \nCoast Guard air stations.\n  The conference report also earmarks $4,650,000 to test and evaluate a \ncurrently developed 85-foot fast patrol craft that is manufactured in \nthe United States and has a top speed of 40 knots. Interestingly, there \nis only one company with such a patrol craft, Guardian Marine \nInternational, LLC., and it is based in the State of Washington. The \nCoast Guard did not request this vessel, does not need this vessel, nor \ndoes this vessel meet the Coast Guard's requirements. The Coast Guard's \nresources are already stretched thin and this will only hamper its \nability to meet its new challenges since September 11. But again, the \nappropriators know best.\n  The conference report further earmarks $500,000 for the Columbia \nRiver Aquatic Non-indigenous Species Initiative--CRANSI--Center at \nPortland State University in Portland, Oregon, to support surveys of \nnonindigenous aquatic species in the Columbia River. This earmark is \ndirectly taking away much needed Coast Guard R funds that could be \nused to fight the war on drugs, protect our ports, or aid in search and \nrescue efforts.\n  And, as with other modes of transportation, the appropriators have \nlarded the DOT's aviation programs with numerous earmarks and \nauthorizing language that is within the jurisdiction of the Commerce \nCommittee. For example, the Statement of Managers earmarks more than \n$206 million in FAA facilities and equipment projects at dozens of \nspecific airports. I am not sure how the appropriators seem to know \nprecisely which pieces of equipment need to be installed at which \nairports, but I believe that we should be leaving these decisions to \nthe FAA. The more projects that are forced upon the agency, the less \nability it has to focus on those that are truly needed to enhance \nsafety and capacity.\n  The appropriators do the same thing when it comes to airport projects \nand the expenditure of discretionary funds. The Statement of Managers \nearmarks more than 100 specific airport construction projects totaling \nmore than $200 million. Once again, this is intended to take away \nsignificantly from the discretion of the FAA to determine the most \nimportant needs of the system as a whole.\n  This might be the time to remind the Secretary and the modal \nadministrators that the slew of projects included in the Statement of \nManagers are advisory only. The Statement of Managers does not have the \nforce of law and the FAA and other modal agencies must exercise its \njudgment in complying with the recommendations of the managers.\n\n  While the aviation earmarking is bad, the raiding of existing \naviation accounts for unrelated purposes is even worse. The FAA's \nAirport Improvement Program is supposed to be devoted to the \ninfrastructure needs of our nation's airports. Yet the conference \nreport take tens of millions of dollars out of AIP to pay for the FAA's \ncosts of administering AIP, the Essential Air Service program, and the \nSmall Community Air Service Developing Pilot Program. Theses are worthy \nactivities and programs, but it violates the long-established purpose \nof AIP to use monies for these things.\n  Mr. President, last year I warned that we should just as well get rid \nof DOT and let the appropriators act as the authorizing agency since \nthey so routinely substitute their own judgment for that of the \nagency's. Well, apparently I have a job in my retirement predicting the \nfuture. There is a provision in this bill that prohibits the use of any \nfunds for a regional airport in southeast Louisiana, unless a \ncommission of stakeholders submits a comprehensive plan for the \nAdministrator's approval. While that is not necessarily good \ngovernment, that is well within the agency purview. However, the bill \ngoes further and requires that if the Administrator approves the plan, \nit must be then submitted to the Appropriations Committee for approval \nbefore funds can be spent.\n  This is unconscionable. Clearly the appropriators do not want this \nairport to be funded unless they say so. Are the appropriators now \ngoing to require that every decision that is made by the oversight \nagency be approved by them first? Will the Administrator or Secretary \nhave to send letters regarding transportation policy to Congress for \napproval? Will DOT leave requests and travel schedules have to be sent \nto the Appropriations Committees? Where does this end? I understand \nthat Congress is supposed to act as a check and balance to the \nexecutive branch, but I must ask, who is serving as a check and balance \nto the appropriators? At a minimum, isn't it supposed to be the \nauthorizers? But passage of this conference report will provide clear \nproof that once again there are no checks and there is no balance.\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on but will refrain. It is hard to \nimagine but despite the seemingly unlimited\n\n[[Page S12339]]                  ____\n\nlists of projects and funding redirectives provided for in this bill, \nit actually could have been worse. The appropriators did rightly reject \nsome of the requests and wish-lists they received, such as including \nlanguage to effectively alter the federal cap on the Boston Central \nArtery Tunnel Project--the Big Dig--or to take action to eliminate the \nAmtrak self-sufficiency requirement now that the Amtrak Reform Council \nhas made its finding that Amtrak will not met its statutory directive. \nPerhaps if the requesters were appropriators, their Christmas wish list \nwould have been fulfilled as well. I tell my colleagues, I will be \ngoing all over the country discussing this egregious, outrageous \nprocedure which has gone completely out of control on a bipartisan \nbasis. Of all the years I have seen this egregious porkbarrel spending, \nthis is one of the worst.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 5 minutes \nremaining; the Senator from Alabama has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield 3 minutes of my time to the Senator from \nPennsylvania, Mr. Specter.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for \nyielding me a brief period of time to comment about an omission from \nthe appropriations conference report involving a constituent company of \nmine, Traffic.com. There had been an arrangement worked out in previous \nlegislation. This would have given Traffic.com a followup contract for \nsome $50 million where they have devised systems for monitoring traffic \non the highways so the people can be informed where there is traffic \ncongestion.\n  The first contract was awarded to Traffic.com under an arrangement \nwhere the second would follow through. There was competitive bidding \nfor the first contract. The Department of Transportation wanted \nclarification, which was added in this Chamber on an amendment which \nwas accepted to give the followup contract to Traffic.com. Then when we \nwent to conference last week, I was informed a few minutes before the \nconference began that the provision had been dropped. There had been no \nnotification.\n  When I raised the issue in the conference, I was advised there was \nlegislation which prohibited this arrangement which they characterized \nas ``sole source contracting,'' but, in fact, it was not because the \nfirst contract had been competitively bid with the understanding that \nthe second contract would follow.\n\n  In any event, our research in the interim since the conference \ncommittee met last week, to today, shows there is no legislative \nprohibition against this arrangement, even if it were sole source \ncontracting, which, I repeat again, it is not. We then discussed at the \nconference the approach of having it included in the supplemental \nappropriations bill, which we are working on now. The Appropriations \nCommittee is meeting this afternoon.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nMurray, and the distinguished ranking member, Senator Shelby, for \ncommenting at that time they would support the effort to get it in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill so we hope we can be cured at that \ntime.\n  I did want to make the brief statement on the record at this point. I \nthank Senator Shelby for yielding me the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes five seconds.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I yield that time back.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Under the authority granted to the majority leader by \nthe unanimous consent agreement of December 3, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the vote on adoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2299, the Transportation appropriations bill occur at 12:30 p.m. today, \nwithout further intervening action, and I now ask for the yeas and nays \non adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, back in July and August, the Senate spent \na lot of time talking about the safety of Mexican trucks.\n  Originally, the White House wanted to allow Mexican trucks to travel \nthroughout the United States without sufficient safety checks.\n  That raised real safety concerns for everyone from the Advocates for \nHighway & Auto Safety to the AAA of Texas.\n  The House of Representatives, meanwhile, voted to prevent any Mexican \ntrucks from traveling beyond a limited area near the border.\n  I have always believed that we could ensure our safety and promote \ncommerce at the same time.\n  So Senator Shelby and I--working with our colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle--created a commonsense safety plan.\n  The Senate turned back several amendments--and voted twice with \nstrong bipartisan super-majorities--to invoke cloture both on the \ncommittee substitute and the bill itself.\n  This summer, there were several attempts to weaken the safety \nprovisions, but the Senate consistently rejected them.\n  And I am proud to say that the final conference agreement strictly \nadheres to the outlines of the Senate bill.\n  This agreement prohibits the border from being opened to Mexican \ntrucks until the DOT implements a number of important safety measures, \nand until the DOT's inspector general has concluded a thorough audit of \nthe Department's efforts.\n  I would like to spend a moment comparing the conference agreement \nwith the administration's original plan.\n  Let me start with compliance reviews, which are comprehensive \ninspections of a trucking firm's vehicles, its management systems, and \nall of its license, insurance, and maintenance records.\n  It looks at the trucking firm's operating and violation histories and \nyields a decision as to whether the firm should be allowed to continue \noperating in the U.S.\n  Under the administration's plans, there was never going to be a \nrequirement that a Mexican trucking firm undergo a compliance review.\n  The conference agreement, however, includes a requirement that each \nand every Mexican trucking firm undergo a compliance review before \nbeing granted permanent operating authority. There are no exceptions.\n  Let's look at on-site inspections.\n  The administration never intended to require that inspections by U.S. \ntruck safety inspectors take place on-site at a Mexican trucking firm's \nfacilities.\n  The conference agreement, however, requires that U.S. truck safety \ninspectors must visit every Mexican trucking firm either when they \nconduct their initial safety examination or when they conduct a \ncompliance review to determine whether the firm should be granted \npermanent operating authority in the U.S.\n  The only exception is granted to the smallest independent operators \nin Mexico. They will be required to have these same exams conducted at \nthe border.\n  Even with this exception, it is likely that these smallest of firms \nwill be visited on-site.\n  That's because the DOT will have to conduct on-site inspections of at \nleast half of all firms and half of all the traffic volume coming into \nthe U.S.\n  Originally, the administration did not intend to verify many licenses \nwhen Mexican truckers crossed the border.\n  The DOT told us that they would verify the licenses on a random \nbasis--but deliberately avoided defining what was meant by the word \n``random.''\n  That could mean verifying 1 out of every 100 licenses or 1 out of \nevery 1,000 licenses.\n  Under the conference agreement, the DOT will be required to \nelectronically verify at least one out of every two licenses.\n  And the actual ratio will be even higher.\n  That's because the conference agreement requires that border \ninspectors verify the license of every trucker carrying hazardous \nmaterials, and every trucker undergoing a Level I inspection, and then \nrequires that inspectors\n\n[[Page S12340]]\n\nverify 50 percent of all other vehicles crossing the border.\n  On the issue of overweight trucks, the administration did not intend \nto implement any special effort to address overweight vehicles--even \nthough Mexican weight limits far exceed those in the U.S.\n  The conference agreement, however, requires that--within 1 year of \nthe date of enactment--each and every truck crossing the border at the \nten busiest border crossings between the U.S. and Mexico will be \nweighed.\n\n  In fact, the conference agreement prohibits the border from being \nopened at all--until half of these border crossings have weigh-in-\nmotion systems fully installed.\n  The administration did not intend to require that Mexican trucks \ncross the border only where DOT safety inspectors are on duty.\n  The conference agreement requires that the trucks cross where \ninspectors are on duty.\n  It also requires that they enter the U.S. at crossings where there is \nadequate capacity for the inspectors to conduct meaningful inspections \nand, if need be, place vehicles out-of-service for safety violations.\n  The DOT was planning to open the border whether or not a number of \ncritical truck safety rulemakings had been finalized and published.\n  Some of these rulemakings have been delayed for years, but the DOT \nplanned to open the border anyway.\n  The conference agreement, however, requires that the Secretary either \nimplement policy directives or publish interim final rules that will \nimmediately govern the behavior of trucking firms--before the border \ncan be opened.\n  Now let's look at the hauling of hazardous materials across the \nborder. The administration had not planned on implementing any unique \nrequirements for hazardous materials trucks even though they represent \na unique and dangerous threat on our highways.\n  The conference agreement, however, requires that even if other trucks \nhave already been allowed to cross the border no hazardous material \ntrucks will be allowed to enter the U.S. until the governments of the \nU.S. and Mexico enter into a separate agreement confirming that U.S. \nand Mexican drivers of these vehicles have been subjected to the same \nunique requirements.\n  Finally, concerning the oversight of the inspector general, the \nadministration was planning to open the border without regard to the \nlong list of safety deficiencies that had been cited by the DOT \ninspector general.\n  As far as the DOT was concerned, the inspector general could continue \nto publish as many critical audits as he wanted to--but they were going \nto open the border on January 1 without regard to whether any of the \ndeficiencies had been addressed.\n  There wasn't even a process in place to require the Transportation \nSecretary to acknowledge the findings of the IG.\n  Under the conference agreement, no trucks may cross the border until \nthe IG has completed another entire audit of the DOT's efforts.\n  And no trucks may cross the border until the Transportation Secretary \nhas received the IG's findings and has certified in writing, in a \nmanner addressing each of those findings, that the opening of the \nborder does not present an unacceptable risk to our constituents.\n  So, the conference agreement includes a serious mechanism to hold the \nTransportation Secretary accountable for his decision to open the \nborder.\n  And you can be sure that the Transportation Appropriations \nsubcommittee will be holding a hearing with both the Transportation \nSecretary and the inspector general once the IG has made his findings \nand the Secretary is poised to issue his certification.\n  Some observers have suggested that the requirements of the conference \nagreement are not as restrictive as the measures that passed the \nSenate.\n  As I view it, the safety requirements are effectively the same.\n  The conference agreement gives the administration a degree of \nflexibility in implementing these safety requirements.\n  Others have said that the border is likely to open more quickly under \nthe provisions of the conference agreement than under the Senate-passed \nbill.\n  That may be true. But I want to remind my colleagues that, it has \nnever been our goal to keep the border closed.\n  I voted for NAFTA.\n  I represent a state that is highly-dependent on international trade.\n  And I believe in the economic benefits that come with lower trade \nbarriers.\n  Throughout this entire process, my goal--and that of Senator Shelby--\nhas been to ensure the safety of our highways.\n  And I am proud that this conference agreement makes great progress \nfor our safety.\n  I am prepared to yield back all of our time on the bill if there is \nno one to speak.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12340-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12340-S12344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMPREHENSIVE RETIREMENT SECURITY AND PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2001--\n                                Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2202 to Amendment No. 2170\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2202 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2202 to amendment No. 2170.\n\n  (Purpose: To strike the provision related to directed scorekeeping)\n\n       Strike section 105(c).\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I put before the Senate an interesting, \nsimple amendment that we as a Senate should adopt. I hope this \namendment is aired for a while. Because Senators have asked me not to, \nI do not have any intention to move rapidly. Other Senators are \npresently indisposed and they might come and perhaps become cosponsors. \nWe will see what we can do.\n  But I want to make sure the Domenici amendment No. 2202 will not be \nmistaken for anything other than what it is. This amendment is not a \nkiller amendment with reference to the underlying amendment. The \nrailroad retirement bill will in no way be damaged by this amendment. \nThis amendment is just a very simple recognition that the bill has some \nlanguage in it that shouldn't be in it. As much as we want to do for \nthe railroad retirees and for all of those who have joined in a rather \nmass number of Senators who want to see this happen--that is, passage \nof the bill--they actually should join in saying we want to do this. \nBut we want to be honest with the American people in terms of what the \nbill costs and how you should score the actual costs against the \nTreasury.\n  My amendment would strike what we call directed scorekeeping language \nout of section 105. This technical language inserted just before the \nHouse passed the bill instructs the Office of Management and Budget to \ndeviate--let me go slow here so everybody will get it--from the \nstandard accounting practice when implementing this bill.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the provision allowing \nprivate investment in equities would increase outlays by $15.3 billion \nin 2002. That means, if you follow the way we do things in a normal \nmanner pursuant to the rules and guidelines in the law, this bill adds \n$15.3 billion in increased outlays.\n  That is a matter of the Congressional Budget Office doing its work \nand telling us the answer when they are asked\n\n[[Page S12341]]\n\nthe question, How much does the bill cost? What do you put on the books \nof the United States?\n  They did their work. Now this bill, at the last minute, deviates from \nthe standard accounting to the extent of $15.3 billion.\n\n  If my amendment is agreed to, which strikes the language permitting \nthe deviation and permitting the violation of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, it does nothing, except it puts before us the reality, the \ntruth. It doesn't cause the bill to be any more or any less in \nconformance with the rules and the Congressional Budget Office. It \ndoesn't make the bill subject to a point of order. It is already \nsubject to that. That has nothing to do with this amendment that I am \noffering to clarify and make consistent this bill, and make it \nconsistent with what we ought to do in following the language and \nprocess and past procedures with reference to the estimated cost.\n  Once again, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \nprovision allowing private investment in equities would increase \noutlays by $15.3 billion in 2002. It doesn't say you can't do it. It \ndoesn't say you shouldn't do it. It just says if you do it, report it. \nJust put it in here. Ask the Congressional Budget Office and report \ntheir answer. Don't ask the Congressional Budget Office and then say, \nregardless of their answer, which we are supposed to follow, we are \ngoing to determine and declare that we are not going to follow it.\n  That is called directed scoring--telling them how to score things \ncontrary to the rules, contrary to reality, and contrary to the way we \nhave been doing it.\n  That is pathetic. We shouldn't do that on any bill.\n  I repeat that it does not kill the bill. It does not damage the bill. \nIt just reports the reality of the bill for bookkeeping and \nscorekeeping, which I believe the American people want. They don't want \none bill, as good as it is, to have inserted in it just before it \npasses the House language saying that whatever the reality and the \ntruth is, don't report it this time for this bill. Just report it \nanother way.\n  All I do is strike that language saying report it that way. It is a \nvery simple idea. It is simple to understand. Just take that language \nout, return it to language which an ordinary, everyday bill of this \ntype would have had in it and should be expected to be part of what we \ndo.\n  By preventing the OMB from reporting that expenditure as an outlay, \nthis, in fact, deviates from; it distorts. It makes us look at \nsomething and say it isn't what it is. That is a good way to say it. We \njust put language in saying no matter what it is, it isn't. I am saying \nno matter what it is, it is, in taking out the language that would do \nthe contrary.\n  The Government has always recorded any investment from equities to \nresearch and development and to education and training as an outlay. \nThe Government should get a good rate of return on all types of \ninvestments. In contrast to private sector accounting, we record these \ninvestments as an expenditure because the Government operates under \ncash accounting rules. We certainly cannot use that fact as a reason \nfor changing it. If we are going to choose to change that system of \naccounting, we shouldn't do it selectively for one bill, no matter how \ngood the bill is, and no matter how much support it has. You ought to \nchange the whole system after a thoughtful evaluation of whether we \nshould continue to use that kind of an approach.\n  I will not go into the reasons why the Federal Government uses the \ncash accounting system instead of an accrual accounting system. But I \nwill say that the Federal Government has operated under cash accounting \nrules since 1789, the first year Congress appropriated $639,000 to \ncover the expenses of our new government. This isn't the time to change \nthe rules. Obviously, it is neither the time, nor the bill. It is a \nbill with great support. I am going to support it. It seems to have \nhuge support. We will get it done, but we ought not choose the bill to \nchange the rules of accounting that have existed for our Government \nsince 1789, the first time Congress appropriated $639,000 as our \nexpenditure.\n\n  We know, from example, in the private sector that bending the \naccounting rules creates confusion for the same reason we should not \nbend the accounting rules of the Federal Government to suit our \npurpose. Doing so reduces transparency and misleads the public.\n  If my amendment is not agreed to, this bill will set a troubling \nprecedent for Social Security. Under current accounting practices, both \nthe Government and the privately controlled investments of Social \nSecurity funds in stocks are treated consistently. They would increase \noutlays. If Government-controlled investments were not reported as \noutlay proposals to collectively invest in Social Security, the assets \nwould have a significant advantage over proposals to create individual \naccounts. I don't think that should be done. Certainly we wouldn't want \nto use this as a precedent for that.\n  That is one of the problems when you violate precedent and pluck \nsomething out and say, we are not going to use it now, for whatever \nreason. We would rather not show the accounting as it is or for real.\n  Specifically, the proposals to have the Government invest in Social \nSecurity assets would be free, whereas proposals to establish \nindividual accounts would cost trillions of dollars.\n  We understand that is not justified. This bill should not be used as \nsomething that gives impetus to that conclusion in a completely \ndifferent area of huge confusion.\n  Regardless of whether you support individual accounts for Social \nSecurity, as the President's commission is about to propose, or \ncollective investments such as President Clinton proposed, it doesn't \nmake much sense for budget rules to save one policy over another. That \nis why I think we should be consistent, and do what is right.\n  Finally, the directed scorekeeping language in the bill creates a 306 \nbudget point of order against the entire Railroad Retirement Act.\n  The point of order prevents Congress from changing the budget rules \nunless the proposal is reported from the Budget Committee. My \namendment, by dropping the directed scorekeeping language, will ensure \nthat we follow the right accounting proposals.\n  But understand, I do not make a point of order. There are plenty of \nvotes for this bill. But I think plenty of those votes ought to be used \nto correct the accounting so there is no black mark that follows this \nbill around as to why did we have to do that. We do not have to do \nthat. We just do not have to do it.\n  At the point it went through the House, maybe it was some way to \naffect the cost and make it easier to get through because we were not \ngoing to charge so much against the surplus of the country. All of \nthose kinds of problems have long gone away. As the occupant of the \nchair knows, we have been spending the surplus for many months. All of \nthe spending that took place on behalf of the New York incident was out \nof the surplus there. We began to break the bank, so to speak.\n  So if there was some reason to manage or distort the real cost, it \ndoes not exist any longer. In fact, we should not have done it anyway. \nBut if that was the reason, it is not needed and we ought to fix it. \nThat one change will not kill this bill. It has nothing to do with the \nlife. Whether it is good or not so good, this action just gets rid of \nsomething that puts a little black mark or maybe even a big black mark \non this bill as seeking some superattention by way of the budget rules \nthat follow this.\n  That is all I have to say. But I note the presence of the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee in this Chamber. From my standpoint, I am ready to \nproceed. But I do not want to cut anybody out of either joining me as a \ncosponsor or speaking.\n  So with that, I make a parliamentary inquiry. Was there a certain \namount of time allocated to the Senator from New Mexico for this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under cloture, the Senator is limited to 1 \nhour. The Senator has consumed about 14 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Inhofe tried to arrange some time \nlast week to speak when we had lots of time. The time is a little more \nconstrained today, but he has always been\n\n[[Page S12342]]\n\nso easy to work with, and I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks and those of Senator Conrad, the Senator from Oklahoma be \nrecognized for up to 40 minutes. Of course, the time would be charged \nagainst the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for me to speak against Senator Domenici and \nSenator Conrad is difficult. I work very closely with Senator Domenici. \nWe have been on the Appropriations Committee working side by side on a \nnumber of issues, including the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, of which I have been chairman and he has been chairman, \nback and forth. Of course, Senator Conrad and I came to the Senate \ntogether. There is no one I have more respect for than Senator Conrad \nand for his integrity and his absolute brilliance. So for me to speak \nagainst something on which they agree is difficult. But as much respect \nas I have for both of these outstanding men, it does not mean they are \nalways right. I respectfully submit that what they are trying to \naccomplish now is wrong.\n  Leave it in the bill is basically what my message is. I know I speak \nfor the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and I know I \nspeak for the majority leader, Senator Daschle, when I say this.\n  The House-passed bill includes directed scorekeeping language. This \nlanguage would require the CBO and OMB to treat the purchase of private \nsector securities by the new railroad retirement trust as a means of \nfinancing rather than as an outlay. OMB sets the official rules right \nnow. Under those rules, the purchase of private sector securities is \nscored as an outlay just as any other purchase of goods and services \nwould be scored.\n  However, the issue of how to score the purchase of private sector \nsecurities is really a very gray area. Unlike the purchase of goods and \nservices, the purchase of private sector securities does not diminish \nthe financial and budgetary wealth of the Government. So a case could \nbe made that these purchases should not be scored as outlays. In such a \ncase, a means of financing Federal deficits is a technical term for the \nbudgetary category of the purchases. The primary means of financing \nFederal deficits historically has been Federal borrowing.\n  Those who would like to continue the current OMB scoring rules would \nargue that almost all the Federal budget is on a cash basis. From that \nperspective, the purchase of private sector securities requires cash \nand should be treated the same as any purchase of goods and services.\n  I do not have an opinion as to which is the best approach, which is \nsuperior. I think they both work. However, from a pragmatic point of \nview--and that is where I am today--this legislative session is winding \ndown. We are facing a serious time constraint if we are going to be \nable to enact this important legislation this year.\n  The railroads have been working and trying to get something such as \nthis done for decades. For once, now we have victory in our grasp. The \nrailroad companies and the unions, which rarely agree on the time of \nday, have agreed on this package. I think it is a victory that we \nshould not let fall from our grasp.\n  If this amendment passes, it is gone. Everyone should understand, it \nis gone. Why? Because this bill will not pass this year.\n  There are very few days left in the calendar. The House has already \npassed this legislation, the legislation that is basically before us, \nthat includes directed scorekeeping, by a vote of 384 to 33. It was not \na close call in the House: 384 to 33.\n  If we pass a bill that does not have directed scorekeeping, then we \nface one of three scenarios. No. 1, we have to go to conference. If \nthis happens, curtains this year, this legislation is all through. No. \n2, the House could send back our bill with an amendment in \ndisagreement. In that case, there would not be enough time on the \nSenate floor to deal with this possibility. No. 3, the House could \nagree with our bill.\n  Under two of the three outcomes, the bill would not be enacted this \nyear. We do not know which of the three outcomes will occur, but I have \nan idea. It is just too risky to proceed in this way. The prudent \ncourse of action is to leave the directed scorekeeping language in this \nbill, the legislation before us.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. President, we have come a long way to arrive at a point where we \nactually have in our grasp this bill on which we can vote. I hope this \namendment, while well intentioned by two fine Senators, both of whom \nwant to protect their budget jurisdiction--I just think, in this \ninstance, they are wrong. I think it would be much better if we went \nthrough with this legislation, followed the lead of the House.\n  The House, as I indicated, passed this bill overwhelmingly. I think \nif we did that, we would have a lot of happy widows, we would have a \nlot of happy railroad retirees; of course, we would have a railroad \nindustry that would be much stronger and firmer.\n  I know in Nevada we have watched the railroads come through our \nState. We had a merger of Union Pacific coming through the northern \npart of the State on very shaky ground. But they were able to pull \nthemselves out. We have done a number of remarkable things with the \nrailroad to help them move more traffic because of the merger. One \nexample is that they have come forward and we are building a depressed \nrailroad sector through Reno to make it a much better, quieter program \nthan we have had with railroads in the entire history of railroads \ncoming through Nevada. All this amendment will do is set that back, and \nthen many other things we have been able to accomplish. But of course \nthe thing that really hurts has to do with the railroad retirees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to support the amendment of \nthe Senator from New Mexico, the distinguished ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Conrad. As chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, it is really welcome that he would join me in \nthis endeavor.\n  As a matter of fact, I believe by his joining, he makes the case that \nwe are not trying to kill this bill. He has been a staunch advocate. I \njust told railroad retirees I am voting for the bill. I didn't tell \nthem, nor did I tell the Senator, that I used to work for the railroad. \nI was a baggage clerk when I was 22. It was a fun job. I didn't work \nlong enough to be part of any of this program. I want everybody to \nknow, I have no interest. It was a great summer job. I became friends \nwith some wonderful railroaders.\n  I repeat, so that nobody misunderstands the Senator's views, this \ntakes out of the bill some language that is not needed for this bill \nand that in essence treats this bill in a way that says what is isn't; \nit is going to cost this much, but it is not going to cost it because \nwe wrote language in the bill saying it isn't.\n  That is not the way to pass a bill. We don't do that for anybody on \nanything.\n  I welcome the Senator's support. I think it is a good way for him to \nstart his chairmanship, saying that he is going to watch the rules \ncarefully and abide by them. I thank the Senator so much for joining \nme.\n  (Mrs. CARNAHAN assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. My great-grandfather was a foreman \non the railroad. My great-grandparents, when they went on their \nhoneymoon, went on a pushcart for 100 miles on the railroad.\n  I do strongly favor this bill. I have to answer to my responsibility \nas chairman of the Budget Committee and as a Member of this body to be \naccurate with our colleagues as to the scoring of this legislation.\n  Directed scoring, if we are to be blunt about it, is to say something \ndoesn't cost when we know that it does. I have an obligation to my \ncolleagues to report accurately to them this legislation. I have been a \nstaunch supporter of this bill the entire time it\n\n[[Page S12343]]\n\nhas been before the Senate. It represents an extraordinary effort by \nthe rail companies and their employees and labor to work together to \nimprove the lives of thousands and thousands of rail workers and their \nfamilies.\n  I agree this legislation provides an important opportunity to \nmodernize the rail pension program. I have received countless e-mails, \nphone calls, faxes, and letters from North Dakota rail workers and \ntheir spouses who have told me how important this legislation is to \nthem and their families.\n  Some of my dearest friends and strongest supporters are in favor of \nthis legislation. I am in favor of the legislation. But I have a \nspecial responsibility as chairman of the Budget Committee to give an \naccurate assessment to our colleagues of the cost of legislation that \nmoves through this Chamber. That is an obligation I take seriously.\n  The directed scorekeeping provision creates the impression that the \ncost of this legislation in fiscal year 2002 has dropped from $16 \nbillion to $250 million. In reality, with or without directed \nscorekeeping, the impact on the budget in 2002 is precisely the same. \nIt is not $250 million; it is $16 billion.\n\n  That is the reality. That is the fact. With this amendment, the \nSenator from New Mexico has provided us with a second chance to review \nthe directed scorekeeping provision of this bill. He is right to do so. \nThat is why I have joined him in this effort.\n  Traditionally, those of us with special responsibility for the budget \nhave vigorously opposed directed scorekeeping because it fundamentally \nundercuts the entire system of budget controls and budget discipline \nthat is so important to the United States being fiscally prudent and \nwise. We cannot do our job of being stewards of the finances of this \ncountry if we don't report accurately and honestly to our colleagues \nthe cost of legislation.\n  That is the most fundamental responsibility of any Budget Committee \nchairman and ranking member. Senator Domenici and I are meeting our \nresponsibility by saying to our colleagues the simple fact is, this \nbill is going to cost $16 billion in fiscal year 2002 no matter what \nthe directed scorekeeping provision says. You can make it up, but it is \nnot true. The fact is, the impact on the federal budget will be $16 \nbillion.\n  That is a cost for which I am willing to vote and support, but I am \nnot willing to say it is something it is not. That is not, in my view, \nthe appropriate role for any Budget Committee chairman.\n  It is not just a matter of $16 billion in fiscal year 2002; it has \nmuch greater significance than that. If we establish the precedent that \nthrough directed scorekeeping we can say a $16 billion expense is \nreally a $250 million expense, what is next? I predict what is next is: \nWhen we get to the reform of Social Security, some will say we can \nsimply take a trillion dollars of the Social Security trust fund and \nmove it over into private accounts and say there has been no \nexpenditure. That is the implication of this vote and why it matters. \nIf we say on this bill you can take something that cost $16 billion \nand, by legislative language, direct the scorekeeping and say it \ndoesn't cost $16 billion, it costs $250 million, then others may try to \ntake a $1 trillion transfer of Social Security money and say it is cost \nfree.\n  If we start down that path, we will rue the day, if we go down the \npath of creating fiscal fictions in this Chamber in order to accomplish \neven the best of intentions.\n  This is a good bill. It is worthy of support. But the price cannot \nbe, should not be, must not be that we say to the American people that \na bill that costs $16 billion only costs $250 million. That cannot be \nthe way we do business in the Senate.\n  If that is the direction we take, I repeat to my colleagues the \nimplication because I believe the next step will be in the Social \nSecurity reform debate, that others will try to say: A trillion dollars \ntaken out of the Social Security trust fund and moved into private \naccounts doesn't cost anything. It is cost free.\n  That would not be true. That would be totally misleading. The money \nthat is in the Social Security trust fund that has been credited to the \nSocial Security trust fund, to be more accurate, has been credited to \nthat fund to meet current promises, promises already made. We can't \ntake that money and make a new set of promises and use the money that \nwas raised to keep the previous promises. It won't work. We can't use \nthe same money twice.\n  You can't use the same money twice. That is what will lead us into \nthe swamp of deficits and debt and disastrous economic decline. Make no \nmistake, what is at stake here is a big deal. This matters. This is not \na free vote. I remain committed to this legislation, but I also remain \ncommitted to being straight with our colleagues and our countrymen as \nto the cost of the legislation that is before us.\n  Our friends in the House included this directed scorekeeping back in \nJuly. It was a mistake then; it would be a mistake for us to repeat it \nhere. Those who say, well, this kills the bill --I don't accept that. \nThis legislation has to go back for further action in the House in any \nevent because of the way it has come before us. It has to go back to \nthe House for action in any event.\n  Let's pass this legislation, but let's do it right and let's do it by \nbeing straight with our colleagues and our countrymen as to its cost.\n  Mr. CARPER. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. CARPER. I, too, am a strong advocate of this legislation. I have \nspoken for it in the Chamber and in our caucus meetings as well. As the \nSenator from North Dakota and the Senator from New Mexico have \nindicated about their relatives, my grandfather was also on the \nrailroad. My grandmother lived many years on a survivor's pension from \nhis service. Whenever the chairman of the Budget Committee and the \nranking member on the Budget Committee stand to endorse an amendment, \nit gives me pause. I want to make sure in the next several minutes--\nmaybe hours--that we consider this legislation I understand the full \nramifications of the amendment or the failure to adopt the amendment.\n  Let me ask the chairman of the Budget Committee this. When I first \nlearned of the directed scorekeeping in the House of Representatives, \nwhich, as he said, is an extraordinary act, I tried to understand why \nthey may have done that. Was it chicanery or was there real logic \nbehind it?\n  As I studied the issue more, my understanding is if we were not on a \ncash basis of accounting, but an accrual basis, this probably would not \nbe an issue. Most States used to be on a cash basis of accounting. The \nmajority of States now use the accrual basis, and most States direct \nthe retirement funds into U.S. Treasury obligations. Today, it is a \nwhole array of investments, including equities, or stocks, bonds, and \nthe kinds of things envisioned here under this legislation. There are, \nas we know, tier 1 benefits under the railroad and tier 2.\n  This is my question: The tier 1 benefits mirror Social Security \nbenefits. Tier 2 are more private sector benefits. The moneys that go \ninto those tier 2 funds for payout come from the railroad companies \nthemselves--from the tax assessed on them--and also a payment by the \nrailroad employees themselves. My understanding is that those monies \nthat go into that retirement fund, paid into by the railroad companies \nand by the employees through the payroll deduction--those monies in the \nfuture will be invested not in U.S. Treasury obligations, but in a wide \nvariety of investment options. But because of the peculiarity of our \naccounting rules, because those monies will now be not spent for roads \nor any other purpose, and not for space exploration, they will still be \ninvested in the same pension benefits, but because of our accounting \nrules, those monies--simply by saying you can now invest those pension \nmonies, the trust fund monies, in non-Treasury obligations triggers a \n$15 billion outlay. Is that what this is all about? I know that is a \nlong question, but let me lay that question at the feet of our Budget \nCommittee chairman.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to respond. First of all, we use a cash method \nof accounting for the Federal budget. We do not use an accrual system. \nYou can't mix the two or you start misleading people. That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Senator's question sounds as though it is prospective in \nnature; as though simply going forward, Tier II\n\n[[Page S12344]]\n\nrevenues would not be invested in Treasurys. That is not the case in \nthis bill. In this bill, CBO estimates that approximately $16 billion \ncurrently invested in Treasurys by the Federal Government would be sold \nand instead invested through an investment trust in private-sector \nassets. Again, the amount is $16 billion and they would be free to \ninvest it in other ways. I support that.\n  But we have to be straight with people. It costs $16 billion to the \nFederal Government in the fiscal year 2002 under the accounting rules \nthat apply to every program of the Federal Government. It doesn't cost \n$250 million; it costs $16 billion. The money moves out of Government \nTreasuries and moves into a railroad investment trust, with the ability \nunder a board, to invest those moneys in higher rate of return assets. \nI support that basic notion.\n  But the hard fact is that it costs the Federal Government $16 \nbillion. It means the fact is the Federal Government will have to \nborrow $16 billion more in fiscal year 2002 than it was otherwise going \nto borrow.\n  Mr. CARPER. If the Senator will continue to yield, I have two glasses \nof water here. We will say one is the railroad pension fund as it \ncurrently exists, and it is full of U.S. Treasury obligations. There is \nanother glass here and we will pretend it is empty for our purposes. \nWhat I think we are talking about doing is taking some of the moneys \ninvested in these Treasury obligations in this one pension fund and, \npresumably, the railroad retirement fund would have to sell those \nobligations and then use the money from the sale of those obligations \nto put in their new pension fund. When they sell those, they are going \nto sell them to somebody--individuals, funds, banks, corporations. It \nis difficult for me to understand how that transaction I have just \ndescribed should cost the Treasury $16 billion. A lot of us are \nstruggling on this one.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say it as simply as I can state it. The reason it \ncosts the U.S. Treasury $16 billion is because the money moves out of \nU.S. Government Treasurys and moves over to the control of a board that \nis run by private sector representatives to be invested in non-\ngovernmental assets. That is about as easy as I can make it.\n  The fact is that the Federal Government is going to have to borrow, \nas a result of that transaction, not $250 million more, but $16 billion \nmore in 2002. For us to have our colleagues say ``but it really doesn't \nmean that'' is not accurate and it is not factual. To say to our \ncolleagues, by direct scorekeeping, by legislative fiat, that it won't \ncost $16 billion, that it won't mean the Federal Government has to \nborrow $16 billion more in 2002, that it is only going to cost $250 \nmillion more, is just not the truth. I don't know how more direct I can \nbe.\n  Mr. CARPER. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nstatement of Senator Inhofe, Senator Stabenow be recognized for up to \n15 minutes, and the time be charged against the 30 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for \n40 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12344-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12344-S12348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AN ABSOLUTE VICTORY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair. First, I say to the leadership how \nmuch I appreciate the fact you are allowing me to bust in on a \ndifferent subject. I think it is very significant at this time because \nsomething happened yesterday that I think makes it worthwhile to talk \nabout this and maybe to do so at some length.\n  Willie George was right. Lest some of you do not know who Willie \nGeorge is, some people consider Willie George a preacher, but he is \nalso a very able historian. As I listened to him and added some \nperspectives on what the attack on America was all about, I realized \nthe inside-Washington mentality is sometimes and often flawed and that \nmentality that comes from Oklahoma reflects more of real America.\n  The Apostle Paul gave us our marching orders in Ephesians 6, verses \n10, 11, and 12. He said:\n\n       Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the \n     power of his might. Put on the whole armor of God, that you \n     may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we \n     wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the \n     principalities, against the powers, against the rulers of \n     this darkness--\n\n  About which we are talking--\n\n     against the spiritual hosts of wickedness in high places.\n\n  Make no mistake about it. This war is first and foremost a spiritual \nwar. It is not a political war. It has never been a political war. It \nis not about politics. It is a spiritual war. It has its roots in \nspiritual conflict. It is a war to be fought to destroy the very fabric \nof our society and the very things for which we stand.\n  Many of the wars in history have been fought because of human desire \nor greed, to have that of a neighboring country--to have mineral \ndeposits, to have what some other country has. But this war is of a \ndifferent nature.\n  It is not just simple greed that motivated these people to kill. This \nwar has been launched against the United States of America. It is a \nspiritual attack. It is an attack that was created in the mind and \nheart of Satan. It is a demonically inspired attack. It is not just the \nselfish ambitions of an egotistical leader. It is not just someone \nwanting to hold on to power. This is nothing more than a satanically \ninspired attack against America created by demonic powers through the \nperverted minds of terrorists.\n\n  One may ask: What is it about our Nation that makes them hate us so \nmuch? Three things. First, in our country, we have the freedom and the \nright to choose the kind of worship we want. I am a born-again \nChristian. I have accepted Jesus Christ as my virtual Lord and Savior. \nI believe it is through Him that we will reach the Father. I believe \nevery American has a right to choose whether or not to believe that.\n  Some people have the notion that if you are a Christian who believes \nin the Bible, you are totally intolerant; you do not allow other people \nto have a choice. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In nations of this world where Christianity is the dominant way of \nworship, we also find Jewish synagogues, Islamic mosques; we find \nfreedom of worship. But we will not find the same kinds of freedom in \nthe militant Islamic nations of this world. They do not allow Christian \nchurches and Jewish synagogues to operate freely. They do not allow \npeople the freedom of choice. In Sudan, they sell Christians into \nslavery.\n  So one of the reasons America is hated so much is that we have \nallowed people through the years to choose what they are going to do. \nIt is choice.\n  The second reason we are hated is that we have opened the door for \npeople to achieve their God-given place on this Earth. We have not \nrestrained people. We have allowed people freedom of expression, the \nfreedom to pursue dreams, the freedom to pursue goals. This is not true \naround the world.\n  Freedom did not come cheap. One of my memories that I consider an \nadvantage for me and that I hold over many others is when I first \nstarted my education in first grade, it was in a country schoolhouse. \nNot many people here know what they are. They are eight grades in one \nroom out in the country. It was called Hazel Dell. In fact, I remember \nthree brothers who rode on a workhorse to school every morning.\n  We had a different sense of history at that time. I remember so well \nreading and learning history as a very young child in that environment. \nKeep in mind, that was the environment at the beginning of World War II \nwhen we had a sense of patriotism that is comparable to today.\n  I remember my teacher said the Pilgrims did not come to this country \nfor adventure; they did not come for excitement; they were not \nadventurous people. They came to this country to escape tyranny, to \npursue freedoms--freedom of religion and economic freedom. Half of them \ndied the first year. They knew it was going to happen. It was worth it \nto get these freedoms.\n  They had freedom of religion and economic freedom. Each was given a \npiece of property to do with as they wanted, and he could work his land \nand reap the benefits of this property. And he prospered mightily, so \nmightily that in one of his letters back to England, Smith said: Now \none farmer can grow 10 times as much corn as the previous farmers \ncould.\n\n[[Page S12345]]\n\n  They were prospering so mightily. I normally tell young people when \nyou have a good thing going, quite often someone is going to try to \ntake it away from you. That is exactly what happened. The British came \nacross the sea. They wanted in on this prosperity, and they started \nimposing laws, rules, and regulations so that the trapper on the \nfrontier could not make a hat of the pelt he caught. He had to sell it \nto British merchants at British prices to be shipped to Great Britain \non English ships to be made into a hat by English laborers to be \nshipped back and sold to the trapper, who caught it in the first place, \nat English prices. Guess what happened. God bless him, the trapper kept \nright on making his own hats.\n\n  That was treason in those days. So they sent this great army to this \ncountry, the greatest army in the world at that time, to stop these \nthings from occurring. They started marching up toward Lexington and \nConcord.\n  I remember so well sitting in that little one-room schoolhouse and \nhaving this vision of what it was really like. Farmers and trappers and \nfrontiersmen were up there. They were not well educated, but they were \nready to stop this resistance, the greatest army on the face of this \nEarth. Most of them could not read or write. As the saying goes, they \ndid not know their right foot from their left foot, so they would put a \ntuft of hay in one boot and a tuft of straw in the other boot and \nmarched to the cadence of ``hay foot, straw foot.''\n  While they were not greatly educated, they knew freedom, and they \nwere going to keep that freedom. As they stood there knowing they were \nsigning their death warrants, those soldiers, listening to the \nthundering cadence of the largest army in the world going towards \nLexington and Concord, waited until they saw the whites of their eyes \nand fired the shot heard round the world, not knowing at that very \nmoment a tall redhead stood in the House of Burgess and made a speech \nfor them, made a speech for us today:\n\n       They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so \n     formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will \n     it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are \n     totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed \n     in every house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution and \n     inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance \n     by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive \n     phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand \n     and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make proper use of those \n     means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The \n     millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and \n     in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by \n     any force which our enemy can send against us.\n\n  This is critical.\n\n       Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There \n     is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and \n     who will raise up friends to fight our battles with us. The \n     battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the \n     vigilant, the active, the brave . . . Gentlemen may cry, \n     Peace, Peace--but there is no peace . . . Why stand we here \n     idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? \n     Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the \n     price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God . . . \n     but as for me, give me liberty or give me death.\n\n  He got both.\n  These freedoms are not found in every nation. America is a great \nnation because we have magnified the rights of individuals, protected \nthe rights of individuals in our culture. We are careful to allow \npeople to have expression in our society, and we are hated for it.\n  The third reason we are hated is because we are a nation of laws. We \nare a people ruled by laws. Lest one thinks that is common, do a \ncareful study of the history of the world. Most of the world's \ncountries do not have a 200-year-old Constitution. They are ruled by \ndictators. They are ruled by the whims of those leaders or by political \nparties as they change. The rule of law is what makes civilization \npossible. The rule of law is what makes an orderly society work. If \nthere is no rule of law, the strongest, toughest bully is the one who \nruns the country.\n  America is a country of law and order because of the philosophies of \nthe people who founded this Nation. They believed in the rule of law \nbecause of what they knew from the Bible. Our Constitution and the \nconstitutions of most of the governments in the world are similar and \nare indeed based upon the Ten Commandments. Our fathers knew that the \nTen Commandments and the laws of God were a basis for all laws. They \nunderstood the concepts of absolute right and absolute wrong. There \nwere not many who believed in what we today call situational ethics \nwhere things change according to our needs. They believed in absolute \nright and absolute wrong. America was founded on those principles. That \nis a reason we are hated so much as a nation. We are hated because of \nthe fact we are a beacon of light, a beacon of freedom all the way \naround the world. We know contemporarily what this means.\n  One of the greatest speeches of all times was ``A Rendezvous with \nDestiny'' made by Ronald Reagan before he was into politics. He talked \nabout the atrocities committed in Castro's Communist Cuba and about the \nlittle boat that escaped and washed up on the southern shores of \nFlorida. When the boat came up, a man who escaped talked about what was \nhappening in Communist Cuba. When he was through talking about the \natrocities, a woman said: I guess we in this country don't know how \nlucky we are.\n  He said: No, no. It is how lucky we are because we had a place to \nescape to.\n  What he was saying was, we were that beacon of freedom. Many, \nincluding the Senator sitting to my right, will remember 15 years ago \nwhen the Communists, then the Soviet Union, were trying to get a \nfoothold in Nicaragua and the freedom fighters were fighting for their \nfreedom. I remember going down there, watching them fight against \nimpossible odds. There is no way they could win, by normal concept. \nThey were fighting.\n  There was a hospital tent in Nicaragua. It was half the size of this \nSenate Chamber. I remember so well, this is where the freedom fighters \nfrom Nicaragua would come in and get taken care of medically. There was \nan operating table in the middle of this giant tent. All they did was \namputations. The problem was, of course, the mines. They had the beds \nof all the patients around the perimeter of this hospital tent.\n  I went around and talked to the individuals. The average age of the \nfighter in Nicaragua at that time was 19 years old. All the older ones \nwere either maimed or killed. I used to be a pilot in Mexico and I \ncommunicate well.\n  I asked each one: Why is it you are doing this against impossible \nodds? Why are you doing this? Why are you fighting?\n  I got to the last bed. Her name was Maria Gonzalez. I asked her that \nquestion. She was 18 years old, weighed 90 pounds, and this was her \nthird trip back to the hospital tent. They amputated her leg that \nmorning. Blood was coming through the bandages. That little girl said: \nWe are fighting because they have taken everything we have, our farms, \nour houses, all that we have. Surely you in the United States don't \nhave to ask that question because you had to fight for your freedoms \nagainst the same odds that we are doing today. And with God's help, we \nwill win, as you, with God's help, won.\n\n  That little girl didn't know whether our Revolution was fought 25 \nyears ago or 150 years ago. But she was brilliant in her knowledge of \nfreedom. We were the beacon of hope. We were the beacon of freedom.\n  Do you know the outcome? We are hated because we are the beacon of \nfreedom for the rest of the world. We are hated because in America we \nhave freedom of choice and freedom of worship, we have freedom of \nexpression, and we are a nation of laws.\n  Now, why was America attacked on September 11? Why did they single us \nout? America was attacked because of our system of values. It is a \nspiritual war. It is not just because we are Israel's best friend. We \nare Israel's best friend in the world because of the character we have \nas a nation. We came under attack and we are Israel's best friend.\n  One of the reasons God has blessed our country is because we have \nhonored his people. Genesis 12:3 says: I will bless them who bless you. \nI will curse him who curses you. This is God talking about Israel.\n  Madam President, on the table where you sit is a Bible. You can look \nit up. He said: I will bless them who bless you. I will curse him who \ncurses you. God is talking about Israel.\n  One of the reasons America has been blessed abundantly over the years \nis\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\nbecause we as a society have opened our doors to Jewish people. Jewish \npeople have been blessed in the United States of America. When the tiny \nState of Israel was founded in 1948, we stood in the beginning with \nIsrael. We were the first country to stand up for Israel. Because we \ntook a stand, other nations in the world followed after very quickly. \nThe United States made it possible for there to be an Israel. We stood \nwith Israel again and again and again in its fight to survive.\n  Make no mistake. It is not just because of our support of Israel. It \nis what we believe as a nation that caused us to come under attack.\n  Recently in the city of Durban, South Africa, there was a conference \ncalled the World Conference on Racism. African Christians are being \nslaughtered by the thousands today by Islamic fundamentalists in Sudan. \nYou didn't hear a lot about that in the reports of this conference; you \ndidn't hear about racism in South Africa. I have a mission in west \nAfrica and have become pretty familiar with some of the atrocities and \nthe ethnic cleansing going on in the world today.\n  I can remember standing at this podium when we were under a different \nPresident. He was trying to get us to send troops into Kosovo, and used \nin his arguments in Kosovo all the ethnic cleansing and the difficulty \ngoing on. I said at that time, for every one person who is killed, who \nis ethnically cleansed in Kosovo, on any given day there are over 100 \nwho are killed and ethnically cleansed in west Africa alone. Do we hear \nabout that? No, we didn't hear about that at the Conference on Racism. \nWhat you heard was how the nations of the world came together and \ndecided all the attention should be focused on the tensions in the \nMiddle East. They were appeasing the terrorists.\n  Israel is under attack in the Middle East because it is the only true \ndemocracy that exists in the Middle East. There are more than 20 Arab \nnations in north Africa and in the Middle East. Virtually every Arab \nnation is run by either a king or a dictator. Israel is the only true \ndemocracy that exists in the Middle East.\n\n  Madam President, did you know if you are an Arab and have an Israeli \ncitizenship, you can vote in the country of Israel? Did you know the \nArabs have parties in the Knesset, the Congress of Israel? Israel is \nthe only true democracy that exists in the Middle East. It has a \nWestern form of government based on the laws we see in the Bible. The \nlaws of God that our country is based on are the same laws from which \nIsrael gets its law. It represents the laws of God. That is the reason \nit is under attack.\n  We ought to be Israel's best friend. If we cannot stand for Israel \ntoday, can we ever again be counted on as a beacon of hope, a beacon of \nfreedom for oppressed nations? You may ask what does this have to do \nwith the attack on America? We are under attack because of our \ncharacter and because we have supported the tiny little nation in the \nMiddle East. That is why we are under attack. If we don't stand for \nthis tiny country today, when do we start standing for tiny little \ncountries in the world that are right?\n  Yasser Arafat and others do not recognize Israel's right to the land. \nThey don't recognize Israel's right to exist.\n  I will discuss seven things I consider to be indisputable and \nincontrovertible evidence and grounds to Israel's right to the land. \nYou have heard this before, but it has never been in the Record. Most \nknow this. We are going to be hit by skeptics who are going to say we \nare being attacked all because of our support for Israel, and if we get \nout of the Middle East all of the problems will go away. That is not \nso. It is not true. If we withdraw, it will come to our door and will \nnot go away. I have some observations to make about that in just a \nminute, but first the seven reasons that Israel has the right to the \nland.\n  Israel has a right to the land because of all the archeological \nevidence. This is reason No. 1. It all supports it. Every time there is \na dig in Israel, it does nothing but support the fact that Israelis \nhave had a presence there for 3,000 years. They have been there for a \nlong time. The coins, the cities, the pottery, the culture--there are \nother people, groups that are there, but there is no mistaking the fact \nthat Israelis have been present in that land for 3,000 years.\n  It predates any claims that other peoples in the regions may have. \nThe ancient Philistines are extinct. Many other ancient peoples are \nextinct. They do not have the unbroken line to this date that the \nIsraelis have.\n  Even the Egyptians of today are not racial Egyptians of 2,000, 3,000 \nyears ago. They are primarily an Arab people. The land is called Egypt \nbut they are not the same racial and ethnic stock as the old Egyptians \nof the ancient world. The Israelis are in fact descended from the \noriginal Israelites. The first proof, then, is the archeology.\n  The second proof of Israel's right to the land is the historic right. \nHistory supports it totally and completely. We know there has been an \nIsrael up until the time of the Roman Empire. The Romans conquered the \nland. Israel had no homeland, although Jews were allowed to live there. \nThey were driven from the land in two dispersions: One was in 70 A.D. \nand the other was in 135 A.D. But there was always a Jewish presence in \nthe land.\n  The Turks, who took over about 700 years ago and ruled the land up \nuntil about World War I, had control. Then the land was conquered by \nthe British. The Turks entered World War I on the side of Germany. The \nBritish knew they had to do something to punish Turkey and also to \nbreak up that empire that was going to be a part of the whole effort of \nGermany in World War I, so the British sent troops against the Turks in \nthe Holy Land.\n  One of the generals who was leading the British armies was a man \nnamed Allenby. Allenby was a Bible-believing Christian. He carried a \nBible with him everywhere he went and he knew the significance of \nJerusalem.\n  The night before the attack against Jerusalem to drive out the Turks, \nAllenby prayed that God would allow him to capture the city without \ndoing damage to the holy places.\n  That day, Allenby sent World War I biplanes over the city of \nJerusalem to do a reconnaissance mission. You have to understand that \nthe Turks had at that time never seen an airplane. So there they were, \nflying around. They looked in the sky and saw these fascinating \ninventions and did not know what they were and they were terrified by \nthem. Then they were told that they were being opposed by a man named \nAllenby the next day, which in their language means ``man sent from \nGod'' or ``prophet from God.'' They dared not fight against a prophet \nfrom God, so the next morning when Allenby went to take Jerusalem, he \nwent in and captured it without firing a single shot.\n  The British Government was grateful to Jewish people around the world \nand particularly to one Jewish chemist who helped them with the \nmanufacture of niter. Niter is an ingredient which goes into \nnitroglycerin, necessary to the war effort. They were getting \ndangerously low of niter in England at that time, so the chemist, who \nwas called Weitzman, discovered a way to make it from materials that \nexisted in England.\n  It was coming from the new world over there, the niter was. But the \nGerman U-boats were shooting them down so it was all at the bottom of \nthe Atlantic Ocean. When Weitzman discovered a way to make it from \nmaterials that existed in England, it saved the British war effort. Out \nof gratitude to this Jew and out of gratitude to Jewish bankers and \nfinanciers and others who lent financial support, England said we are \ngoing to set aside a homeland in the Middle East for the Jewish people. \nAnd that is history.\n\n  The homeland that Britain said it would set aside consisted of all of \nwhat is now Israel and all of what was then the nation of Jordan, the \nwhole thing. That was what Britain promised to give the Jews in 1917.\n  In the beginning, there was some Arab support for this. There was not \na huge Arab population in the land at that time and there is a reason \nfor that. The land was not able to sustain a large population of \npeople. It just didn't have the development it needed to handle all \nthose people, and the land wasn't really wanted by anybody.\n  I want you to listen to Mark Twain. Have you ever read ``Huckleberry \nFinn'' or ``Tom Sawyer''? Mark Twain--Samuel Clemens--took a tour of \nPalestine in 1867. This is how he described it. We are talking about \nIsrael. He said:\n\n       A desolate country whose soil is rich enough but is given \n     over wholly to weeds. A\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\n     silent, mournful expanse. We never saw a human being on the \n     whole route. There was hardly a tree or a shrub anywhere. \n     Even the olive and the cactus, those fast friends of a \n     worthless soil, had almost deserted the country.\n\n  Where was this great Palestinian nation? It didn't exist. It wasn't \nthere. The Palestinians weren't there. Palestine was a region named by \nthe Romans, but at the time it was under the control of Turkey and \nthere was no large mass of people there because the land would not \nsupport them.\n  This is the report of the Palestinian Royal Commission, created by \nthe British. It quotes an account of the conditions on the coastal \nplain, along the Mediterranean Sea in 1913. This is the Palestinian \nRoyal Commission. They said:\n\n       The road leading from Gaza to the north was only a summer \n     track, suitable for transport by camels or carts. No orange \n     groves, orchards or vineyards were to be seen until one \n     reached the Yavnev village. Houses were mud. Schools did not \n     exist. The western part toward the sea was almost a desert. \n     The villages in this area were few and thinly populated. Many \n     villages were deserted by their inhabitants.\n\n  The French author Voltaire described Palestine as:\n\n       A hopeless, dreary place.\n\n  In short, under the Turks the land suffered from neglect and low \npopulation, and that is a historical fact. The nation became populated \nwith both Jews and Arabs because the land came to prosper when Jews \ncame back and began to reclaim it. Historically, they began to reclaim \nit. If there had never been any archeological evidence at all to \nsupport the rights of the Israelis to the territory, it is also \nimportant to recognize that other nations in the area have no \nlongstanding claim to the country either.\n  Madam President, did you know that Saudi Arabia was not created until \n1913? Lebanon until 1920? Iraq didn't exist as a nation until 1932; \nSyria until 1941; the borders of Jordan were established in 1946, and \nKuwait in 1961.\n  Any of these nations who would say that Israel is only a recent \narrival would have to deny their own rights as recent arrivals as well. \nThey did not exist as countries. They were all under the control of the \nTurks. So, historically, Israel gained its independence in 1948.\n\n  The third reason I believe the land belongs to Israel is because of \nthe practical value of the Israelis being there. Israel today is a \nmodern marvel of agriculture. Israel is able to bring more food out of \na desert environment than any other country in the world. The Arab \nnations ought to make Israel their friend and import technology from \nIsrael that would allow all the Middle East, not just Israel, to become \nan exporter of food. Israel has unarguable success in its agriculture.\n  The fourth reason I believe Israel has the right to the land is on \nthe grounds of humanitarian concern. You see, there were 6 million Jews \nslaughtered in Europe in World War II. The persecution against the Jews \nhas been very strong in Russia since the advent of communism. It was \nagainst them even before then under the Czars.\n  These people have a right to their homeland. If we are not going to \nallow them a homeland in the Middle East, then where? What other nation \non Earth is going to cede territory? To give up land?\n  They are not asking for a great deal. You know the whole nation of \nIsrael would fit into my State of Oklahoma seven times. So on \nhumanitarian grounds alone, Israel ought to have the land.\n  The fifth reason Israel ought to have the land is because she is a \nstrategic ally to the United States. Whether we realize it or not, \nIsrael is a detriment, an impediment to certain groups hostile to \ndemocracies and hostile to those things that we believe in, hostile to \nthe very things that make us the greatest nation in the history of the \nworld. They have kept them from taking complete control of the Middle \nEast. If it were not for Israel, they would overrun the region. They \nare our strategic ally.\n  Madam President, it is good to know that we have a friend in the \nMiddle East that we can count on. They vote with us in the United \nNations more than England. They vote with us more than Canada, more \nthan France, more than Germany, more than any other country in the \nworld.\n  The sixth reason is that Israel is a roadblock to terrorism. The war \nwe are now facing is not against a sovereign nation. It is a group of \nterrorists who are very fluid, moving from one country to another. They \nare almost invisible. That is who we are fighting against. We need \nevery ally we can get. If we do not stop terrorism in the Middle East, \nit will be on our shores. We have said this and said this and said \nthis.\n  One of the reasons I believe the spiritual door was opened for an \nattack against the United States of America is because the policy of \nour Government has been to ask Israelis and demand with pressure that \nthey not retaliate in a significant way against the terrorist strikes \nthat have been launched against them, the most recent one just 2 days \nago.\n  Since its independence in 1948, Israel has fought four wars: the war \nin 1948-1949; the war in 1956, the Sinai campaign; the Six-Day War in \n1967; and in 1973 the Yom Kippur War, the holiest day of the year, with \nEgypt and Syria.\n  You have to understand that in all four cases, Israel was attacked. \nSome people may argue that wasn't true because they went in first in \nthe war of 1956. But they knew at that time that Egypt was building a \nhuge military to become the aggressor. Israel, in fact, was not the \naggressor and has not been the aggressor in any of the four wars.\n  Also, they won all four wars against impossible odds. They are great \nwarriors. They consider a level playing field being outnumbered two to \none.\n  There were 39 Scud missiles that landed on Israeli soil during the \ngulf war. Our President asked Israel not to respond. In order to have \nthe Arab nations on board, we asked Israel not even to participate in \nthe war. They showed tremendous restraint and did not. And now we've \nasked them to stand back and not do anything over these last several \nattacks.\n  We have criticized them. We have criticized them in our media. Local \npeople in television and radio offer criticisms of Israel not knowing \nthe true issues. We need to be informed.\n  I was so thrilled when I heard a reporter pose a question to our \nSecretary of State, Colin Powell. He said, ``Mr. Powell, the United \nStates has advocated a policy of restraint in the Middle East. We have \ndiscouraged Israel from retaliation again and again, and again because \nwe've said it leads to continued escalation--that it escalates the \nviolence.'' He said, ``Are we going to follow that preaching \nourselves?''\n  Mr. Powell indicated that we would strike back. In other words, we \ncan tell Israel not to do it, but when it hits us we are going to do \nsomething. That is one of the reasons I believe the door was opened. \nBecause we have held back our tiny little friend. We have not allowed \nthem to go to the heart of the problem. The heart of the problem--that \nis where we are going now.\n  But all that changed yesterday when the Israelis went into the Gaza \nwith gunships and into the West Bank with F-16s. With the exception of \nlast May, the Israelis had not used F-16s since the 1967 7-Day War. And \nI am so proud of them because we have to stop terrorism. It is not \ngoing to go away. If Israel were driven into the sea tomorrow, if every \nJew in the Middle East were killed, terrorism would not end. You know \nthat in your heart. Terrorism would continue.\n\n  It is not just a matter of Israel in the Middle East. It is the heart \nof the very people who are perpetrating this stuff. Should they be \nsuccessful in overrunning Israel--they won't be--but should they be, it \nwould not be enough. They will never be satisfied.\n  No. 7, I believe very strongly that we ought to support Israel; that \nit has a right to the land. This is the most important reason: Because \nGod said so. As I said a minute ago, look it up in the book of Genesis.\n  In Genesis 13:14-17, the Bible says:\n\n       The Lord said to Abram, ``Lift up now your eyes, and look \n     from the place where you are northward, and southward, and \n     eastward and westward: for all the land which you see, to you \n     will I give it, and to your seed forever. . . . Arise, walk \n     through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of \n     it; for I will give it to thee.''\n\n  That is God talking.\n  The Bible says that Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the \nplain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar before the \nLord. Hebron is in the West Bank. It is at this place where God \nappeared to\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\nAbram and said, ``I am giving you this land,''--the West Bank.\n  This is not a political battle at all. It is a contest over whether \nor not the word of God is true. The seven reasons here, I am convinced, \nclearly establish that Israel has a right to the land.\n  Eight years ago on the lawn of the White House, Yitzhak Rabin shook \nhands with PLO Chairman, Yasser Arafat. It was a historic occasion. It \nwas a tragic occasion.\n  At that time, the official policy of the Government of Israel began \nto be, ``Let us appease the terrorists. Let us begin to trade the land \nfor peace.'' This process has continued unabated up until last year. \nHere in our own Nation, at Camp David, in the summer of 2000, then \nPrime Minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, offered the most generous \nconcessions to Yasser Arafat that had ever been laid on the table.\n  He offered him more than 90 percent of all the West Bank territory; \nsovereign control of it. There were some parts he did not want to \noffer, but in exchange for that he said he would give up land in Israel \nproper that the PLO was not asking for.\n  And he also did the unthinkable. He even spoke of dividing Jerusalem \nand allowing the Palestinians to have their capital there in the East. \nYasser Arafat stormed out of the meeting.\n\n  Why did he storm out of the meeting? Everything he has said he has \nwanted all of these years was put into his hand. Why did he storm out \nof the meeting?\n  A couple of months later, there began to be riots, terrorism. The \nriots began when, now Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, went to the Temple \nMount. And this was used as the thing that lit the fire and that caused \nthe explosion.\n  Did you know that Sharon did not go unannounced and that he contacted \nthe Islamic authorities before he went and secured their permission and \nhad permission to be there? It was no surprise. The response was very \ncarefully calculated. They knew the world would not pay attention to \nthe details.\n  They would portray this in the Arab world as an attack upon the holy \nmosque. They would portray it as an attack upon that mosque and use it \nas an excuse to riot. Over the last eight years, during this time of \nthe peace process, where the Israeli public has pressured its leaders \nto give up land for peace because they're tired of fighting, there has \nbeen increased terror.\n  In fact, it has been greater in the last eight years than any other \ntime in Israel's history. Showing restraint and giving in has not \nproduced any kind of peace. It is so much so, that today the leftist \npeace movement in Israel does not exist because the people feel they \nwere deceived.\n  They did offer a hand of peace, and it was not taken. That is why the \npolitics of Israel have changed drastically over the past 12 months. \nThe Israelis have come to see that, ``No matter what we do, these \npeople do not want to deal with us . . . They want to destroy us.'' \nthat is why even yet today the stationery of the PLO still has upon it \nthe map of the entire state of Israel, not just the tiny little part \nthey call the West Bank that they want. They want it all.\n  The unwavering loyalty we have received from our only consistent \nfriend in the Middle East has got to be respected and appreciated by \nus. No longer should foreign policy in the Middle East be one of \nappeasement. As Hiram Mann said, ``No man survives when freedom fails. \nThe best men rot in filthy jails and those who cried `appease, appease' \nare hanged by those they tried to please.''\n  Islamic fundamentalist terrorism has now come to America. We have to \nuse all of our friends, all of our assets, and all of our resources to \ndefeat the satanic evil.\n  When Patrick Henry said, ``We will not fight our battles alone. There \nis a just God who reigns over the destiny of nations who will raise up \nfriends who will fight our battles with us,'' he was talking about all \nour friends, including Israel. And that is what is happening, as of \nyesterday and I thank God for that. Israel is now in the battle by our \nside.\n  That is what is happening. As of yesterday, Israel is now in the \nbattle by our side, and I thank God for that. It is time for our policy \nof appeasement in the Middle East and appeasement to the terrorists to \nbe over. With our partners, our victory must and will be absolute \nvictory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Madam President, as chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, which is the lead authorizing committee for \nmany of the programs authorized in the Transportation Equity Act for \nthe 21st Century, I would like to comment on the pending FY 2002 \ntransportation appropriations conference report.\n  Overall, this is an excellent bill and I intend to vote for it. \nHowever, there are a few provisions in the highway portion of this \nlegislation that concern me. TEA-21 represented a carefully negotiated \ncompromise between many different points of view, numerous committees, \nand the entire House and Senate. One key provision of this compromise \nlegislation was Revenue Aligned Budget Authority--RABA--which ensured \nthat obligations from the Highway Trust Fund would equal revenues into \nthe fund, called TEA-21. TEA-21 determined a carefully negotiated \nbreakdown between the share of RABA funds that would flow to the States \nthrough the apportionment formulas and the share that would be \ncompetitively distributed through the allocated programs.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report makes significant changes to the \nauthorization for RABA funding. As it has done in each of the past 2 \nyears, the conference report ignores the authorized distribution of \nfunds for allocated programs under RABA. However, this time, rather \nthan giving the money back to the States through the formulas, this \nlegislation earmarks it for special projects. In addition, the \nconference report earmarks nearly $500 million that was supposed to be \ndistributed to States through the apportionment formulas. As a result, \nsome States will lose significant amounts of highway funding. In \nessence, I am very concerned that the appropriators are rewriting the \napportionment formulas that were so carefully negotiated in TEA-21.\n  I do not mean to begrudge the appropriators their prerogative to \nearmark funding for specific projects. In fact, I am very pleased that \nsome of the funding is set aside for Vermont. However, at some point we \ndo have to draw the line on earmarking when it threatens the very \nfabric of a carefully negotiated authorization. Unfortunately, this \nyear we may have finally crossed that line.\n  I look forward to working with the appropriators next year and \nthroughout the reauthorization process to make sure we do a better job \nof maintaining the integrity of TEA-21 while providing the \nappropriators flexibility within the guidelines set forth in that law. \nTEA-21 is a delicately balanced piece of legislation and we must be \ncareful not to upset that balance.\n  I yield back any time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin).

Mr. President, I rise today to express great concern \nabout recent events and comments that have been made in this Chamber \nand in the House of Representatives that I believe are not in keeping \nwith the sense of cooperation and bipartisanship that we have seen \nsince September 11.\n  I remember, after the horrible attacks that we all grieved about and \nhave focused on, on that day of September 11 we joined together on the \nCapitol steps, and one of our colleagues spontaneously started singing \n``God Bless America,'' and we all joined in.\n\n[[Page S12349]]\n\n And there was a sense of purpose and dedication and commitment as \nAmericans. We all said that while we may have had differences--that is \nwhat it is all about in a democracy--we were going to put aside the \npartisan bickering and the personal assaults and do as our President \nasked, which was to come together and focus on the needs of the country \nand to set a new tone.\n  And then a few weeks later we saw our own majority leader and his \nstaff under another kind of attack, that of anthrax. It came to be an \nattack on those of us in the Hart Building. And we have now seen other \nletters. But we have seen our majority leader and his staff operating \nwith incredible dedication, with poise, with tremendous leadership. And \nthe hard work of the staff is continuing.\n  In fact, all of our staffs are continuing under very difficult \ncircumstances. My own staff operates out of a room in the loading dock \nat Russell. We see people who are in various situations around this \ncomplex of the Capitol, but they continue to serve.\n  We have done a lot of things. We immediately responded to the attacks \nwith a commitment of resources for New York and for the Pentagon. \nYesterday I had the opportunity to visit the Pentagon and see the \nincredible changes that have taken place since September 11. They are \nrebuilding the Pentagon with speed that is amazing. Everyone involved \nin that should be commended for the work they are doing to rebuild this \nimportant part of our country and our national security and leadership.\n  We have responded to that. We have passed airport security bills. \nYes, there were differences, but they were worked out to move us \nforward in terms of airport and airline security.\n  We have passed economic legislation to support the airlines and \npassed a sweeping antiterrorism bill that has included the ability to \ntrack the money through money laundering provisions--I was pleased to \nbe a part of it in the Banking Committee--as well as upgrading the \ntools available to law enforcement officials and create the kinds of \nopportunities to reach out and prevent terrorism as well as to respond \nto it.\n  We have continued to move the appropriations bills through this \nprocess. We are coming to the conclusion of that in the next couple of \nweeks. But we are still debating economic recovery, how best to do \nthat. What should be our priorities? Should we, in fact, invest in \nadditional homeland security, beefing up our public health \ninfrastructure, as I hope we will do?\n  But we are now seeing a constant drone of attacks and comments being \nmade about our Senate majority leader, and I just have to rise today to \nexpress deep disappointment and concern about that. We have seen \npersonal comments being made.\n  Last week the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee made \nstatements about our leader saying there was nothing inside the \nleader's head on which to focus. There have been implications, with all \nkinds of derogatory statements that have been made about his leadership \nand calls for him to step aside because he may be putting forward a \ndifferent vision or set of values and priorities than someone on the \nother side--statement after statement, attacks about someone's \nsincerity and their patriotism and their leadership that are just not \nhelpful and not necessary and, by the way, absolutely absurd.\n  I found it offensive, when we were listening to the debate on the \nenergy bill on Friday; over and over again it was laced with personal \ncomments, comments that are unbecoming to this body or the body on the \nother side of the building from which I came as a House Member.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I am happy to yield to my good friend from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I want to say how proud I am you took to the floor \nto bring this to light. I think the American people are ill-served, as \nyou do, when there are personal attacks on any of our leaders.\n  Do we have differences? Yes. Should we express those differences? \nAbsolutely. Because, frankly, I have a lot of people who say: What \nreally is the difference between Democrats and Republicans? So the fact \nthat we do not agree on an economic stimulus package is to be expected. \nThe fact that the Democrats are fighting for people who lost their \njobs, yes, that is to be expected. The fact that we do not think it is \nright to give big rebate checks to the largest and most wealthy \ncorporations in America and call it a stimulus, the fact that we do not \nagree with it is to be expected. The fact that the other side would \nsupport that is to be expected. So debating that is fine.\n\n  But my colleague has pointed out the viciousness of the attack \nagainst the leader of this Senate, Tom Daschle, who happens to be one \nof the kindest, most compassionate people in politics today, is \nsomething that cannot go by without a statement.\n  So I say to my friend, by way of a question, isn't it true that the \npeople of this country expect us to have differences, expect us, on \ndomestic policy, to bring those differences to light, where we are so \nunited on the terrorism front--and we support our President and our \nSecretary of State; and we are moving together in this fight; there are \nno differences really, not even around the edges on that. But isn't it \na fact that it is fine for us to have these differences, but that these \ndifferences should be debated with respect, with fairness, and with \ndignity?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I couldn't agree more with my friend from California. I \nknow the families I represent in Michigan are saying to me: We know \nthere are differences in approaches.\n  That is a reason why they sent me here. And I am of a different \nparty, a different philosophy, on economic questions possibly, or other \ndomestic issues, than those on the other side of the aisle.\n  They expect us to operate with civility, with respect. I believe and \nin fact have been telling people in Michigan that there is a new day, \nthat since September 11 we have come together. Yes, we have differences \nin priorities. We are Americans. Under the Constitution, we have a \nright, an obligation, to give our point of view. There will be \ndifferences.\n  The personal attacks, the vicious partisan attacks that we have heard \nrecently are just the same old thing we have seen for too long around \nhere. People don't want to see that happening.\n  I will not question someone's patriotism. I will not say because they \ndiffer with my thoughts that there is nothing between their ears or \nthat they are somehow a child who wants a recess and that they are a \nthird grader--whatever the comments were last week. Those kinds of \nthings, frankly, demean all of us. That is my concern.\n  We have a lot of work to do in this next couple of weeks. People \nexpect us to be focused on their needs and on the needs of the country, \nthe safety of the country, the economy. It is legitimate for us to \ndebate, and we have legitimate differences on how to move the economy \nforward. I have spoken before in this Chamber about whether it is \nsupply side economics or demand side economics, what is the best mix? \nThat is legitimate. People expect us to do that. We would not be \nfulfilling our own responsibilities as individual Senators not to come \nforward with our own ideas. But when it goes on and we hear our leader \nbeing attacked for abrogating his responsibility or that every day \nsomeone is in pain should be laid at the foot of Tom Daschle, that is \nuncalled for.\n  I was particularly concerned that there are actually ads being run \nnow attacking our leader in the Senate because of a meeting he had in \nMexico with the President of Mexico. Our President has met with Vicente \nFox. President Fox has been here. We have welcomed him to the Capitol. \nThey are our neighbors to the south. We have important work to do with \nthem. Certainly part of what happens economically relates to trade and \nthe relationship of our two countries. Yet we have those who have \nactually paid for partisan ads back in our leader's home State to imply \nthat while a weekend in Mexico might be a nice break from the attacks \nat hand, in fact, this trip was the wrong thing to do.\n\n  I hope we can decide we are going to dedicate the time between now \nand the end of this session to the serious, vital business at hand and \nthe priorities about which we can disagree. We can disagree about \nwhether or not to drill in Alaska's national wildlife refuge. We\n\n[[Page S12350]]\n\ncan disagree about appropriations priorities.\n  As someone who has tremendous respect for the leader of this body, I \nwill continue to object when there are personal comments made either \nabout our leader or about the Republican leader or about others on the \nSenate floor. We have been through too much together since September 11 \nto turn back to the personal kinds of derogatory statements that were a \npart of the past. We can do better than that. The American people \ndeserve better. The American people expect us to do better than that.\n  I call on the President of the United States and the Republican \nleadership to join us in a vigorous, sincere debate on the priorities \nfor the country, the best way to achieve economic recovery and \nsecurity, and to do that with the highest and best that is in us. We \nhave a great body and people of wonderful good will on both sides of \nthe aisle in both Houses, as well as the White House. We can do what \nthe people expect us to do. We can do it right. I hope in fact we will \nget about the business of doing it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What bill is \npending before the Senate? What are the agreements regarding it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending bill is H.R. 10, to which pending \nis the Daschle substitute amendment, and an amendment to that is the \namendment by the Senator from New Mexico with time for debate evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has a vote been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself the 2\\1/2\\ minutes that I \nhave.\n  First, I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee for cosponsoring \nthis amendment.\n  Second, for those--they are numerous in the Senate--who are for the \nrailroad retirement bill, this amendment is not a poison pill for the \nrailroad retirement bill. It does not impact how this bill will be \nimplemented. It simply will make sure the costs are recorded correctly. \nIf you record them correctly rather than direct how they will be \nscored, you have no impact on whether the bill proceeds.\n  There is no additional point of order or anything that is an \nimpediment to the bill. It is just that we very seldom, if ever, let a \nbill go through that costs money where we direct how it should be \nscored. In this case, the Congressional Budget Office was asked how \nmuch it will cost. They told us. Instead of scoring it as we would \nnormally in almost every single bill that affects spending, the House, \nin the final moments as this bill was getting ready to be passed, put \nin language saying it shouldn't be scored as it is; we want to score it \nanother way; we direct it not be scored costing $15.3 billion.\n  All I ask is that provision be stricken. The bill does not have \nlanguage in it, if the Domenici amendment is agreed to, that directs \nhow you score it, but rather the costs will be scored as estimated by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, which does the same thing for every \nbill that goes through. Bills do not have language telling you that you \nmust score it differently than you score all the other bills and \ndifferently than the Congressional Budget Office indicates.\n  I reserve whatever time I have and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself a minute and a half.\n  Mr. President, I have the highest regard for the Senator from New \nMexico and also for Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee. \nThey do an excellent job in a very difficult situation trying to keep \nus on track with\n\n[[Page S12351]]\n\nthe budget matters. They are very good Senators. I think people from \ntheir home States know that. But I just wanted to state that.\n  The question here is, does this cost any money? If you assume it does \ncost money, then there is an argument against directed scorekeeping; \nthat is, there is an argument we do have outlays of maybe $15, $17 \nbillion.\n  What is it we are addressing? We are addressing that the tier 2 \nretirement trust fund buys securities; that is, stocks and bonds, \nrather than buying Treasury bills. The question is, Is buying equity \nsecurities the same or different from buying Treasury notes? Under the \nrules, they are different; that is, one is an outlay and the other is \nnot. So it will be a $15 billion outlay cost under the budget rules if \nthe trust fund invests in securities; that is, equity securities, and \nno outlay, no cost when the trust fund buys Treasury bonds.\n  I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, technically, the chairman and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico are right because that is the way the budget rules have \nbeen applied. And this is a gray area. This is not similar to buying a \ntruck or a gold mine or buying another physical asset. Rather, it is \nbuying securities instead of Treasury bonds.\n  I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  So I am saying to my friends, the Government is no better off or \nworse off whatsoever if the trust fund buys securities rather than \nbuying Treasury notes, as all pension funds do. They invest in both \nTreasury securities as well as equity securities.\n  So I urge my colleagues to not apply this rule at this time because \nthe Government is no better or worse off; second, if the Senator's \namendment were to be adopted, that would be the end of the railroad \nretirement bill this year because we would have to go back to the House \nand it would not survive this session or maybe even this Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time for the Senator from Montana has \nexpired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have to Senator \nConrad and thank him for cosponsoring the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I favor the railroad retirement \nlegislation. I strongly favor it. But I just as strongly support this \namendment to knock out directed scorekeeping because I think it \nmisleads our colleagues and our countrymen.\n  Directed scorekeeping would suggest this legislation costs $250 \nmillion this year to implement. That simply is not correct. The cost is \n$15.6 billion. The hard reality is, that is what the Federal Government \nis going to have to borrow to fund this legislation, $15.6 billion, not \n$250 million. We should not say otherwise.\n  We can support this legislation but be direct and clear with respect \nto its cost.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2202. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.

Mr. President, I do not want to rudely interrupt, but \nI want to take a minute to make a unanimous consent request.\n  I see the ranking member of the Veterans' Committee in the Chamber. \nShortly, I am going to ask unanimous consent to pass a veterans \nhomeless bill. I will give my colleagues the background.\n  Three weeks prior to the Thanksgiving recess, I came to the Chamber \nto try to pass a version of the homeless veterans assistance bill. Lane \nEvans has done a lot of work on the House side, so has Chris Smith. It \nis an excellent bill. We passed this bill out of the Veterans' \nCommittee by a unanimous vote.\n  I had to come to the Chamber four times asking unanimous consent to \npass the legislation. There was an anonymous hold. Again, I say to \ncolleagues, any Senator certainly can object, but this whole business \nof anonymous holds and no arguments made is unbelievable. So I had to \nsay to my colleagues on the other side that on nonemergency measures, I \nwas putting a hold on everything. My hold was not anonymous. I said on \nthe floor--it is me--I am putting a hold on it.\n  We have been doing all this work with Democrats and Republicans on \nthe House side. Chris Smith, who is chairman of the Veterans' Committee \nin the House, has been especially helpful on the bill. We had strong \nbipartisan support on the Senate side as well. We preconferenced it, \nand we have unanimity of opinion. This veterans homeless bill is superb \nlegislation.\n  About a third of the homeless adult males in the country are \nveterans. Many of them are Vietnam vets. Most struggle with \nposttraumatic stress syndrome. Most struggle with addiction. They do \nnot get help. It is a scandal.\n  This legislation is one-stop shopping, places where people can go for \ncommunity-based care, mental health services, treatment, and assistance \nin getting affordable housing. My God, we could not do anything that is \nbetter.\n  This legislation came back from the House. I thought we certainly \nwould pass it. I know the chair of the Veterans' Committee in the \nHouse, a Republican, has urged colleagues to do so.\n  Now I understand we have another one of these anonymous holds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 201, H.R. 2716.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am sorry that I have to do this, but for \nthe proceedings we are now under, and the fact we have dealt with this \nissue before--my colleague and I agree on much of what he has just \nsaid, but I do believe the way he now attempts to address this issue \ndoes not fit where we want to go or where the Senate has acted and the \nHouse has acted. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I had gone further, I would have mentioned also, \nwith the support of Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter, the\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\nunanimous consent request was that the amendment be agreed to; the act, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table. Of course, my colleague from Idaho \nhas objected.\n\n  I am a bit of an emotional Senator. I say to my good friend from \nIdaho that unlike the Senator who has put an anonymous hold on this \nbill, my hold is not anonymous. I have a hold on every single \nresolution and legislation introduced by my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle that is nonemergency--all of it. It is not anonymous. \nI have just said it here.\n  I did it for 3 weeks before Thanksgiving. I cannot believe it. Now we \nare back at this again. It comes over here from the House with the full \napproval of the chair of the Veterans' Committee--I think unanimous \nsupport--support of both Senator Rockefeller, who chairs the Veterans' \nCommittee, and Senator Specter.\n  We have been working on this for several years. It is a scandal. Is \nit too much to ask that we get this support to veterans? People are \ngiving all these speeches about how great it is that our men and women \nare serving our country, they are in harm's way, we support them--and \nwe do, I agree--and then when they get out of the Armed Services and \nthey are now veterans, all of a sudden we do not say thank you any \nlonger. You don't think you can find it in your hearts to pass this \nbill that is so important to this group of veterans in this country? \nThat is my first point.\n  My second point deals with my indignation, for which I apologize. I \nam just getting sick and tired of these anonymous holds. I really am. \nTherefore, I say to my good friend from Idaho, I know this is not his \nposition. He has to come out here by proxy, representing someone who \nhas put an anonymous hold on this bill again, in which case I have a \nhold on all legislation, all resolutions introduced by my good friends \non the other side of the aisle that are nonemergency.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield. I do not yield the floor. \nI will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Briefly on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator for yielding. As the Senator from \nMinnesota knows, a hold is not absolute. It merely is to notify those \nwho have objection to the bill that it might be coming up. I think the \nSenator has operated appropriately. I am not the person who has the \nhold on his bill, but it is important we deal with the issue in a \ntimely fashion.\n  There is much of what the Senator said I agree with. I serve on the \nVeterans' Committee. I do not say by this action I am not in support of \nveterans, homeless veterans, those who are in need. I understand where \nthe Senator wants to go. My guess is ultimately we can get there, and I \nwill work with the Senator to make that happen.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I note my colleague from Texas is in \nthe Chamber. I will only take 1 more minute.\n  I thank the Senator from Idaho. I take his remarks as being very \nsincere. Again, the reason I have to do this, I say to my colleague, is \nbecause I went through this for 3 weeks prior to Thanksgiving. I came \nto the Senate Chamber 4, 5 times and never could get approval. The hold \nwas anonymous.\n  Last week, I tried to get approval, and I have tried to get approval \nsince. It is out there. Everybody knows what the bill is. We have been \nworking on this a long time. There is strong bipartisan support for the \nbill.\n  I thank my colleague. I hope we can work it out. In the meantime, \nbefore we work it out, I want all of my good friends on the other side \nto know my hold is not anonymous. I have a hold on all their \nresolutions, amendments, and bills unless they are emergency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12352-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12352-S12363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMPREHENSIVE RETIREMENT SECURITY AND PENSION REFORM ACT OF 2001--\n                               Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2196\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that returns on investment are earned prior to any \n              reduction in taxes or increase in benefits.)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2196. It is a short \namendment, and I would like it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2196:\n       On page 2 of the amendment, insert before line 1 the \n     following:\n       ``Sec. 2. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     any reduction in tax or increase in benefits shall take \n     effect only to the degree that the Secretary of the Treasury \n     finds that the actual earnings of the Railroad Retirement \n     Investment Trust Fund are sufficient to fund them.''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have before us a bill that 74 Members \nhave cosponsored. It is clear from the previous vote where the votes \nare on this bill. I remind my colleagues that Senator Domenici offered \nan amendment to strike a provision of the bill that was not in any bill \nthat anybody cosponsored, and it was literally a provision that was \nwritten into the bill that orders the Office of Management and Budget, \nwhich is the budget scoring arm of the executive branch, and the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is the budget scoring arm of the \nlegislative branch of Government, to falsify the budget by not counting \n$15 billion that is being taken out of the Treasury.\n  This is an extraordinary provision. It basically ordered both \nbudgeting arms--the budgeting arm of the executive branch of Government \nand the budgeting arm of the legislative branch of Government--to \nsimply look the other way and not count $15 billion being taken out of \nthe Treasury.\n  Senator Domenici, with the support of the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, offered an amendment to strike that language so at least we \ncould have honest bookkeeping. Only 40 Members of the Senate voted for \nhonest bookkeeping. It is clear this railroad retirement bill is wired.\n  What I wanted to do was to offer an amendment to achieve everything \nproponents of the bill claim they want to do but to do it in a \nresponsible manner. I don't know where this amendment is going. I \nexpect it is going to get relatively few votes. However, I feel \nobligated to offer the amendment and people can do what they want to do \nwith it.\n  Let me try to define the problem. If you read what people are saying \nin the paper and you talk to all these very nice people in the hallways \nwho are lobbying for this bill, they say: Look, we have over $15 \nbillion in our trust fund. It is our money. It is invested in \nGovernment bonds. We don't think it is a good investment--I sure agree \nwith them there. They claim they want to take the money and invest it. \nThen with the higher interest rates that they can earn, they want to \nlower taxes and increase benefits.\n  Now, there is a big problem here. If you look at the actual estimates \ndone by the railroad retirement board, you find under any of the three \neconomic scenarios that the railroad retirement trust fund actuaries \nlook at, this proposal does a lot more than simply invest the money. In \nfact, as I pointed out on many occasions, what this bill does, in \nessence, is, over a 17-year period, it literally takes $15 billion of \ncapital out of the trust fund. This chart shows--and this is based on \nthe Railroad Retirement Board's data; this is not my data--under \ncurrent law the trust fund would build up along the black line entitled \n``Trust Fund Under Current Law.''\n\n  Let me remind my colleagues that railroad retirement is not fully \nfunded. If we had ERISA laws applied to railroad retirement where you \nhad to have a trust fund sufficient to pay benefits, ERISA would shut \nrailroad retirement down today. This is a program that has no actuarial \nsolvency whatever and it is currently receiving huge Federal taxpayer \nsubsidies today and has always received Federal subsidies.\n  Basically what is going on, this is what the trust fund balance looks \nlike under current law. Proponents of this bill say it doesn't make \nsense to invest this in Government bonds; let us invest it in stocks \nand bonds. We will have more money; we can have a better, more secure \nretirement program. I agree with that. I am supportive of letting them \ninvest the money. The problem is, that is a smokescreen.\n  What they are really doing, if you look at what happens to the trust \nfund\n\n[[Page S12353]]\n\nbefore any money is invested, before one single penny is invested, they \ncut the amount of money the railroads are putting into retirement from \n16.1 percent of payroll to 14.75 percent, and it falls to 14.2 percent \nand then to 13.1 percent. They also lower the retirement age from 62 to \n60. At the same time we are raising the retirement age for Social \nSecurity, they lower the number of years to be vested from 10 to 5 and \nthey raise benefits. The net result is, even though they assume they \nwill earn 8 percent in real terms, whereas they are only getting 1 \npercent in real terms from Government bonds the way they are \ncalculating it, even with as high a rate of return, what happens to the \ntrust fund under this bill? What happens to the trust fund is, it goes \ndown because not only are we paying out every penny of earnings from \nthe higher rate of return but we are also paying out principal.\n  Why doesn't it go broke? The reason it doesn't go broke is, in 2021, \nthe trust fund is now down to about a third of what it would be under \ncurrent law because you have added all the new benefits. You reduce the \namount of money going into the fund so even though you hope to earn a \nmuch higher rate of return, you expect all the return and two-thirds of \nthe trust fund.\n  What happens in 2021 that keeps the system from going bankrupt? The \nway the bill is written, at that point, the payroll tax, which is down \nto 13.1 percent of payroll, skyrockets. It goes from 13.1 percent up to \n22.1 percent and it does that all in a span of some 5 years.\n  I ask my colleagues the following question: If railroads are saying \nthey cannot operate profitably while we are putting 16.1 percent of \npayroll into this retirement program--and remember, they have three \nretirees for every worker; Social Security has three workers for every \nretiree; this program is nine times as financially vulnerable as Social \nSecurity--if they can't afford to pay 16.1 percent today and they are \nurging us to let them cut that to 13.1 percent, how can they come in \n2025 and afford to pay 22.1 percent of payroll, which is what their \nnumbers require?\n  Does any Member here not believe that come 2019 the railroads are \ngoing to come to Congress and say, we would be required simply to \nmaintain the trust fund at roughly one-fourth of what it would have \nbeen without this law, already four-fifths of the trust fund would be \ngood? They are going to run to Congress in 18 years and say, we can't \npossibly pay a 22.1-percent payroll tax and remain in business. So you \nare going to either have to have the taxpayer come in and bail out this \nfund or you are going to have every railroad in America going broke.\n\n  One question that is never answered is, if they can't afford to pay \n16.1 percent today, how are they going to afford paying 22.1 percent in \n25 years? The point is, they don't ever intend to pay that amount. They \nare, in essence, asking us, despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, \nto let them take four-fifths of the trust fund over the next 25 years \nand divide it up with retirees and then have the Federal Government \nguarantee the fund so 25 years from now we have one-fourth of the trust \nfund to pay benefits we have today, and the railroads, which cannot pay \n16.1 percent, would be paying 22.1 percent then.\n  Now, they are going to argue the system would be solvent, they can \npay the benefits. But they can only do that with a 22.1-percent payroll \ntax. Nobody that I know believes that is a tax they can pay. Anyone who \nlooks at this realizes if we adopt this bill, 20 years from now we \nwon't be here, other people will be here, but the railroads will be \nsaying, you are going to have to come and do something because we can't \npay these taxes.\n  Under the best of economic circumstances--and this is data from the \nrailroad retirement board--under the best of circumstances, the bill \nbefore the Congress will deplete 53 percent of the trust fund by 2026. \nUnder a more restricted and a more normal economic circumstance, it \nwill deplete 75 percent of the trust fund. And under a pessimistic \neconomic scenario it will bankrupt the trust fund in 20 years. These \nare not my numbers. These are the numbers of the actuaries of the \nrailroad retirement trust fund.\n  Now, I understand people want to pass this bill, so I put together an \namendment which lets the railroads and the unions do what they want to \ndo, which is take $15 billion out of the trust fund right now and \ninvest it. That will become a private trust fund and they will have it \nin stocks and bonds and then they will earn on those stocks and bonds. \nThe amendment I have offered says, look, do everything you are claiming \nto do here but don't reduce the amount of money going into the trust \nfund from the railroads and don't increase benefits until you have \ninvested the $15 billion, and until you have earned a rate of return on \nit. And then when you are dealing with the interest and not the \nprincipal, you can do whatever you want to do.\n  What this bill does is take the money out of Government bonds and \nallow it to be invested, $15 billion of it; then as that money earns \ninterest, you could lower the amount the railroads are paying in, you \ncould lower the retirement age, you could increase benefits, but only \nto the degree you were doing it with the interest you are earning. You \ncould not spend off the trust fund, thereby putting the taxpayer at \ngreater risk.\n  I know if anyone defends the proposal, they will say, look, the trust \nfund does not go broke under the bill. In fact, I guess they would \nconcede it goes down in value under the expected economic scenario by \nthree-fourths. But there is still enough money to pay the benefits. \nThat is only part of the story. The rest of the story is, the only \nreason there is enough money to pay benefits at this point under the \nbill is that it is assumed by them that the tax on the railroads to pay \nfor the retirement benefits has risen from 13.1 percent to 22.1 \npercent.\n  Does anybody believe the railroads are capable of paying 22.1 percent \nof the wages of all the railroad retirees into the railroad retirement \ntrust fund? Are we not here today because the railroads say they cannot \npay 16.1 percent? The whole logic, when you strip away the window \ndressing, is they want to lower the amount they are putting into the \ntrust fund from 16.1 to 13.1 percent, to try to help the railroads. \nThey have worked out an agreement to get the unions to support it by \nsaying, in essence, $7.5 billion goes to the railroads and giving $7.5 \nbillion to the union members. But the net result is the trust fund is \n$15 billion poorer 17 years from today than it is now. Even though you \nare earning a higher rate of return, because you are taking out huge \namounts, you are depleting the trust fund.\n\n  All I am trying to do with this amendment is say invest the money and \nevery penny you earn belongs to the railroads and the unions. Forget \nabout the taxpayer. But don't take the principal out, just take the \nearnings.\n  Frankly, if this were some kind of reasonable debate, you might say \nlet's take these higher earnings; part should go to the taxpayer \nbecause the taxpayer is paying a substantial amount of these benefits, \npart should go to the railroads, and part should go to the retirees. \nBut I am saying forget that; take the interest, but don't take the \nprincipal. That is the essence of the amendment.\n  I would like to submit the amendment. I hope my colleagues will \naccept it. I do not understand how it can be prudent public policy to \nset out a policy which, while claiming to get a higher rate of return, \nactually reduces the size of the trust fund available to pay benefits, \nbetween now and the year 2026, by 75 percent. How can that make sense? \nHow can it be prudent public policy to set out a program which is \nsalvaged only by the willingness of the railroads to pay to 22.1 \npercent of all wages into a trust fund, when today they claim they \ncannot afford to pay 16.1 percent? How can that possibly make any \nsense?\n  What I am saying is don't deplete the trust fund. But every penny you \nearn, by investing it, you can give to the railroads and you can give \nto the retirees. But maintain the assets to protect the taxpayers. That \nis the proposal. I think it is simple and easy to understand. For those \nwho want investment, it gives you investment. For those who want a \nbetter rate of return potentially, it gives you a better rate of \nreturn. But what it does not let you do is pillage 75 percent of the \ntrust fund over the next 25 years. That it does not let you do.\n  That is the essence of the amendment.\n\n[[Page S12354]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have been listening carefully to my good \nfriend from Texas, and a lot of what he says is accurate. But he does \nnot, as they say, tell you the whole story. Ultimately, the question \ncomes down to: Are there enough funds in tier 2, in the railroad \nretirement fund, to pay additional benefits to retirees and spouses and \nalso to decrease the amount of taxes the railroads are now paying? \nAdmittedly, it is a very high rate. That is the question. And can that \nbe done in a fiscally sound manner?\n  Today the railroad retirement trust fund balance is growing very \ndramatically. Under current law, the trust fund will have balances this \nyear of about six times the cost of benefits. Through about the year \n2020, the ratio never sinks below six. At that point, the year 2020, it \ncontinues to decline forever. By the end of 75 years, the balances in \nthe trust fund will equal an unbelievable 53 times the cost of 1 year's \nbenefits.\n  So the question is, Why all this increase in balances? Isn't there \nsomething prudent that can be done about this very large increase in \nbalances? Because under the actuarial estimates it just continues to \ngrow and grow.\n  And how much of the balance is really necessary? In Social Security, \nthe actuary considers the system to be in actuarial balance in any year \nthe balances of the Social Security trust fund are equal to at least \none time the amount of benefits that are paid out in a year. That is \nSocial Security's standards. The actuaries have determined there is at \nleast a 1-to-1 ratio of balances in the Social Security trust fund \ncompared to the costs in that year that have to be paid out. Clearly, \ntoday it is much more than one, but the standard, the actuaries say, is \n1 to 1. It is not six times or three times, but one.\n\n  Today, on the railroad retirement trust fund tier 2, there is a real \nneed, frankly, to do something about the balances in a way that seems \nreasonable and prudent. There are some changes that should be made. One \nis the retirement age. Some industries are a lot more hazardous and \ndangerous than some others. Railroading is certainly more hazardous and \nmore dangerous than some other industries. The retirement age today in \nthe railroad industry under current law is 62 years. It is only fair \nthat it be reduced to 60 years. In many industries across the Nation, \nthe retirement age is lower than that. It can be 55, and for a \nhazardous industry such as railroads it makes sense that the retirement \nage be 60.\n  In addition, vesting does not have to be a full 10 years as it is \ntoday. In many industries, vesting is less than that. It is 5 years.\n  For survivor benefits, today when a railroader retires, he and his \nwife will receive 145 percent of wages. If he dies, the widow gets 50 \npercent. If he were single, it would be 100 percent. So the thought is \nto at least raise the widow's. If she survives her husband, raise her \nbenefits to 100 percent. It seems to me that the railroader himself \nwould get 100 percent if he retired and is single. It just makes sense.\n  The current taxes that the company pays are too high. They are much \nhigher than taxes paid in the private arena, and they are higher than \nwhat a company would pay in its pension program for its employees.\n  The idea is to lower the taxes and increase the benefits in a way \nthat is reasonable and prudent so we don't have that huge balance \naccumulating in the railroad trust fund. I think it is done in a very \nsound and fair way.\n  The ultimate question really is, Is the balance of money in the trust \nfund large enough to accommodate these changes? In the legislation \nbefore us, which includes the changes I have indicated, the balances in \nthe trust fund in any year are at least one and two-thirds times \ngreater than the amount needed to pay benefits in that year. That is a \nhigher standard by two-thirds than the standard currently for Social \nSecurity. By the end of the 75-year period under this bill, the \nbalances are about 12 times the cost of paying benefits in any 1 year.\n  Look at the chart of the Senator from Texas. He has that red portion. \nIt continually falls off until about the year 2023. In 2026, his chart \nstops. It doesn't keep going. If his chart were to keep going, it would \nhave the effect of this chart behind me to my right. It falls down to \nthe levels indicated on the chart of the Senator from Texas, but then \nit starts right up again at a very high rate.\n  The low level which is of concern to the Senator from Texas \nrightfully should be addressed. It is a level which is one and two-\nthirds times higher than the actuarial balance that the chief actuary \nat Social Security says must be maintained.\n  There are provisions in the bill--the Senator from Texas is correct, \nand the railroad industry agrees and thinks this is just fine--which \nsay if the funds are not what we assume them to be, then the \nrailroader's and employer's taxes begin to rise. But the Senator from \nTexas says when that happens, and if it happens, Congress is going to \njust come right in and bail out the railroad industry.\n  We have not done that, historically. The last five times this \nCongress generally addressed the question of the financial viability of \nthe railroads and/or the retirement system, in 1974, in 1981, in 1983, \nand in 1987, Congress did not bail out the railroads. Congress either \ndecreased benefits or raised employer taxes. We encourage the railroad \nto solve these problems themselves. We have never ``bailed out'' the \nrailroad industry.\n\n  Further, this legislation before us has lots of built-in sort of \nrequirements of independent audits, of reports, and looking far ahead \nas possible to try to anticipate if there is going to be a problem of \nsome kind or another.\n  Specifically, the legislation before us requires the trust fund to \nhave an independent, qualified public accountant to audit the trust. \nThe trust fund then must submit a report to Congress which includes a \nreport based on the audit. The report supplied to Congress must contain \nfinancial statements of operations and cashflow.\n  Moreover, two financial reports required in current law would \ncontinue. The chief actuary for the Railroad Retirement Board must also \ndo a major update of actuarial evaluations every 4 years but with \nannual updates every year by the chief actuary of the Railroad \nRetirement Board. The Railroad Retirement Board will report annually to \nthe Congress and to the President as to the state of the system. Every \nyear we will get updates.\n  The lines on the chart of the Senator from Texas as well as these are \nthe intermediate assumptions; that is, there is a pessimistic \nassumption, there is an intermediate assumption, and there is an \noptimistic assumption. These are the intermediate assumptions on both \nof these charts.\n  What basically drives these assumptions? What is the biggest unknown \nthat we have to look at?\n  It is essentially the level of employment in the railroad industry. \nWhen the level of employment in the railroad industry declines \nsignificantly, obviously, as is in the case of Social Security, there \nare fewer people paying into the trust fund compared with the number of \npeople drawing benefits from the trust fund.\n  This is an industry which is almost the opposite of Social Security. \nFor Social Security, there are about three workers for every one person \npaying in. In this industry, it is about one to three. It is a mature \nindustry. It is not a young industry. It is an industry with fewer \nemployees and more retirees.\n  The question is, How many more fewer employees will there be to \naccommodate the number of retirees?\n  I would like you to look at this chart behind me. It indicates that \nwe need not worry about a cut in the number of employees. That is \nbecause of increased productivity and increased efficiencies in the \nrailroad industry. It really can't get much lower per ton mile or per \nrailroad mile traveled.\n  This chart shows the railroad crew size and productivity. As you can \nsee, in about the years 1950 to 1964, the average crew size was five. \nIn the years roughly 1960 to 1978, the crew size was four, and on down \nto about 1998, the average crew size is two.\n  You can't get much lower than two for a crew on a train. There is \nalways going to be at least two. We are not going to have fewer \nemployees. We will probably have more trains, which means more \nemployees, but we are not going to have fewer employees per train.\n\n[[Page S12355]]\n\n  Meanwhile, the revenue per ton mile and per employee, as you can tell \nby the chart, is increasing at a very high rate. We have more revenue \nfor ton miles per employee. That is going to help the solvency of the \ntrust fund. At the same time there are not going to be any fewer \nemployees than there are today.\n\n  The basic point is, Is this the responsible way to solve the problem \nof explosive trust fund balances? I submit yes. One, the actuaries will \nmaintain a balance that is proper. There will be annual reports galore.\n  I urge Senators to resist this amendment. It is unnecessary. It is \nwrong. It means the balances will stay forever. The benefits will not \nbe greater. The burden on taxes will not be lower in due time.\n  If this amendment is agreed to, despite being wrong on its merits, it \nis going to probably mean no railroad bill this session, and maybe next \nyear, because we will have to go to conference on this matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me be brief. When all the people came \nto see me about 6 months ago--actually, almost a year ago, in relation \nto this bill--I sat down to listen to them, having spent about 3 years \nworking on Social Security.\n  Let me give you my response, based on something I think everybody can \nunderstand. Today we are really worried about Social Security because \nwe have 3.3 workers per retiree. We are going to two workers per \nretiree. We are very concerned about our ability to pay Social Security \nbenefits.\n  I have done a great deal of work and written a fair amount of \nmaterial and articles explaining how investing Social Security \nsurpluses in interest-earning real assets will cause the trust fund in \nSocial Security to grow and will enhance our ability to pay benefits.\n  But I have never suggested that investing the Social Security surplus \ncould allow us to lower the retirement age in Social Security from 65 \nto 60. In fact, under current law, it is rising from 65 to 67 even at \nthis moment. I have never suggested that before any money is invested \nthat we could cut Social Security taxes. Someone would laugh in your \nface if you suggested that.\n  Now, into my office walk representatives of the railroads and unions, \nand they say: Look, we have a program which has one worker for every \nthree retirees, not the other way around, which it is with Social \nSecurity. This retirement program is in much worse shape than Social \nSecurity. We want to invest our trust fund, and we are going to cut the \nretirement age, reduce the amount of time you have to work to get \nbenefits, increase benefits, and reduce the amount that the railroads \nare putting into the program through two different payments they are \nmaking.\n  First of all, if, in your retirement, somebody told you they could \nspend 75 percent of your trust fund, give you more benefits, and you \ncould pay less in, I do not think you would believe it. Well, you \nshould not believe it because it is not true.\n\n  My colleague points out my chart ends in 2026. Why? Because in 2026 \nthe payroll tax, which the railroads are saying have to be reduced for \nthem to be able to operate--they have to be reduced from 16.1 percent \ndown to 13.1 percent--by the time we get to 2026, the payroll tax is up \nnot to 16.1 percent but 22.1 percent. Does anybody believe that the \nrailroads can or will pay 22.1 percent of payroll into this retirement \nprogram? Nobody believes they can or will.\n  Everybody understands that 20 years from now we are going to hear \nthis knock on our door. We are not going to be here, but somebody is \ngoing to be here, and the railroads are going to say: My God, this \nretirement program is in terrible trouble, and under law our payroll \ntax is getting ready to jump from 13.1 percent to 22.1 percent. We \ncannot pay these taxes. At that point whatever these charts show is not \nrelevant because everybody knows the railroads cannot pay that amount \ninto this program and operate viably in the American economy.\n  So what is going to happen? You have spent four-fifths of the trust \nfund or let the railroads spend four-fifths of the trust fund. You have \na payroll tax of 22.1 percent. What is going to happen? They are going \nto say they can't pay it and they are going to ask the Federal \nGovernment to intervene.\n  When you are talking about what good shape this trust fund is in, \nwhat is being called solvency here is having enough money to pay \nbenefits for 4 years. There is no private retirement program under \nERISA that would not be shut down if it had assets that would only pay \nfor 4 years.\n  My amendment is not what I would call a stingy amendment. My \namendment says, OK, take this trust fund, and we are going to give you \n$15 billion right out of the Treasury. You can invest it on behalf of \nthe retirees. And then you can spend every penny that you earn on that \n$15 billion. You can lower the amount railroads are putting into the \nsystem. You can give new benefits, but you cannot spend the principal. \nThat is all my amendment does.\n  If we do not adopt an amendment similar to this, I want to predict, \neven though I do not think any of us will be here 20 years from now--I \ncertainly will not--that 20 years from now this retirement program is \ngoing to be on its back, the railroads are going to be being pulled \ndown economically by having a 22.1-percent payroll tax, and we are \ngoing to have a transportation crisis in America.\n  I do not know if anybody will ever look back at what we are doing \nhere, but they should. Because what we have done, underneath all else, \nis that while we are doing some things that make sense--letting them \ninvest the trust fund makes sense--we are literally letting them take \n$15 billion, we are letting the railroads pocket $7.5 billion, we are \nletting them give $7.5 billion in gifts to their retirees and workers, \nand we are setting up a situation where there is going to be a train \nwreck, and the taxpayers are going to be forced to pick up the pieces.\n  Senator Nickles and I have no constituency. That is obvious. This \nthing has been sold. All the railroads have come to Republicans and \nsaid: This is great; it will be great for railroads. The unions have \ncome to the Democrats and said: This will be great for the workers. And \nthe bottom line is, nobody cares, apparently, about the taxpayer or \nabout the future of this retirement program.\n  So we are on the verge of cutting this, taking 75 percent of the \nmoney out of this trust fund and giving it away, committing ourselves \nto the railroads, having to pay a tax that we know they are not capable \nof paying, that we know cannot be paid. How are railroads going to put \n22.1 percent of every dollar they pay to every worker into this trust \nfund 20 years from now when they cannot put 16.1 percent in today? They \nare not going to be able to do it.\n  So all my amendment says is, let them invest it and do whatever they \nwant to do with the interest, but do not let them spend the principal. \nWhat that will mean is, the trust fund will basically stay at its \ncurrent level. They can reduce the amount railroads are paying in. They \ncan increase benefits. Neither of those actions, in my opinion, is \nfiscally responsible, but they cannot simply pillage the trust fund for \n$15 billion over 17 years, which is exactly what happens under this \nproposal--and every set of figures used by every person in this debate \nall come from the railroad retirement board. All of them show that the \ntrust fund, over the next 20 years, is depleted, under the expected \neconomic projections, by 75 percent. That cannot be good public policy.\n  I understand that Senator Nickles has an amendment. What I would like \nto do is yield the floor. If there is any more debate on this \namendment, there can be, and I would be happy to have the amendment set \naside. Senator Nickles can offer his amendment, and then it can be \ndebated. And then we could have the vote on the two amendments and sort \nof see where we are.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2175 To Amendment No. 2170\n\n  (Purpose: To use a 5-year average rather than a 10-year average on \n             capturing the average account benefits ratio)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be laid aside and I call up amendment No. 2175.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S12356]]\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2175 to amendment No. 2170:\n       On page 40, line 1, strike ``10 most'' and insert ``5 \n     most''.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Gramm for reading \nthe bill and trying to do something to protect the integrity of the \ntrust fund.\n  He has said, No. 1, if we are going to give them $15 billion, let's \nmake sure we don't spend down the principal. And, No. 2, let's only \nspend the interest or the dividends from that trust fund to provide new \nbenefits. I support him in that. I compliment him for that.\n  I also have an amendment that wants to protect the integrity of the \ntrust fund. The trust fund, by any of the scenarios--I will show the \ncharts in just a minute--the trust funds goes way too low. The bill's \nstated objective is to keep the trust fund equal to but somewhere \nbetween four and six times the annual payment to beneficiaries. That is \ntheir goal. That is their objective. Unfortunately, the bill before us, \nunder the middle assumption, doesn't even come close to that.\n  As a matter of fact, the trust fund goes all the way down to about \n1.3 annual payments. In other words, it almost goes bankrupt. It barely \nhas enough to make 1 year's payments of benefits. That is not a good \ndeal for taxpayers, and it is certainly not a good deal for railroad \nretirees. I don't think it is a good deal for the railroad companies \nbecause they are going to be socked with a very large tax increase.\n  I will use the chart Senator Baucus has. I think it illustrates it. \nWe start out with about 6 years of benefits under today's standard, but \nwhen we pass this bill, in a period of about 20 years, we go down to \njust a little over 1 year's balance. In other words, we take a fund--\nand I will insert this in the Record. Actually, I will insert for all \nthree assumptions.\n  Under the assumption I will talk about, the employment assumption No. \n2, the one in the middle, we start with a balance this year of $19.3 \nbillion. And under current law, that goes to $34 billion.\n  Under the bill we are getting ready to pass--and I can count votes; \nfrankly, I could count votes before this week started--that trust fund \nbalance goes from $19 to $8.4 billion. Instead of being $34 billion, it \ngoes to $8.4 billion. That is the bill we are getting ready to pass.\n  I wish I could wake up all my colleagues, most of whom have not read \nthis bill, most of whom had nothing to do with drafting the bill. This \nis the first time I can recall in my 21 years in the Senate that we \nhave had a bill that was totally written by special interest groups. In \nthis case, railroad unions and management got together and said: Here \nis our bill, don't touch it. Don't have a hearing on it.\n  They didn't have a hearing in the House. We didn't have a hearing in \nthe Senate. I asked for a hearing in the Senate Finance Committee. We \ndid not get it. We had a markup but it was already railroaded. There \nwere not going to be any amendments. There was one amendment adopted in \nthe House or the Senate. That was the amendment dealing with scoring. \nWe are not going to count it. It didn't say we will waive the Budget \nAct. It said will not count it, which I think is even worse than just \nwaiving the Budget Act. Why have a Budget Act if you are going to have \n$15.3 billion in budget outlays and it doesn't count?\n  We just had a vote on that by Chairman Domenici and ranking member \nConrad, and we lost. We lost that vote. So the special interest groups \nare together. And they said: Let's leave it in. They didn't request \nthat amendment. It is interesting; that was put in by the House. So \nthat was the only amendment they put in.\n\n  It was a bad amendment in my opinion. We are going to accept that, \nand we are going to keep the bill. We will not touch it. I think we are \nmaking a mistake.\n  You ask: Why are you still fighting this? You know this bill is going \nto pass? Sure, I do. But I want to make a statement. I want to show \nthat we can do a better job. We are not beholden to the special \ninterest groups. We are beholden to taxpayers. This is a Federal \nstatute. We are changing Federal law. How many CEOs of the railroad \ncompanies or how many union members were elected to the Senate? I don't \nknow, but they wrote the law. They wrote the bill that is going to \nbecome law.\n  I don't think they did a very good job. If I thought they did a good \njob, maybe I would cosponsor the bill. I don't think they did a good \njob. History will tell.\n  I will make a prediction. I am not going to be here in 20 years. I \nguess if I was as studious and healthy as Senator Thurmond, maybe I \ncould be. If I was fortunate enough to be reelected by the people of \nOklahoma, maybe I could be. Agewise it is possible, but it is not \npossible after consulting with my spouse. But 20 years from now, if not \nwell before that, Congress is going to have to readdress this issue \nbecause we are going to have a big problem.\n  As this chart shows--I am borrowing Senator Baucus's chart, and I \nthank him--we are going from 6 years of benefits down to a little over \n1, we think. That is in 20-some years.\n  Then Senator Baucus said: Wait a minute. Way out in the outyears, it \ngoes way up. Who knows? I know they are going to have problems when we \nget into the year 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026. It goes way \ndown. The trust fund actually falls by 65 percent. When you have that \ntrigger, payroll taxes have to go way up. Payroll taxes have to go up \nby 69 percent.\n  That is because in the bill we say if it triggers at a certain point, \nwe are going to have a tax increase, a tax increase that is paid by the \nrailroad companies. And it goes from 13.1 percent to 22.1 percent.\n  Senator Gramm said they are having problems. They have shrunk their \nlabor force significantly. They are not going to be able to handle that \nkind of increase. They will come back to Congress and say: Here, it is \nyours. The trust fund is broke. It didn't work out very well, so pay \nour employees. And because the Railroad Retirement Act is a Federal \nstatute, it becomes an entitlement.\n  Many people here say it is not that. No, they won't be coming back to \nus.\n  I predict that within 20 years they will be coming back to Congress \nand saying: We need a fix. We need a little bump. We need a little \ntransfusion. Maybe the transfusion will be from Social Security. They \nare already getting it. I wonder how many of our colleagues know that \nthey get billions of dollars from Social Security, basically from tier \n1 going into tier 2, to pay their benefits. It is in the bill. I have \nan amendment that will address that. Possibly we will consider that \nsoon.\n  Right now I offer an amendment that I urge my colleagues to look at, \nconsider, and hopefully pass. The triggering mechanism to have a tax \nincrease is if the trust fund goes so low that there will be a tax \nincrease. If you actually get low enough to pay benefits for 4 years, \nyou have a tax increase. It is automatic. It is in the bill. It would \nbecome law soon. OK. That makes sense. But you ought to have some kind \nof triggering mechanism so if we keep the trust fund balanced, we won't \nbe coming to the taxpayers for general revenues.\n\n  What is wrong is the calculation. You look back over 10 years to \nfigure that average. By looking over 10 years, if you just see the \nrevenue estimates, they estimate that the trust fund balance goes from \na high, somewhere in the neighborhood, under present law, of about $27 \nbillion. Under the Daschle bill or the railroad bill we are getting \nready to pass, the railroad trust fund runs about $23 billion. Then the \nnext several years it falls to 19, 18, 17, 16, 13, 12, 10, 8. You are \nlooking at a 10-year average. If you look at a 10-year average and you \nare averaging 8 and averaging 20, maybe it won't trigger the tax \nincrease until about the year 2021, 2022, 2023. In other words, it \nallows the fund to fall from about 6 years' payments down to a little \nover 1 before the tax increase is triggered.\n  That is too late. That doesn't allow the trust fund to have enough \ntime to recharge, to build, to have a cushion to earn interest or to \nearn dividends. In other words, we allow this dip to go too low.\n  The effect of my amendment would be to smooth that out. Possibly it \nwould smooth out the payroll tax increase. In other words, instead of \nlooking back over 10, we would look over 5. So your average, once you \ngot on the\n\n[[Page S12357]]\n\ndecline, it would say, if we get much lower, we will have to have a tax \nincrease sooner to keep that fund from going so low. That is too big of \na dip. That is too dangerous for railroad employees or retirees to have \nthe fund balance dip down as low as 1.3 annual payments.\n  This is under the middle scenario. If you look under the pessimistic \nscenario, it goes in the red. Under the pessimistic scenario, the whole \ntrust fund goes totally in the red by the year 2022. It will not be \nable to make payments. It will need either general revenue funds or it \nwill have to cancel increases or suspend payments or whatever.\n  In other words, there is a scenario here where the fund is totally \nbroke in 20 years. That is not acceptable. I don't think it is \nacceptable. I think we should protect railroad retirees. We have too \nmuch of a variable by using a 10-year average before you have a trigger \nfor a tax increase. So my suggestion is, let's make it over a 5-year \naverage. If you get on a down slope, the trust fund starts falling in \nvalue, we won't have to wait another 8 years before you trigger a tax \nincrease.\n  That is the essence of my amendment. It is a friendly amendment. It \nis not an amendment to gut the bill. It is not an amendment to say we \ndon't want railroad retirement and we are not going to have railroad \nretirement. It is an amendment that says they put together a deal that \nwas negotiated between labor and the employees or the unions. They may \nhave cut a good deal for the employers, basically saying let the fund \ngo almost bankrupt before you trigger a tax increase.\n  We will do that in 20 years. Guess what. Everybody running those \ncompanies will all be retired by then, and Members of Congress will all \nbe gone by then. Let somebody else worry about that. So these big tax \nincreases are not triggered--it is interesting, they are not triggered \nuntil 15 years from now, but then they are pretty big. It is not a 10-\npercent increase in payroll taxes, not a 20-percent increase; they keep \nthe tax rate basically at 13.1 percent for about the next 15 years and, \nbingo, you go from 13.1 percent to 22.1. That is a 69-percent increase \nin payroll taxes.\n  I just can imagine--as a matter of fact, I will make this prediction: \nWhen this happens 15, 20 years from now, somebody is going to come \nback--the railroad companies will say: We can't afford that. That will \nbankrupt us. They will basically say: Taxpayers, you handle it or \nliquidate the railroad so they can pay these benefits.\n  You are in that kind of scenario. That will happen. That is too \nDraconian of an increase because we allowed the trust fund to get too \nlow before we triggered the changes. I say, let's trigger the tax \nincrease. Instead of over a 10-year average, do it over a 5-year \naverage. That makes a lot more sense. We are not holding these funds to \nfiduciary standards. I have an amendment to do that. We don't hold them \nto fiduciary standards that we do all other multiemployer plans. Maybe \nwe should.\n  I have told some of my colleagues who have been voting and saying \nthey want to take up the bill, all right, we are on the bill. I want to \nconsider the bill. They say let's consider amendments. Well, this is an \namendment. This is an amendment that would help the security of the \ntrust fund, make sure it doesn't get down too low. We would have the \nautomatic trigger moved up a little bit. That is the essence of the \namendment. Instead of letting the fund dip down quite so low--before it \ngoes down too low, below the threshold of four times annual payments, \nwe would trigger the tax increase a little earlier so it doesn't go \ndown quite so low. That is the essence of the amendment.\n  We want to save the trust funds so the funds will be there to make \nthe payments and not bankrupt the railroads at the same time. Now, \nmaybe if, in the interest in this bill, the railroad companies and the \nunions would have come before Congress and said, yes, let's have a \nhearing on this bill, I could have asked them questions. My guess is \nthe railroad unions would say, yes, I like that idea. They would \nprobably say I like that idea because we don't want to jeopardize our \npayments. If somebody is retired at age 60, and they happen to be age \n80 and they are reading the reports, they would say, the trust fund \nwent down to almost bankrupt. They can barely make payments this year. \nThey are not going to get a lot of comfort over that. So the idea is, \nlet's try to make greater protection of the trust fund.\n  Mr. President, I want to have printed in the Record a table that I \nhave compiled, my staff, of the three various

Railroad Retirement Trust Fund actuaries. Provided by Senator Don Nickles, 12/4/01.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. This compares present law to this bill, under those \nassumptions. Present law under the employment assumption, the middle \nassumption, shows in current law a trust fund balance of $19.3 billion \ntoday and $34 billion in the year 2025. Under the Daschle amendment, or \nthe bill we have before us, we start at $19.3 billion, and in 25 years \nwe end at $8.5 billion. In other words, the trust fund is only about--\nwell, it is 75 percent below where it is today, or where it would be \nunder current law. That is assuming a 21-percent payroll tax in the \nlast few years. So even with enormous payroll tax increases, the fund \nis still in serious jeopardy of being able to pay benefits, being able \nto provide security and assurances that there is going to be money \nthere for retirees who maybe\n\n[[Page S12358]]\n\nworked most of their lives and depend on it.\n  I have put this in the Record because I want people to see it. I want \nrailroad management companies to look at these scenarios and realize, \nOK, we are trading current law for this. This may be a great deal for \nthem for the intermediate time. People may say: Why are you doing this? \nRailroad companies will save a few hundred million dollars a year--over \n10 years, $4 billion; over 15, 17 years, $17.5 billion. Their taxes are \ngoing to be cut. I will put that into the Record. Their taxes are going \nto be cut over $400 million and that gets larger every year. That is \nwhat the companies get by reducing the payroll tax from present law, \n$16.1 billion, to 13.1 percent, and then it eliminates another \nsupplemental benefit tax that boils down to, I think, 26 cents an hour. \nThey eliminate both of those taxes and save about $400 million a year--\n``they'' being maybe a dozen railroad companies. They save $400 million \na year.\n  What do the employees get? The employees get a pretty good deal. They \nget a deal because they have tier 1 benefits that are supposed to be \nequal to Social Security; they pay the same tax. The Social Security \ntax is equal to 6.2 percent for employees, 6.2 percent for the \nemployer. They pay the identical tax, same tax as everybody else in \nAmerica. But they don't get the same benefit. Under Social Security \nbenefits, people receive their full retirement benefits at age 65, \nwhich is going to age 67. Under railroad retirement, they get to \nreceive 100 percent benefit now at 62. This bill makes that 60. They \npay the same tax with more benefit. You get zero if you retire at age \n60 under Social Security. If you retire at 62 under Social Security, \nyou get 80 percent of the benefit you were expected to receive at age \n65. That 80 percent is being reduced under current law to 70 percent \nover the next several years. So under Social Security, a person who \nretires at 62, many years from now, gets 70 percent; and under railroad \nretirement, they get 100 percent benefit at age 60--and they pay the \nsame taxes. There is a big difference there.\n  What about the survivor benefit? That is a great big benefit increase \nfor railroad retirees. It costs money. How much does it cost? Guess \nwhat. It costs about $4 billion a year over the next 10 years. They \nalso have another little benefit: tier 2 benefits, non-Social Security \nbenefits, the other railroad retirement benefits, a survivor benefit \nequal to 100 percent of what the employee was receiving. That is pretty \nnice because in most private pension systems the survivor receives 50 \npercent. I wish they could pay that much and more. Who is going to have \nto pay the bill? What are those benefits? They add up to $4 billion \nover the next 10 years. That is about $400 million per year in a couple \nof years. So it totals about $4 billion over the next 10 years. It just \nhappens to come out even that the railroad companies and employees \ncome out with the same amount of benefit. That is what they mutually \nagreed upon. Well, what they didn't do, in my opinion, they didn't \nprotect the fund. The fund goes almost bankrupt before this triggering \nmechanism to make sure the fund stays solvent is kicked in. That is not \nto get too technical, but they have a 10-year lookback average before, \nand if that average gets below 4 years' annual payments, then they have \nan automatic tax increase. That waits too long and allows the fund to \ngo down to 1.3 annual payments before the tax is really kicked in--\nmaybe it is kicked in in the last couple years, but it doesn't catch \nup.\n\n  So the fund is in jeopardy. The payments are in jeopardy. The whole \nconcept of paying railroad retirement is in serious jeopardy because we \ndidn't do a good enough job, when we created this change, to make sure \nit would be solvent. So I have an amendment--really a simple \namendment--that says instead of looking back over 10 years, look back \nover 5 years. I think it is a reasonable amendment, one that if the \nrailroad employees could look at, they would support in a minute, \nabsolutely, totally, completely. It is a good provision to try to make \nsure there will be a trust fund there instead of allowing it to dip so \nlow.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, basically, this amendment offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma is just unnecessary. In fact, he used my chart. \nMy chart makes a case that is much worse than would occur under the \nbill.\n  I am just trying to present the facts so people can make a reasonable \njudgment. I looked at the balance on a year-by-year basis. That is what \nthat chart shows. Under the bill before us, there is a 10-year rolling \naverage lookback which means that lower level on the chart would never \nget that low under the bill. The Senator from Oklahoma wants to change \nit from 10 to 5. Even 5 will not get that low.\n  The main point is that many people have looked at this issue from \ndifferent directions and have concluded that this legislation is a good \nway to deal with the excess balance in the railroad retirement trust \nfund. By increasing some benefits, by lowering taxes, and yet building \nin some automatic auditing devices, that comports with requiring the \nactuary to report whether the trust fund is actuarially sound in the \ncurrent year and succeeding years under various economic assumptions.\n  I do not know how much better we can do than that. It is very \ndifficult to predict the future. I remind my colleagues that CBO, in \ntrying to make 10-year estimates, let alone the 20 years we are talking \nabout here, has varied its 10-year totals by $1 trillion over a 6-month \nperiod of time. It is because economic assumptions change so quickly, \nso often.\n  We are in a more uncertain world than we were, say, 10, 15, 20, 30, \n40 years ago. The actuaries have done the best they can with what they \nhave. They made three different projections. One is pessimistic, one is \nintermediate, one is optimistic. The assumption we have been talking \nabout is the intermediate. It is not the pessimistic, not the \noptimistic; it is the intermediate.\n  I submit that with the annual reports from the actuaries coming to \nthe Congress, we will know whether we are getting into trouble or not.\n  This is the best solution we could come up with at this time, and it \nis done on a fair, reasonable basis.\n  Taking a more pessimistic analysis than provided by the analysis of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, the worst case is about the year 2020, 2022, \nand that is when the ratio is 1 to two-thirds, balance to costs. The \nSocial Security actuary says we can get as low as 1 to 1. We are not 1 \nto 1 today in Social Security. The Social Security actuary says that is \nthe lowest benchmark with which he deals.\n  Under our intermediate assumptions, we do not get that low. We get 1 \nto two-thirds, 1 to 1. I suggest we are even too pessimistic.\n  I asked the question of the chief actuary how the economic estimates \nhave been on employment levels, which is the most difficult estimate to \nmake. His response is: Employment levels over the last 5 years--\nrailroad employment--have decreased an average of .9 percent per year. \nHe said this decrease is better than assumption 1. Assumption 1 is the \nmost optimistic assumption. He says for the last 5 years, the actual \ndecrease in employment was .9 percent per year, which is better than \nprovided for in assumption 1. We are talking about the intermediate, \nnot assumption 1.\n  He also says employment levels over the last 10 years have decreased \nan average of 1.8 percent which falls somewhere in between assumption 1 \nand assumption 2.\n  We have been a little too conservative actually. The main point is, \nwho knows what the world is going to be like in the year 2020? The \nSenator from Oklahoma takes the most pessimistic assumption and says we \ncannot have that. My Lord, if we are in that bad a shape in 18, 19 \nyears, I can tell my colleagues we are going to be doing a lot of other \nthings in this body in addition to railroad retirement. I have \nconfidence in the Congress, in the system. We analyzed this thoroughly. \nWe will do well.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In just a second. I also say this measure before us has \n73 cosponsors. It was considered last year in September in the Finance \nCommittee. We had 20 amendments in the Finance Committee. It passed by \na very large margin in the House.\n  In sum, this amendment is unnecessary, and it is also mischievous \nbecause\n\n[[Page S12359]]\n\nif it were to be adopted, this bill would have to go to conference. \nThere would be no railroad retirement bill this session, and there \ncould be no railroad retirement bill this Congress.\n  I urge Members not to agree to this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. The Senator said I took the most pessimistic assumption. \nI correct him. All my statements and the charts are on the middle \nassumption, not the most pessimistic assumption. The most pessimistic \nassumption says this bill has real problems. I did not use that. I used \nthe middle assumption.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I stand corrected. Mr. President, most of his analysis \nwas on the intermediate assumption. At one point, he was talking about \nthe most pessimistic assumption. My response was to both.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I do not want to inflate anything. I am \nvery particular on being factual. I want to correct a mistake I made in \nmy earliest debate. This came up, frankly, when those of us who had \nsome concerns about the legislation were informed of it on Monday and \nwe were to debate it on Tuesday. I cited from memory that this fund had \nactually paid out more every year than it had taken in, to the tune of \nabout $90 billion. That was not factually correct.\n  The facts are the fund has paid out more than it has taken in every \nyear since 1957. For the last 43 years, it has actually received \npayroll taxes, contributions from employees, and it has made benefit \npayments. The benefit payments have exceeded payroll taxes and company \ncontributions every year for the last 43 years, so I was correct from \n1957 on. I wanted to state that, and I will insert that in the Record \nas well.\n  I want to be factually correct. I want my colleagues to understand \nthat when I state that 20 years from now there is going to be a big \nproblem if we do not do something because we are getting ready to set \nup a system that allows this fund to almost go bankrupt, almost to \nwhere they cannot pay the benefits before we let the tax increase \ntrigger.\n  Some people have said: This is self-funding. This is great. We are \ngoing to keep these fund balances between four and six times annual \npayments for the next 75 years. If the trust fund balances go up, they \nmake good investments, they invest in a lot of stocks that did \nexceptionally well, great; they can have payroll tax cuts.\n  If they do poorly, if they get below that four, we will have \nautomatic payroll tax increases on the employer, not the employee. \nFine, if that works.\n  Under the middle assumption, the tax increases are not triggered \nuntil well after the fund is depleted because they use a 10-year \naverage. So they are on a sliding-down scale before the tax increases \ntrigger, so the fund almost goes bankrupt. It goes down to about 1.3 \nannual payments before they have the tax increases, and then they are \nin serious trouble.\n  Somebody said this is the law; this does not allow general fund \nfinancing, which is one of the reasons I happened to be concerned about \nit. Somebody asks: Why are you so concerned? Ultimately the Federal \nGovernment could be liable. You say: Why? Let me read a couple \nstatements.\n  I like to think the railroad companies would take care of their \nemployees, and if they did, I couldn't care less what benefits they \npay. If this were out of the Federal system, they could pay whatever \nbenefits they want. I do not care if they have retirement at age 40 if \nthey pay for it and the Federal Government is not liable for it. I do \nnot care if they have early retirement.\n  I do not care if they have a spouse benefit that exceeds 100 percent \nif they pay for it.\n  What I disagree with strongly is if they greatly increase benefits \nand underfund the system and then say: If this does not work out, \ntaxpayers, you pick up the cost. Why should we be asking people in \nMinnesota or Oklahoma who make $40,000 a year or $20,000 a year to \nincrease their taxes to pay benefits for people who make a lot more \nmoney than they do and enable them to retire at age 60 when people in \nOklahoma do not get to retire until they are 65 or 67 and then they \nreceive benefits far greater than people in Oklahoma receive. I do not \nwant the people of Oklahoma to have to pay taxes for them to do that.\n  I will read a couple quotes. Supporters insist the amendment places \nresponsibility on future benefits on the railroads in the event \ninvestments do not work out.\n  I will read what the railroad industry thinks of its responsibility. \nThis is a quote from the United Transportation newsletter dated May of \n2000:\n\n       The legislation also requires that the railroads would be \n     responsible if the trust fund falls below a certain level. If \n     this happens, a tax would automatically be placed solely on \n     the carriers in order to replenish the fund. In order to add \n     a final assurance to the integrity of the fund, it is still \n     bound by the full faith and credit of the United States \n     Government. They would be required to pay the obligations of \n     the fund if, for some reason, the other safety nets in place \n     were insufficient.\n\n  Earlier this year, the Lincoln Journal Star--on 8/15 of this year--\nstated:\n\n       Other unions and the Association of American Railroads are \n     promoting the bill as a self-financed shoo-in. In fact, the \n     U.S. government would still back the retirement fund, \n     acknowledged Obie O'Bannon, vice president of legislative \n     affairs for the association. But, he pointed out, the \n     ``automatic tax ratchet'' would require the railroads to kick \n     in more money any time the fund's balance is below four times \n     annual benefits, so that's protection that would mean all \n     U.S. railroads would face insolvency before the Federal \n     liability applies.\n\n  I don't want the railroad to go insolvent, but I don't want the \nFederal liability to apply either. I don't want our taxpayers across \nthe country to have to bail this system out because we did a crummy job \nof legislating in 2001, and in 20 years we say: Well, we made a \nmistake. Darn, Senators Gramm and Nickles were right. Now the railroad \ncompanies are faced with a huge tax increase they cannot pay.\n  The fund is raising towards insolvency. Taxpayers, would you please \ngive a supplemental. Let us raid a little more from Social Security--\nwhich they do under this bill, as well. There is about a $2 billion \ntransfer from Social Security to help pay tier 2 benefits. That is \ninteresting. I thought we would protect Social Security. But we have a \nSocial Security bailout for the bill. Maybe we will address that \nshortly.\n  How else do we fix the fund? Are we going to write a check? Is the \nFederal Government going to write the check? I don't know. Some people \nin the unions say that is what we will do. Some in management say that \nis what we will do. I don't think that is the solution.\n  Let me read the last sentence of the vice president of legislative \naffairs for the Association of American Railroads:\n\n       All railroads would face insolvency before the federal \n     liability applies.\n\n  I don't want the railroads to become insolvent, nor do I want the \nFederal taxpayers to become liable for all the generous benefits. These \nbenefits, in comparison to retirement benefits in the private sector, \nare very generous--overly generous. Find other private pension systems \nthat offer full retirement at age 60. You won't find very many. Find \nother pension systems that offer spousal benefits or survivor benefits \nat 100 percent. You won't find very many. I doubt the department stores \noffer these kinds of benefits. Manufacturing companies don't offer \nthese benefits. Yet we are getting ready to do it.\n  Now I read that if it doesn't work out, taxpayers ``will bail us \nout.''\n  I won't be in the Senate, or I doubt I will be in the Senate, 20 \nyears from now, but if I am, I guarantee I will be opposing a taxpayer \nbailout of this industry. And conversely, I hope there will be others \nopposing this. This will happen. It is a prediction. It will be in the \nCongressional Record.\n\n  I hope I am wrong. I hope they find investments that do enormously \nwell. They might find good investments such as Intel, 10 years ago, \ngoing up in multiples. They might also find investments such as Enron. \nI am concerned. Everybody indicated this is not so bad.\n  I have not raised this on the general issue of debate. This investing \nin private funds is a good idea. I love for private individuals \ninvesting for themselves to buy parts of different companies. I am \nreluctant to think: What will this board invest in? Mr. President, $15 \nor $16 billion is a lot of money. What companies will they buy?\n\n[[Page S12360]]\n\n Are they going to be politically correct? Would they buy Microsoft? \nOur Government was suing Microsoft. I guess they still have suits \npending against Microsoft. Maybe that is not politically correct. What \nabout tobacco? Our Government in the previous administration was going \nafter tobacco. Philip Morris was a good investment the last year. \nMicrosoft was a good investment the last year. Would they be buying \nutility companies? A lot of utility companies are being sued for a lot \nof different reasons. Do they have to wash their hands from \ninvestments?\n  I have concerns when you have a board comprised of rail management \nrepresentatives, union representatives, and they select one additional \nperson they mutually agree upon to invest billions and billions. I have \nreservations about that. That is not what I raised this issue on.\n  For the information of colleagues, we will vote on the Gramm \namendment and the Nickles amendment starting around 4:30. For the \ninformation of our colleagues, we will have the joint prayer service, \nwhich we desperately need, starting at 5 o'clock. The amendment I am \noffering says, before we allow the trust funds to be depleted on such a \nsteep decline, if a 5-year average gets below 4 years, annual payments \ntrigger the tax increases at that time instead of using the 10-year \naverage. That would keep this a lot more shallow. It will keep the fund \nprobably well above 2 or 3 in the annual balance statement, certainly \nabove 2--not allowed to dip down so deep. That is for the protection of \nthe railroad retirees and for the protection of taxpayers, to make sure \nwe will not have to do what the United Transportation Newsletter said: \nWe can always fall back on the full faith and credit of the U.S. \nGovernment.\n  I hope that doesn't happen. I will work energetically to see it \ndoesn't happen. If we keep the trust balance more level, it will not \nhappen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment that would say, instead \nof having a 10-year lookback before you trigger an automatic tax \nincrease, do it over 5 years so we don't allow the trust fund balances \nto go as low as they are now projected to by the railroads' own \nactuaries of the pension plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't see any other Senators wishing to \nspeak, and the leadership would like to schedule these votes around \n4:30, so we have 15 more minutes. I will take that time to make a \ncouple of points.\n  First, this amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma simply is \nunnecessary. It is true that there is a dip. The fact is, on a yearly \nbasis the dip is as represented on that chart, but the bill before the \nSenate will not be as low as represented on the chart. Even if it is as \nlow as represented on the chart, this is unnecessary.\n  It is true that there is a question in the year 2021. There are a lot \nof questions. We have to do the best we can with what we have. The vast \nmajority of Senators and House Members have considered and concluded \nthat this is a fair way to deal with this issue. This issue, if it \narises, will not arise, according to the basis of this debate, for \nanother 20 years. So we are talking about what may or may not occur in \n20 years. Because of the annual reports provided in the bill and the \nactuarial estimates on an annual basis, when it gets closer to 20 years \nfrom now, we will have an idea whether or not this is working. If it is \nnot working, we will make adjustments. This amendment is totally \nunnecessary.\n  A couple of other points. The Senator mentioned there is a lot of \nSocial Security money going into railroad retirement. I will address \nthat. It is a point that is not commonly understood. In America today, \nclearly, there is a wide variety of industries. Some are new young \nindustries, service industries; some are older, mature industries, such \nas railroad or mining industries. Industries come and go. They expand. \nThey are just different, which means they have different ratios of the \nnumber of employees paying into Social Security compared with retirees \nreceiving Social Security in that industry.\n\n  Social Security, of course, doesn't collect and pay on an industry \nbasis. It collects and pays on a national basis. It is a large pool of \nAmericans, American workers paying into Social Security, and there are \na large number of retirees in America receiving benefits.\n  So as a practical matter, if we look at an industry, say a mature \nindustry where there are fewer employees paying into a Social Security \ntrust fund, and a lot of retirees receiving benefits, in effect there \nis a transfer of Social Security to that industry away from a younger \nindustry where there are so many more employees paying in and so many \nfewer retirees receiving benefits. In effect, that is what happens \ntoday in America under Social Security. That is what is happening today \nin railroad retirement under tier 1, which is essentially Social \nSecurity. Because it is a mature industry and because there are fewer \nemployees--railroaders in the industry, compared with the number of \nretirees proportionate to the average industry in America--there are \ntransfers in effect to railroad retirees under tier 1 as is the case \nfor all industries and for all workers in America today. There is no \ndifference. There is no difference.\n  So it sounds as if Social Security is helping out unfairly, enriching \nrailroad retirees under tier 1. It just is not because the Social \nSecurity tier 1 employees are treated the same way as are employees in \na mature industry receiving benefits.\n  The second point is it has been suggested here that it is not fair to \nlower the retirement age to 60 from 62. After all, the retirement age \nunder Social Security is higher. It has been suggested that it is not \nfair to vest earlier, 5 years instead of 10 years; that it is not fair \nthat survivor's benefits for a survivor would be 100 percent instead \nof, say, 45 percent. And the point is made under Social Security \nretirees' survivors get benefits at a later age. So isn't this some \nspecial deal that railroad retirees are getting? It is not fair.\n  On the face of it that is a question. But, as they say, that is only \nhalf of the story. In the rest of the story, the facts are that tier 2 \nin railroad retirement is very comparable to a private pension plan \nthat a company may have for its employees. The company's employees--\nretirees, say--would receive benefits under Social Security, tier 1 in \nthe railroad system, and they receive benefits under their pension \nplan, tier 2 in the railroad industry. Many pension plans provide for \nan earlier retirement age--not 65 or up to 67, as required in Social \nSecurity, but at an earlier age.\n  Those people pay Social Security. Those are Social Security retirees. \nHow does all that work out? What is happening here?\n  It is very simple. In the private sector pension plans participate in \nwhat is called a bridge with Social Security; that is, under Social \nSecurity the retirement age is 65, but under the private pension plan \nif you fully vest--say 30 years employment at, say, 60--the private \npension plan makes up the amount that Social Security does not pay. It \nis called a bridge. That is how it works and it makes sense. If Social \nSecurity does not provide those benefits for early retirement age, then \nthe private pension plan provides the benefits. That is what is \nhappening in this legislation. It is just the same.\n\n  That is, tier 2 would provide the extra benefits under a bridge to \ntier 1, in effect. Actually, they don't provide it in tier 1. It is \njust that the extra benefits go to the retiree to make up the \ndifference.\n  I submit, railroading is pretty hazardous. It is a dangerous \nindustry. And a 62 retirement age--excuse me, a 60 retirement age after \n30 years of hard work as a railroader certainly seems fair to me. There \nare other industries not as dangerous or demanding, but this one \ncertainly is. It is a dangerous industry.\n  It has been suggested that ERISA provisions ought to apply. Railroad \npensions should be fully funded, and this is not fully funded--as is \nthe case under ERISA, which is what applies to most private pension \nplans.\n  First of all, Social Security is not fully funded. Maybe it should \nbe. We would like to work in that direction, but it is not today. But \nmore important, to fully fund the railroad retirement plan would \nrequire the injection of $40 billion. Then it could be fully funded. We \ndo not have $40 billion. I think the total revenue of the railroad \nsystem in America is about $40 billion per year, and I think the income \nper year is close to $4 billion in the railroad industry.\n\n[[Page S12361]]\n\n  Still more to the point, this trust fund, tier 2, would have about \n$40 billion today, an extra $40 billion, if Congress in the past had \nlived up to its word. It would have it. What am I saying?\n  Many years ago, Congress--I think it was in 1950--passed something \ncalled dual benefits. The effect of it is that railroad retirees got \ndual benefits. They got twice the benefits.\n  Clearly, that got to be a lot of money for the trust fund. If they \nget double benefits for Social Security compared with other retirement \nsystems, that adds up pretty quickly. Congress decided to change that, \nin 1974--to end that. Congress said we are going to end this dual \nbenefits idea. It is just too expensive. It is just too much.\n  But we, Congress, will grandfather in prior retirees so they do not \nget less than they thought they were going to get. So as a practical \nmatter, that would have been--those benefits paid prior to 1974 would \nhave been about $3.5 billion. If the railroad retirement system had \nthat $3.5 billion--they did not get it, Congress did not give it to \nthem--today that would be worth about $30 billion, $40 billion.\n  If Congress had lived up to its word in the past, we could come close \nto having enough dollars in the fund to make it fully funded and ERISA \napplicable. But ERISA cannot be applicable today because it is $40 \nbillion short because Congress didn't live up to its word. \nNevertheless, I think the provisions in this bill requiring all these \nreports assure us of notice, adequately in advance, whether or not \nthere is going to be a problem during the next 20 years. It could be \njust the opposite. It could be a lot better than we expect. But if it \nis worse than we expect, there will be more than enough benefits for \nCongress to be able to change it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the ``Railroad Retirement and Survivors \nImprovement Act of 2001 Progress of the Railroad Retirement and Social \nSecurity Equivalent Benefit Accounts under Employment Assumption II.''\n  It basically says let's transfer $1.586 billion in from Social \nSecurity, or the tier 1 fund, into the tier 2 fund. Social Security is \nsubsidizing tier 2 benefits.\n  I also state to my colleagues, a real solution would be if tier 1 is \nsupposed to be equivalent to Social Security, and people want that--and \nthen as Senator Baucus says, tier 2, if they want to subsidize Social \nSecurity for a lower retirement, they can do that--let's just put them \nunder Social Security so we do not intermingle these funds. There is a \nlittle raiding going on. Under this bill, there is about $2 billion, \nthen, $80-some million almost every year, and then it increases to \nalmost $100 million every year that is transferred from tier 1 to tier \n2.\n  I do not like it. We are raiding the Social Security fund.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this table printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                                                 TABLE 3-II.--RAILROAD RETIREMENT AND SURVIVORS' IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2001\n

Railroad Retirement Board actuaries, 12/3/01.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we can solve that by putting all railroad \nemployees, like we put all new Federal employees, under Social \nSecurity. We did it. We put Members of Congress under Social Security. \nTo me, it would help this problem so we would get away from this little \nfinancial wiggling that has been going on with this fund for a long \ntime.\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a table \nthat I have that shows the benefits for employees and the benefits for \nrailroad companies, or management, on a year-to-year basis. I alluded \nto this in my statement, but I wanted to have the facts with these \ncharts substantiating my oral comments.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord,  as follows:\n\n                                                                      RAILROAD RETIREMENT: H.R. 1140 AS PASSED BY THE HOUSE\n                                                                                    [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       2002         2003         2004         2005         2006         2007         2008         2009         2010         2011        Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReduction in Retirement Age......................          37          121          192          228          259          305          359          397          420          443        2,761\nExpansion of Widow/er Benefits...................          83           92           94           95           97          100          102          104          106          108          981\nRepeal of RRR Benefit Ceiling....................          11           14           15           16           18           19           20           22           24           26          185\nReduction in Vesting Requirements................           *            *            *            *            *            1            1            1            1            2            6\n                                                  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      New Benefits for Labor.....................         131          227          301          339          374          425          482          524          551          579        3,933\nAdjustment in Tier II Tax Rate...................

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 4 \nminutes for debate prior to the vote in relation to the Gramm amendment \nNo. 2196; that regardless of the outcome of the vote, there be 4 \nminutes of debate prior to the vote in relation to the Nickles \namendment No. 2175 with the time equally divided and controlled in the \nusual form, and that no second-degree amendments be in order to either \namendment nor the language that may be stricken.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wonder if \nSenator Nickles will also agree that we have 1 minute on each rather \nthan 4 minutes. The Senator wants 4?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendments the Senate gave consent to earlier be reversed so the first \nvote will be on the Nickles amendment No. 2175 and the second vote will \nbe on the Gramm amendment No. 2196.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment is to help protect the \nsolvency of the trust fund. As the chart shows, the trust fund falls \nunder the middle scenario. The trust fund falls from about 6 years' of \npayments. There is enough money in the trust fund to pay 6 years' worth \nof benefits. Under that scenario, if we pass this bill, which we are \ngoing to do, it goes down to about 1.3. I keep hearing 1.6. I believe \nit is 1.3--barely enough to pay 1 years' benefit. That is because we \nuse a 10-year average looking back. The fund has to fall so far before \nthe tax increase is triggered.\n  Under this amendment, we strike the 10 years and say let us make it \n5. As the fund balance starts to fall under the railroad retirement \nassumption, it falls all the way down to $8 billion. We pay $8 billion \nin benefits right now.\n  I am saying, let us not let it go quite that low. Let us look back \nover 5 because if it starts falling, that fund gets below the 4 years' \npayments--enough to pay for 4 years' worth of benefits--if it gets \nbelow that, let us have the tax increase triggered then. Not 10 years, \nit will be 5 years out.\n  That will keep the fund solvent for railroad retirees. It will \ndecrease the pressure on the railroad companies later on. It also gives \nsome protection to taxpayers. It will decrease the likelihood that \nthere will be a bailout or a necessity for a bailout to be falling on \ngeneral revenues or general taxpayers in the year--whether it is 2015, \n2017, or 2021, I do not know. Let us not let the fund go all the way \ndown to almost 1 year's payment before we trigger a tax increase. Let \nus do it a little bit earlier. Let us use the 5-year average instead of \nthe 10-year average.\n  I used to do this work. Anybody who talks to their actuary will say \nthat makes a lot of sense. Waiting for a 10-year average would be \nabsurd.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this amendment is, first, totally \nunnecessary. The actuaries project that the balance of the fund without \nthis bill over 75 years will be at least one and one-thirds above the \nbenefits paid. That is the lowest level; that is, about the year 2002, \nwhich is significantly more than the short-term actuarial balance \nnecessary for Social Security. One and two-thirds; one for Social \nSecurity.\n  This amendment is totally unnecessary. It is, second, a killer \namendment. If this amendment is agreed to, we will go to conference. \nThere are not many days left in the session. There will be no railroad \nretirement bill passed this year and probably not in this Congress. It \nis unnecessary and I particularly urge Members to oppose it.\n  The underlying bill requires many audit reports, financial and \nactuarial reports on a yearly basis on the strength, viability, and the \nhealth of this trust fund. We will have plenty of time and many years \nin advance to see whether or not some of the dire predictions made in \nthis Chamber are accurate.\n  We have a hard time knowing 10-year budgets in the budget process \naround here. We are talking about 20 years down the road. A, it is not \nnecessary; B, a lot of reports, if the dire predictions do come true; \nand, C, it is a killer amendment.\n  I urge colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.

Mr. President, this is an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm. I strongly urge Members to not vote for \nit. It is unnecessary. There are actuarial reports required in this \nbill to the Congress, and financials are required annually. We will \nknow well in advance of any potential problem that may occur in 20 \nyears. This is a killer amendment. If it passes, we have to go to \nconference. That means no bill this year. I urge Members not to support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple. The amendment \nbefore us says you can invest the railroad retirement trust fund, you \ncan invest it in stocks and bonds, but you cannot spend out of it until \nyou have earned something on the investment.\n  Under the bill before us, you lower the amount of money going into \nthe fund and you raise benefits before one penny is earned, before one \ninvestment is made, and in fact you take money out so quickly that you \ndeplete 75 percent of the trust fund before the tax on railroads has to \nrise from 13.1 percent to over 22 percent in order to maintain absolute \nminimum solvency.\n  The amendment before us simply says invest the money, earn income on \nthe money, use the income to lower taxes to fund railroad retirement \nand to increase benefits, but don't spend the trust fund's money, spend \nthe earnings on the money. It is an eminently reasonable amendment. It \nis in no way a gutting amendment. If we could have gone to committee \nwith a bill, I believe this would have been the solution. I understand \nmy colleagues are for the bill,\n\n[[Page S12363]]\n\nbut I think this is a prudent way of doing it. Make the investments, do \nit exactly as the bill would do it, but don't spend the principal, \nspend the earnings. Don't do the things the bill calls for until you \nhave the money in hand.\n  I think that is a simple principle. The people understand it. I would \nappreciate if they would vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to bring attention to one \nparticular segment of the railroad industry--commuter rail. As a \nSenator from Illinois, I have had the opportunity to become very \nacquainted with the excellent commuter rail system that serves Chicago \nand northeastern Illinois. This system--Metra--is the second largest \ncommuter rail system in the country and is a key part of the overall, \ngrowing, commuter rail industry. Metra employs between 2,500 and 3,000 \nworkers, nearly all of whom are covered under the Railroad Retirement \nBoard benefit plan.\n  The extent of commuter rail's growth over recent decades is made \nclear by looking at the number of workers that it employs. Nationally, \nroughly one-quarter of all rail employees work for commuter and \npassenger rail, and it is expected that this number will grow \nsubstantially in the future.\n  For these reasons, I believe commuter rail, because of its growing \nsize, importance, and impact, should be represented on the Railroad \nRetirement Board of Trustees that is created by this bill. As this bill \nmoves forward in the legislative process, I hope that I will be able to \nwork with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Finance \nCommittee and other conferees to ensure that commuter rail is \nrepresented on the Board of Trustees.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001. Finally, Congress is \ngoing to consider this important bill. I have been working to improve \nthe benefits for our retired railroad workers for many years. Today, we \ncan finally say that promises made are promises kept to our rail \nworkers and their families.\n  The people who have made their contribution to family and to society \nby working on our Nation's railroads deserve a decent retirement. I \nknow the job that railroad employees perform is very hard, very \nimportant work. Our country has an obligation to help those who have \nworked hard, saved, and played by the rules. That is why I am proud to \nhave been a sponsor of Railroad Retirement Improvement legislation for \nmany years and am proud to be a supporter of this bill.\n  I have been fighting to improve the benefits for railroad workers and \ntheir families since I was first elected to Congress. The retirement \nage for railroad workers and their spouses to qualify for railroad \nretirement benefits should be lowered. It is difficult for people and \nfamilies to plan for their retirement in today's world, even with two \nsalaries. That is why strengthening retirement benefits for all \nAmericans has always been one of my highest priorities.\n  This bill is bipartisan. The House passed their version of this \nimportant bill by an overwhelming vote of 384-33. Seventy-four of my \ncolleagues are cosponsors of the Senate version of the Railroad \nRetirement and Survivors' Improvement Act of 2001. The support for this \nmeasure is clear, and the time to act is now.\n  The Railroad Retirement and Survivor's Improvement Act expands \nbenefits for the widows of rail employees and lowers the minimum \nretirement age at which employees with 30 years of experience are \neligible for full retirement benefits to 60 years old. This legislation \nalso reduces the number of years required to be fully vested for tier \nII benefits and expands the system's investment authority by creating \nan independent, non-governmental Railroad Retirement Trust Fund.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in standing up for our railroad \nretirees and their families and support this very important bill.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment was \nagreed to.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12363-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL DAY OF RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

ELISABETH THURMOND OF NORTH AUGUSTA, SC\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of Mrs. \nElisabeth T. Thurmond, my sister-in-law and a valued member of the \ncommunity of North Augusta, SC, who passed away Friday, November 16, \n2001, at the age of 90.\n  Elisabeth Thurmond, who was married to my late brother Dr. J. William \nThurmond, will be remembered as a caring and generous woman. She was \nknown for volunteering much of her time to serve the people of North \nAugusta and she made significant contributions to her community in a \nhost\n\n[[Page S12364]]\n\nof areas. For example, she was a charter member of Fairview \nPresbyterian Church and served in a variety of roles within the church, \nincluding as a trustee and a Sunday school teacher. Furthermore, Mrs. \nThurmond worked to help improve the educational system of North \nAugusta. She was very active in school PTAs and served as the \nchairwoman of the North Augusta Parent Teacher Association Council that \nhelped to establish the Paul Knox Educational Endowment Fund. In \naddition, she was a member of countless boards and councils and often \nheld important leadership positions such as a seat on the Board of \nDirectors of the North Augusta Chamber of Commerce. Clearly Elisabeth \nThurmond lived a life full of civic accomplishment, and she was honored \nfor her service as the 1981 North Augusta Citizen of the Year.\n  However, the impact of Mrs. Thurmond's good deeds were seen not only \nby the people of North Augusta but also across State lines. She was \nvery active with the local chapter of the Girl Scouts of America for \nmany years and, after serving as member of the Regional Board of \nDirectors for the Girl Scouts of America, she was named a member of the \nnational board of directors of the organization.\n  In conclusion, Mrs. Elisabeth Thurmond was a woman of character and \nintegrity. She lived a life of great accomplishment and made wonderful \ncontributions to the city and people of North Augusta. Our State is a \nbetter place because of all her hard work, and the impact she made in \nthe lives of others will be felt long after her passing. She was a true \nAmerican and a fine South Carolinian, and she will certainly be missed \nby a wide circle of friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12364-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred August 24, \n2000 in Somerset, KY. Two women, while working as caretakers at a \nhospital, beat and abused a mentally retarded patient. The assailants, \nValerie Hoskins and Crystal Wright, were indicted on criminal charges \nin connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12364-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12364-S12365]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        CONGRATULATING IDAHO'S NATIONAL BOARD CERTIFIED TEACHERS\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a very special \ngroup of educators in my home State of Idaho.\n  Last month, sixty-six teachers received a National Board \nCertification from the National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards, the highest professional credential in the field of \nteaching. With the addition of these individuals, there are now 272 \nNational Board Certified Teachers in Idaho.\n  High-quality teachers are the most important assets to any \neducational system. In order to gain a National Board Certification, \nthese teachers voluntarily, often at great personal expense and \nsacrifice, submit to a nearly yearlong performance-based assessment. \nThey must demonstrate their mastery in several areas including: \nKnowledge of subject matter; ability to effectively teach their \nsubjects to students; and ability to manage and measure student \nlearning. In fact, the State of Idaho recognizes teachers who gain a \nNational Board Certification as ``master teachers.'' I commend these \neducators for the dedication and sacrifice it takes to successfully \ncomplete this program. Not only do they benefit in their teaching \ntechniques, but Idaho's school children benefit through their \ndedication.\n  Each one of these teachers has touched countless lives of students. \nThey have been diligent in the trust that has been given to them by \nparents throughout Idaho.

BERNARD MARCUS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to offer my thanks \nand appreciation to Mr. Bernard Marcus for his generous donation of \n$200 million for the construction of a five-million-gallon aquarium in \nthe city of Atlanta, GA. This gift, made by the Marcus Foundation, is \none of the largest single grants ever made by a private foundation and \nwill provide the people of Georgia and those who visit our great State \nthe opportunity to experience the wonders of aquatic and riparian \nwildlife. In addition to this most recent gesture of generosity, Mr. \nMarcus has contributed to causes ranging from the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, vascular diseases, developmentally disabled \nchildren, and Jewish charities. Those who have benefitted from his \nbenevolence know him to be a man dedicated to his community and \nfriends. I thank him for his friendship and generosity and look forward \nto this exciting new addition to the City of Atlanta and the State of \nGeorgia. At this time, I would like to ask that the text of two Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution articles be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Nov. 20, 2001]\n\n   Aquarium ``Will Be a Great Marvel'' Home Depot Chief Pledges $200 \n                                Million\n\n                          (By Shelia M. Poole)\n\n       Home Depot Chairman Bernard Marcus promised that the huge \n     Georgia Aquarium announced Monday would have ``no \n     boundaries'' in offering top-notch entertainment and research \n     opportunities for residents and visitors.\n       ``It will be a great marvel,'' said Marcus, whose private \n     Marcus Foundation will spend up to $200 million to build and \n     endow the aquarium, which will be owned by the state.\n       The nonprofit aquarium--at 5 million gallons and 250,000 \n     square feet--would be among the largest and most elaborate in \n     the nation. It will contain freshwater and saltwater fish and \n     mammals.\n       Marcus, the 72-year-old cofounder of Home Depot, said the \n     aquarium is a way for him and his wife, Billi, to give back \n     to the community in a way that is ``meaningful and will last \n     past our lifetimes.''\n       The aquarium, to open in 2005, will be built on 15.5 acres \n     adjacent to Atlantic Station, a planned $2 billion minicity \n     under construction west of the Downtown Connector. When \n     completed, the development will include apartments, \n     condominiums, offices, shops and a 20-screen movie theater.\n       The site for the aquarium is just north of Atlantic \n     Station, east of Mecaslin Street and south of Deering Road, \n     near the former National Lead Industries site.\n       The developer of Atlantic Station, Jim Jacoby, who owns \n     Marineland in Florida, is assisting in acquiring the \n     property.\n       On Monday, representatives of state and local government, \n     business, academia and the tourism and convention industry \n     attended the announcement in the Georgia Capitol's Senate \n     chamber.\n       Atlanta Mayor-elect Shirley Franklin called it ``a \n     wonderful gift for the city.''\n       She said the aquarium would not only provide entertainment \n     and education opportunities for residents, but also create a \n     draw for tourists and conventioneers. City boosters have long \n     decried the lack of attractions in downtown Atlanta.\n       Marcus' announcement effectively supersedes other efforts \n     to build aquariums in Atlanta. At least two proposals had \n     been floated to build aquariums at Stone Mountain Park and \n     near Turner Field.\n       ``We're not in business to compete,'' but to work toward \n     getting quality recreation facilities in the area, said \n     Thomas Dortch, chairman of the Atlanta-Fulton County \n     Recreation Authority, which had tried for years to find \n     financing and a downtown site for an aquarium. ``With the \n     commitment from Mr. Marcus and the governor, we're excited \n     about the fact there will be a world-class aquarium.''\n       The aquarium is still very much a work in progress, say \n     those associated with it. There are no renderings, site plans \n     or economic impact figures, although attendance is projected \n     to be between 1.5 million and 2.5 million annually.\n       Don Harrison, a Home Depot spokesman, said Marcus planned \n     to visit aquariums across the United States and elsewhere, \n     including China. The design will be finalized over the next \n     18 months.\n       ``Now is when all the work begins,'' said Harrison. The \n     aquarium will be global in scope, drawing researchers and \n     visitors from around the world, he said. ``The world is, \n     frankly, our target.''\n       Former Atlantan Jeffrey Swanagan, executive director and \n     chief executive officer of the Florida Aquarium in Tampa, has \n     been tapped to run the project. Swanagan spent 10 years as \n     deputy director of Zoo Atlanta and was a protege of director \n     Terry Maple.\n       Marcus first approached Gov. Roy Barnes about the project a \n     year ago. The governor suggested Atlantic Station as a \n     possible site. ``Location was key,'' Marcus said. ``In our \n     minds it will become a destination to visitors.''\n       Already the city has museums, art galleries and theater. \n     What it doesn't have, Marcus said, is an aquarium.\n       Dan Graveline--executive director of the Georgia World \n     Congress Center--said, ``It will be a wonderful asset for the \n     city. One of [the city's] biggest shortcomings is that \n     convention[-goers] lack things to do in downtown Atlanta.''\n       The aquarium represents the largest donation to date from \n     the Marcus Foundation and is a departure from previous \n     endeavors, noted Harrison, the spokesman for Home Depot.\n       With the private funding, the Georgia aquarium will open \n     with no debt. Other aquariums, typically funded by municipal \n     bonds and saddled with enormous debt, have struggled to \n     prosper. Many have had difficulty funding new exhibits \n     critical to attracting repeat customers.\n       A notable exception is the Monterey Bay Aquarium in \n     California. The aquarium, which opened in October 1984, was \n     privately financed with a $55 million gift from David and \n     Lucile Packard of the Hewlett-Packard fortune.\n       There were ``no bonds and no debt,'' said Ken Peterson, a \n     spokesman for the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which attracts 1.8 \n     million visitors annually and was expanded in 1996. ``When \n     you're paying a mortgage plus your operating expenses, it \n     doesn't leave a lot of extra revenue for developing special \n     exhibitions or new exhibit galleries.''\n       Bob Masterson, president of Orlando-based Ripley \n     Entertainment Inc., which operates aquariums in Myrtle Beach, \n     S.C., and Gatlinburg, Tenn., said the size of the Atlanta \n     Facility will make it expensive to operate.\n       ``We spend about $30,000 a day to run the 1.3 million-\n     gallon aquarium in Myrtle Beach and a little more than that \n     in Gatlinburg,'' he said. ``With a 5 million-gallon tank, I'd \n     guess it would cost at least $50,000 a day to operate. And if \n     it fails, there is nothing else you can do with that \n     building.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Nov. 20, 2001]\n\n An Aquarium for Atlanta: Giant facility Will Increase Knowledge About \n                                 Oceans\n\n                         (By Charles Seabrook)\n\n       Call it the Atlanta Ocean.\n       A world-class aquarium in Atlanta will mean not only a \n     place where people can marvel over ocean wonders, but also a \n     place\n\n[[Page S12366]]\n\n     where scientists and students can unravel mysteries of the \n     sea.\n       Understanding the oceans' workings is vital, scientists \n     say, because the declining health of the world's seas has \n     become a pressing public problem.\n       Dozens of ocean fish species are in peril because of \n     overfishing, and marine biologists estimate that more than 25 \n     percent of the coral reefs in the world's tropical oceans are \n     sick or dying.\n       ``If this aquarium is built the way it's envisioned, it \n     will be wonderful not only for economic development but also \n     for basic science,'' said Mark Hay, professor of \n     environmental biology at Georgia Tech. ``It will be of \n     immense importance for researchers.''\n       The Georgia Aquarium that Bernard Marcus, chairman of Home \n     Depot, says he wants to build--spending up to $200 million--\n     will hold more than 5 million gallons of water and encompass \n     250,000 square feet.\n       ``People who may never travel to the coast will be able to \n     come to Atlanta to learn the lessons of the sea,'' Hay said.\n       For scientists, the size and scope of the aquarium, \n     scheduled for completion in 2005, means they may be able to \n     conduct studies that cannot be done very well in \n     laboratories.\n       ``We can buy little tanks and put little creatures in them \n     and observe them in our labs,'' Hay said.\n       But a large aquarium, he says, could accommodate complete \n     ecosystems--such as a living coral reef--replete with large \n     numbers of different creatures and plants and minerals.\n       Scientists say the ocean will never be fully understood \n     until they understand how its ecosystems function.\n       The Georgia Aquarium will follow the lead of other major \n     aquariums around the world. Scientific research is a basic \n     mission at most of those institutions.\n       ``We realize that health oceans are essential to our \n     survival on Earth,'' says Ken Peterson of the Monterey Bay \n     Aquarium in California.\n       ``As an aquarium, we see our role as raising public \n     awareness of the oceans and conducting research to help \n     resolve the problems the oceans face.''\n       He notes that half the Earth's oxygen comes from the sea, \n     and the only protein for more than a billion people is \n     provided by the ocean.\n       ``We believe it is important that people know that and know \n     how important the oceans are for their survival,'' he says.\n       Jeffrey Swanagan, who has been tapped as the executive \n     director of the aquarium, says a theme has not been chosen. \n     ``But it will have a world focus, so that we can tell any \n     freshwater or saltwater story,'' he says.\n       Swanagan, a Georgia Tech graduate who spent 10 years at Zoo \n     Atlanta, said the ``value of research and conservation is \n     very strong in me.''\n       Swanagan said he hopes the Georgia Aquarium will make \n     people in Atlanta as familiar with the sea as they are with \n     the Chattahoochee River.\n       ``In Tampa, where I live now, kids take the sea for granted \n     because it's all around them,'' he said. ``They think nothing \n     of driving over a causeway and seeing dolphins jumping out \n     the water. We want the people in Atlanta to have similar \n     experiences, albeit it will be an indoor one.''\n       Swanagan, executive director of the Florida Aquarium, said \n     he and his staff will be looking closely at aquariums all \n     over the world to study their exhibits, planning and their \n     public appeal.\n       Universities and other academic institutions in Georgia \n     also are being asked for help in establishing a marine \n     research program.\n       ``We want an aquarium like no other,'' he says.\n       That means, he adds, that the aquarium might attempt to \n     house sea creatures that have been heretofore difficult for \n     other aquariums to maintain.\n       Some of those creatures, say marine biologists, include \n     fish, squids and other animals that live deep in the ocean \n     under tremendous pressures--and which have never been seen \n     alive on land.\n       For Hay and other scientists, the aquarium will be the \n     chance of a lifetime.\n       Hay helped build the renowned living coral reef aquarium at \n     the Smithsonian Institution 20 years ago.\n       Many scientists said that facility could not be done \n     because of all the requirements needed to keep the reef \n     animals alive and healthy.\n       ``We did have to learn as we went along,'' he said.\n       For instance, one scientist argued that a machine was \n     needed to create wave patterns in the aquarium, but others \n     argued that it was unnecessary.\n       The researchers found, however, that wave action is vital \n     to maintaining a health coral reef system.\n       ``So, designing and building a new aquarium will further \n     our knowledge even more,'' he says.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12366-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTING NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH DIRECTOR: DR.

Hyman for his distinguished leadership \nat the National Institute of Mental Health at NIH for the past 5 years. \nDr. Hyman will soon be turning his immense talents to his new duties as \nthe Provost at Harvard University, and I wish him well in this new \nchapter of his outstanding career.\n  Steven Hyman was remarkably effective in bringing issues to the \nnational agenda that for too long have met with shame and stigma. As a \nrenowned neuroscientist, he used his considerable talent, reputation, \nand communication skills to demonstrate to the entire Nation the \nprogress that is being made in understanding and healing mental \nillnesses. He worked closely with the Surgeon General in his efforts to \nbring this profoundly important message to the attention of the \ncountry.\n  It is because of efforts like these that we are closer than ever \nbefore to providing fair treatment for patients and their families, who \nhave suffered from discrimination because mental illness for so long \nhas been treated unfairly. Under Dr. Hyman's leadership, the NIMH has \ncharted a bold course, initiating new clinical trials that will not \nexclude patients who are coping with difficulties so often associated \nwith mental illness. He has insisted on including members of the public \nin the Institutes' research planning, including the groups reviewing \ngrant applications. He has increased the Institute's research emphasis \non areas of critical need, such as children and the elderly. He has \nworked skillfully to guarantee that greater effort is made to translate \nresearch into practice.\n  I know that the National Institute of Mental Health will miss Dr. \nHyman's bold and brilliant presence, and so will the nation, as he \ntakes up his eminent new position at Harvard I commend him for his \noutstanding service to this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12366-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO MAYOR BRUCE TOBEY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Bruce Tobey, the outstanding Mayor of \nGloucester, MA, who is retiring at the end of this year. I join the \npeople of Gloucester in expressing my deep appreciation for his \ncommitment and dedication to the City of Gloucester and I thank him for \nhis leadership and his friendship.\n  Mayor Tobey has been a strong and effective leader for Gloucester, \nworking to improve opportunities for all of Gloucester's residents. \nMayor Tobey took a particular interest in the fishing community. \nFishing has been the lifeblood of Gloucester for nearly four hundred \nyears, and Mayor Tobey has worked tirelessly to continue this proud \ntradition.\n  Mayor Tobey's leadership was especially significant in opening the \nGloucester Fish Exchange. The Fish Exchange has been a major success as \na site for fishermen to sell their fish and for buyers to view the \nfish. It is the second Fish Exchange to be established in the entire \ncountry. I commend the Mayor for his foresight and perseverance, which \nhas made Gloucester's Fish Exchange such a resounding success.\n  Mayor Tobey has also worked skillfully to rehabilitate the State Fish \nPier in Gloucester. New businesses on the pier, including the Cape Ann \nSeafood Center, a 50,000-square-foot seafood-processing center, are \nthere today because of Mayor Tobey's leadership and dedication. New \nbusinesses on the pier have been essential in improving access to local \nseafood processing, and have also created numerous new jobs on the \nwaterfront.\n  Mayor Tobey has also been a strong supporter of the Gloucester \nFisheries Forum, a day-long symposium dedicated to the discussion of \nmajor fisheries issues. Year in and year out, this Forum has become a \nproductive opportunity for members of the local fishing community to \nspeak to leaders in the field and learn from them about the current \nchallenges and future hopes for the fishing industry.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this \nopportunity to pay tribute to Gerry Doyle, the outstanding Mayor of \nPittsfield, MA, who is retiring at the end of this year. He has been a \nwonderful mayor for the people of Pittsfield, and I know they join me \nin thanking him for his commitment and dedication to public service.\n  Mayor Doyle will long be remembered for his outstanding leadership in \nachieving an historic agreement to clean up the Housatonic River and \nthe General Electric industrial site. He was the driving force behind \nthis impressive agreement which protects the magnificent environmental \nheritage of the Berkshires and the public health of the entire \ncommunity, and has laid a solid basis for future economic development \nin Pittsfield.\n  The settlement is one of the largest of its kind ever achieved in \nMassachusetts, Mayor Doyle won great progress for all the Berkshires by \nstriking this all-important balance between economic development and \nenvironmental cleanup. The day this agreement was reached was the \ndawning of a new era for Pittsfield, and for that we will always be \ngrateful to Mayor Doyle for his outstanding leadership.\n  Mayor Doyle has also done an outstanding job of increasing tourism in \nthe Berkshires and in improving the quality of life for the people of \nPittsfield. He's worked skillfully to improve transportation in the \ncity, which in turn has helped attract new businesses to Pittsfield.\n  All of us in Massachusetts are grateful for Mayor Doyle's \ndistinguished service to the City of Pittsfield and to our State, and \nwe are grateful for his friendship. We know that his commitment to \npublic service will continue in other ways, and he will be deeply \nmissed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12367-2", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12367-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12367-4", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT ON THE EMERGENCY REGARDING PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS \n             DESTRUCTION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 60\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 204(c) of the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), and section 401(c) of the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction that was declared in \nExecutive Order 12938 of November 14, 1994.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the coverage of marriage and family therapist services and \nmental health counselor services under part B of the Medicare Program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2001 with my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas, Mrs. Lincoln. Specifically, the \nSeniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2001 permits mental \nhealth counselors and marriage and family therapists to bill Medicare \nfor their services. This will result in an increased choice of \nproviders for seniors and enhance their ability to access mental health \nservices in their communities.\n  This legislation is especially crucial to rural seniors who are often \nforced to travel long distances to utilize the services of mental \nhealth providers currently recognized by the Medicare program. Rural \ncommunities have difficulty recruiting and retaining providers, \nespecially mental health providers. In many small towns a mental health \ncounselor or a marriage and family therapist is the only mental health \ncare provider in the area. Medicare law, as it exists today, compounds \nthe situation because only psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, \nclinical social workers and clinical nurse specialists are able to bill \nMedicare for their services.\n  It is time the Medicare program recognized the qualifications of \nmental health counselors and marriage and family therapists as well as \nthe critical role they play in the mental health care infrastructure. \nThese providers go through rigorous training, similar to the curriculum \nof masters level social workers, and yet are excluded from the Medicare \nprogram.\n  Particularly troubling to me is the fact that seniors have \ndisproportionally higher rates of depression and suicide than other \npopulations. Additionally, 75 percent of the 518 nationally designated \nMental Health Professional Shortage Areas are located in rural areas \nand one-fifth of all rural counties have no mental health services of \nany kind. Frontier counties have even more drastic numbers as 95 \npercent do not have a psychiatrist, 68 percent do not have a \npsychologist and 78 percent do not have a social worker. It is quite \nobvious we have an enormous task ahead of us to reduce these staggering \nstatistics. Providing mental health counselors and marriage and family \ntherapists the ability to bill Medicare for their services is a key \npart of the solution.\n  Virtually all of my State of Wyoming is a mental health professional \nshortage area and will greatly benefit from this legislation. Wyoming \nhas 169 psychologists, 121 psychiatrists, and 247 social workers for a \ntotal of 537 Medicare eligible mental health providers. Enactment of \nthe Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act of 2001 will double \nthe number of mental health providers available to seniors in my State \nwith the addition of 517 mental health counselors and 55 marriage and \nfamily therapists currently licensed in the State.\n  In crafting this legislation Senator Lincoln and I worked with \nnumerous outside organizations with an interest in this issue. As a \nresult of this collaboration, the ``Seniors Mental Health Access \nImprovement Act of 2001'' is strongly supported by the American \nCounseling Association, the Wyoming Counseling Association, the \nAmerican Mental Health Counselors Association, the Arkansas Mental \nHealth Counselors Association, the American Association for Marriage \nand Family Therapy, the Wyoming and Arkansas Chapters of the \nAssociation for Marriage and Family Therapy, the California Association \nof Marriage and Family Therapists, and the National Rural Health \nAssociation.\n  I believe this legislation is critically important to the health and \nwell-being of our Nation's Seniors and I strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to become a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of endorsement from supporting organizations be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1760\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

There simply aren't enough \n     providers. Given this fact, it makes no sense to continue to \n     exclude licensed professional counselors from Medicare \n     coverage, when similarly-trained providers are covered. In \n     many parts of the state, licensed professional counselors are \n     the only mental health specialists around.\n       We believe that establishing Medicare coverage of licensed \n     professional counselors is a cost-effective means of \n     improving the health and well-being of enrollees. The more \n     than 500 professional counselors licensed in Wyoming should \n     be allowed to help meet their mental health needs. It should \n     jolt Congress into action to know that older Americans are \n     the demographic group in the U.S. most at risk of committing \n     suicide. This must be remedied.\n       Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist \n     you on mental health issues, and thank you again for your \n     leadership, initiative, and hard work.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karen Robertson,\n       President.\n     Dr. David L.

As a Licensed \n     Professional Counselor (LPC) and a constituent, I want to \n     express to you the importance of this legislation to LPCs in \n     our state and to the nation's 39 million Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       Mental health counselors-called Licensed Professional \n     Counselor in Arkansas are mental health professionals with a \n     master's or doctoral degree in counseling or related \n     disciplines who provide services along a continuum of care. \n     Currently, 45 states and the District of Columbia license or \n     certify mental health counselors to independently provide \n     mental health services, including the diagnosis and treatment \n     of mental and emotional disorders. LPCs practice in a variety \n     of settings, including hospitals, community mental health \n     centers, managed behavioral health care organizations, \n     employee assistance plans, substance abuse treatment centers, \n     and private practice.\n       Medicare currently covers the services of independently \n     practicing psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, clinical \n     social workers, and clinical nurse specialists, however; it \n     does not recognize mental health counselors or marriage and \n     family therapists as separately reimbursable mental health \n     providers. The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act \n     corrects this oversight by including mental Health counselors \n     and marriage and family therapist among the list of providers \n     who deliver mental health services to Medicare beneficiaries, \n     provided they are legally authorized to perform the services \n     under state law. Enactment of this provision would increase \n     access to and the availability of mental health services to \n     Medicare beneficiaries, particularly for those seniors who \n     reside in rural and underserved area.

Craig Thomas,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: The American Association for Marriage \n     and Family Therapy is writing on behalf of the 46,000 \n     marriage and family therapists throughout the United States \n     to commend you for sponsoring the Seniors Mental Health \n     Access Improvement Act of 2001. This crucial legislation to \n     expand the mental health benefits for our elderly will go a \n     long way towards improving Medicare beneficiaries' access to \n     critical mental health services provided by Marriage and \n     Family Therapist (MFTs) and Mental Health Counselors (MHCs) \n     across the nation.\n\n[[Page S12373]]\n\n       As you know, mental illness is a major problem for many \n     Americans, and particularly for the elderly. Research \n     demonstrates that depression is disproportionately high among \n     older persons, as is the incidence of suicide. The Surgeon \n     General's Report on Mental Health has indicated that there \n     are effective treatments for these and other mental \n     illnesses. The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act \n     of 2001 helps make these treatments accessible to elderly \n     citizens. By expanding the pool of qualified providers, the \n     bill also achieves the important objective of increasing \n     access to mental health services for elderly in rural areas, \n     where there is a recognized shortage of professionals.\n       Passage of the Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act \n     of 2001 will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in need of \n     mental health services will have the same freedom to choose a \n     mental health professional available in their community as \n     the non-Medicare population. The Archives of General \n     Psychiatry projects that the number of people over 65 years \n     with psychiatric disorders will increase from about 4 million \n     in 1970 to 15 million in 2030. It also indicates that the \n     current health care system is unprepared to meet the upcoming \n     crisis in geriatric mental health. Providing access to \n     licensed MFTs and MHCs will help ensure that there are an \n     adequate number of providers available to meet the needs of \n     the growing elderly population.\n       Your leadership and support to address the mental health \n     needs of our seniors is greatly appreciated. It is about time \n     the Medicare program is structured to respond to the demands \n     of the elderly population it serves.

Blanche Lambert Lincoln,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lincoln: The American Association for Marriage \n     and Family Therapy is writing on behalf of the 46,000 \n     marriage and family therapists throughout the United States \n     to commend you for sponsoring the Seniors Mental Health \n     Access Improvement Act of 2001. This crucial legislation to \n     expand the mental health benefits for our elderly will go a \n     long way towards improving Medicare beneficiaries' access to \n     critical mental health services provided by Marriage and \n     Family Therapist (MFTs) and Mental health Counselors (MHCs) \n     across the nation.\n       As you know, mental illness is a major problem for many \n     Americans, and particularly for the elderly. Research \n     demonstrates that depression is disproportionately high among \n     older persons, as is the incidence of suicide. The Surgeon \n     General's Report on Mental Health has indicated that there \n     are effective treatments for these and other mental \n     illnesses. The Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act \n     of 2001 helps make these treatments accessible to elderly \n     citizens. By expanding the pool of qualified providers, the \n     bill also achieves the important objective of increasing \n     access to mental health services for elderly in rural areas, \n     where there is a recognized shortage of professionals.\n       Passage of the Seniors Mental Health Access Improvement Act \n     of 2001 will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries in need of \n     mental health services will have the same freedom to choose a \n     mental health professional available in their community as \n     the non-Medicare population. The Archives of General \n     Psychiatry projects that the number of people over 65 years \n     with psychiatric disorders will increase from about 4 million \n     in 1970 to 15 million in 2030. It also indicates that the \n     current health care system is unprepared to meet the upcoming \n     crisis in geriatric mental health. Providing access to \n     licensed MFTs and MHCs will help ensure that there are an \n     adequate number of providers available to meet the needs of \n     the growing elderly population.\n       Your leadership and support to address the mental health \n     needs of our seniors is greatly appreciated. It is about time \n     the Medicare program is structured to respond to the demands \n     of the elderly population it serves. AAMFT hopes the Seniors \n     Mental Health Improvement Act of 2001 will become law. We \n     look forward to working with you to meet this objective. \n     Thank you again for your commitment to improving the lives of \n     the elderly.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             David M.

As you know, more than 90 \n     percent of Wyoming has been designated by the federal \n     government as a mental health professional shortage area. By \n     authorizing Medicare coverage for both Marriage and Family \n     Therapists (MFTs) and Mental Health Counselors (MHCs), you \n     are more than doubling the number of mental health \n     professionals available to provide services to the Medicare \n     population in these underserved areas.\n       Your legislation will also ensure that Wyoming \n     beneficiaries in need of mental health services will have the \n     same freedom to choose the mental health professional \n     available in their community as the non-Medicare population. \n     As you are aware, our state has already authorized MFTs to \n     provide a wide range of mental health services covered by the \n     Medicare program. Unfortunately, because Medicare does not \n     currently recognize MFTs, Medicare beneficiaries must often \n     travel hundreds of miles to be seen by a mental health \n     professional who is recognized by the Medicare program. This, \n     despite the fact that there may be a Marriage and Family \n     Therapist in their community that the state has already \n     deemed qualified to provide the covered services.\n       Your support for improved access to mental health services \n     is greatly appreciated.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Thomas today in introducing the Seniors Mental Health Access \nImprovement Act of 2001.\n  This bill would expand Medicare coverage to licensed professional \ncounselors and licensed marriage and family therapists. One result of \nthis expanded coverage will be to increase seniors' access to mental \nhealth services, especially in rural and underserved areas.\n  Licensed professional counselors and marriage and family therapists \nare currently excluded from Medicare coverage even though they meet the \nsame education, training, and examination requirements that clinical \nsocial workers do. The only difference is that clinical social workers \nhave been covered under Medicare for over a decade.\n  Why do we need this legislation? The mental health needs of older \nAmericans are not being met. Although the rate of suicide among older \nAmericans is higher than for any other age group, less than three \npercent of older Americans report seeing mental health professionals \nfor treatment. And going to their primary care physician is simply not \nenough. Research shows that most primary care providers receive \ninadequate mental health training, particularly in geriatrics.\n  Lack of access to mental health providers is one of the primary \nreasons why older Americans don't get the mental health treatment they \nneed. Not surprisingly, this problem is exacerbated in rural and \nunderserved areas.\n  Licensed professional counselors are often the only mental health \nspecialists available in rural and underserved communities. This is \ntrue in my home State of Arkansas, where 91 percent of Arkansans reside \nin a mental health professional shortage area.\n  Since there are more licensed professional counselors practicing in \nmy State than any other mental health professional, this legislation \nwill significantly increase the number of Medicare--eligible mental \nhealth providers in Arkansas. Licensed professional counselors are \nalready serving patients who have private insurance or Medicaid. It is \ntime for Medicare patients to also have access to these professionals.\n  The bill we are introducing today is an important first step in \nexpanding access to good mental health. By including licensed \nprofessional counselors and licensed marriage and family therapists \namong the list of providers who deliver mental health services to \nMedicare beneficiaries, we will help ensure that all seniors, no matter \nwhere they live, have the opportunity to receive mental health \ntreatment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Campbell, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1761. A bill to amend title XVII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of cholesterol and blood lipid screening under the \nMedicare Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S12375]]\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare \nCholesterol Screening Coverage Act of 2001, along with my colleagues \nMr. Campbell and Mr. Bingaman. This bipartisan legislation, which also \nhas been introduced in the House of Representatives, would add blood \ncholesterol screening as a covered benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The most recent guidelines from the National Heart, Lung and Blood \nInstitute recommends that all Americans over the age of 20 be screened \nfor high cholesterol. Yet current Medicare policy only covers \ncholesterol testing for patients who already have heart disease, stroke \nor other disorders associated with elevated cholesterol levels. Thus, \nenactment of this bill will help save lives of the approximately one-\nthird of Medicare recipients not already covered for cholesterol \ntesting.\n  High cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke, \nthe Nation's number 1 and number 3 killers of both men and women. \nCardiovascular disease kills nearly a million people each year in this \ncountry, more than the next seven leading causes of death combined. In \nparticular, Americans over the age of 65 have the highest rate of \ncoronary heart disease, CHD, in the Nation and about 80 percent of the \ndeaths from CHD occur in this age group. It is not surprising that \ncardiovascular diseases account for one-third of all Medicare's \nspending for hospitalizations.\n  Obviously, in order to slow the onset of CHD, it is first necessary \nto identify those with elevated cholesterol, which is why passage of \nthis bill is so critical. The importance of identifying those at risk \nfor CHD is illustrated by the results of just released research from \nOxford University. This study showed that in elderly people, lowering \nof cholesterol was associated with a one-third reduction in heart \nattack and stroke and a substantially reduced need for surgery to \nrepair or open clogged arteries.\n  Clearly, this bill can save lives. Yet despite the importance of \nidentifying this major, changeable risk factor for cardiovascular \ndisease, screening for cholesterol is not covered by Medicare. I have \nfelt for a long while that our health care system, and Medicare in \nparticular, needs to place a greater emphasis on preventative health \ncare. Implementation of the measures in this bill can potentially \ndecrease the incidence of cardiovascular disease resulting in reduced \nillness, debilitation and death. Early detection of illness is often an \nimportant factor in successful treatment and has been effective in \nreducing long-term health care costs.\n  Previously, Congress in its wisdom, has acted to provide for other \nscreening tests including bone mass measurement, and screenings for \nglaucoma and for colorectal, prostate and breast cancer. Now we must \ntake another step in the right direction by extending Medicare coverage \nfor cholesterol screening.\n  It is only right that the Congress do what it can to help implement \nthe guidelines of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, and it \nis only right that we provide these benefits for all Medicare \nrecipients. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \npiece of legislation.

A bill to promote rural safety and improve rural law \nenforcement; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in the weeks since September 11, we've \nheard a lot about homeland security. Right now, we're working to make \nour Nation's infrastructure more secure, our food and water supply \nsafer, and to improve our government's ability to respond to chemical \nand biological weapons attacks.\n  To me, homeland security also means giving all of our Nation's law \nenforcement officers the tools and training they need to do their jobs. \nAnd that means recognizing that law enforcement in rural America has \nits own unique set of challenges: rural law enforcement officers patrol \nlarger areas, and operate under tighter budgets with smaller staffs, \nthan most of their urban and suburban counterparts.\n  In States like South Dakota, often, just a handful of people are \nresponsible for patrolling an entire county. Law enforcement officers \nrespond to a lot of calls alone, and often have to communicate with \neach other by cell phone. Backup can be several hours away. Yet we \nexpect the same quality of service, and we demand lower crime rates.\n  I believe Washington can and must do a better job of helping rural \nlaw enforcement do their work. That is why I am proud to join my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Tim Johnson, in introducing the Rural \nSafety Act of 2001.\n  While Tim and I are the ones introducing this bill, we want to thank \nall of the South Dakota sheriffs with whom we've spoken whose ideas and \nexperiences are incorporated within it. For my part, I'd like to \nrecognize: Sheriff Mike Milstead of Minnehaha County, Sheriff Mark \nMilbrandt of Brown County, Sheriff Leidholt of Hughes County, Chief Al \nAden of Pierre, Chief Duane Heeney of Yankton, Chief Ken Schwab of my \nhometown, Aberdeen, Chief Doug Feltman of Mitchell; and Chief Craig \nTieszen of Rapid City.\n  One theme I've heard repeated on visit after visit is this: \nWashington needs to do a better job working with State and local law \nenforcement agencies. To me, that means building on what we know works, \nand developing new initiatives that respond to the special law \nenforcement challenges of small towns and rural communities. To that \nend, this bill does six things: First, it builds on our success with \nthe COPS program. COPS has enabled South Dakota communities to hire \nmore than 300 law enforcement officers. Across the country, it's added \nmore than 100,000 new officers to the ``thin blue line.'' Under this \nproposal, rural communities that hire officers through the COPS program \nwill be eligible for federal funding to keep those offices on for a \nfourth year.\n  Second, because rural law enforcement officers have to cover such \nlarge areas, rural law enforcement agencies arguably have a greater \nneed for advanced communications equipment than many urban and suburban \ndepartments, but have fewer resources to purchase them. Recently, I \nreceived a letter from Sgt. Marty Goetsch in the Lawrence County \nSheriff's Office in Deadwood, SD. He told me that his office, and its \nstaff of 11, are ``very much behind in the available technology.'' This \nbill provides funds to help rural communities obtain things like mobile \ndata computers and dash-mounted\n\n[[Page S12376]]\n\nvideo cameras. It will also provide additional funds for training to \nuse new technologies.\n  Third, this bill will establish a Rural Policing Institute as a way \nto help rural law enforcement officers upgrade their skills and \ntactics.\n  Fourth, it will expand and improve the 9-1-1 emergency assistance \nsystems in rural areas. Many of us take for granted that in an \nemergency, we can call 9-1-1, and help will be there. In rural and \nremote areas, the nearest help may be miles away. We need to make sure \nthat people in rural areas can rely on a modern, integrated system of \ncommunication between law enforcement, and fire and other safety \nofficials. The Rural Safety Act will provide the resources to finish \nthe job and develop a seamless 9-1-1 system all across America.\n  Fifth, the bill will help communities create ``restorative justice'' \nfor first-time, non-violent juvenile offenders. These programs offer \nvictims the opportunity to confront youthful offenders and require that \nthese offenders make meaningful restitution to their victims. In many \ncases, that will meet our societal goals more effectively and more \nefficiently that costly incarceration.\n  Sixth, it will enable us to stop the spread of ``meth'' now, before \nit becomes a crisis. A study released last year by the Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University shows that eighth \ngraders living in rural communities are 104 percent more likely to have \nused amphetamines, including methamphetamine. We need to stop the use \nof all of these drugs, but in rural America, meth is particularly \naddictive, and devastatingly destructive. This proposal will increase \nprevention and treatment of meth use, and cleanup of meth labs that \nhave been discovered and shut down.\n  Seventh and finally, our plan will offer gun owners tax credits to \npurchase gun safes. It will also provide law enforcement agencies with \nresources to buy and install gun safes or gun storage racks for \nofficers' homes. I don't believe Washington should restrict the right \nof law-abiding citizens to own guns. But if gun owners want help in \npreventing accidental gun tragedies, I believe Washington can, and \nshould, help.\n  When we talk about homeland security, I believe we need to think \nabout the law enforcement needs of those who live in America's rural \nareas. That is what this bill does, and that is why I encourage all of \nmy colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN:\n  S. 1764. A bill to provide incentives to increase research by \ncommercial, for-profit entities to develop vaccines, microbicides, \ndiagnostic technologies, and other drugs to prevent and treat illnesses \nassociated with a biological or chemical weapons attack; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, America has a major flaw in its \ndefenses against bioterrorism. Recent hearings I chaired in the \nGovernment Affairs Committee on bioterrorism demonstrated that America \nhas not made a national commitment to research and development of \ntreatments and cures for those who might be exposed to or infected by a \nbiological agent or chemical toxin. Correcting this critical gap is the \npurpose of legislation I am introducing today.\n  Obviously, our first priority must be to attempt to prevent the use \nof these agents and toxins by terrorists, quickly assess when an attack \nhas occurred, take appropriate public health steps to contain the \nexposure, stop the spread of contagion, and then detoxify the site. \nThese are all critical functions, but in the end we must recognize that \nsome individuals may be exposed or infected. Then the critical issue is \nwhether we can treat and cure them and prevent death and disability.\n  We need a diversified portfolio of medicines. In cases where we have \nample advance warning of an attack and specific information about the \nagent or toxin, we may be able to vaccinate the vulnerable population \nin advance. In other cases, even if we have a vaccine, we might well \nprefer to use medicines that would quickly stop the progression of the \ndisease or the toxic effects. We also need a powerful capacity quickly \nto develop new countermeasures where we face a new agent or toxin.\n  Unfortunately, we are woefully short of vaccines and medicines to \ntreat individuals who are exposed or infected. We have antibiotics that \nseem to work for most of those infected in the current anthrax attack, \nbut these have not prevented five deaths. We have no effective vaccines \nor medicines for most other biological agents and chemical toxins we \nmight confront. In some cases we have vaccines to prevent, but no \nmedicines to treat, an agent. We have limited capacity to speed the \ndevelopment of vaccines and medicines to prevent or treat novel agents \nand toxins not currently known to us.\n  We have provided, and should continue to provide, direct Federal \nfunding for research and development of new medicines, however, this \nfunding is unlikely to be sufficient. Even with ample Federal funding, \nmany private companies will be reluctant to enter into agreements with \ngovernment agencies to conduct this research. Other companies would be \nwilling to conduct the research with their own capital and at their own \nrisk but are not able to secure the funding from investors.\n  The legislation I introduce today would provide incentives for \nprivate biotechnology companies to form capital to develop \ncountermeasures, medicines, to prevent, treat and cure victims of \nbioterror attacks. This will enable this industry to become a vital \npart of the national defense infrastructure and do so for business \nreasons that make sense for their investors on the bottom line.\n  Enactment of these incentives is necessary as most biotech companies \nhave no approved products or revenue from product sales to fund \nresearch. They rely on investors and equity capital markets to fund the \nresearch. They must necessarily focus on research that will lead to \nproduct sales and revenue and, thus, to an end to their dependence on \ninvestor capital. There is no established or predictable market for \ncountermeasures. Investors are justifiably reluctant to fund this \nresearch, which will present challenges similar in complexity to AIDS. \nInvestors need assurances that research on countermeasures has the \npotential to provide a rate of return commensurate with the risk, \ncomplexity and cost of the research, a rate of return comparable to \nthat which may arise from a treatment for cancer, MS, Cystic Fibrosis \nand other major diseases.\n  It is in our national interest to enlist these companies in the \ndevelopment of countermeasures as biotech companies tend to be \ninnovative and nimble and intently focused on the intractable diseases \nfor which no effective medical treatments are available.\n  The incentives I have proposed are innovative and some may be \ncontroversial. I invite everyone who has an interest and a stake in \nthis research to enter into a dialogue about the issue and about the \nnature and terms of the appropriate incentives. I have attempted to \nanticipate the many complicated technical and policy issues that this \nlegislation raises. The key focus of our debate should be how, not \nwhether, we address this critical gap in our public health \ninfrastructure and the role that the private sector should play. \nMillions of Americans will be at risk if we fail to enact legislation \nto meet this need.\n  My proposal is complimentary to legislation on bioterrorism \npreparedness sponsored by Senators Frist and Kennedy. Their bill, the \nBioweapons Preparedness Act of 2001, S. 1715, focuses on many needed \nimprovements in our public health infrastructure. It builds on their \nproposal in the 106th Congress, S. 2731, and H.R. 4961, sponsored by \nCongressman Richard Burr.\n  Among the provisions in these bills are initiatives on improving \nbioterrorism preparedness capacities, improving communication about \nbioterrorism, protection of children, protection of food safety, and \nglobal pathogen surveillance and response. The Senate Appropriations \nCommittee reported legislation to appropriate the funds for the \npurposes authorized in the Frist-Kennedy proposal and that was \nincorporated in the stimulus package pending in the Senate before the \nThanksgiving recess.\n  Title IV of their bill includes provisions to expand research on \nbiological agents and toxins, as well as new treatments and vaccines \nfor such agents and\n\n[[Page S12377]]\n\ntoxins. Since the effectiveness of vaccines, drugs, and therapeutics \nfor many biological agents and toxins often may not ethically be tested \nin humans, the bill ensures that the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, \nwill finalize by a date certain its rule regarding the approval of new \ncountermeasures on the basis of animal data. Priority countermeasures \nwill also be given enhanced consideration for expedited review by the \nFDA. They rely on the authority, through an existing Executive Order, \nto ensure indemnification of sponsors who supply vaccines to the \nGovernment. And the bill provides a limited antitrust exemption to \nallow potential sponsors to discuss and agree upon how to develop, \nmanufacture, and produce new countermeasures, including vaccines, and \ndrugs. Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice approval \nof such agreements is required to ensure such agreements are not anti-\ncompetitive.\n\n  My legislation builds on these provisions by providing incentives to \nenable the biotechnology industry acting on its own initiative to fund \nand conduct research on countermeasures. It includes tax, procurement, \nintellectual property and liability incentives. Accordingly, my \nproposal raises issues falling within the jurisdiction of the HELP, \nFinance, and Judiciary Committees.\n  The Frist-Kennedy bill and my bill are complimentary. We do need to \nconform the two bills to one another on some issues: the bills have \ndifferent definitions of the term ``countermeasure,'' my bill gives the \nDirector of Homeland Defense authority over the countermeasure list \nwhereas the Secretary of Health and Human Services would have authority \nunder Frist/Kennedy, and my bill establishes a ``purchase fund'' and \nFrist-Kennedy is a ``stockpile.'' The best, most comprehensive approach \nwould be to meld the two bills together.\n  The bottom line is that we need both bills, one focusing on public \nhealth and one focusing on medical research. Without medical research, \npublic health workers will not have the single most important tool to \nuse in an attack, medicine to prevent death and disability and medicine \nthat will help us avoid public panic.\n  We are fortunate that we have broad-spectrum antibiotics including \nCipro to treat the type of anthrax to which so many have been exposed. \nThis treatment seems to be effective before the anthrax symptoms become \nmanifest, and effective to treat cutaneous anthrax, and we have been \nable to effectively treat some individuals who have inhalation anthrax. \nI am thankful that this drug exists to treat those who have been \nexposed, including my own Senate staff. Our offices are immediately \nabove those of Senator Daschle.\n  We have seen how reassuring it is that we have an effective treatment \nfor this biological agent. We see long lines of Congressional staffers \nand postal workers awaiting their Cipro. Think what it would be like if \nwe could only say, ``We have nothing to treat you and hope you don't \ncontract the disease.'' Think of the public panic that we might see.\n  I am grateful that this product exists and proud of the fact that the \nBayer Company is based in Connecticut. The last thing we should be \ndoing is criticizing this company for their research success. The \ncompany has dispensed millions of dollars worth of Cipro free of \ncharge. Criticizing it for the price that it charges tells other \nresearch companies that the more valuable their products are in \nprotecting the public health, the more likely they are to be criticized \nand bullied.\n  It is fortuitous that Cipro seems to be effective against anthrax. \nThe product was not developed with this use in mind. My point with this \nlegislation is we cannot rely on good fortune and chance in the \ndevelopment of countermeasures. We need to make sure that these \ncountermeasures will be developed. We need more companies like Bayer, \nwe need them focused specifically on developing medicines to deal with \nthe new bioterror threat, and we need to tell them that there are good \nbusiness reasons for this focus.\n  We also are fortunate to have an FDA-licensed vaccine, made by \nBioPort Corporation, that is recommended by our country's medical \nexperts at the DOD and CDC for pre-anthrax exposure vaccination of \nindividuals in the military and some individuals in certain laboratory \nand other occupational settings where there is a high risk of exposure \nto anthrax. This vaccine is also recommended for use with Cipro after \nexposure to anthrax to give optimal and long-lasting protection. That \nvaccine is not now available for use. We must do everything necessary \nto make this and other vaccines available in adequate quantities to \nprotect against future attacks. But the point of this legislation is \nthat we need many more Cipro-like and antrax vaccine-like products. \nThat we have these products is the good news; that we have so few \nothers is the problem.\n  One unfortunate truth in this debate is that we cannot rely upon \ninternational legal norms and treaties alone to protect our citizens \nfrom the threat of biological or chemical attack.\n  The United States ratified the Biological and Toxin Weapons \nConvention, BWC, on January 22, 1975. That Convention now counts 144 \nnations as parties. Twenty-two years later, on April 24, 1997, the \nUnited States Senate joined 74 other countries when it ratified the \nChemical Weapons Convention, CWC. While these Conventions serve \nimportant purposes, they do not in any way guarantee our safety in a \nworld with rogue states and terrorist organizations.\n  The effectiveness of both Conventions is constrained by the fact that \nmany countries have failed to sign on to either of them. Furthermore, \ntwo signatories of the BWC, Iran and Iraq, are among the seven \ngovernments that the Secretary of State has designated as state \nsponsors of international terrorism, and we know for a fact that they \nhave both pursued clandestine biological weapons programs. The BWC, \nunlike the CWC, has no teeth, it does not include any provisions for \nverification or enforcement. Since we clearly cannot assume that any \ncountry that signs on to the Convention does so in good faith, the \nConvention's protective value is limited.\n  On November 1 of this year, the President announced his intent to \nstrengthen the BWC as part of his comprehensive strategy for combating \nterrorism. A BWC review conference, held every 5 years to consider ways \nof improving the Convention's effectiveness, will convene in Geneva \nbeginning November 19. In anticipation of that meeting, the President \nhas urged that all parties to the Convention enact strict national \ncriminal legislation to crack down on prohibited biological weapons \nactivities, and he has called for an effective United Nations procedure \nfor investigating suspicious outbreaks of disease or allegations of \nbiological weapons use.\n  These steps are welcomed, but they are small. Even sweeping reforms, \nlike creating a more stringent verification and enforcement regime, \nwould not guarantee our safety. The robust verification and enforcement \nmechanisms in the CWC, for instance, have proven to be imperfect, and \nscientists agree that it is much easier to conceal the production of \nbiological agents than chemical weapons.\n  The inescapable fact, therefore, is that we cannot count on \ninternational regimes to prevent those who wish us ill from acquiring \nbiological and chemical weapons. We must be prepared for the reality \nthat these weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists, and could \nbe used against Americans on American soil. And we must be prepared to \ntreat the victims of such an attack if it were ever to occur.\n  On November 26, the Centers for Disease Control issued its interim \nworking draft plan for responding to an outbreak of smallpox. The plan \ndoes not call for mass vaccination in advance of a smallpox outbreak \nbecause the risk of side effects from the vaccine outweighs the risks \nof someone actually being exposed to the smallpox virus. At the heart \nof the plan is a strategy sometimes called ``search and containment.''\n  This strategy involves identifying infected individual or individuals \nwith confirmed smallpox, identifying and locating those people who come \nin contact with that person, and vaccinating those people in outward \nrings of contact. The goal is to produce a buffer of immune individuals \nand was shown to prevent smallpox and to ultimately eradicate the \noutbreak. Priorities\n\n[[Page S12378]]\n\nwould be set on who is vaccinated, perhaps focusing on the outward \nrings before those at the center of the outbreak. The plan assumes that \nthe smallpox vaccination is effective for persons who have been exposed \nto the disease as long as the disease has not taken hold.\n  In practice it may be necessary to set a wide perimeter for these \nareas because smallpox is highly contagious before it might be \ndiagnosed. There may be many areas subject to search and containment \nbecause people in our society travel frequently and widely. Terrorists \nmight trigger attacks in a wide range of locations to multiply the \nconfusion and panic. The most common form of smallpox has a 30-percent \nmortality rate, but terrorists might be able to obtain supplies of \n``flat-type'' smallpox with a mortality rate of 96 percent and \nhemorrhagic-type smallpox, which is almost always fatal. For these \nreasons, the CDC plan accepts the possibility that whole cities or \nother geographic areas could be cordoned off, letting no one in or out, \na quarantine enforced by police or troops.\n  The plan focuses on enforcement authority through police or National \nGuard, isolation and quarantine, mandatory medical examinations, and \nrationing of medicines. It includes a discussion of ``population-wide \nquarantine measures which restrict activities or limit movement of \nindividuals [including] suspension of large public gatherings, closing \nof public places, restriction on travel [air, rail, water, motor \nvehicle, and pedestrian], and/or `cordon sanitaire' [literally a \n`sanitary cord' or line around a quarantined area guarded to prevent \nspread of disease by restricting passage into or out of the area].'' \nThe CDC recommends that States update their laws to provide authority \nfor ``enforcing quarantine measures'' and it recommends that States in \n``pre-event planning'' identify ``personnel who can enforce these \nisolation and quarantine measures, if necessary.'' Guide C, Isolation \nand Quarantine, page 17.\n  On October 23, 2001, the CDC published a ``Model State Emergency \nHealth Powers Act.'' It was prepared by the Center for Law and the \nPublic's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities, in \nconjunction with the National Governors Association, National \nConference of State Legislatures, Association of State and Territorial \nHealth Officials, National Association of City and County Health \nOfficers, and National Association of Attorneys General. A copy of the \nmodel law is printed at www.publichealthlaw.net. The law would provide \npowers to enforce the ``compulsory physical separation, including the \nrestriction of movement or confinement, of individuals and/or groups \nbelieved to have been exposed to or known to have been infected with a \ncontagious disease from individuals who are believed not to have been \nexposed or infected, in order to prevent or limit the transmission of \nthe disease to others.'' Federal law on this subject is very strong and \nthe Administration can always rely on the President's Constitution \nauthority as Commander in Chief.\n  Let us try to imagine, however, what it would be like if a quarantine \nis imposed. Let us assume that there is not enough smallpox vaccine \navailable for use in a large outbreak, that the priority is to \nvaccinate those in the outward rings of the containment area first, \nthat the available vaccines cannot be quickly deployed inside the \nquarantined area, that it is not possible to quickly trace and identify \nall of the individuals who might have been exposed, and/or that public \nhealth workers themselves might be infected. We know that there is no \nmedicine to treat those who do become infected. We know the mortality \nrates. It is not hard to imagine how much force might be necessary to \nenforce the quarantine. It would be quite unacceptable to permit \nindividuals to leave the quarantined area no matter how much panic had \ntaken hold.\n  Think about how different this scenario would be if we had medicines \nthat could effectively treat and cure those who become infected by \nsmallpox. We still might implement the CDC plan but a major element of \nthe strategy would be to persuade people to visit their local clinic or \nhospital to be dispensed their supply of medicine. We could trust that \nthere would be a very high degree of voluntary compliance. This would \ngive us more time, give us options if the containment is not \nsuccessful, give us options to treat those in the containment area who \nare infected, and enable us to quell the public panic.\n  Because we have no medicine to treat those infected by smallpox, we \nhave to be prepared to implement a plan like the one CDC has proposed. \nTheirs is the only option because our options are so limited. We need \nto expand our range of options.\n  We should not be lulled by the apparent successes with Cipro and the \nstrains of anthrax we have seen in the recent attacks. We have not been \nable to prevent death in some of the patients with late-stage \ninhalation anthrax and Robert Stevens, Thomas Morris Jr., Joseph \nCurseen, Kathy Nguyen, and Ottilie Lundgren have died. This legislation \nis named in honor of them. What we needed for them, and did not have, \nis a drug or vaccine that would treat late stage inhalation anthrax.\n  As I have said, we need an effective treatment for those who become \ninfected with smallpox. We have a vaccine that effectively prevents \nsmallpox infection, and administering this vaccine within four days of \nfirst exposure has been shown to offer some protections against \nacquiring infection and significant protection against a fatal outcome. \nThe problem is that administering the vaccine in this time frame to all \nthose who might have been exposed may be exceedingly difficult. And \nonce infection has occurred, we have no effective treatment options.\n  In the last century 500 million people have died of smallpox, more \nthan have from any other infectious diseases, as compared to 320 \nmillion deaths in all the wars of the twentieth century. Smallpox was \none of the diseases that nearly wiped out the entire Native American \npopulation in this hemisphere. The last naturally acquired case of \nsmallpox occurred in Somalia in 1977 and the last case from laboratory \nexposure was in 1978.\n  Smallpox is a nasty pathogen, carried in microscopic airborne \ndroplets inhaled by its victims. The first signs are headache, fever, \nnausea and backache, sometimes convulsions and delirium. Soon, the skin \nturns scarlet. When the fever lets up, the telltale rash appears, flat \nred spots that turn into pimples, then big yellow pustules, then scabs. \nSmallpox also affects the throat and eyes, and inflames the heart, \nlungs, liver, intestines and other internal organs. Death often came \nfrom internal bleeding, or from the organs simply being overwhelmed by \nthe virus. Survivors were left covered with pockmarks, if they were \nlucky. The unlucky ones were left blind, their eyes permanently clouded \nover. Nearly one in four victims died. The infection rate is estimated \nto be 25-40 percent for those who are unvaccinated and a single case \ncan cause 20 or more additional infections.\n  During the 16th Century, 3.5 million Aztecs, more than half the \npopulation, died of smallpox during a 2-year span after the Spanish \narmy brought the disease to Mexico. Two centuries later, the virus \nravaged George Washington's troops at Valley Forge. And it cut a deadly \npath through the Crow, Dakota, Sioux, Blackfoot, Apache, Comanche and \nother American Indian tribes, helping to clear the way for white \nsettlers to lay claim to the western plains. The epidemics began to \nsubside with one of medicine's most famous discoveries: the finding by \nBritish physician Edward Jenner in 1796 that English milkmaids who were \nexposed to cowpox, a mild second cousin to smallpox that afflicts \ncattle, seemed to be protected against the more deadly disease. \nJenner's work led to the development of the first vaccine in Western \nmedicine. While later vaccines used either a killed or inactivated form \nof the virus they were intended to combat, the smallpox vaccine worked \nin a different way. It relied on a separate, albeit related virus: \nfirst cowpox and the vaccinia, a virus of mysterious origins that is \nbelieved to be a cowpox derivative. The last American was vaccinated \nback in the 1970s and half of the U.S. population has never been \nvaccinated. It is not known how long these vaccines provide protection, \nbut it is estimated that the term is 3-5 years.\n  In an elaborate smallpox biowarfare scenario enacted in February 1999 \nby\n\n[[Page S12379]]\n\nthe Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies, it was \nprojected that within 2 months 15,000 people had died, epidemics were \nout of control in fourteen countries, all supplies of smallpox vaccine \nwere depleted, the global economy was on the verge of collapse, and \nmilitary control and quarantines were in place. Within twelve months it \nwas projected that eighty million people worldwide had died.\n  A single case of smallpox today would become a global public health \nthreat and it has been estimated that a single smallpox bioterror \nattack on a single American city would necessitate the vaccination of \n30-40 million people.\n  The U.S. Government is now in the process of purchasing substantial \nstocks of the smallpox vaccine. We then face a very difficult decision \non deploying the vaccine. We know that some individuals will have an \nadverse reaction to this vaccine. No one in the United States has been \nvaccinated against smallpox in 25 years. Those that were vaccinated \nback then may not be protected against the disease today. If we had an \neffective treatment for those who might become infected by smallpox, we \nwould face much less pressure regarding deploying the vaccine. If we \nface a smallpox epidemic from a bioterrorism attack, we will have no \nCipro to reassure the public and we will be facing a highly contagious \ndisease and epidemic. To be blunt, it will make the current anthrax \nattack look benign by comparison.\n  Smallpox is not the only threat. We have seen other epidemics in this \ncentury. The 1918 influenza epidemic provides a sobering admonition \nabout the need for research to develop medicines. In 2 years, a fifth \nof the world's population was infected. In the United States the 1918 \nepidemic killed more than 650,000 people in a short period of time and \nleft 20 million seriously ill, one-fourth of the entire population. The \naverage lifespan in the U.S. was depressed by ten years. In just 1 \nyear, the epidemic killed 21 million human beings worldwide--well over \ntwice the number of combat deaths in the whole of World War I. The flu \nwas exceptionally virulent to begin with and it then underwent several \nsudden and dramatic mutations in its structure. Such mutations can turn \nflu into a killer because its victims' immune systems have no \nantibodies to fight off the altered virus. Fatal pneumonia can rapidly \ndevelop.\n  Another deadly toxin, ricin toxin, was of interest to the al-Qaeda \nterrorist network. At an al-Qaeda safehouse in Saraq Panza, Kabul \nreporters found instructions for making ricin. The instructions make \nchilling reading. ``A certain amount, equal to a strong dose, will be \nable to kill an adult, and a dose equal to seven seeds will kill a \nchild,'' one page reads. Another page says: ``Gloves and face mask are \nessential for the preparation of ricin. Period of death varies from 3-5 \ndays minimum, 4-14 days maximum.'' The instructions listed the symptoms \nof ricin as vomiting, stomach cramps, extreme thirst, bloody diarrhoea, \nthroat irritation, respiratory collapse and death.\n  No specific treatment or vaccine for ricin toxin exists. Ricin is \nproduced easily and inexpensively, highly toxic, and stable in \naerosolized form. A large amount of ricin is necessary to infect whole \npopulations, the amount of ricin necessary to cover a 100-km \\2\\ area \nand cause 50 percent lethality, assuming aerosol toxicity of 3 mcg/kg \nand optimum dispersal conditions, is approximately 4 metric tons, \nwhereas only 1 kg of Bacillus anthracis is required. But it can be used \nto terrorize a large population with great effect because it is so \nlethal.\n  Use of ricin as a terror weapon is not theoretical. In 1991 in \nMinnesota, 4 members of the Patriots Council, an extremist group that \nheld antigovernment and antitax ideals and advocated the overthrow of \nthe U.S. Government, were arrested for plotting to kill a U.S. marshal \nwith ricin. The ricin was produced in a home laboratory. They planned \nto mix the ricin with the solvent dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO, and then \nsmear it on the door handles of the marshal's vehicle. The plan was \ndiscovered, and the 4 men were convicted. In 1995, a man entered Canada \nfrom Alaska on his way to North Carolina. Canadian custom officials \nstopped the man and found him in possession of several guns, $98,000, \nand a container of white powder, which was identified as ricin. In \n1997, a man shot his stepson in the face. Investigators discovered a \nmakeshift laboratory in his basement and found agents such as ricin and \nnicotine sulfate. And, ricin was used by the Bulgarian secret police \nwhen they killed Georgi Markov by stabbing him with a poison umbrella \nas he crossed Waterloo Bridge in 1978.\n\n  Going beyond smallpox, influenza, and ricin, we do not have an \neffective vaccine or treatment for dozens of other deadly and disabling \nagents and toxins. Here is a partial list of some of the other \nbiological agents and chemical toxins for which we have no effective \ntreatments: clostridium botulinum toxin, botulism; francisella \ntularensis, tularaemia; Ebola hemorrhagic fever, Marbug hemorrhagic \nfever, Lassa fever, Julin, Argentine hemorrhagic fever; Coxiella \nburnetti, Q fever; brucella species, brucellosis; burkholderia mallei, \nglanders; Venezuelan encephalomyelitis, eastern and western equine \nencephalomyelitis, epsilon toxin of clostridium perfringens, \nstaphylococcus entretoxin B, salmonella species, shigella dysenteriae, \nescherichia coli O157:H7, vibrio cholerae, cryptosporidium parvum, \nnipah virus, hantaviruses, tickborne hemorrhagic fever viruses, \ntickborne encephalitis virus, yellow fever, nerve agents, tabun, sarin, \nsoman, GF, and VX; blood agents, hydrogen cyanide and cyanogens \nchloride; blister agents, lewisite, nitrogenadn sulfur mustards, and \nphosgene oxime; heavy metals, arsenic, lead, and mercury; and volatile \ntoxins, benzene, chloroform, trihalomethanes; pulmonary agents, \nPhosgene, chlorine, vinly chloride; and incapacitating agents, BZ.\n  The naturally occurring forms of these agents and toxins are enough \nto cause concern, but we also know that during the 1980s and 1990s the \nSoviet Union conducted bioweapons research at 47 laboratories and \ntesting sites, employed nearly 50,000 scientists in the work, and that \nthey developed genetically modified versions of some of these agents \nand toxins. The goal was to develop an agent or toxin that was \nparticularly virulent or not vulnerable to available antibiotics.\n  The United States has publicly stated that five countries are \ndeveloping biological weapons in violation of the Biological Weapons \nconvention, North Korea, Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya, and stated that \nadditional countries not yet named, possibly including Russia, China, \nIsrael, Sudan and Egypt, are also doing so as well.\n  What is so insidious about biological weapons is that in many cases \nthe symptoms resulting from a biological weapons attack would likely \ntake time to develop, so an act of bioterrorism may go undetected for \ndays or weeks. Affected individuals would seek medical attention not \nfrom special emergency response teams but in a variety of civilian \nsettings at scattered locations. This means we will need medicines that \ncan treat a late stage of the disease, long after the infection has \ntaken hold.\n  We must recognize that the distinctive characteristic of biological \nweapons is that they are living micro-organisms and are thus the only \nweapons that can continue to proliferate without further assistance \nonce released in a suitable environment.\n  The lethality of these agents and toxins, and the panic they can \ncause, is quite frightening. The capacity for terror is nearly beyond \ncomprehension. I do not believe it is necessary to describe the facts \nhere. My point is simple: we need more than military intelligence, \nsurveillance, and public health capacity. We also need effective \nmedicines. We also need more powerful research tools that will enable \nus to quickly develop treatments for agents and toxins not on this or \nany other list.\n  We need to do whatever it takes to be able to reassure the American \npeople that hospitals and doctors have powerful medicines to treat them \nif they are exposed to biological agents or toxins, that we can contain \nan outbreak of an infectious agent, and that there is little to fear. \nTo achieve this objective, we need to rely on the entrepreneurship of \nthe biotechnology industry.\n  There is already some direct funding of research by the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA, the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, and the Centers for Disease Control, CDC. This research \nshould go forward.\n\n[[Page S12380]]\n\n  DARPA, for instance, has been described as the Pentagon's ``venture \ncapital fund,'' its mission to provide seed money for novel research \nprojects that offer the potential for revolutionary findings. Last \nyear, DARPA's Unconventional Pathogen Countermeasures program awarded \ncontracts totalling $50 million to universities, foundations, \npharmaceutical and biotechnology companies seeking new ways to fight \nbiological agents and toxins.\n  The Unconventional Pathogen Countermeasures program now funds 43 \nseparate research efforts on anti-bacterials, anti-toxins, anti-virals, \ndecontamination, external protection from pathogens, immunization and \nmulti-purpose vaccines and treatments. A common thread among many of \nthese undertakings is the goal of developing drugs that provide broad-\nspectrum protection against several different pathogens. This year, \nwith a budget of $63 million, the program has received over 100 \nresearch proposals in the last two months alone.\n  Some of this DARPA research is directed at developing revolutionary, \nbroad-spectrum, medical countermeasures against significantly \npathogenic microorganisms and/or their pathogenic products. The goal is \nto develop countermeasures that are versatile enough to eliminate \nbiological threats, whether from natural sources or modified through \nbioengineering or other manipulation. The countermeasures would need \nthe potential to provide protection both within the body and at the \nmost common portals of entry, e.g., inhalation, ingestion, \ntranscutaneous. The strategies might include defeating the pathogen's \nability to enter the body, traverse the bloodstream or lymphatics, and \nenter target tissues; identifying novel pathogen vulnerabilities based \non fundamental, critical molecular mechanisms of survival or \npathogenesis, e.g., Type III secretion, cellular energetics, virulence \nmodulation; constructing unique, robust vehicles for the delivery of \ncountermeasures into or within the body; and modulating the \nadvantageous and/or deleterious aspects of the immune response to \nsignificantly pathogenic microorganisms and/or the pathogenic products \nin the body\n  While DAPRA's work is specifically aimed at protecting our military \npersonnel, the National Institutes of Health also spent $49.7 million \nin the last fiscal year to find new therapies for those who contract \nsmallpox and on systems for detecting the disease. In recent years, \nNIH's research programs have sought to create more rapid and accurate \ndiagnostics, develop vaccines for those at risk of exposure to \nbiological agents, and improve treatment for those infected. Moreover, \nin the last fiscal year, the Centers for Disease Control has allocated \n$18 million to continue research on an anthrax vaccine and $22.4 \nmillion on smallpox research.\n\n  Some companies are willing to enter into a research relationships \nfunded by DARPA and other agencies to develop countermeasures. \nRelationships between the Government and private industry can be very \nproductive, but they can also involve complex issues reflecting the \ndifferent cultures of government and industry. Some companies, \nincluding some of the most entrepreneurial, might prefer to take their \nown initiative to conduct this research. Relationships with government \nentities involve risks, issues, and bureaucracy that are not present in \nrelationships among biotechnology companies and between them and non-\ngovernmental partners.\n  The Defense Departments Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program, JVAP, \nillustrates the problems with a government led and managed program. A \nreport in December 2000 by a panel of independent experts found that \nthe current program ``is insufficient and will fail'' and recommended \nit adopt an approach more on the model of a private sector effort. It \nneeds to adopt ``industry practices,'' ``capture industry interest,'' \n``implement an organizational alignment that mirrors the vaccine \nindustry's short chain of command and decision making,'' ``adopt an \nindustry-based management philosophy,'' and ``develop a sound \ninvestment strategy.'' It bemoaned the ``extremely limited'' input from \nindustry in the JVAP program.\n  It is clear from this experience that we should not rely exclusively \non government funding of countermeasures research. We should take \nadvantage of the entrepreneurial fervor, and the independence, of our \nbiotechnology industry entrepreneurs. It is not likely that the \nGovernment will be willing or able to provide sufficient funding for \nthe development of the countermeasures we need. Some of the most \ninnovative approaches to vaccines and medicines might not be funded \nwith the limited funds available to the Government. We need to provide \nincentives that will encourage every biotech company to review its \nresearch priorities and technology portfolio for its relevance and \npotential for countermeasure research. Some of this research is early \nstage, basic research that is being developed and considered only for \nits value in treating an entirely different disease. We need to kindle \nthe imagination of biotechnology companies and their tens of thousands \nof scientists regarding countermeasures research.\n  My proposal would supplement direct Federal government funding of \nresearch with incentives that make it possible for private companies to \nform the capital to conduct this research on their own initiative, \nutilizing their own capital, and at their own risk, all for good \nbusiness reasons going to their bottom line.\n  The U.S. biotechnology industry, approximately 1,300 companies, spent \n$13.8 billion on research last year. Only 350 of these companies have \nmanaged to go public. The industry employs 124,000, Ernest & Young \ndata, people. The top five companies spent an average of $89,000 per \nemployee on research, making it the most research-intensive industry in \nthe world. The industry has 350 products in human clinical trials \ntargeting more than 200 diseases. Losses for the industry were $5.8 \nbillion in 2001, $5.6 billion in 2000, $4.4 billion in 1999, $4.1 \nbillion in 1998, $4.5 billion in 1997, $4.6 billion in 1996, and \nsimilar amounts before that. In 2000 fully 38 percent of the public \nbiotech companies had less than 2 years of funding for their research. \nOnly one-quarter of the biotech companies in the United States are \npublicly traded and they tend to be the best funded.\n  There is a broad range of research that could be undertaken under \nthis legislation. Vaccines could be developed to prevent infection or \ntreat an infection from a bioterror attack. Broad-spectrum antibiotics \nare needed. Also, promising research has been undertaken on antitoxins \nthat could neutralize the toxins that are released, for example, by \nanthrax. With anthrax it is the toxins, not the bacteria itself, that \ncause death. An antitoxin could act like a decoy, attaching itself to \nsites on cells where active anthrax toxin binds and then combining with \nnormal active forms of the toxin and inactivating them. An antitoxin \ncould block the production of the toxin.\n  We can rely on the innovativeness of the biotech industry, working in \ncollaboration with academic medical centers, to explore a broad range \nof innovative approaches. This mobilizes the entire biotechnology \nindustry as a vital component of our national defense against bioterror \nweapons.\n  The legislation takes a comprehensive approach to the challenges the \nbiotechnology industry faces in forming capital to conduct research on \ncountermeasures. It includes capital formation tax incentives, \nguaranteed purchase funds, patent protections, and liability \nprotections. I believe we will have to include each of these types of \nincentives to ensure that we mobilize the biotechnology industry for \nthis urgent national defense research.\n  I am aware that all three of the tax incentives I have proposed, and \nboth of the two patent incentives I have proposed, may be \ncontroversial. In my view, we can debate tax or patent policy as long \nas you want, but let's not lose track of the issue here, development of \ncountermeasures to treat people infected or exposed to lethal and \ndisabling bioterror weapons.\n  We know that incentives can spur research. In 1983 we enacted the \nOrphan Drug Act to provide incentives for companies to develop \ntreatments for rare diseases with small potential markets deemed to be \nunprofitable by the industry. In the decade before this legislation was \nenacted, fewer than 10 drugs for orphan diseases were developed and \nthese were mostly chance discoveries. Since the Act became law, 218\n\n[[Page S12381]]\n\norphan drugs have been approved and 800 more are in the pipeline. The \nAct provides 7 years of market exclusivity and a tax credit covering \nsome research costs. The effectiveness of the incentives we have \nenacted for orphan disease research show us how much we can accomplish \nwhen we set a national priority for certain types of research.\n  The incentives I have proposed differ from those set by the Orphan \nDrug Act. We need to maintain the effectiveness of the Orphan Drug Act \nand not undermine it by adding many other disease research targets. In \naddition, the tax credits for research for orphan drug research have no \nvalue for most biotechnology companies because few of them have tax \nliability with respect to which to claim the credit. This explains why \nI have not proposed to utilize tax credits to spur countermeasures \nresearch. It is also clear that the market for countermeasures is even \nmore speculative than the market for orphan drugs and we need to enact \na broader and deeper package of incentives.\n\n  The Government determines which research is covered by the \nlegislation. The legislation confers on the Director of the Office of \nHomeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and \nSecretary of Health and Human Services, authority to set the list of \nagents and toxins with respect to which the legislation applies. The \nDirector determines which agents and toxins present a threat and on \nwhether the countermeasures are more likely to be developed with the \napplication of the incentives of the legislation. The Director may \ndetermine that an agent or toxin does not present a threat or that \ncountermeasures are not more likely to be developed with the \nincentives. The legislation includes an illustrative list of agents and \ntoxins that might be selected by the Director. The decisions of the \nDirector are final and cannot be subject to judicial review.\n  Once the list of agents and toxins is set, companies may register \nwith the Food and Drug Administration their intent to undertake \nresearch and development of a countermeasure to prevent or treat the \nagent or toxin. This registration is required only for companies that \nseek to be eligible for the tax, purchase, patent, and liability \nprovisions of the legislation. The registration does not apply to non-\nprofit entities or to companies that do not seek such eligibility. The \nregistration requirement gives the FDA vital information about the \nresearch effort and the personnel involved with the research.\n  The Director of the Office of Homeland Security then may certify that \nthe company is eligible for the tax, purchase, patent, and liability \nincentives in the legislation. Eligibility for the purchase fund, \npatent and liability incentives is contingent on successful development \nof a countermeasure according to the standards set in the legislation.\n  The legislation contemplates that a company might well register and \nseek certification with respect to more than one research project and \nbecome eligible for the tax, purchase, patent, and liability incentives \nfor each. There is no policy rationale for limiting a company to one \nregistration and one certification.\n  This process is similar to the current registration process for \nresearch on orphan, rare, diseases. In that case, companies that are \ncertified by the FDA become eligible for both tax and market \nexclusivity incentives. This process gives the Government complete \ncontrol on the number of registrations and certifications. This gives \nthe Government control over the cost and impact of the legislation on \nprivate sector research.\n  The legislation includes three tax incentives to enable biotechnology \ncompanies to form capital to fund research and development of \ncountermeasures. Companies must irrevocably elect only one of the \nincentives with regard to the research. These tax incentives are \navailable only to biotechnology companies with less than $750,000,000 \nin paid-in capital.\n  The paid-in capital of a corporation is quite distinct from the \nmarket capitalization of the firm. The paid-in capital is the aggregate \namount paid by investors into the corporation when this stock was \nissued, the price at issue multiplied by the number of shares sold. The \nmarket capitalization is the value of this stock in the stock market as \nit is traded among investors. I have focused on the paid-in capital as \nthis is the amount of capital actually available to the corporation to \nfund its research.\n  The legislation includes three different tax incentives to give \ncompanies flexibility in forming capital to fund the research. Each of \nthe options comes with advantages and limitations that may make it \nappropriate or inappropriate for a given company or research project. \nWe do not now know fully how investors and capital markets will respond \nto the different options, but we assume that companies will consult \nwith the investor community about which option will work best for a \ngiven research project. Capital markets are diverse and investors have \ndifferent needs and expectations. Over time these markets and investor \nexpectations evolve. If companies register for more than one research \nproject, they may well utilize different tax incentives for the \ndifferent projects.\n  Companies are permitted to undertake a series of discrete and \nseparate research projects and make this election with respect to each \nproject. They may only utilize one of the options with respect to each \nof these research projects.\n  The company is eligible to establish an R Limited Partnership to \nconduct the research. The partnership passes through all business \ndeductions and credits to the partners. For example, under this \narrangement, the research and development tax credits and depreciation \ndeductions for the company may be passed by the corporation through to \nits partners to be used to offset their individual tax liability. These \ndeductions and credits are then lost to the corporation.\n  The company is eligible to issue a special class of stock for the \nentity to conduct the research. The investors would be entitled to a \nzero capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the stock held for \nat least 3 years. This is a modification of the current Section 1202 \nwhere only 50 percent of the gains are not taxed. This provision is \nadapted from legislation I have introduced, S. 1134, and introduced in \nthe House by Representatives Dunn and Matsui, H.R. 2383. A similar bill \nhas been introduced by Senator Collins, S. 455.\n  The company is eligible to receive refunds for Net Operating Losses, \nNOLs, to fund the research. Under current law, net operating losses can \nonly be used to offset a company's tax liability. If a company has no \nprofits and therefore no tax liability, it cannot use its net operating \nlosses. It can carry them forward, but the losses have no current \nvalue. This option would allow the company to receive a refund of its \nNOLs at a rate of 75 percent of their value. Once the company becomes \nprofitable, and incurs tax liability, it must repay all of the refunds \nit has received. The provision in my legislation is adapted from bills \nintroduced by Senator Torricelli, S. 1049, and Congressman Robert \nMatsui, H.R. 2153.\n  A company that elects to utilize one of these incentives is not \neligible to receive benefits of the Orphan Drug Tax Credit. Companies \nthat can utilize tax credits, companies with taxable income and tax \nliability, might find the Orphan Credit more valuable. The legislation \nincludes an amendment to the Orphan Credit to correct a defect in the \ncurrent credit. The amendment has been introduced in the Senate as S. \n1341 by Senators Hatch, Kennedy and Jeffords. The amendment simply \nstates that the Credit is available starting the day an application for \norphan drug status is filed, not the date the FDA finally acts on it. \nThe amendment was one of many initiatives championed by Lisa J. Raines, \nwho died on September 11 in the plane that hit the Pentagon, and the \namendment is named in her honor. As we go forward in the legislative \nprocess, I hope we will have an opportunity to speak in more detail \nabout the service of Ms. Raines on behalf of medical research, \nparticularly on rare diseases.\n\n  My legislation does not include an enhanced tax credit for this \nresearch. Very few biotechnology companies can utilize a tax credit as \nthey have no taxable revenue and tax liability with respect to which to \nclaim a credit. Instead, they can carry the credit forward and utilize \nit when they do have tax liability. But that may be many years from \nnow. That is why I have focused on other incentives to assist the\n\n[[Page S12382]]\n\nbiotechnology industry to form capital to fund this countermeasures \nresearch.\n  The guaranteed purchase fund, and the patent bonus and liability \nprovisions described below provide an additional incentive for \ninvestors to fund the research. Without capital from investors these \nbiotechnology companies do not have the capacity, irrespective of their \ninterest, to conduct the research.\n  The market for countermeasures is speculative and small. This means \nthat if a company successfully develops a countermeasure, it may not \nreceive sufficient revenue on sales to justify the risk and expense of \nthe research. This is why the legislation establishes a countermeasures \npurchase fund that will define the market for the products with some \nspecificity before the research begins.\n  The fund managers will set standards for which countermeasures it \nwill purchase and define the financial terms of the purchase \ncommitment. This will enable companies to evaluate the market potential \nof its research before it launches into the project. The specifications \nwill need to be set with sufficient specificity so that the company, \nand its investors, can evaluate the market and with enough flexibility \nso that it does not inhibit the innovativeness of the researchers. This \napproach is akin to setting a performance standard for a new military \naircraft.\n  The legislation provides that the purchase fund is not obligated to \npurchase more than one product per class. This seeks to avoid a \nsituation where the Government must purchase more than one product when \nit only intends to use one. But it might make more sense, as an \nincentive, for the Government to commit to purchasing more than one \nproduct so that many more than one company conducts the research. A \nwinner-take-all system may well intimidate some companies and we may \nend up without a countermeasure to be purchased. It is also possible \nthat we will find that we need more than one countermeasure because \ndifferent products are useful for different patients. We may also find \nthat the first product developed is not the most effective. Given the \nurgency of the research, we would like to have the problem of seeing \nmore than one effective countermeasure developed. How we reconcile \nthese competing considerations is a key issue we need to resolve.\n  My legislation provides that the countermeasure must be approved by \nthe FDA. The standards that the FDA should apply in reviewing these \ntypes of products is an issue have been discussed in some detail and we \nneed to fashion the most effective provision on this subject. We need \nto recognize that the requirement for FDA approval might, in some \ncases, not be needed, appropriate or possible.\n  The purchase commitment for countermeasures is available to any \ncompany irrespective of its paid-in capital.\n  Intellectual property protection of research is essential to \nbiotechnology companies for one simple reason: they need to know that \nif they successfully develop a medical product another company cannot \nexpropriate it. It's a simple matter of incentives.\n  The patent system has its basis in the U.S. Constitution where the \nFederal Government is given the mandate to ``promote the Progress of \nScience and the Useful Arts by securing for a limited time to Authors \nand Inventors the exclusive right to their respective Writings and \nDiscoveries.'' In exchange for full disclosure of the terms of their \ninventions, inventors are granted the right to exclude others from \nmaking, using, or selling their inventions for a limited period of \ntime. This quid pro quo provides investors with the incentive to \ninvent. In the absence of the patent law, discoverable inventions would \nbe freely available to anyone who wanted to use them and inventors \nwould not be able to capture the value of their inventions or secure a \nreturn on their investments.\n  The patent system strikes a balance. Companies receive limited \nprotection of their inventions if they are willing to publish the terms \nof their invention for all to see. At the end of the term of the \npatent, anyone can practice the invention without any threat of an \ninfringement action. During the term of the patent, competitors can \nlearn from the published description of the invention and may well find \na new and distinct patentable invention.\n  The legislation provides two types of intellectual property \nprotection. One simply provides that the term of the patent on the \ncountermeasure will be the term of the patent granted by the Patent and \nTrademark Office without any erosion due to delays in approval of the \nproduct by the Food and Drug Administration. The second provides that a \ncompany that successfully develops a countermeasure will receive a \nbonus of 2 years on the term of any patent held by that company. \nCompanies must elect one of these two protections and only small \nbiotechnology companies may elect the second protection. Large, \nprofitable pharmaceutical companies may elect only the first of the two \noptions.\n  The first protection against erosion of the term of the patent is an \nissue that is partially addressed in current law, the Hatch-Waxman \nPatent Term Restoration Act. That act provides partial protection \nagainst erosion of the term, length of a patent when there are delays \nat the FDA in approving a product. The erosion occurs when the PTO \nissues a patent before the product is approved by the FDA. In these \ncases, the term of the patent is running but the company cannot market \nthe product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides some protections against \nerosion of the term of the patent, but the protections are incomplete. \nAs a result, many companies end up with a patent with a reduced term, \nsometimes substantially reduced.\n\n  The issue of patent term erosion has become more serious due to \nchanges at the PTO in the patent system. The term of a patent used to \nbe fixed at 17 years from the date the patent was granted by the PTO. \nIt made no difference how long it took for the PTO to process the \npatent application and sometimes the processing took years, even \ndecades. Under this system, there were cases where the patent would \nissue before final action at the FDA, but there were other cases where \nthe FDA acted to approve a product before the patent was issued. \nErosion was an issue, but it did not occur in many cases.\n  Since 1995 the term of a patent has been set at 20 years from the \ndate of application for the patent. This means that the processing time \nby the PTO of the application all came while the term of the patent is \nrunning. This gives companies a profound incentive to rush the patent \nthrough the PTO. Under the old system, companies had the opposite \nincentive. With patents being issued earlier by the PTO, the issue of \nerosion of patent term due to delays at the FDA is becoming more \nserious and more common.\n  The provision in my legislation simply states that in the case of \nbioterrorism countermeasures, no erosion in the term of the patent will \noccur. The term of the patent at the date of FDA approval will be the \nsame as the term of the patent when it was issued by the PTO. There is \nno extension of the patent, simply protections against erosion. Under \nthe new 20-year term, patents might be more or less than 17 years \ndepending on the processing time at the PTO, and all this legislation \nsays is that whatever term is set by the PTO will govern irrespective \nof the delays at the FDA. This option is available to any company that \nsuccessfully develops a countermeasure eligible to be purchased by the \nfund.\n  The second option, the bonus patent term, is only available to small \nbiotechnology companies. It provides that a company that successfully \ndevelops a countermeasure is entitled to a 2-year extension of any \npatent in its portfolio. This does not apply to any patent of another \ncompany bought or transferred in to the countermeasure research \ncompany.\n  I am well aware that this bonus patent term provision will be \ncontroversial with some. A company would tend to utilize this option if \nit owned the patent on a product that still had, or might have, market \nvalue at the end of the term of the patent. Because this option is only \navailable to small biotechnology companies, most of whom have no \nproduct on the market, in most cases they would be speculating about \nthe value of a product at the end of its patent. The company might \napply this provision to a patent that otherwise would be eroded due to \nFDA delays or it might apply it to a patent that was not eroded. The \nresult might be a patent term that is no longer than the patent term \nissued by the PTO. It all depends on which companies elect\n\n[[Page S12383]]\n\nthis option and which patent they select. In some cases, the effect of \nthis provision might be to delay the entry onto the market of lower \npriced generics. This would tend to shift some of the cost of the \nincentive to develop a countermeasure to insurance companies and \npatients with an unrelated disease.\n  My rationale for including the patent bonus in the legislation is \nsimple: I want this legislation to say emphatically that we mean \nbusiness, we are serious, and we want biotechnology companies to \nreconfigure their research portfolios to focus in part on development \nof countermeasures. The other provisions in the legislation are \npowerful, but they may not be sufficient.\n  This proposal protects companies willing to take the risks of \nproducing anti-terrorism products for the American public from \npotential losses incurred from lawsuits alleging adverse reactions to \nthese products. It also preserves the right for plaintiffs to seek \nrecourse for alleged adverse reactions in Federal District Court, with \nprocedural and monetary limitations.\n  Under the plan, the Secretary of HHS is authorized, and in the case \nof contractors with HHS, is required, to indemnify and defend persons \nengaged in research, development and other activities related to \nbiological defense products through execution of ``indemnification and \ndefense agreements.'' An exclusive means of resolving civil cases that \nfall within the scope of the indemnification and defense agreements is \nprovided with litigation rights for injured parties. Non-economic \ndamages are limited to $250,000 per plaintiff and no punitive or \nexemplary damages may be awarded.\n  Some have tried to apply the existing Vaccine Injury Compensation \nProgram, VICP, to this national effort. That is inappropriate because \nthat program will be extremely difficult to use, both administratively \nand scientifically. For example, it would take several years to develop \nthe appropriate ``table'' that identifies a compensable injury. \nCompanies will be liable during this process. Note that when VICP was \ncreated, there had been studies of what adverse reactions to mandated \nchildhood vaccines had occurred and the table was based largely on this \nexperience. Even so, it has taken years of effort, ultimately resulting \nin wholesale revisions to the table by regulation, to get the current \ntable in place. For anti-bioterrorism products currently being \ndeveloped, it will simply be impossible to construct a meaningful \nVaccine Injury Table, there will be no experience with the product.\n  The Frist-Kennedy bill relies on the President's Executive Order \nregarding liability protections, so there is a basis for an agreement \nregarding this issue as applied to bioterrorism countermeasures. The \nprovisions that I have proposed are superior to those in the Executive \nOrder because the order provides protection only on a contract basis. \nSo, it doesn't provide protection based on the product being developed, \nonly if that product is being developed under a specific government \ncontract. Therefore, it's negotiated case by case by HHS and a company. \nYour proposal provides assurance to companies, especially small and \nmedium sized companies, that they will be protected. This will allow \nthem to go forward with their development plans. Their lawyers may be \nleery of trying to negotiate their own deal with HHS. So, the EO may be \neffective for a large company when it negotiates making additional \nsmallpox vaccine, but it provides little assurance to a small company \nthat wants to start development. Also, the administration says the EO \nwill be used to protect companies, however, the next \nadministration could interpret it differently. That's why a statutory \nprovision will provide greater assurance to companies.\n\n  The legislation focuses intently on development of vaccines and \nmedicines, but it is possible that we will face biological agents and \nchemical agents we've never seen before. As I've mentioned, the Soviet \nUnion bioterror research focused in part on use of genetic modification \ntechnology to develop agents and toxins that currently-available \nantibiotics can not treat. Australian researchers accidentally created \na modified mousepox virus, which does not affect humans, but it was 100 \npercent lethal to the mice. Their research focused on trying to make a \nmouse contraceptive vaccine for pest control. The surprise was that it \ntotally suppressed the ``cell-mediated response,'' the arm of the \nimmune system that combats viral infection. To make matters worse, the \nengineered virus also appears unnaturally resistant to attempts to \nvaccinate the mice. A vaccine that would normally protect mouse strains \nthat are susceptible to the virus only worked in half the mice exposed \nto the killer version. If bioterrorists created a human version of the \nvirus, vaccination programs would be of limited use. This highlights \nthe drawback of working on vaccines against bioweapons rather than \ntreatments.\n  With the advances in gene sequencing, genomics, we will know the \nexact genetic structure of a biological agent. This information in the \nwrong hands could easily be manipulated to design and possibly grow a \nlethal new bacterial and viral strains not found in nature. A scientist \nmight be able to mix and match traits from different microorganisms, \ncalled recombinant technology, to take a gene that makes a deadly toxin \nfrom one strain of bacteria and introduce it into other bacterial \nstrains. Dangerous pathogens or infectious agents could be made more \ndeadly, and relatively benign agents could be designed as major public \nhealth problems. Bacteria that cause diseases such as anthrax could be \naltered in such a way that would make current vaccines or antibiotics \nagainst them ineffective. It is even possible that a scientist could \ndevelop an organism that develops resistance to antibiotics at an \naccelerated rate.\n  This means we need to develop technology, research tools, that will \nenable us to quickly develop a tailor-made, specific countermeasure to \na previously unknown organism or agent. These research tools will \nenable us to develop a tailor-made vaccine or drug to deploy as a \ncountermeasure against a new threat. The legislation authorizes \ncompanies to register and receive a certification making them eligible \nfor the tax incentives in the bill for this research.\n  Perhaps the greatest strength of our biomedical research \nestablishment in the United States is the synergy between our superb \nbasic research institutions and private companies. The Bayh-Dole Act \nand Stevenson-Wydler Act form the legal framework for mutually \nbeneficially partnerships between academia and industry. My legislation \nstrengthens this synergy and these relationships with two provisions, \none to upgrades in the basic research infrastructure available to \nconduct research on countermeasures and the other to increase \ncooperation between the National Institutes of Health and private \ncompanies.\n  Research on countermeasures necessitates the use of special \nfacilities where biological agents can be handled safely without \nexposing researchers and the public to danger. Very few academic \ninstitutions or private companies can justify or capitalize the \nconstruction of these special facilities. The Federal Government can \nfacilitate research and development of countermeasures by financing the \nconstruction of these facilities for use on a fee-for-service basis. \nThe legislation authorizes appropriations for grants to non-profit and \nfor-profit institutions to construct, maintain, and manage up to ten \nBiosafety Level 3-4 facilities, or their equivalent, in different \nregions of the country for use in research to develop countermeasures. \nBSL 3-4 facilities are ones used for research on indigenous, exotic or \ndangerous agents with potential for aerosol transmission of disease \nthat may have serious or lethal consequences or where the agents pose \nhigh risk of life-threatening disease, aerosol-transmitted lab \ninfections, or related agents with unknown risk of transmission. The \nDirector of the Office and NIH shall issue regulations regarding the \nqualifications of the researchers who may utilize the facilities. \nCompanies that have registered with and been certified by the Director, \nto develop countermeasures under Section 5(d) of the legislation, shall \nbe given priority in the use of the facilities.\n  The legislation also reauthorizes a very successful NIH-industry \npartnership program launched in FY 2000 in Public Law 106-113. The \nfunding is for partnership challenge grants to promote joint ventures \nbetween NIH and\n\n[[Page S12384]]\n\nits grantees and for-profit biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical \ndevice industries with regard to the development of countermeasures, as \ndefined in Section 3 of the bill, and research tools, as defined in \nSection 4(d)(3) of the bill. Such grants shall be awarded on a one-for-\none matching basis. So far the matching grants have focused on \ndevelopment of medicines to treat malaria, tuberculosis, emerging and \nresistant infections, and therapeutics for emerging threats. My \nproposal should be matched by reauthorization of the challenge grant \nprogram for these deadly diseases.\n  My legislation is carefully calibrated to provide incentives only \nwhere they are needed. This accounts for the choices in the legislation \nabout which provisions are available to small biotechnology companies \nand large pharmaceutical companies.\n  Most biotechnology companies rely on infusions of investor capital to \nfund research, so the capital formation tax incentives only apply to \nthem. Large pharmaceutical companies have ample revenues from product \nsales, and access to debt capital, so they do not need these incentives \nfor capital formation.\n  The guaranteed purchase fund applies to any company that successfully \ndevelops a countermeasure. There is no reason to make any distinction \nbetween small and large companies. They all need to know the terms and \ndimensions of the potential market for the products they seek to \ndevelop. With countermeasures the market may well be uncertain or \nsmall, necessitating the creation of the purchase fund.\n  The patent protection provisions are also well calibrated. Both small \nand large companies face the patent term erosion problem due to delays \nat the FDA. There is no reason why companies that successfully develop \na countermeasure should end up with a patent with an eroded term.\n\n  With regard to the patent bonus provision, this is included to \nsupplement the capital formation tax incentives for small biotechnology \ncompanies. It provides a dramatic statement to investors that this \nresearch makes good business sense. As capital formation is not a \nchallenge for a large pharmaceutical company, this patent bonus \nprovision is not available to them.\n  Finally, with regard to the liability provisions, there is no reason \nto make any distinction between small and large companies.\n  The legislation makes choices. It sets the priorities. It provides a \ndose of incentives and seeks a response in the private sector. We are \nattempting here to do something that has not been done before. This is \nuncharted territory. And it's also an urgent mission.\n  There may be cases where a countermeasure developed to treat a \nbiological toxin or chemical agent will have applications beyond this \nuse. A broad-spectrum antibiotic capable of treating many different \nbiological agents may well have the capacity to treat naturally \noccurring diseases.\n  This same issue arises with the Orphan Drug Act, which provides both \ntax and FDA approval incentives for companies that develop medicines to \ntreat rare diseases. In some cases these treatments can also be used \nfor larger disease populations. There are few who object to this \nsituation. We have come to the judgment that the urgency of this \nresearch is worth the possible additional benefits that might accrue to \na company.\n  In the context of research to develop countermeasures, I do not \nconsider it a problem that a company might find a broader commercial \nmarket for a countermeasure. Indeed, it may well be the combination of \nthe incentives in this legislation and these broader markets that \ndrives the successful development of a countermeasure. If our intense \nfocus on developing countermeasures, and research tools, provides \nbenefits for mankind going well beyond terror weapons, we should \nrejoice. If this research helps us to develop an effective vaccine or \ntreatment for AIDS, we should give the company the Nobel Prize for \nMedicine. If we do not develop a vaccine or treatment for AIDS, we may \nsee 100 million people die of AIDS. We also have 400 million people \ninfected with malaria and more than a million annual deaths. Millions \nof children die of diarrhea, cholera and other deadly and disabling \ndiseases. Countermeasures research may deepen our understanding of the \nimmune system and speed development of treatments for cancer and \nautoimmune diseases. That is not the central purpose of this \nlegislation, but it is an additional rationale for it.\n  The issue raised by my legislation is very simple: do we want the \nFederal Government to fund and supervise much of the research to \ndevelop countermeasures or should we also provide incentives that make \nit possible for the private sector, at its own expense, and at its own \nrisk, to undertake this research for good business reasons. The Frist-\nKennedy legislation focuses effectively on direct Federal funding and \ncoordination issues, but it does not include sufficient incentives for \nthe private sector to undertake this research on its own initiative. \nTheir proposal and mine are perfectly complimentary. We need to enact \nboth to ensure that we are prepared for bioterror attacks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an outline of my legislation appear at \nthis point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the outline was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows\n\n  Biological and Chemical Weapons Countermeasures Research Act of 2001\n\n       The premise of the legislation is that there will be limits \n     on direct Federal funding of research and development of \n     countermeasures, vaccines, drugs, and other medicines, to \n     prevent or treat infections from biological and chemical \n     agents and toxins. The legislation proposes incentives that \n     will enable biotechnology companies to take the initiative, \n     for good business reasons, to conduct research to develop \n     these countermeasures.\n       The incentives are needed because most biotech companies \n     have no approved products or revenue from product sales to \n     fund research. They rely on investors and equity capital \n     markets to fund the research. These companies must focus on \n     research that will lead to product sales and revenue and end \n     their dependence on investor capital. When they are able to \n     form the capital to fund research, biotech companies tend to \n     be innovative and nimble and focused on the intractable \n     diseases for which no effective medical treatments are \n     available.\n       There is no established or predictable market for \n     countermeasures. Investors are justifiably reluctant to fund \n     this research, which will present technical challenges \n     similar in complexity to development of effective treatments \n     for AIDS. Investors need assurances that research on \n     countermeasures has the potential to provide a rate of return \n     commensurate with the risk, complexity and cost of the \n     research, a rate of return comparable to that which may arise \n     from a treatment for cancer, MS, Cystic Fibrosis and other \n     major diseases or from other investments.\n       The legislation provides tax incentives to enable biotech \n     companies to form capital to conduct the research. It then \n     provides a guaranteed and pre-determined market for the \n     countermeasures and special intellectual property protections \n     to serve as a substitute for a market. Finally, it \n     establishes liability protections for the countermeasures \n     that are developed.\n       Specifics of the legislation are as follows: one, Office of \n     Homeland Security sets research priorities in advance. \n     Biotech companies that seek to be eligible for the incentives \n     in the legislation must register with the Food and Drug \n     Administration and be certified as eligible for the \n     incentives; two, once a company is certified as eligible for \n     the incentives, it becomes eligible for the tax, purchasing, \n     patent, and liability provisions. A company is eligible for \n     certification for the tax and patent provisions if it \n     seeks to develop a research tool that will make it \n     possible to quickly develop a countermeasure to a \n     previously unknown agent or toxin, or an agent or toxin \n     not targeted for research; three, Capital Formation for \n     Countermeasures Research: The legislation provides that a \n     company seeking to fund research is eligible to elect from \n     among three tax incentives. The three alternatives are as \n     follows: a. The company is eligible to establish an R \n     Limited Partnership to conduct the research. The \n     partnership passes through all business deductions and \n     credits to the partners; b. The company is eligible to \n     issue a special class of stock for the entity to conduct \n     the research. The investors would be entitled to a zero \n     capital gains tax rate on any gains realized on the stock; \n     and, c. The company is eligible to receive refunds for Net \n     Operating Losses, NOLs, to fund the research.\n       These tax incentives are available only to biotechnology \n     companies with less than $750,000 in paid-in capital.\n       A company must elect only one of these incentives and, if \n     it elects one of these incentives, it is then not eligible to \n     receive benefits under the Orphan Drug Act. The legislation \n     includes amendments to the Orphan Drug Act championed by \n     Senators Hatch, Kennedy and Jeffords, S. 1341. The amendments \n     make the Credit available from the date of the application \n     for Orphan Drug status, not the date the application is \n     approved as provided under current law; four, Countermeasure \n     Purchase Fund: The legislation provides that a company that \n     successfully develops a countermeasure, through FDA approval, \n     is eligible to sell the product to the Federal Government at \n     a pre-established\n\n[[Page S12385]]\n\n     price and in a pre-determined amount. The company is given \n     notice of the terms of the sale before it commences the \n     research. Sales to this fund may be made by any company \n     irrespective of its paid-in capital; five, Intellectual \n     Property Incentives: The legislation provides that a company \n     that successfully develops a countermeasure is eligible to \n     elect one of two patent incentives. The two alternatives are \n     as follows: a. The company is eligible to receive a patent \n     for its invention with a term as long as the term of the \n     patent when it was issued by the Patent and Trademark Office, \n     without any erosion due to delays in the FDA approval \n     process. This alternative is available to any company that \n     successfully develops a countermeasure irrespective of its \n     paid-in capital; b. The company is eligible to extend the \n     term of any patent owned by the company for two years. The \n     patent may not be one that is acquired by the company from a \n     third party. This is included as a capital formation \n     incentive for small biotechnology companies with less than \n     $750,000 in paid-in capital.\n       Six, Liability Protections: The legislation provides for \n     protections against liability for the company that \n     successfully develops a countermeasure. This option is \n     available to any company that successfully develops a \n     countermeasure irrespective of its paid-in capital; and \n     seven, Strengthening of Biomedical Research Infrastructure: \n     Authorizes appropriations for grants to construct specialized \n     biosafety containment facilities where biological agents can \n     be handled safely without exposing researchers and the public \n     to danger. Also reauthorizes a successful NIH-industry \n     partnership challenge grants to promote joint ventures \n     between NIH and its grantees and for-profit biotechnology, \n     pharmaceutical and medical device industries with regard to \n     the development of countermeasures and research tools.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12385-1", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 186--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION OF SENATOR LOTT IN \n                        THE CASE OF LEE V.

Mr. President, this resolution concerns a civil action \ncommenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District \nof Mississippi. The lawsuit, filed by a prolife, pro se plaintiff, \nnames Senator Lott as the sole defendant. The plaintiff has filed a \nnumber of prior lawsuits against other public officials, which have \nbeen dismissed by several courts.\n  In this action, the plaintiff calls upon Senator Lott to commence \nimpeachment proceedings against the United States Supreme Court for its \nruling in Bush v.

The plaintiff contends that because the Supreme \nCourt's decision in that case was unlawful, all actions taken by \nPresident George Bush are unconstitutional, including one allegedly \ndenying him disability benefits. This resolution authorizes the Senate \nLegal Counsel to represent Senator Lott in this suit to move for its \ndismissal.

I send a bill to the desk regarding bioterrorism \npreparedness and ask for its first reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1765) to improve the ability of the United \n     States to prepare for and respond to a biological threat or \n     attack.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator \nKennedy, and dozens of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport critical legislation that will help our Nation better prepare \nto defend against potential bioterrorist attacks.\n  The Bioterrorism Preparedness Act of 2001 was first introduced on \nNovember 15. Today, we are reintroducing this bill so that it may be \nplaced directly on the calendar and available for consideration by the \nfull Senate.\n  As my colleagues will note, the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act enjoys \nbroad bipartisan support. We are re-introducing the legislation today \nwith 71 cosponsors--33 Republicans and 38 Democrats. In addition, in \nthe two weeks since the legislation was first introduced, we have \ngained the support of over two dozen organizations, including the \nAmerican Medical Association, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, \nthe American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the Association of Minority Health Professions Schools, \nand the National Association of Children's Hospitals & Related \nInstitutions. The list of supporters is growing every day.\n  In light of this overwhelming support and the short time remaining \nthis session of Congress, we are moving the bill directly onto the \nSenate calendar so that it will be available for us to consider as soon \nas possible.\n  In the wake of the attacks at the Pentagon and World Trade Center on \nSeptember 11 and subsequent bioterrorist attacks, we know that \nbioterrorism is a significant and growing threat. I believe we must \ntake steps this year to strengthen our capabilities to prepare for and \nrespond to potential attacks.\n  Three years ago, as Chair of the Senate Public Health Subcommittee, I \nbegan a series of hearings to study in-depth the ability of our \nnation's public health infrastructure--at the local, state, and \nnational level--to respond to public health threats and emergencies, \nincluding bioterrorism. Those hearings culminated in the passage of \nlegislation last year--the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of \n2000--intended to enhance coordination and improve resources for our \npublic health system, principally at the state and local levels. But \nthat authorizing legislation has never fully been funded, and it is now \nclear that more resources are needed to immediately strengthen our \nresponse capabilities.\n  That is why I feel so strongly that we must pass the Bioterrorism \nPreparedness Act of 2001. The legislation will address gaps in our \nNation's defenses by expanding the capabilities of local, state, and \nfederal government to respond to bioterrorist attacks, improving \ncoordination among those responsible for responding to bioterrorist \nthreats, speeding the development of vaccines and other \ncountermeasures, and safeguarding the Nation's food supply and \nagriculture.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to \ndevelop this legislation. In particular, I would like to single out \nSenator Roberts, Senator Daschle, and Senator Hutchison for their work \non the agricultural provisions; Senators Gregg and Hutchinson for their \ncontributions on the drug and vaccine development components; and \nSenator Collins for her input on the food safety provisions. Of course, \nI would also like to acknowledge my chief Democratic cosponsor, Senator \nKennedy. I encourage my colleagues who have not yet cosponsored this \nlegislation to do so. And I encourage the leadership of the Senate to \nwork with Senator Kennedy and myself to find time in the days remaining \nso that this important legislation can be passed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the second reading and object to \nmy own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection having been heard, the bill will \nreceive its second reading on the next legislative day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/12/04/senate-section/article/S12386-3", "month": "12", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 5, 2001\n\n  Mr. REID.
