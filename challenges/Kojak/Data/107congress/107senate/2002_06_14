Madam President, seniors in Washington State cannot get\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nthe medical care they need, and I have come to the floor today to \nexplain the problem and to offer a solution that has the support of \ndoctors, nurses, hospitals, and patients throughout Washington State.\n  While many States are facing challenges in health care, the problems \nare especially severe in my home State, where providers are struggling \nto care for patients in a system that is falling down around them. \nThere are many reasons for this crisis, but one of the most fundamental \nis the unfair way in which Medicare reimburses doctors and providers.\n  Just look at what happens to the seniors I represent. They have spent \ntheir lives working hard, raising their families, and paying into the \nMedicare system. In fact, they have paid the same percentage of their \nincome into Medicare as Americans from every State. But when they \nretire, they find that their access to health care depends upon where \nthey happen to live. If they live in Washington State, they can expect \nfar less access and far fewer benefits than seniors in other States. \nThat is because Medicare reimbursement rates vary State by State.\n  Today, those reimbursement rates don't reflect the true cost of \nproviding care, and they are penalizing patients and providers \nthroughout Washington.\n  Madam President, in recent years, we have lost many physicians and \nclinics, especially in our rural areas. These unfair Medicare rates are \nmaking the problem even worse by encouraging doctors to retire early, \nto move, or to stop seeing Medicare patients altogether.\n  At the same time, these rates make it even harder for us to attract \nthe new doctors, nurses, and health care professionals that we need to \nfill the growing void. As a result, seniors have to spend all day long \non the phone trying to find a doctor who will see them. More often than \nnot, they are told the doctor is not accepting any new Medicare \npatients.\n  Today, I want to explain the problem, show the impact it is having on \nthe people of my State, and talk about a legislative proposal that \nSenator Cantwell and I have introduced to give Medicare patients the \nequity they deserve.\n  For years, the health care challenges of Washington State have been \ngetting worse, just like in the Presiding Officer's State. More and \nmore patients don't have insurance and families don't have enough \ninsurance. There is a shortage of health care professionals. That is \ncausing problems, especially in our rural areas. There are many reasons \nfor these difficulties, including our growing retired population, the \nrising cost of medical care and prescription drugs, as we all know, and \npaperwork and insurance.\n  In January, Medicare payments to doctors were slashed by 5.4 percent \nnationwide. Because many private insurers base their rates on Medicare \npayments, providers cannot shift the costs as they could in the past. \nIn addition, Washington State is facing a budget shortfall and that has \naffected funding for Medicaid.\n  As we in Washington State try to address those national challenges, \nwe are starting out several steps behind. That is because Washington \nState receives far below the national average in Medicare payments per \npatient. As this chart behind me shows, Medicare rates vary by State. \nShown here are the average Medicare payments per beneficiary. These \nfigures come from the Federal agency that manages the program--the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as CMS. These figures \nare for fiscal year 2000. I would love to show more recent numbers, but \nI understand CMS has decided they are no longer going to calculate or \ndistribute these figures.\n\n  Looking at this chart, you can see that these figures vary \ndramatically between States. At the top is Louisiana. They get, on \naverage, $7,336 per Medicare patient. At the bottom is Iowa, which \nreceives less than half that, just $3,053. When you include the \nDistrict of Columbia, Washington State, my State, ranks 42nd in the \nNation in Medicare reimbursement beneficiary. The Presiding Officer's \nState of Arkansas ranks right here at about 28th in the Nation. It is \nwell below the average of what most States get. The national average is \n$5,490. Washington State, my State, receives $3,921 per patient.\n  In fact, in New York, a doctor can be reimbursed at twice the rate as \nWashington State for some procedures. That affects the stability of our \ndoctors, hospitals, clinics, and home health care providers. Over the \nlifetime of a Medicare beneficiary, it can mean thousands of dollars \nless spent on their care in Washington.\n  These regional inequities have resulted in vastly different levels of \ncare and access to care. For example, in Florida, up here at the top of \nthe chart, a lot of Medicare beneficiaries have access to prescription \ndrugs and prescription eyeglasses in their Medicare Plus Choice \nprogram.\n  In Washington State, while there may be some willing providers, there \nare no open plans available that offer prescription drug coverage, much \nless eyeglasses, because of our low reimbursements.\n  Overall, this is about fairness and access to health care. So I want \nto point out four reasons this morning why this system is unfair to \npatients in my State and the other States that rank at the bottom in \nreimbursements.\n  First, Washington State seniors pay the same rate into Medicare as \neveryone else. During their working years, every American pays the same \npercent of their income into the Medicare system, no matter where they \nlive.\n  During retirement, every American pays the exact same dollar amount \nin part B premiums, no matter which State they live in. Washington \nseniors pay the same, but they do not get the same access to care, and \nthat is not fair.\n\n  Second, the reimbursement rates do not reflect the true costs of \nproviding care. The cost of treating a patient does not magically drop \nwhen you cross the border into my home State of Washington. The health \ncare pressures we are facing do not stop at the State line, but \npayments do, and that is forcing doctors to choose between helping \npatients and staying in business. That is not fair.\n  Third, health care today is affected by national trends that require \nmore equal reimbursement rates throughout the country. Two of those \ntrends are the shrinking pool of available doctors and the growing need \nfor expensive medical equipment.\n  There are a limited number of medical professionals, and every State \nis now competing to attract them. Because Medicare rates are so much \nlower in my State, we cannot offer the same salaries or the same \nrecruitment incentives.\n  Hospitals face this challenge when it comes to medical technology. \nToday, health care relies increasingly on sophisticated expensive \ntechnology. An MRI machine costs the same amount for a hospital in \nFlorida as a hospital in Washington State, but the only difference is \nthe hospital in Washington State receives far less money from Medicare \nto pay for it. Overall, that means our State cannot attract the \nproviders or buy the equipment that other States can, and that is not \nfair.\n  I recently heard from doctors with Olympia Radiation Oncology in \nOlympia, WA, and they said:\n\n       While the cost of state-of-the-art equipment and personnel \n     remains the same from state to state, the reimbursement is \n     allowing appropriately reimbursed states to maintain a higher \n     quality of care, while Washington State is struggling to \n     deliver basic care. . . . If this problem is not addressed in \n     a timely manner, we will continue to have a migration of \n     young people and businesses out of our state, and we will be \n     left with an aging population with suboptimal care.\n\n  My State is being penalized for doing the right things in health \ncare, and that is not fair. Washington State has a long tradition of \nproviding high-quality, low-cost health care, but today that innovative \ntradition is being used against us by the Medicare system. Other States \nspend more than twice what we spend and end up with less healthy \noutcomes while we are being punished for providing excellent care at \nlow costs, and that is not fair.\n  This is an issue of fairness. Our seniors pay the same into the \nsystem and pay the same Part B premiums, but we do not get the same \naccess or benefits. Our doctors have to choose between staying in \nbusiness or accepting Medicare patients because Medicare payments do \nnot reflect the true costs.\n  Our State is competing with every other State to attract doctors and \nto buy medical equipment, but we do not\n\n[[Page S5565]]\n\nhave the same resources as Medicare provides to other States.\n  Finally, our State is being penalized for providing highly efficient, \nhigh-quality health care at low costs. Any way we look at it, the \nsystem is not fair to the people I represent.\n  This difference in reimbursement rates would not be a big deal if it \nwere just a bureaucratic formula on a piece of paper, but we are \ntalking about whether or not people can see a doctor, and I can tell \nyou, unfair Medicare rates are hurting patients in Washington State in \nseveral ways. Many doctors are leaving our State, retiring early, or \neven refusing to accept Medicare patients. Nationwide a study by the \nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians found that 17 percent of family \ndoctors are not accepting new Medicare patients. The problem is even \nmore severe in my State. The Washington State Medical Association \nconducted a survey last November and found that 57 percent of \nphysicians who responded said they are either limiting their Medicare \npatients or dropping all Medicare patients from their practice.\n\n  Many experts believe that study does not even show the full extent of \nthe problem. Other doctors are just leaving our State altogether. Since \n1998, the number of Washington State Medical Association members \nleaving our State has increased by 31 percent.\n  To illustrate this problem, the Washington State Medical Association \ntook out print advertisements in Washington State newspapers. And they \nsay: Eastern Washington, my State, has a thriving medical community. \nYou will find them in places like Boise, ID and Eugene, OR.\n\n       It's getting to the point where Washington doctors can't \n     afford to stay in Washington. Administrative costs are out of \n     control, reimbursement rates don't cover services, medical \n     practices are shutting down. The fact is Medicaid and \n     Medicare are grossly underfunded and private payers are \n     setting their rates according to public programs. Now what \n     does this mean to the patient? It means that even if you have \n     great health insurance, the underfunding of public programs \n     puts your personal physician's practice in jeopardy. So in \n     other words, all the insurance in the world isn't going to \n     help when your family doctor packs up and leaves the State.\n\n  This is a pretty good description of what is happening in my State. \nWhen doctors leave our State or retire early, their patients have to \nlook for a new doctor who will accept Medicare, and according to my \nState's medical association, each time one physician leaves the \nMedicare Program, 2,000 patients have to find a new caregiver.\n  Across Washington State, seniors are experiencing the frustration of \nspending all day on the phone and still not being able to find a doctor \nwho will accept them just because they are on Medicare.\n  Many articles have been published in my State detailing the trouble \nour seniors are having finding a doctor, and I have included many of \nthese articles on my Web site. But I want to share one example with my \ncolleagues.\n  A few months ago in Sequim, WA, a small, rural community, an older \nwoman came up to me in a parking lot with a cast on her arm. She told \nme when she broke her arm, she went to the doctor. He put her cast on \nand told her to come back in 4 weeks. In the interim, her doctor \ndetermined he could no longer take Medicare patients. So when she went \nback 4 weeks later, she found out her doctor would not see her because \nhe was not accepting Medicare patients.\n  There she was in this parking lot, standing there asking me how she \nwas supposed to get her cast off. That is how bad it has gotten.\n  These terrible examples are becoming more common every day in my \nState because unfair Medicare rates are encouraging doctors to leave my \nState or close their practices to Medicare patients. But it is not just \na problem for people on Medicare. It ends up having an impact on \neveryone.\n  When a patient cannot find a doctor, a patient ends up in the \nemergency room. The ER is really the only place where a patient cannot \nbe turned away. Unfortunately, by the time they make it to the ER, \ntheir symptoms, which could have been addressed easily, have now \ndeveloped into more serious medical problems.\n\n  James Newman is an emergency room doctor in Kennewick, WA. He is the \nchairman of education for the Benton-Franklin County Medical Society. \nDr. Newman has seen patients go into cardiac arrest in the emergency \nroom because they did not get care early enough. Often those patients \nhad symptoms for weeks, but they could not find a primary care doctor, \nso they end up going into cardiac arrest in the emergency room, and \nthat is outrageous.\n  Dr. Newman says that once a patient is ready to leave the ER, he \ncannot find a doctor who will continue to care for them. So Dr. Newman, \nwho is board certified in emergency medicine and has been practicing \nfor 10 years, spends much of his time trying to find doctors for his \npatients, sometimes begging and borrowing favors just to get his \npatients the care they need, and he ends up having to practice beyond \nthe normal scope of his job.\n  For example, he might give a patient an 8-month prescription for \nhypertension medicine because he knows that patient will not be able to \nfind a primary care doctor to refill a shorter prescription. Even \nworse, Dr. Newman ends up seeing the same patients again and again in \nhis emergency room because they cannot find a doctor to care for them. \nThat is how bad things have gotten in my State.\n  Remember, the cost of providing care in emergency rooms is much \nhigher than preventing those problems in the first place. This problem \nimpacts everyone who needs emergency care. Our emergency rooms are \novercrowded. According to a recent study by the Washington chapter of \nthe American College of Emergency Room Physicians, 91 percent of small \nhospitals and 100 percent of large hospitals reported overcrowding.\n  In addition, 76 percent of large hospitals reported overcrowding 2 to \n3 times a week or more often.\n  In addition to problems in the emergency room, these unfair rates \nalso make it hard for us to recruit the new physicians we need to \nreplace those who are moving and retiring early.\n  I want to share with the Senate what Mike Glenn, the CEO of Olympic \nMedical Center in Port Angles, WA had to say on recruitment.\n  As he tries to attract doctors, he is finding that hospitals in other \nStates are offering twice the salaries he can offer.\n  He says:\n\n       Doctors in nearly every field are either fleeing our state \n     to earn higher salaries, or staying but with growing levels \n     of dissatisfaction and resentment.\n       Physician headhunter firms have targeted our state as \n     fertile ground to find doctors willing to pack up and leave \n     for positions in states benefitting from more Medicare \n     dollars.\n       If this situation is not quickly remedied, many Washington \n     communities will face critical shortages of physicians.\n       Imagine a trip to a hospital Emergency Room without \n     qualified ER doctors to provide life saving treatment, or \n     without anesthesiologists to staff the Operating Room.\n       This is not a doomsday scenario, but a logical consequence \n     of the current Medicare reimbursement system.\n\n  There is no denying that unfair Medicare rates are hurting patients \nand providers in Washington State.\n  Doctors are leaving our State or refusing to see new Medicare \npatients.\n  As a result, seniors cannot find doctors who will accept them.\n  Too often, those seniors end up in the emergency room in much worse \ncondition.\n  We cannot even dig ourselves out of this hole because the low \nreimbursement rates make it hard for us to recruit new doctors to \nWashington State\n  It is going to get worse.\n  As I mentioned earlier, in January, Medicare payments to doctors were \ncut by more than 5 percent.\n  They are expected to continue to decline in the next 3 years for a \ntotal decrease of 17 percent by 2005.\n  That is untenable. We need to do something about it.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush Administration does not acknowledge the \nseverity of the problem.\n  In April, Tom Scully, the administrator of CMS, told Washington \nseniors that ``access was not yet a serious problem.''\n  On Wednesday, I asked him about it at a hearing, and he said \nbasically the same thing: That it will be a problem, but it is not a \nserious problem today.\n  They do not get it.\n  CMS is not going to fix this.\n  The White House is not going to fix this.\n  The Office of Management and Budget is not going to fix this.\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\n  If we are going to fix this problem, we are going to have to do it \nright in the Senate.\n  That is why Senator Cantwell and I have introduced S. 2568, the \nMediFair Act.\n  The MediFair Act is designed to restore access and fairness to \nMedicare, and--in the process--help seniors, the disabled and all of \nour citizens.\n  This proposal is based on what I have heard from doctors, nurses, \nhospitals and patients over the past year.\n  Our bill has been endorsed by the Washington State Medical \nAssociation, the Washington State Hospital Association, and the \nWashington Nurses Association.\n  On the House side, companion legislation has been introduced.\n  It has the support of lead sponsor Adam Smith along with \nRepresentatives Dicks, McDermott, Baird, Inslee, and Larsen.\n  The MediFair Act is a starting point for eliminating the regional \ninequities in Medicare.\n  The bill will make the system more fair.\n  It will ensure that seniors are not penalized when they choose to \nretire in the State of Washington.\n  It will encourage more doctors to accept Medicare patients.\n  It will make it easier for us to recruit new doctors to our State.\n  And it will help our hospitals and home health agencies get the \nresources they need to care for our patients.\n  Let me explain my bill. The MediFair Act works to bring States up \nfrom the bottom of the reimbursement list.\n  The legislation would ensure that every State receives at least the \nnational average of per-patient spending.\n  The bill does not affect States that currently receive the national \naverage or just above the national average.\n  Further, our bill promotes efficient health care and healthy \noutcomes.\n  This is an area where we really need to correct the incentives.\n  Here is how Mike Glenn of the Olympic Medical Center put it:\n\n       The concern is not over 42 states receiving better Medicare \n     reimbursement than Washington, but over what is rewarded and \n     what is not.\n       Washington hospitals and physicians are proud of our record \n     of pioneering high quality, cost effective medicine. And we \n     do so by focusing on treatments that can help, while avoiding \n     overuse of treatments that cannot.\n       This style of medicine yields equal if not better patient \n     outcomes. Our reward for this is to be paid a fraction of our \n     actual costs.\n       To make matters worse, states who do not embrace our style \n     of cost effective care continue to demand and receive twice \n     as much funding from Medicare for no discernable difference \n     in patient outcomes.\n       The gap between the ``haves'' and the ``have-not States'' \n     is growing.\n       If Medicare does not change this--through action like the \n     MediFair bill--Washington hospitals in Medicare dependent \n     areas will enter into a death spiral until they are forced to \n     close their doors.\n\n  So our bill promotes the right things: efficient healthcare and \nhealthy outcomes. It will force States that receive inordinately high \npayments to improve the quality of their healthcare.\n  Payments would be reduced to those States, which do not realize \nhealthy outcomes--such as extending life expectancy or reducing rates \nof diabetes or heart disease.\n  Simply put, our bill finally holds states accountable for the health \ncare they provide with Medicare dollars.\n  Before I close, I want to answer just a few questions about my bill.\n  Some are concerned about the possible cost of fixing the inequities \nin Medicare.\n  I am, too.\n  But I also know that there is a high cost to doing nothing as seniors \nlose their doctors and their access to healthcare.\n  There is a cost to the community when seniors end up in-and-out of \nthe emergency room on a regular basis.\n  And of course, there is a human cost to the patients and their \nfamilies.\n  Another question I have heard is:\n  How will this bill attract support from Senators from high \nreimbursement states?\n  First, States that are using Medicare dollars efficiently and \neffectively don't need to be concerned.\n  Either way, I recognize that not everyone will embrace this specific \nlegislative proposal.\n  I want to find a solution that will help seniors get the care they \nneed, and I recognize that there may be different ways to approach the \nproblem.\n  This MediFair bill is a starting point. It's a way to draw attention \nto the problem and get folks to look at various solutions.\n  What matters is fixing the problem, so I welcome ideas and \nsuggestions from anyone who wants to help us solve this problem.\n  Finally, some of my colleagues may wonder how this bill fits into our \nefforts to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit, which is \nsomething I have worked to pass for several years.\n  We have introduced the ``Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of \n2002,'' of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Our work on prescription drugs should not keep us from fixing this \nfundamental problem.\n  After all, a prescription drug benefit isn't worth anything if there \naren't any doctors to write out a prescription. So both issues are \ncritical, and we need to move forward on both of them.\n  We need to fix these problems now--before another senior in my State \nloses her doctor--before another patient goes into cardiac arrest in \nthe emergency room because he could not find a doctor when his symptoms \nfirst appeared.\n  The system is unfair, and as Dr. Sam Cullison said, ``Sadly, it is \nthe Medicare patients themselves who are paying the price for this \ninequity.''\n  We can restore fairness to Medicare.\n  We can help patients get the medical access they need, and the \nMediFair Act is part of that process.\n  I invite my colleagues to talk with Senator Cantwell and me about how \nwe can move this or any other proposal forward.\n  I conclude by saying that this is a matter of critical national \nattention, and I am going to work every single day to educate our \nfellow Senators, who are also impacted. We have to do something about \nthis.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Everett Herald, June 4, 2002]\n\n            Murray's Medicare Plan a Step in Right Direction\n\n       Sen. Patty Murray has the right intention. She wants to \n     make Medicare work better for patients and health care \n     providers alike in this state.\n       Murray and the rest of the state's congressional Democrats \n     have united around a plan that would raise Medicare \n     reimbursements to health care providers in states where \n     payments are below the national average. Washington is among \n     the 10 lowest states in reimbursement rates, which actually \n     punish areas with relatively efficient health care systems.\n       Murray's Medi-Fair Act would remedy the inequity by raising \n     all payment rates to at least the national average and over \n     time, forcing improvements elsewhere. It's a good plan, but \n     one that is more likely to raise much-needed discussions \n     rather than solve the problem immediately.\n       The short-term political reality is that the potential \n     solutions run into a double-whammy. On one side, the Bush \n     administration appears determined to avoid domestic spending \n     increases--unless there is a high enough political gain, such \n     as with the farm bill. On the other side, major states--\n     including California, New York and Florida--aren't about to \n     help others address the equity issue unless their higher \n     Medicare reimbursements can be protected.\n       The best hope is that Murray and potential allies in both \n     parties, including Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa \n     (where reimbursement rates are the lowest of all), can raise \n     the level of discussion to the point that a solution becomes \n     politically necessary.\n       Certainly, for Medicare patients and aging baby-boomers who \n     will soon use the system, the need for action is becoming \n     increasingly serious. The inequities have been around for \n     years, but their effects have become more severe. In this \n     state, many doctors are now refusing to take new Medicare \n     patients because the reimbursements don't cover physicians' \n     costs. The problems extend beyond doctors, though, to other \n     providers.\n       For the entire health care system, the paper work \n     accompanying Medicare is also a serious issue. It aggravates \n     the low reimbursements here by running up the expenses in \n     medical offices. There is a need for a system that simplifies \n     administration, just as there is a need for a health care \n     system that provides broader access for all people, \n     regardless of age and income.\n       Action on reforming Medicare's inequities should not be \n     made to wait for such larger solutions. Medicare is America's \n     most significant achievement in assuring health care access. \n     Its erosion cannot be tolerated. Whatever the politics \n     obstacles to immediate action, the Murray initiative helps \n     bring forward the issue of massive inequities in \n     reimbursements. That's a step in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S5567]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n              [From the Bellingham Herald, June 12, 2002]\n\n                    ``Medifair'' Is Workable Answer\n\n       Our nation's Medicare system is so fraught with problems \n     that there is no single cure for what ails it. Recovery will \n     require multiple remedies over time. Still, U.S. Sen. Patty \n     Murray, D-Wash., took a healthy step toward a solution in \n     announcing her ``Medifair'' legislation last month.\n       Much lip service has been paid to addressing Medicare \n     issues, but Murray's bill, still in draft form, advances the \n     fight.\n       It's no secret that Washington state is at the low end of \n     the scale for reimbursements. That's more than evident in \n     Whatcom County, where the Family Care Network and Madrona \n     Medical groups have had to stop taking new Medicare patients \n     because they can't afford to treat them.\n       Despite the fact that everyone pays into the system at \n     equal rates, the doctors who treat them are not reimbursed at \n     the same rates. States like California and Florida receive \n     far higher payments than Washington, which is being penalized \n     for trying to contain medical costs. The current formula is \n     unfair to both the patients who pay into it and to the \n     health-care providers who treat them.\n       Murray's bill would require that every state receive at \n     least the national average for per-patient spending, which \n     was $5,490 in 2000. Washington received about $3,900 per \n     beneficiary in 2000, making it 42nd among the states in per \n     capita spending.\n       Under Murray's proposal, states that receive 105 percent of \n     the average could see cuts.\n       In reality, the bill will face very strong opposition and \n     will be difficult to pass. Big states will fight hard not to \n     have their reimbursements cut, and the formula could require \n     new revenue that won't be readily available.\n       The important thing is that Murray is getting the system on \n     the table for examination.\n       While Washington ranks near the bottom in reimbursements, \n     it ranks closer to the top in numbers of Medicare clients. \n     The federal plan covers about 750,000 seniors and disabled \n     people in this state, making it 18th in the nation in client \n     base, according to 1999 figures.\n       U.S. Rep. Rick Larsen, D-Arlington, has already announced \n     he's behind Murray's idea.\n       It's time for Washington's other members of Congress, on \n     both sides of the aisle, to join this fight and help \n     Washington be a leader in Medicare reform.\n\n               [From the Spokesman-Review, June 5, 2002]\n\n                 Murray's Bill Rights Medicare Inequity\n\n                           (By John Webster)\n\n       Unveiling a Medicare-enhancement bill the other day, U.S. \n     Sen. Patty Murray told an unsettling story: An elderly \n     constituent wearing a cast on her arm came up to Murray and \n     said that when the time came to get her cast removed, her \n     physician refused to see her because he recently had stopped \n     accepting Medicare patients.\n       Why would any member of the healing profession want to shun \n     Medicare, a major source of patients? Because, in Washington \n     state, Medicare's reimbursement rates are lousy and getting \n     worse.\n       That's why Murray introduced S. 2568, the MediFair Act of \n     2002. The bill would compel Medicare officials to correct a \n     reimbursement inequity.\n       The state medical association says this inequity has \n     created such financial difficulty that a growing number of \n     older physicians are throwing in the towel and retiring; \n     young physicians are moving to states other than Washington; \n     and, some Washington state physicians are deciding to stop \n     taking Medicare patients.\n       These are alarming trends for the residents of our state. \n     The problem is particularly troubling for Spokane. Here, \n     there is a sizable population of low-income and elderly \n     people who depend on Medicare. In addition, Spokane is a \n     regional center for advanced medical services--one of the \n     strongest sectors in our economy. Medicare is a leading \n     source of the health care industry's income; if it fails to \n     cover costs, that's a serious problem.\n       The reimbursement inequity has existed for years, but it is \n     getting progressively worse. When Medicare set its \n     reimbursement rates years ago, it built them on the status \n     quo, state by state. Medical care was more cost-efficient \n     here than in some states, so reimbursement rates here were \n     set at a lower level.\n       But as years went by, physicians have faced a accelerating \n     need to invest in high-tech equipment, which costs the same \n     everywhere. Medicare's rates left Washington's clinics with \n     less money to buy that technology, than doctors had in other \n     states.\n       On top of that, in 1997 Congress approved a series of cuts \n     in Medicare, to balance the federal budget. Ever since, \n     Medicare has been cutting physicians' reimbursement rates. \n     Doctors in less-efficient states with higher reimbursement \n     rates had leeway to adopt efficiencies and adjust. Not so, in \n     Washington, where rates are lower. By 2005, that 1997 budget \n     deal is scheduled to have cut reimbursement rates by 17 \n     percent.\n       As of 2000, Sen. Murray says, Medicare spent an average of \n     $3,921 on each Medicare beneficiary in Washington state. In \n     New York it spent $6,924. The national average was $5,490. \n     Washington's rate ranked 42nd in the nation.\n       This makes it tough for Washington to keep or recruit \n     physicians.\n       According to a survey by the Washington State Medical \n     Association, 57 percent of physicians are limiting or \n     dropping Medicare patients from their practice.\n       Murray's bill would require Social Security to correct the \n     inequity; in states such as Washington, Medicare would have \n     to raise reimbursement rates to the national average.\n       The proposal has the support of associations representing \n     the state's doctors, hospitals and nurses. Good for Sen. \n     Murray, for seeking a solution. The elderly depend on \n     Medicare, and they are counting on Congress to fix Medicare's \n     many ailments--including this one, which threatens the \n     stability of medical clinics as well as access to the \n     physicians that elderly people need.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, I will make a few remarks this morning \nin our remaining time regarding one of the issues before us. We, of \ncourse, have spent a good deal of time on emergencies over the last \nnumber of months, and properly so. We have had emergencies. Obviously, \nthe most compelling one has been terrorism and homeland defense.\n  In addition to that, we have talked about a number of other things. \nWe have had fires; agriculture, which we felt is something of an \nemergency; as well as health care, which the Senator from Washington \ntalked about. Indeed, most legislation that comes up is sort of deemed \nan emergency, at least in the view of the sponsor.\n  There is one thing which I think pretty clearly should be one of the \nmost important, something that will affect us over time and one that we \ncan avoid, which is the energy problem in our country. Probably nothing \ntouches more Americans than energy, whether it be electric energy or \ngasoline for one's automobile.\n  Finally, after a considerable amount of effort in both Houses, we do \nhave an energy bill that has passed both Houses. It is designed to give \nus an energy policy which we have not had for a very long time. \nObviously, there are differences between the House-passed bill and the \nSenate-passed bill. Both of them have many of the components that were \nput forth by the President and the Vice President early last year in \nterms of an energy policy. Yesterday, we had the appointment of a \nconference committee named by the House, and I am pleased with that \nbecause we will be able now to go forward in putting together these two \nbills and coming out with an energy policy for the United States.\n  I want to emphasize how important that is. We have seen some problems\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\nrecently in California, of course, and problems can occur in other \nplaces. We will likely see some this summer if we continue to have the \nheat we have had, and the demand for electric power. There will be some \nproblems, I suppose, relative to that.\n  We are seeking a policy that does several things. No. 1, it avoids \nhaving an energy crisis. There is no real need for that. We know what \nis needed. It is very simple to set forth what we have to have in the \nfuture. We are also seeking to try to do whatever we can. It is very \npossible to avoid overdependency on imported oil and fuel. We are now \n60 percent dependent on overseas countries for our oil supplies. These \nare our challenges.\n  In addition, an energy policy that looks forward to cleaner air and \nprotecting our environment is one everyone is committed to. There will \nbe great debate over ANWR and whether or not a small footprint on 19 \nmillion acres of a wildlife refuge in Alaska would be detrimental. That \nis yet to be decided.\n  However that turns out, there are things we have to do. One \nopportunity we have is to continue to make coal a cleaner resource. \nRegarding electric generation, 50 percent is generated by coal. That \nwill continue to grow, I suspect, and be a larger percentage over time. \nWe need to make sure we can make the coal-generated electricity as \nclean as possible. Our bill will provide for additional help with \nrespect to that. It is important we do that. Coal is probably the \nlargest energy resource we have available in the United States.\n  Regarding gas and oil, again, we have become very dependent on \nimports. We have great opportunities in this area in the continental \nUnited States, in Alaska and the West. We need to do that and be \nbalanced with the environment and production. We need access to public \nlands to do that. We will work on that.\n  We have an opportunity now to deal with one of the issues that \nimpacts, probably more than anything else in this country, our policy \non energy. We are ready to move with that. It needs to be balanced \nbetween renewables, production, environment, and usage. We can do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we are going to start voting at 9:35. We \nneed a roadmap to follow as to what we are going to do in the next 45 \nminutes with a variety of votes on matters that are related in some \ndegree, but mostly unrelated, to S. 2600, the terrorism insurance bill, \nthe subject of debate all day yesterday. We will be continuing with \nmatters that have to be dealt with before we get back to that bill. I \ntake a minute or so to express my sincere hope we will get back to that \nbill. I regret it is taking this long. We have been at this an awfully \nlong time.\n  We only dealt with two amendments yesterday that were relevant to the \nbill despite all the talk about this. There are people from the AFL-\nCIO, to business groups, developers, commercial interests, who would \nlike to see the bill adopted soon because of the inability of major \nprojects to move forward due to the unavailability of terrorism \ninsurance.\n  We have come a long way while waiting to get here. This is an \nimportant issue. The President indicated this, and the Secretary of the \nTreasury, and every organization I know of, with the exception of one \nor two, believe this is something we must do and should have done \nearlier. We will deal with some of the other matters, and I don't \nminimize the importance of them, but we are getting off track from the \nunderlying bill. The leader feels strongly about this, as do many \nMembers on both sides. We had some very fine speeches yesterday by \nMembers on both sides of the aisle in support of this underlying \nlegislation.\n  My hope is sooner, rather than later, we can adopt S. 2600.

Madam President, first, I thank the Senator from \nVirginia, Senator Allen, for bringing this matter to the floor. I was \nunavoidably detained yesterday. I had a lot of constituents from the \nGreater Des Moines Chamber of Commerce, about 140 Iowans, with whom I \nwas meeting as we concluded a very busy day to cap off their annual \nwork trip to Washington, D.C. Unfortunately, I was unable to be here in \nthe Chamber to assist and help my good friend from Virginia in offering \nthis amendment.\n  I personally thank the Senator from Virginia for filling in the gap \nyesterday and getting this amendment up on this bill. This is an issue \nthat needs to be addressed and I could not ask for a more dedicated and \nsteadfast ally than Senator Allen in helping pursue justice for all of \nthe innocent American victims of state-sponsored terrorism. This is an \nissue that must be addressed by this Congress.\n  That is why the bipartisan legislation Senator Allen and I introduced \nin April--the Terrorism Victim's Access to Compensation Act (S. 2134) \nand the amendment that Senator Allen joins me in offering here take two \nvery important steps. First, this amendment would require that \ncompensation be paid first and foremost from the blocked and frozen \nassets of the state sponsors of terrorism and their agents, not U.S. \ntaxpayers, in cases where American victims of terrorism secure a final \njudgment in our federal courts and are awarded compensation \naccordingly.\n  Second, this amendment provides a level playing field for all \nAmerican victims of state-sponsored terrorism who are pursuing redress \nin our federal courts and compensation from the blocked assets of state \nsponsors of terrorism, including their agencies and instrumentalities.\n\n  Madam President, we are united as Americans to meet the threat of \ninternational terrorism. This fight is being waged on many fronts, from \nthe mountains of Afghanistan to the borders and streets of America.\n  Even as we track down the terrorists and defend America, we must \nnever forget that terrorist acts are ultimately stories of human \ntragedy. We must never forget the victims.\n  I am talking about American victims like the dedicated, professional \nwoman from Waverly, IA, Kathryn Koob, who sought to build cross-\ncultural ties between the Iranian people and the American people only \nto be taken hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held captive for \n444 nightmarish days in Iran.\n  I am talking about American victims like Taleb Subh from LeClaire, \nIA, who, as a teenager, was visiting relatives in Kuwait and terrorized \nby Saddam Hussein and his troops at the outbreak of the Persian Gulf \nWar.\n\n[[Page S5569]]\n\n  These are two examples, but Americans in all 50 states have suffered. \nThat is why Senator Allen and I have joined together with 17 co-\nsponsors on both sides of the aisle to advance this legislation to \nensure that American victims of state-sponsored terrorism are justly \ncompensated for their pain, suffering, and losses.\n  Current law allows American citizens to sue terrorists for \ncompensation for their losses. Many Americans have won verdicts and \njudgments in our federal courts, yet have been unable to collect even \nthough the U.S. Treasury lawfully controls at least $3.7 billion in \nblocked or frozen assets of the seven foreign governments known to \nsponsor terrorism. Our own government has worked to prevent these \nfamilies from collecting. In fact, our own State Department and Justice \nDepartment have gone into federal court to single out and block the 52 \nAmericans held hostage in Iran and their families from even being able \nto pursue justice in our federal courts, let alone collect \ncompensation.\n  To be clear, current law only applies to terrorist states. At \npresent, seven foreign governments are officially designated by the \nU.S. State Department as state sponsors of terrorism. They are Iran, \nIraq, Libya, Syria, Sudan, North Korea, and Cuba. It is those state \nsponsors of international terrorism, not the American taxpayer, who \nmust be compelled to pay these costs first and foremost.\n  The Harkin-Allen Amendment sends a clear message to foreign \ngovernments that sponsor international terrorism: If you sponsor \nterrorism, if you attack innocent Americans, we will pursue you, we \nwill bring you to justice, and America will literally make you pay.\n  American victims of state-sponsored terrorism deserve to be \ncompensated for their pain, suffering, and losses by those terrorists \nwho sponsor and commit these terrible acts. The Congress should clear \nthe way for those with court-ordered judgments to be paid from blocked \nterrorist assets and, in so doing, deter future acts of state-sponsored \nterrorism against innocent Americans.\n  Again, I appreciate the Senator from Virginia taking the initiative \non this and getting this amendment up when I was unavoidably detained \nyesterday. I hope we have a resounding vote in favor of its passage.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to my good friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, this is \nreferred to as the Harkin-Allen amendment. I thank you for your great \nleadership. All of us have a lot of busy times around here, but we are \nteamed together for the victims who ought to get just compensation from \nthese terrorists.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his kindness and \ngenerosity and for propounding that unanimous consent request. He is a \ngentleman.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays on both amendments--I withdraw \nthat.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed for \nno more than 3 minutes on the Leahy-Hatch amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5569-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5569-S5573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TERRORIST BOMBINGS CONVENTION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Senator from Iowa has left the floor. \nI note he and the Senator from Virginia--we had attempted to move the \nHarkin-Allen amendment through the Judiciary Committee yesterday. There \nwas an objection to moving it, on the Republican side; otherwise, I \nwould think we could have had it on the floor as a freestanding matter.\n  We are considering the Leahy-Hatch substitute for the Terrorist \nBombing Convention. This bill brings the United States into immediate \ncompliance with two international conventions signed by the United \nStates. Both conventions were entered into after the terrorist bombings \nat the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. If anybody wants to know \nwhy these treaties are important, look at the news today, the horrific \ncar bombing outside the U.S. consulate in Karachi, Pakistan.\n  We grieve for the victims; we mourn with the families of the dead; \nand we pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. And, Mr. President, \nwe act. Not tomorrow--not next month--but today. We act to protect \nfuture victims. We act to punish future evil doers. We act to show that \nthe United States will lead the international community in the fight to \nend such terrorist bombings. That is precisely what my bill, S. 1770, \nand the Leahy-Hatch substitute does. Although I introduced this bill \nover six months ago, today's events should serve as a jolt to us all. \nThe time for delay and obstructionism and partisan bickering is over. \nIt is time to pass this bill.\n  I am pleased the Senate is considering the Leahy-Hatch substitute \namendment to S. 1770, the ``Terrorist Bombing Convention and \nSuppression of the Financing of Terrorism Convention Implementation \nActs of 2001.'' This bill will bring the United States into immediate \ncompliance with two important international conventions, which were \nsigned by the United States and transmitted to the United States Senate \nfor ratification by President Clinton. Both Conventions were entered \ninto after the terrorist bombings at the United States embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania.\n  Consideration of these important treaties was inexcusably delayed \nwhen the Senate was under Republican control, and passage of this \nimplementation legislation has been likewise blocked by an anonymous \nRepublican hold. As I urged in a statement on the floor of the Senate \non June 7, Republican obstructionism on this anti-terrorism legislation \nshould stop, the anonymous Republican hold on this bill should be \nlifted and this bill should pass.\n  The International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist \nBombings--``Bombing Convention''--was adopted by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly in December 1997 and signed by the United States in \nJanuary 1998. In September 1999, it was transmitted to the Senate by \nPresident Clinton for ratification, but no action was taken on this \ntreaty while the Senate remained under Republican control.\n  The International Convention for the Suppression of Financing \nTerrorism--``Financing Convention''--was adopted by the United Nations \nGeneral Assembly in December 1999 and signed by the United States in \nJanuary 2000. In October 2000, it was transmitted to the Senate by \nPresident Clinton for ratification, but, again, no action was taken on \nthis treaty while the Senate remained under Republican control.\n  When the Senate reorganized under a Democratic majority last summer, \nthe Foreign Relations Committee under the leadership of Chairman Biden \nmoved expeditiously to report these conventions to the full Senate. The \nantibombing treaty, in particular, sat in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee for approximately 2 years without action during the Clinton \nadministration when the Senate was under Republican control. Senator \nBiden deserves credit for acting quickly to report these treaties \nshortly after he assumed chairmanship of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Under the leadership of Majority Leader Daschle, the two \ntreaties were considered by the Senate, which gave its consent to \nratification by unanimous consent on December 5, 2001.\n  Yet even as Senator Biden and Majority Leader Daschle were pushing to \nmove the treaties themselves through the Senate, the Bush \nadministration did not transmit proposed implementing legislation to \nthe Judiciary Committee before or during the time that we were working \ntogether day and night to write the USA PATRIOT Act, the bipartisan \nantiterrorism legislation responding to the events of September 11. I \nremain puzzled why the administration felt that this measure should be \nseparated from that effort.\n  Both treaties require the signatory nations to enact certain, \nprecisely worded criminal provisions in their laws in order to be in \ncompliance. That is what S. 1770, the Leahy bill, does. I introduced S. \n1770, on December 5, 2001, shortly after passage of the USA Patriot \nAct, as a separate bill. This was the same day that the Senate agreed \nto ratify both treaties. I then tried to\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\nmove the bill quickly through the Senate, but an anonymous Republican \nhold blocked passage.\n  Again this year I tried to move the bill through the Senate, but \nagain there was an anonymous hold from the Republican side of the aisle \nwhich blocked its passage. Had there not been a hold placed on the bill \nlast year, I am quite sure that we could have resolved any remaining \nissues in conference, as the Republican-controlled House was \nsimultaneously passing its own version of my bill.\n  After the anonymous hold was placed on S. 1770 at the end of the last \nsession, we received a letter from the Department of Justice on January \n29, 2002, about the bill. The letter stated that the Department \n``support[ed] the legislation but recommend[ed] several \nmodifications.'' None of the modifications which the Department \nrecommended dealt with issues that were necessary for compliance with \nthe treaties, the basic purpose of the bill. The legislation I \noriginally introduced would bring this country into full compliance \nwith those important obligations and take away an excuse from nations \nthat are hesitant to cooperate in the war against terrorism.\n  The recent spate of horrible suicide bombings around the world and \nthe fact that the convention prohibiting terrorist financing entered \ninto force on April 10, 2002, demonstrate the pressing need for this \nlegislation. As if that was not enough, only last month the FBI \nDirector warned that he believes that suicide bombings in the United \nStates are ``inevitable,'' bringing home the point that this \nlegislation is required both to fight terrorism at home and abroad. \nNevertheless, S. 1770 has been subjected to an anonymous Republican \nhold since December of last year.\n  In the post-September 11 environment it is almost beyond my \nunderstanding why any Member of this body would secretly obstruct \npassage of an important piece of antiterrorism legislation--yet here we \nare in June, blocked from compliance with two international terrorism \ntreaties by a secret Republican hold. As the Administration has made \nclear, both Conventions are:\n\n     important to insure that all nations have in place laws to \n     enable full and effective international cooperation against \n     terrorism. By enacting this legislation, the United States \n     will be in a position to lead the cooperative effort against \n     terrorist bombings and terrorist finances.\n\nSee Statement of Administration Policy, December 19, 2001.\n  The legislation meets our obligations under the treaties in the \nfollowing ways. Both conventions require signatory nations to adopt \ncriminal laws prohibiting specified terrorist activities in order to \ncreate a regime of universal jurisdiction over certain crimes. Articles \n2 and 4 of the Bombing Convention require signatory countries to \ncriminalize the delivery, placement, discharge or detonation of \nexplosives and other lethal devices ``in, into, or against'' various \ndefined public places with the intent to kill, cause serious bodily \ninjury, or extensively damage such public places. The Bombing \nConvention also requires that signatories criminalize aiding and \nabetting, attempting, or conspiring to commit such crimes.\n  Articles 2 and 4 of the Financing Convention require signatory \ncountries to criminalize willfully ``providing or collecting'' funds, \ndirectly or indirectly, with knowledge that they are to be used to \ncarry out acts which either (1) violate nine enumerated existing \ntreaties, or (2) are aimed at killing or injuring civilians with the \npurpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government to do \nany act. The Financing Convention also requires that signatories \ncriminalize aiding and abetting, attempting, or conspiring to commit \nsuch crimes. Signatories must criminalize such acts under Article 2 \nwhether or not ``the funds were actually used to carry out'' such an \noffense.\n  Both conventions require that signatory nations exercise limited \nextraterritorial jurisdiction and extradite or prosecute those who \ncommit such crimes when found inside their borders. The conventions \nalso require that signatories ensure that, under their domestic laws, \npolitical, religious, ideological, racial or other similar \nconsiderations are not a justification for committing the enumerated \ncrimes. Thus, signatory nations will not be able to assert such bases \nto deny an extradition request for a covered crime. Finally, Article 4 \nof each convention requires that signatory states make the covered \noffenses ``punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account \nthe grave nature of [the] offenses.''\n  S. 1770 and the substitute amendment, consistent with the House \nversion of this bill, H.R. 3275, create two new crimes (one for \nbombings and another for financing terrorist acts) that track precisely \nthe language in the treaties, and bring the United States into \ncompliance. The legislation also provides extraterritorial jurisdiction \nas required by the conventions. Furthermore the bill creates domestic \njurisdiction for these crimes in limited situations where a national \ninterest is implicated, while excluding jurisdiction over acts where \nthe conventions do not require such jurisdiction and there is no \ndistinct federal interest served.\n  The bill, again consistent with the H.R. 3275, also contains \n``ancillary provisions'' that would make the two new crimes predicates \nfor money laundering and RICO charges, and for wiretaps. The two \nprovisions would also be subject to an 8-year statute of limitations \nand included as a ``federal crime of terrorism.'' Finally, civil asset \nforfeiture would be available for the new terrorism financing crime. \nExisting anti-terrorism crimes are predicates for each of these tools, \nand providing law enforcement with these ancillary provisions is both \nconsistent and appropriate.\n  Neither international convention requires a death penalty provision \nfor any covered crime. Indeed, the Department of Justice, in a \nmemorandum dated November 14, 2001 to the Subcommittee on Crime of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee, made amply clear that ``the death penalty is \nnot required by the Convention'' and would not be required to bring the \nUnited States into compliance. This should come as no surprise, given \ninternational sentiment opposing the United States' use of the death \npenalty in other contexts.\n  The inclusion of a death penalty provision in the implementing \nlegislation for these conventions could lead to complications in \nextraditing individuals to the United States from countries that do not \nemploy the death penalty. Therefore, unlike the House version of the \nimplementing legislation, the original Senate version of S. 1770 \ncontained no new death penalty provision.\n  The Administration's insistence on adding yet another death penalty \nto our federal criminal laws is especially inexplicable given the \ncontext of this implementing legislation. The chief purpose of the \nTerrorist Bombing Convention is to foster international cooperation and \ndecrease hurdles to extradition in terrorism cases. The United States, \nunderstandably, wants those who victimize its citizens around the world \nto be subject to trial and punishment in our own courts. Beyond that \npurpose, the legislation is largely duplicative of existing state and \nfederal laws.\n  Even in the recent terrorism context, however, where the desire to \nassist the United States is at its peak, our closest allies have balked \nor obstructed our prosecution efforts when the death penalty has been \nimplicated, wasting valuable time in our proactive efforts to prevent \nfuture attacks. For instance, according to press reports France offered \nlegal assistance to Zacarrias Moussaoui, the so-called ``20th \nHijacker,'' in part due to the decision to seek the death penalty in \nhis case. Spain also refused to extradite a highly dangerous group of \nterrorists to the United States based upon concerns about the death \npenalty, and a European Union raises similar concerns. This week the \nWashington Post reported that Germany also is refusing to fully \ncooperate in the prosecution of Moussaoui because the United States is \nseeking the death penalty in that case. In short, the primary purpose \nof this implementing legislation, fostering international cooperation, \nmay be defeated by the White House's insistence on the inclusion of a \ndeath penalty provision in this bill.\n  Nevertheless, at the insistence of the White House, the substitute \namendment would allow the government to seek the death penalty in \nbombing\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\ncases where death results, by reference to the existing death penalty \nprovision found in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332a, prohibiting the use of weapons \nof mass destruction.\n  Unlike H.R. 3275, the original Senate version of S. 1770 also did not \ncontain a third new crime for ``concealment'' of material support for \nterrorists. The Department of Justice conceded in the November, 2001, \nmemorandum that this provision was not necessary to bring the United \nStates into compliance with the conventions, stating, ``the concealment \noffense set forth in proposed 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339(c)(b) does not \ndirectly implement the Convention.'' Indeed, in the wake of the passage \nof new money laundering provisions in the USA PATRIOT Act, P.L. No. \n107-56, and due to the existence of a concealment crime under 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 2339A, with which the Department of Justice recently charged \nseveral people in New York, including a criminal defense attorney, such \nlegislation is largely duplicative of existing law. More problematic, \nhowever, is the fact that the House bill provided a lower mens rea \nrequirement than Sec. 2339A, an important change that was not \nhighlighted or explained in the Administration's accompanying \nmaterials.\n  The substitute amendment contains a new crime of concealment that \ntracks the existing mens rea requirements of Sec. 2339A, so that a \nlarge class of non terrorist related activity is not inadvertently \ncovered. This new crime would be punishable by ten years imprisonment.\n  Finally, the original Senate bill contained an important new tool for \ninternational cooperation between law enforcement which is not included \nin H.R. 3275 and has been deleted from the substitute amendment. \nCurrently, there is no clear statutory authority allowing domestic law \nenforcement agents to share Title III wiretap information with foreign \nlaw enforcement counterparts. This may create problems when, for \nexample, the DEA seeks to alert Colombian authorities that a cocaine \nshipment is about to leave a Colombian port but the information is \nderived from a Title III wiretap.\n  The original bill would have clarified the authority for sharing \nwiretap derived information, specifically in the Title III context. The \nbill provided a clear mechanism through which law enforcement could \nshare wiretap information with foreign law enforcement, while at the \nsame time ensuring that there are appropriate safeguards to protect \nthis sensitive information against misuse. It added a subsection to 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 2517, permitting disclosure of wiretap information to \nforeign officials (1) with judicial approval, (2) in such a manner and \nunder such conditions as a court may direct, and (3) consistent with \nAttorney General guidelines on how the information may be used to \nprotect confidentiality. Unfortunately, due to the White House's \nobjection, the substitute removes it from the bill.\n  I am pleased that obstructing has stopped on this important \nimplementing legislation for two anti-terrorism treaties that are \nintended to increase protections for our national security by enhancing \ninternational cooperation in the fight against terrorism.\n  I ask unanimous consent for the substitute to be printed in its \nentirety the record at the conclusion of my remarks along with the \nsectional analysis including a summary of the changes made by the \nsubstitute to the original bill.\n\n Anti-Terrorism Conventions Implementation--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n               TITLE I--Suppression of Terrorist Bombings\n\n       Title I of this bill implements the International \n     Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings, which \n     was signed by the United States on January 12, 1998, and was \n     transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification on September 8, 1999. Twenty-eight States are \n     currently party to the Convention, which entered into force \n     internationally on May 23, 2001. The Convention requires \n     State Parties to combat terrorism by criminalizing certain \n     attacks on public places committed with explosives or other \n     lethal devices, including biological, chemical and \n     radiological devices. The Convention also requires that State \n     Parties criminalize aiding and abetting, conspiring and \n     attempting to undertake such terrorist attacks.\n     Section 101. Short Title\n       Section 101 provides that title I may be cited as ``The \n     Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act of 2001.''\n     Section 102. Bombing Statute\n       Section 102 adds a new section to the Federal criminal \n     code, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332f and entitled \n     ``Bombings of places of public use, government facilities, \n     public transportation systems and infrastructure \n     facilities,'' which makes terrorist acts covered by the \n     Convention a crime. New section 2332f supplements and does \n     not supplant existing Federal and State laws, and contains \n     five subsections, which are described below.\n       Subsection (a) makes it a crime to unlawfully place or \n     detonate an explosive in certain public places and facilities \n     with the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury, or \n     with the intent to cause extensive destruction, where such \n     destruction results in, or is likely to result in, major \n     economic loss. Conspiracies and attempts to commit such \n     crimes are also criminalized. This provision implements \n     Article 2, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of the Convention.\n       Inclusion of the term ``unlawfully'' in subsection (a), \n     which is mirrored in Article 2 of the Convention defining the \n     offenses, is intended to allow what would be considered under \n     U.S. law as common law defenses. For purposes of subsection \n     (a), whether a person acts ``unlawfully'' will depend on \n     whether he is acting within the scope of authority recognized \n     under and consistent with existing U.S. law, which reflects \n     international law principles, such as self defense or lawful \n     use of force by police authorities. This language is not to \n     be construed as permitting the assertion, as a defense to \n     prosecution under new section 2332f, that a person \n     purportedly acted under authority conveyed by any particular \n     foreign government or official. Such a construction, which \n     would exempt State-sponsored terrorism, would be clearly at \n     odds with the purpose of the Convention and this implementing \n     legislation.\n       With respect to the mens rea provision of subsection (a), \n     it is sufficient if the intent is to significantly damage the \n     targeted public place or facility. Further, for the purpose \n     of subsection (a), when determining whether the act resulted \n     in, or was likely to result in, major economic loss, the \n     physical damage to the targeted place or facility may be \n     considered, as well as other types of economic loss \n     including, but not limited to, the monetary loss or other \n     adverse effects resulting from the interruption of its \n     activities. The adverse effects on non- targeted entities and \n     individuals, the economy and the government may also be \n     considered in this determination insofar as they are due to \n     the destruction caused by the unlawful act.\n       Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdictional bases for the \n     covered offenses and includes jurisdiction over perpetrators \n     of offenses abroad who are subsequently found within the \n     United States. This provision implements a crucial element of \n     the Convention (Article 8(1)), which requires all State \n     Parties to either extradite or prosecute perpetrators of \n     offenses covered by the Convention who are found within the \n     jurisdiction of a State Party. While current Federal or State \n     criminal laws encompass all the activity prohibited by the \n     Convention that occurs within the United States, subsection \n     (b)(1) ensures Federal jurisdiction where there is a unique \n     Federal interest, e.g., a foreign government is the victim of \n     the crime or the offense is committed in an attempt to compel \n     the United States to do or abstain from doing any act.\n       Subsection (c) establishes the penalties for committing the \n     covered crimes at any term of years or life. This provision \n     differs from the Administration proposal, which sought to add \n     a new death penalty provision for this crime, despite the \n     fact that such a provision is not required for compliance \n     under the Convention and may create hurdles in seeking \n     extradition to the United States under this statute.\n       Subsection (d) sets forth certain exemptions to \n     jurisdiction as provided by the Convention. Specifically, the \n     subsection exempts from jurisdiction activities of armed \n     forces during an armed conflict and activities undertaken by \n     military forces of a State in the exercise of their official \n     duties.\n       Subsection (e) contains definitions of twelve terms that \n     are used in the new law. Six of those definitions (``State or \n     government facility,'' ``infrastructure facility,'' ``place \n     of public use,'' ``public transportation system,'' ``other \n     lethal device,'' and ``military forces of a State'') are the \n     same definitions used in the Convention. Four additional \n     definitions (``serious bodily injury,'' ``explosive,'' \n     ``national of the United States,'' and ``intergovernmental \n     organization'') are definitions that already exist in other \n     U.S. statutes. One of those definitions (``armed conflict'') \n     is defined consistent with an international instrument \n     relating to the law of war, and a U.S. Understanding to the \n     Convention that is recommended to be made at the time of U.S. \n     ratification. The final term (``State'') has the same meaning \n     as that term has under international law.\n     Section 103. Effective Date\n       Since the purpose of Title I is to implement the \n     Convention, section 103 provides that the new criminal \n     offense created in Section 102 will not become effective \n     until the date that the Convention enters into force in the \n     United States. This will ensure immediate compliance of the \n     United States with its obligations under the Convention.\n\n\n          Title II--Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism\n\n       Title II implements the International Convention for the \n     Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, which was signed \n     by the United States on January 10, 2000, and was\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\n     transmitted to the Senate for its advice and consent to \n     ratification on October 12, 2000. The Convention is not yet \n     in force internationally, but will enter into force 30 days \n     after the deposit of the 22nd instrument of ratification with \n     the U.N. Secretary-General. Once in force, the Convention \n     requires State Parties to combat terrorism by criminalizing \n     certain financial transactions made in furtherance of various \n     terrorist activities. The Convention also requires that State \n     Parties criminalize conspiracies and attempts to undertake \n     such financing.\n     Section 201. Short Title\n       Section 201 provides that title II may be cited as ``The \n     Suppression of Financing of Terrorism Convention \n     Implementation Act of 2001.''\n     Section 202. Terrorism Financing Statute\n       Section 202(a) adds a new section to the Federal criminal \n     code, to be codified at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C and entitled \n     ``Prohibitions against the financing of terrorism,'' which \n     makes financial acts covered by the Convention a crime. New \n     section 2339C supplements and does not supplant existing \n     Federal and State laws, and contains five subsections, which \n     are described below.\n       Subsection (a) makes it a crime to provide or collect funds \n     with the intention or knowledge that such funds are to be \n     used to carry out certain terrorist acts. Conspiracies and \n     attempts to commit these crimes are also criminalized. This \n     subsection implements Article 2, paragraphs 1, 3, 4 and 5 of \n     the Convention.\n       Subsection (b) establishes the jurisdictional bases for the \n     covered offenses under section 2339C(a) and includes \n     jurisdiction over perpetrators of offenses abroad who are \n     subsequently found within the United States. This provision \n     implements a crucial element of the Convention (Article 10), \n     which requires all State Parties to either extradite or \n     prosecute perpetrators of offenses covered by the Convention \n     who are found within the territory of a State Party. \n     The structure of this provision is designed to accommodate \n     the structure of the Convention, which sets forth both \n     mandatory and permissive bases of jurisdiction, and \n     excludes certain offenses that lack an international \n     nexus. Some portions of this provision go beyond the \n     jurisdictional bases required or expressly permitted under \n     the Convention, however, where expanded jurisdiction is \n     desirable from a policy perspective because a unique \n     Federal interest is implicated and is consistent with the \n     Constitution.\n       Subsection (c) establishes the penalties for committing the \n     covered crimes at imprisonment for not more than 20 years, a \n     fine under title 18, United States Code, or both. This \n     penalty is consistent with the current penalties for money \n     laundering offenses. See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1956.\n       Subsection (d) contains 13 definitions of terms that are \n     used in the new law. Two of those definitions (``government \n     facility,'' and ``proceeds'') are the same definitions used \n     in the Convention. The definition for ``funds'' is identical \n     to that contained in the Convention with the exception that \n     coins and currency are expressly mentioned as money. The \n     definitions for ``provides'' and ``collects'' reflect the \n     broad scope of the Convention. The definition for ``predicate \n     acts'' specifies the activity for which the funds were being \n     provided or collected. These are the acts referred to in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 2339C(a)(1). The \n     definition of ``treaty'' sets forth the nine international \n     conventions dealing with counter-terrorism found in the Annex \n     to the Convention. The term ``intergovernmental \n     organization,'' which is used in the Convention, is \n     specifically defined to make clear that it contains within \n     its ambit existing international organizations. The \n     definitions for ``international organization,'' ``serious \n     bodily injury,'' and ``national of the United States'' \n     incorporate definitions for those terms that already exist in \n     other U.S. statutes. One of the definitions (``armed \n     conflict'') is defined consistent with international \n     instruments relating to the law of war. The final term \n     (``State'') has the same meaning as that term has under \n     international law.\n       Subsection (e) creates a civil penalty of at least $10,000 \n     payable to the United States, against any legal entity in the \n     United States, if any person responsible for the management \n     or control of that legal entity has, in that capacity, \n     committed an offense set forth in subsection (a) of the new \n     section 2339C. This civil penalty may be imposed regardless \n     of whether there is a conviction of such person under \n     subsection (a), and is in addition to any other criminal, \n     civil, or administrative liability or penalty allowable under \n     United States law. Subsection (e) fulfills Article 5 of the \n     Convention.\n     Section 203. Effective Date\n       Section 203 provides that those provisions of the Act that \n     may be implemented immediately shall become effective upon \n     enactment. However, two jurisdictional provisions will not \n     become effective until the Financing Convention enters into \n     force for the United States. Those provisions are the new 18 \n     U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2339C(b)(1)(D) and (2)(B). In addition, new \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C(d)(7)(I), which is a definitional \n     section specifically linked to the Bombing Convention, will \n     not become effective until that Convention enters into \n     effect.\n\n\n                     TITLE III--Ancillary Measures\n\n       Title III, which is not required by the International \n     Conventions but will assist in federal enforcement, adds the \n     new 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2332f and 2339C to several existing \n     provisions of law.\n     Section 301. Ancillary Measures\n       Sections 2332f and 2339C are made predicates under the \n     wiretap statute (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2516(1)(q)) and under the \n     statute relating to the provision of material support to \n     terrorists (18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339A). Sections 2332f and 2339C \n     are also added to those offenses defined as a ``Federal crime \n     of terrorism'' under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2332b(g)(5)(B), as \n     amended by the USA PATRIOT Act. P.L. No. 107-56. In addition, \n     a provision is added to the civil asset forfeiture statute \n     that makes this tool available in the case of a violation of \n     18 U.S.C. Sec. 2339C. These provisions are consistent with \n     the treatment of similar Federal crimes already in existence.\n\n\n           TITLE IV--Foreign Disclosure of Wiretap Intercepts\n\n       This provision, which is not required by the International \n     Conventions, clarifies that Federal law enforcement \n     authorities may disclose otherwise confidential wiretap \n     information to their foreign counterparts with appropriate \n     judicial approval. This provision is intended to ensure \n     effective cooperation between domestic and foreign law \n     enforcement in the investigation and prosecution of \n     international criminal organizations.\n     Section 401. Short Title\n       Section 401 provides that title IV may be cited as ``The \n     Foreign Law Enforcement Cooperation Act of 2001.''\n     Section 402. Amendment to Wiretap Statute\n       Section 402 adds a new subsection to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2517 \n     that governs the disclosure of otherwise confidential \n     information gathered pursuant to a Title III wiretap. This \n     provision clarifies the authority of domestic law enforcement \n     officers to disclose such information as may show a violation \n     of either domestic or foreign criminal law to foreign law \n     enforcement officials. The provision requires a court order \n     prior to making such a disclosure and sets the standards for \n     the issuance of such an order. It is intended to allow \n     foreign disclosure only to enforce the criminal laws of \n     either the United States or the foreign nation. It also \n     requires that an attorney for the government certify that the \n     foreign officials who are to receive the wiretap information \n     have been informed of the Attorney General's guidelines \n     protecting confidentiality. This provision is intended to \n     enhance the ability of domestic law enforcement to work with \n     their foreign counterparts to investigate international \n     criminal activity at the same time as protecting against \n     improper use of such wiretap information.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we must act. The United States must lead \nthe international community in the fight to end such terrorist \nbombings. This is precisely what the Leahy-Hatch substitute does. We \nhave been trying to pass this legislation for 6 months. We have been \ntrying to clear it. We have been involved with the White House to reach \na consensus.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for his work, and the White House. We have \nworked out the whole matter with the White House and with Senators. I \nurge its passage. I urge its passage with as large a vote as possible.\n  I yield the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in support of H.R. 3275. I am very \npleased that the Senate is considering this valuable legislation which \nwould make the United States compliant with two very important \ntreaties.\n  I believe one of our most significant duties, as the United States \nSenate, is the consideration of treaties for ratification. We alone \nhave the responsibility to give advice and consent to international \nunderstandings and agreements made by the executive branch of our \nGovernment.\n  The two treaties this legislation addresses are part of a nearly \nfour-decade process of conventions considering acts of terrorism. As we \ndebate this legislation, we are examining long-term global means to \naddress the threat of terrorism. The Convention on the Suppression of \nTerrorist Bombings and the Convention for the Suppression of the \nFinancing of Terrorism require the United States and any country \nadopting the treaties to criminalize terrorist bombings and to \ncriminalize direct or indirect financing of terrorist acts.\n  The Financing Convention addresses some of the issues we worked on \nlast year. The Senate has already approved antiterrorism legislation \nthat included provisions dealing with money laundering issues which \nhelp deter and punish terrorist acts and would enhance law enforcement \ninvestigatory tools. The legislation established rule-making procedures \nfor the U.S. Treasury, clarified guidelines for international banking, \nand maintained accountability considerations for individuals and \nfinancial institutions. I believe it is imperative that we continue to \naddress terrorist financing domestically as well as internationally. In \nresponse to requests by the United States, countries throughout the \nworld began the\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\nsearch for terrorists' financial assets. The freezing of these assets \nis a first step to the eradication of global terrorist organizations.\n  On September 28 of last year, the United Nations Security Council \nadopted Resolution 1373 which established a set of legally binding \nobligations for each member nation. Now, this is quite significant \nbecause there are not a lot of legally binding resolutions considered \nby the Security Council. Resolution 1373 requires each nation to \nprevent the financing of terrorism, deny safe haven to terrorists, and \nincrease cooperation and information sharing in these efforts. \nResolution 1373, which passed with our support, also directs nations to \nratify all outstanding terrorism related conventions.\n  Nations, both allies and former adversaries, overwhelmingly acted to \nsign, ratify, and become compliant with a number of terrorism \nconventions. It has taken the United States nearly 9 months to do so. \nThe Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on these treaties \nlast October and approved them in November. The full Senate ratified \nthe treaties in December.\n  Now, most people might think that once the Senate gives its advice \nand consent to a treaty, it is ratified and the United States is full \nparty to the agreement. This could only be seen as a ``virtual'' \nratification. It is not, however, until the United States is fully \ncompliant with the treaty that the President can deposit our articles \nof ratification and we become full treaty members.\n  It is this last step where the Senate faltered. We had the House \napproved implementing legislation last December. We are only now, in \nJune, contemplating its passage. We cannot drag our feet any longer.\n  Today we are considering implementing language. We are ready to vote. \nWe are ready to make the United States compliant with important \ntreaties that can help us fight against terrorism. The amendment \nlanguage is identical to the version passed by the House in December. \nIt is the right language, the appropriate language and should pass the \nSenate today.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, support the \nfight against terrorism, and support making the United States compliant \nto these two valuable international agreements.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I rise today to oppose a provision in \nH.R. 3275, the Terrorist Bombings Convention Implementation Act, and \nthe proposed Leahy-Hatch amendment to S. 1770, the Senate version of \nthis implementing legislation, which would authorize the use of the \ndeath penalty by the Federal Government.\n  This bill seeks to implement into Federal law the obligations of the \nUnited States under the International Convention for the Suppression of \nTerrorist Bombings and the International Convention for the Suppression \nof the Financing of Terrorism. The U.S. signed these conventions, which \nwere later ratified by the Senate on December 5, 2001. These two \nconventions are vital to our efforts to fight terrorism. These \nconventions will fill an important gap in international law by \nexpanding the legal framework for international cooperation in the \ninvestigation, prosecution, and extradition of persons who engage in \nbombings and financially support terrorist organizations. Both \nconventions require participating countries to pass specific criminal \nlaws to implement those nations' obligations under the conventions.\n  But while these conventions do not require a death penalty, the House \nbill and the proposed amendment to the Senate bill would authorize the \nuse of the death penalty by the United States. Not only do I oppose the \nexpansion of the Federal death penalty at a time when Americans are \nquestioning the fairness of the administration of this punishment, but \nI also fear that expanding the Federal death penalty through this \nimplementing legislation will undermine our fight against terrorism.\n  I fear that the inclusion of a death penalty could actually thwart \nthe purpose of these conventions. Instead of encouraging international \ncooperation in the fight against terrorism, this implementing \nlegislation threatens to hamper international cooperation to prevent \nand punish terrorist bombings and financing of terrorist organizations. \nMany nations, including our closest allies in the fight against \nterrorism, may refuse to extradite suspects to nations where those \nsuspects will face the death penalty. Already our allies like France \nand Germany have expressed their concerns about extraditing individuals \nor sharing information concerning al-Qaeda suspects out of concern that \nthe United States will seek the death penalty against suspected \nterrorists. As this experience obviously shows, it doesn't serve the \ncause of justice, peace, or freedom to include a death penalty \nprovision in this important bill.\n  Moreover, this is not the time to expand the Federal death penalty. \nAmericans are increasingly recognizing that the current death penalty \nsystem is broken, and risks executing the innocent or applying the \nultimate punishment disproportionately to those who may live in the \n``wrong'' part of the country, have the ``wrong'' color skin, or just \nnot have the money to pay for a ``dream team'' defense.\n  These problems plague the integrity of the justice system at the \nstate and federal levels. A report released by the Justice Department \nin September 2000 showed troubling racial and geographic disparities in \nthe administration of the federal death penalty. The color of a \ndefendant's skin or the federal district in which the prosecution takes \nplace can affect whether a defendant lives or dies in the federal \nsystem. Former Attorney General Janet Reno ordered a further analysis \nof why these disparities exist. And Attorney General Ashcroft has \nagreed to continue this study.\n  We have not yet seen the results of this study, nor have we had the \nopportunity to review and understand what the results might mean for \nthe fairness and integrity of our federal justice system. While this \nimportant study is underway, Congress should not create even more \ndeath-eligible crimes.\n  As Governor George Ryan of Illinois said at a hearing I held on June \n12th in the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution on the \nreport of the Illinois Governor's Commission on Capital Punishment, \n``especially after September 11, . . . the United States must be a \nmodel for the rest of the world. And that means our justice system \nshould be the glowing example for the pursuit of truth and justice. It \nmust be fair and compassionate.''\n  There is no question that we should prosecute and punish severely \nthose responsible for the horrific attacks on our nation on September \n11th or those who may plan or perpetrate acts of terror in the future. \nBut I am very concerned that the bill's provision for the death penalty \nagainst suspected terrorists could undermine the purpose of the \nconventions and our ability to seek vital information and cooperation \nfrom other nations. I fear that the death penalty provision will \nweaken, not strengthen, our hand in pursuing terrorists, especially our \nglobal efforts to bring alleged terrorists to justice and to prevent \nfuture acts of terror.\n  For these reasons, I cannot in good conscience support H.R. 3275, the \nproposed Leahy substitute amendment to H.R. 3275, the proposed Leahy-\nHatch amendment to S. 1770, or S. 1770, if the amendment should be \nadopted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5573-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, a few minutes ago, prior to the vote we \nhave just now taken, I asked unanimous consent to set aside the \nBrownback and Ensign amendments, and that was not agreed to. It is now \nmy intention to file a cloture motion on the bill, and I ask that the \ncloture motion be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close the debate on Calendar No. \n     410, S. 2600, the terrorism insurance bill:\n         Harry Reid, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Jean Carnahan, \n           Charles Schumer, Kent Conrad, Tom Daschle, Richard \n           Durbin, Jack Reed, Byron L. Dorgan, Christopher J. \n           Dodd, Debbie Stabenow, Jay Rockefeller, Maria Cantwell, \n           Jeff Bingaman, Daniel K. Akaka, Evan Bayh, Joseph \n           Lieberman.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we will announce the time of the cloture \nvote which will, of course, occur on Tuesday morning, but I do hope \nSenators who are interested in the bill at the very least will express \nthemselves today and on Monday. We will be in session on Monday.\n  I hope we can achieve cloture on the terrorism bill. Of course, that \nis still accommodating Senators who wish to offer amendments for a 30-\nhour period following the cloture vote should it be successful.\n  Senator Lott and I have just been discussing the schedule for the \nremainder of the week. Once we have completed our work on the terrorism \ninsurance bill, it will be my intention to move to the Defense \nauthorization bill. I do not think that will take a motion to proceed, \nbut certainly one will be offered if it is required. We will be on that \nfor the remainder of the week and for whatever length of time it will \ntake in the following week.\n  Senators should be reminded that we only have 2 weeks to go in this \nwork period. We are hopeful we can accommodate a number of nominations \nand a lot of other work besides the Defense authorization bill and the \nterrorism insurance bill. At the very least, we are going to finish \nthose two pieces of legislation prior to the time we leave.\n  I will announce later today the time for the vote on cloture, but it \nwill be Tuesday morning. I urge my colleagues to be present for that \nvote. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the distinguished majority leader \nyield? I want to clarify again that the majority leader does not \nanticipate recorded votes on Monday, even though we will be in session \nfor debate and for, I guess, amendments to be offered; is that correct?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The distinguished Republican leader is correct. Earlier \nhe may recall that we announced some no-vote Mondays. This particular \nMonday is one of the no-vote Mondays, so-called, so I am going to \nrespect that commitment. Senators have made scheduling decisions. \nCertainly we will be in session. As I say, it will be an opportunity \nfor people to come to the floor to speak to the bill.\n  It is unfortunate we have not been able to get agreement to set the \namendments aside because I think it would offer other Senators the \nchance to offer additional amendments. Barring that UC, we will expect \nto be in session without the additional consideration of other \namendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I can continue, I certainly understand \nand support the decision to identify certain dates for a variety of \nreasons when Senators are aware there will not be votes, but I \nemphasize again, as the majority leader has, it does not mean we cannot \nbe in session and get a lot of work done.\n  Also, I understand why Senator Daschle feels a necessity to file \ncloture. Obviously, we discourage each other from doing that, but in \norder to move forward after a reasonable period of time--I have done it \nmany times on this terrorism insurance issue, while there are some \nother amendments, hopefully germane amendments, that will and can be \noffered and debated and\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nconsidered, in order to get to the Defense authorization bill and \ncomplete our work before the Fourth of July recess, we need to complete \nthis bill in a reasonable period of time--Tuesday or Wednesday--and \nthen go right to Defense authorization.\n  I commend the Senator for making that decision. There are a lot of \nother bills Senators on both sides are pushing the majority leader to \ndo, meritorious or otherwise. This is very important.\n\n  I encourage Senators on both sides of the aisle, when we get to the \nDefense authorization bill, let's not use this as a grab bag. We have \nlots we need to do in this area. We are talking about a pay raise for \nour military men and women. We are talking about quality-of-life \nissues. We are talking about basic decisions about the future of our \ndefense for our country. There will be plenty other opportunities to \noffer unrelated, nongermane amendments.\n  I believe Senator Warner and Senator Levin will be ready to go. There \nwill be disagreements and heated debate on some of the amendments. Some \nwill take time. I believe the managers are ready to go and will make \ngood progress on it and be assured we can get it done without it being \nvery messy.\n  I appreciate the decision Senator Daschle has made. I think it is the \nright thing for the Senate, for the military, and for our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator as always for his \ncooperation. This is an important schedule. We know we have to finish \nthe work on terrorism insurance. We know we have to deal with the \nDefense authorization bill. The Senator from Virginia and the Senator \nfrom Michigan have been ready to go for a couple of weeks. It should be \na good debate.\n  I also agree with the distinguished Republican leader that this \nshould not be the grab bag, this should not be the vehicle that \nattracts extraneous legislation. Let's get it done and done cleanly and \nmove on to other matters that are important as well.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to make one other point, if I can be \nrecognized in my own right, before Senator Warner leaves. Senator \nDaschle and I have also been talking about ways to move forward on \nnominations. Hopefully, we are coming up with a process that will allow \nus to make good progress across the board on nominations in the next \ncouple of weeks. I am looking forward to continuing work on that also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the members of the Armed \nServices Committee, I thank both of our leaders for recognizing the \nneed to move to the Defense authorization bill. That hopefully will \nthen set the stage for the Defense appropriations bill to follow in an \norderly manner.\n  Just moments ago, the chairman of our committee, the Senator from \nMichigan, Mr. Levin, and I conferred with the leadership. I think I can \nspeak on behalf of the chairman that we are both ready to go, and we \nwill be prepared to bring up some of the more, should we say, \ncontroversial amendments early on so that those issues can be addressed \nand hopefully thereafter we can move quickly through the other \nprovisions of the bill.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of this \nlegislation and wish to praise my Connecticut colleague, Senator Dodd, \nfor his diligence in crafting a workable solution to the terror \ninsurance issue. As we all know, this has been a frustrating process \nand Senator Dodd has proven to be tenacious in the quest to enact this \nlegislation into law. He is performing a valuable and mostly unsung \npublic service.\n  Let me explain why -I believe this issue is so important and why \nSenator Dodd's work is so important.\n  As part of their property and casualty insurance, many businesses \nhave insurance against the costs that arise if their business is \ninterrupted. If we don't pass an effective terror insurance bill, there \nwill be a massive interruption in the business community. We can avoid \nthis result by passing this legislation.\n  Property and casualty insurance is not optional for most businesses. \nNot every business owner buy life insurance, but nearly every business \nbuys property and casualty insurance--to protect its property, to \nprotect it against liability, and to protect its employees under the \nState workers compensation laws. Property and casualty insurance is \nrequired by investors and shareholders. It is required by banks that \nlend for construction and other projects.\n  We all know that home mortgage companies require the homeowners to \nmaintain homeowners property insurance, and it's the same with business \nlending.\n  Maintaining property and casualty insurance is mandated as part of \nthe fiduciary obligation to the business. And if property and casualty \ninsurance for major causes of loss is not available, or it is \nprohibitively expensive, businesses face a difficult choice about going \nforward with construction projects, and other ventures. If no insurance \nis available, banks won't lend and the business activity that is \ndepending on the loans will stop. The impact on the real estate, \nenergy, construction, and transportation sectors will be severe.\n  For their part, insurance companies must be able to ``underwrite'' \ntheir policies. This means that they need to be able to assess their \nexposure or risk of a claim. They need to know if their exposure to \nclaims is acceptable, excessive, or indeterminate. In the case of \nclaims for damages caused by terror attacks, there is not way to assess \ntheir risk and no way to underwrite the policy. There are too many \nuncertainties.\n  One thing that is certain, as it was not before September 11, is that \nlosses from terrorist acts can cost tens of billions of dollars. In \nfact, under the worst-case scenarios, losses could easily reach \nhundreds of billions of dollars.\n  There are hundreds of insurers in any given market. It is a highly \ncompetitive industry. But these insurers are dependent on reinsurers \nwho help insurance companies spread their risk. When reinsurers will \nnot renew their contracts unless they contain terrorism exclusions or \nlimitations, many if not most of the insurance companies will not be \nable to provide terrorism coverage--at any cost.\n  Insurance companies need reinsurance because their own capital to \ncover losses is finite.\n  Even a good sized company--one that would be in the top half dozen or \nso commercial insurers in the U.S.--with perhaps 5 percent of the \ncommercial lines market and capital of $7 or $8 billion--would have to \nask, do we want to roll the dice on our very survival by writing \nterrorism coverage and covering it with our own reserves?\n  That is not a risk that an insurance company will take. If we do not \npass this legislation, therefore, insurers will take whatever steps \nthey consider necessary to ensure they do not drive themselves into \nbankruptcy.\n  The insurance industry can protect itself by reducing its exposure to \nterrorism claims. There is nothing we can do in the Congress--within \nthe limits of our Constitution--to require insurance companies to write \npolicies. They don't have to write policies. If they don't write \npolicies, or write them only with extraordinary premiums for terror \ncoverage, the companies may not be as profitable in the short run, but \nthey will at least be protecting themselves against involvency.\n  State regulators are already considering terrorism exclusions--as \nthey should do, consistent with their responsibilities to oversee the \nsolvency of the insurance industry. Absent exclusions, in states where \nthey might not be approved for one reason or another, the insurers will \nhave no choice but to limit their business.\n  If insurance companies are permitted to write policies with no \ncoverage for claims connected to terrorism, then businesses will have \nto decide if they will self-insure against these losses. Many of them \nwill conclude that they cannot accept this exposure.\n  Therefore, if we fail to pass this legislation, it will be everyone \nthat the insurance companies they insure that loses. Insurance \ncompanies can protect themselves by not writing policies, or writing \nonly policies without any coverage for acts of terror, or writing \npolicies with extraordinary premiums. But companies that need insurance \ncoverage may have even harsher options.\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\n  So, the issue is how we enable enough insurance companies to \ndetermine that the risk of terrorist claims is a risk that they can \nassume.\n  That is what this legislation is all about--defining the risk so that \ninsurers can assess and put a price on it. This legislation is about \nfacilitating insurance companies' ability to continue to write property \nand casualty insurance policies. It is about providing business owners \nwith the opportunity to buy insurance against terror claims and doing \nso in the private market to the extent that is possible.\n  This is, of course, not the first time we have faced this kind of an \nissue. The Federal Government has a history of partnering with the \ninsurance industry to provide coverages for risks that are too big--too \nuninsurable--for the industry alone.\n  Current examples are the flood, crop, and nuclear liability programs, \nand in the past we've seen partnerships on vaccine liability and riot \nreinsurance. From an insurability standpoint, these risks are probably \nmore insurable than terrorism.\n  Some might debate whether we should have passed the existing \nprograms, or whether they are operated efficiency. But there should be \nno debate about the need for a terrorism program, and Senator Dodd has \nstructured this one the right way--with retentions and loss sharing by \nthe industry, so the incentives are there for efficient operations.\n  Again, I congratulate my Connecticut colleague, Senator Dodd, for his \ndiligence in working through these complicated issues and bringing this \nbill to the floor. We need to defeat the amendments and enact this \nlegislation into law as soon as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to address \nthe Senate as in morning business for 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have the sad duty to report another \ndeath of a West Virginian in Afghanistan. For many generations, the \npeople of West Virginia have answered the call and many have paid with \ntheir lives. West Virginians understand the cost of freedom and have \nalways been willing to pay that cost when called for duty.\n  Today we are reminded again how much that cost is because we now know \nof the death of Anissa A. Shero in Gardez, Afghanistan. She is from \nGrafton, WV. This was a tragic death in an airplane crash. She is the \nfirst woman Air Force casualty in the war in Afghanistan. She was \nmarried to SSgt Nathan Shero this past September, 2001. She had just \nbeen married. He is also deployed.\n  Her father was a disabled Vietnam war veteran who lost both of his \nlegs as a result of a casualty, and her grandfather fought in the \nBattle of the Bulge in the Second World War. She was a volunteer who \nchose to serve her country in the face of grave danger. When terrorists \nstruck, she was there. She left behind the mountains of West Virginia, \nin a sense, to go to the mountains of Afghanistan, to risk her life so \nour lives would be freer and safer.\n  She was part of an extraordinarily successful effort to eradicate the \nTaliban and to make tremendous disruption to and demoralize the al-\nQaida forces, and again to give us more freedom and hope. Men and women \nin both nations are safer now because of her work, and unfortunately \nbecause of her death.\n  All of us who value freedom owe Sergeant Shero a profound debt of \ngratitude and honor, and I know the thoughts and prayers of many people \nin this Chamber, the other body, and all over America, certainly all \nover West Virginia, are like mine, with her family and her friends. She \nrepresented the very best of West Virginia and the very best of \nAmerica. She was strong, courageous, and dedicated. She will forever \nserve as a role model for West Virginians, for men and women alike, who \nlove their country and who, like her, know that our ideals are worth \nfighting for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue of urgent \nconcern for American foreign policy: the situation in the Middle East \nand its implications for our war on terrorism.\n  Yesterday the majority leader offered three principles to guide our \npolicy in the Middle East. I share his concern about the gravity of the \nsituation we face and his affirmation of American support for Israel, \nand the imperative of American leadership in helping bring about a \nlasting peace in the region.\n  Time is not on our side. In April, I spoke before this body in \nsupport of President Bush's leadership in bringing a diplomatic \nresolution to this conflict. I applaud the President and his team for \ntheir progress so far in assembling the pieces of a potentially \nhistoric agreement and coalition for peace. But we are still only at \nthe beginning of a long and difficult process.\n  What happens in the Middle East cannot be separated from our \ninterests in the war on terrorism. If we fail in peace-making between \nIsrael and her neighbors, there will be grave consequences for the \nUnited States, Israel, and the world. We will further empower the \nterrorists and extremists, those who thrive, find refuge, and recruit \nin conditions of poverty, violence, and despair. We must help secure a \nvision of hope for the people of the Middle East in order to reclaim \nthe peace initiative.\n  It is time to put the endgame up front in the Israeli-Palestinian \nconflict. The Palestinians must have a state, with contiguous and \nsecure borders, and Israel must have a state without terrorism and with \nsecure borders. President Bush endorsed the concept of a Palestinian \nstate in a historic speech to the United Nations last year. If we do \nnot address this, the core political issue of this conflict, we will \nallow the extremists on both sides to win. And then we will all lose: \nPalestinians, Israelis, Arabs, Americans, the world.\n  Strong, engaged, steady, and visionary American leadership is a \npredicate for the future of the Middle East. The Arab League peace \nproposal, at the initiative of Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, \ncalls for normal relations between Israel and the Arab world and \npresents a unique and historic opportunity for peace. The Bush \nadministration may be considering recognizing a transitional or \nprovisional Palestinian state, with the specific details to be worked \nout over time, an idea similar to the Peres-Abu Ala agreement of last \nyear. The so-called ``Quartet''--US, Russia, the EU, and the UN--\nprovides an international context for this possibility and a revived \ndiplomatic track.\n  The pieces may be in place, the image of an idea for peace forming on \nthe horizon, although the work ahead will be difficult. There are no \neasy answers or risk-free options. We can no longer defer the tough \ndecisions on Israeli settlements, Palestinian refugees, borders, and \nthe status of Jerusalem. The time for a step-by-step sequential process \nhas come and gone. We are close to reaching a line of demarcation, \nwhere only bold and courageous leadership on all sides can show the way \nto a resolution.\n  Israel must make some hard choices for peace. It knows that military \nmeans alone will not end terrorism. Settlements in the occupied West \nBank and Gaza must end. Israel should withdraw its military from the \nPalestinian towns it has re-occupied, as soon as the security situation \nallows. The emphasis for Israel must be on developing a coalition of \ncommon interests including our Arab allies and the United States to \nform the core of a peace coalition. Israel should move closer to this \ncoalition and away from isolation and reliance on only the military \noption to ending the crisis.\n\n  The Israeli people have suffered too much and too long from \nterrorism. It\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nmust end. America will continue to stand by our friend and do what we \nmust to help secure a peace and Israel's survival. But America's \nsupport of Israel should not be at the expense or exclusion of our \nrelationships with our Arab friends and the Palestinian people. It need \nnot be. America is against terrorists, America is not against Arabs or \nPalestinians. We are and can be a friend and supporter of all sides. We \nmust be, or there will be no hope and no peace.\n  This also means that we will not retreat from our support of \ndemocratic principles, values, and expectations. We will not trade \nfriendship and freedom for expediency and peace.\n  The other Arab leaders of the region must play a major role in this \nrevived peace process. They have serious responsibilities and \nsignificant self-interests in helping end terrorism and resolving this \nconflict. There is no longer room for ambiguity or criticism from the \nsidelines. Abdication of responsibility or subtlety is no longer an \noption.\n  Crown Prince Abdullah, King Abdullah of Jordan, and President Mubarak \nof Egypt and other Arab leaders clearly understand the high stakes and \nare willing to take risks for peace. The prospects for getting a peace \nprocess back on track is best served when the risks are shared.\n  The Palestinian leadership must respond to the challenge and \nopportunity before it. Terrorism does an injustice to the Palestinian \nstruggle for self-determination. A Palestinian state cannot be born \nfrom and committed to terrorism and hostility toward its neighbor.\n  It is a tragedy that the Palestinian people have been linked in the \nminds of many people--many Americans, to the methods of terrorists and \nextremists who represent only darkness and hatred, not the aspirations \nof most Palestinians for statehood and a life of hope and peace.\n  Real reform and change within the Palestinian Authority has become a \ncondition of any peace agreement. This must happen--and happen now. The \npresent Palestinian government must stand up and show a leadership that \nhas been lacking for too long. The current Palestinian leaders must be \naccountable and take responsibility for the future of the Palestinian \npeople. Terrorism and violence are not the means to statehood and \nlegitimacy.\n  American and Israeli pressure and intervention, however, can not be \nthe final determinants of a new Palestinian leadership. An alternative \nPalestinian leadership, as Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told me a \ncouple of months ago, may be either too weak to make peace or too \nradical to even consider it. This will certainly be the case if \nalternative leadership is perceived as primarily the result of American \nor Israeli collaboration.\n  There are those in the Palestinian movement that have been speaking \nout for democracy and against corruption in the Palestinian Authority \nfor some time. Hanan Ashrawi and Mustafa Barghouti, as well as many \nothers, have been taking risks for democracy for Palestinians and \ntransparency in Palestinian governance long before it became a \ncondition for a renewed peace process.\n\n  Leaders of the Arab world must take more responsibility for \nPalestinian leadership. They cannot look away. It is now far too \ndangerous for them to allow further drift in the Middle East.\n  In considering the difficult road ahead, I understand the political \nconstraints and risks that Israel and our Arab friends face in moving \nforward with peace. But it is better to share the risk than leave the \nfield to the terrorists and extremists who will fill the leadership \nvacuum.\n  The problems in the Middle East affect and influence all aspects of \nour foreign policy, including our leadership in the war on terrorism. \nThe Arab-Israeli conflict cannot be separated from America's foreign \npolicy. Actions in the Middle East have immense consequences for our \nother policies and interests in the world. We are limited in dealing \nwith other conflicts until this conflict is on a path to resolution.\n  America's policy and role in the Middle East, and the perception of \nour policies and role across the globe, affects our policies and \ninterests in Afghanistan, South Asia, Indonesia, and all parts of the \nworld. We cannot defeat terrorism without the active support of our \nfriends and allies around the world. This will require an enhancement \nof our relationships, not an enhancement of our power. It will require \nAmerica's reaching out to other nations. It will require a wider lens \nin our foreign policy with a new emphasis on humanitarian, economic, \nand trade issues as well as military and intelligence relationships.\n  We need the active support and involvement of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, \nJordan, and the other states of the Middle East to defeat terrorism. \nThe potential for isolating them on one side, with the United States \nand Israel on the other, is the wrong path. The alternative to \ndeveloping coalitions of common interest in the Middle East and our war \non terrorism is a region afire with radicalism and rage directed at \nIsrael and the United States. We cannot wait. We cannot defer the peace \ntimetable to the perfect time for peace. There is no perfect time for \npeace or perfect set of dynamics for peace. It will happen because we \nmake it happen. We must seize the time we have, with all its \nimperfections.\n  The perception of American power becomes the reality of American \npower. If we fail in our diplomatic efforts to help bring peace to \nIsrael and her neighbors, and isolate ourselves and Israel in the \nprocess, our security and Israel's security will become more vulnerable \nand the world more dangerous.\n  We need to keep our eye on the objectives: peace between Israel and \nits neighbors and victory in our war on terrorism. I close by joining \nmy colleague, the majority leader, in encouraging President Bush not to \nrisk unraveling the progress we have made so far in the Middle East by \nallowing a period of inattention and inaction to drag us all back into \na dark abyss of despair and danger. A conference or some tangible \nrelevant framework for peace must be announced and organized soon. The \nstakes have rarely been so high, the opportunities so great, and the \nmargins for error so small.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5578-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5578-S5580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                CLONING\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the matter before the Senate at the \npresent time is an amendment offered by my friend, Senator Brownback. I \nwill address the issues raised by that amendment.\n  We are considering a question that is of vital importance for every \nAmerican affected by diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's disease, or other \nserious disorders. That question is whether we will permit a type of \nlife-saving medical research to achieve its full potential to heal \nillnesses and cure disease--or whether we will stop this promising \nresearch dead in its tracks and deny its benefits to millions of \nAmericans.\n  We all know where Senator Brownback stands on the issue of medical \nresearch using the breakthrough new technique of nuclear \ntransplantation. My friend from Kansas wants to ban this research \nforever. That's the position he has stated time and again in this \nChamber and in forums across the country. And that is what the \namendment that he offers today will accomplish.\n  Members of this body have spent long, serious hours grappling with \nthe complex scientific and ethical issues raised by the issue of human \ncloning. Senators know the difference between human cloning and medical \nresearch. Human cloning produces a human being. Medical research is \ndone in a laboratory dish and produces cells. But these cells can be \nused by doctors to develop astonishing transplants that will never be \nrejected by a patient's own body.\n  A majority of the Senate opposes any legislation to ban, even \ntemporarily, the lifesaving research on nuclear transplantation that \nbrings such hope to so many of our constituents. In the innocuous guise \nof an amendment to suspend certain aspects of the patent law, my friend \nfrom Kansas is trying to accomplish the goal he has long sought--\nbanning medical research that uses nuclear transplantation.\n  The Brownsack amendment does many things. First, it bans patents on \nany cloned human being. It seems to me that if we want to ban human \ncloning, then we should ban it--pure\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\nand sample. I introduced legislation with Senator Arlen Specter, \nSenator Feinstein, and Senator Hatch to ban human cloning in a \nstraightforward way. Our legislation makes human cloning a crime \npunishable by 10 years in prison and substantial fines. That's the way \nto prohibit cloning.\n  Using cloning to reproduce a child is improper and immoral--and it \nought to be illegal. I think that every Member of the Senator would \nagree on this point.\n  Some want to use our opposition to human cloning to advance a more \nsweeping agenda. In the name of banning cloning, they would place \nunwarranted restrictions on medical research that could improve and \nextend countless lives. In a letter to the Congress, 40 Nobel Laureates \nwrote that these restrictions would ``impede progress against some of \nthe most debilitating diseases known to man.''\n  Of course we should reject the offensive idea that human beings could \nbe patented, as the Patent Office already rightly does. But the \nBrownback amendment goes far belong this commonsense proposal. It is so \nbroadly written as to ban patents on single cells derived from medical \nlaboratory research using cloning techniques. It even bans patents on \nthe processes used to conduct this important medical research.\n  Why would my friend from Kansas propose such sweeping bans on \npatents? He offers this proposal precisely because he knows that if it \nis enacted, it will eviscerate this research.\n  The extraordinary progress in medical research that we have seen in \nrecent years relies on two great motors of innovation: NIH funding and \na dynamic private biotechnology sector.\n  But when it comes to vital research using nuclear transplantation \ntechniques, one of those motors has already been broken. There are no \nresearch grants being given by NIH or any other Federal agency for this \nresearch. There never have been, and under this administration, there \nnever will be.\n  If we had allowed our Nation's great research universities to conduct \nextensive nuclear transplanation research, there's no telling what \nmedical miracles we might have seen by now. Perhaps scientists using \nNIH funds could have already developed replacement cells for little \nchildren with diabetes that would never run the risk of tissue \nrejection. Perhaps those same NIH-funded scientists could have \ndeveloped new cures for those whose minds and memories slowly ebb away \non the tide of Alzheimer's disease.\n  Fortunately, we have a robust and dynamic biotechnology industry \nwhere new cures are developed and new discoveries made. Because NIH \nwill not fund nuclear transplantation research, every major discovery \nin this field has come from funds provided by biotechnology companies.\n  But the biotechnology industry runs on patents. Abraham Lincoln said \nthat the patent system ``added the fuel of interest to the fire of \ngenius.''\n  The Brownback amendment would permanently shut off the supply of that \nfuel. It would accomplish Senator Brownback's long-held goal of banning \nthis medical research entirely. NIH already can't fund it and the \nBrownback amendment would make sure no biotechnology company would \ntouch it.\n  Instead of debating peripheral issues like patents, we should be \ndebating the question that's at the core of this debate, whether we \nshould allow or prohibit a type of medical research that bring hope to \nmillions of Americans simply because it seems new or strange to some \npeople.\n  We offered our opponents on this issue the opportunity for a debate, \nbut they declined that offer. I am saddened by this decision, because I \nbelieve that these issues deserve to be debated thoroughly on their own \nmerits, not hastily considered as part of legislation on insurance. I \nhope that we will have the opportunity for a full debate on the issue \nof cloning, as I know it is of profound interest to many of our \ncolleagues. It has been my privilege to take part in some of the other \ngreat debates we have had over the years on issues raised by the \nprogress of science.\n  In the 1970s we debated whether to ban the basic techniques of \nbiotechnology. Some of the very same arguments that are raised against \nnuclear transplantation research today were raised against \nbiotechnology back then. Some said that it would lead to ecological \ncatastrophe or genetic monsters. Critics told us that the new science \nof recombinant DNA research was unproven and untested. They said that \nit might never yield new cures and that its benefits would never \nmaterialize.\n  We could not know in the 1970s all the incredible advances that \nrecombinant DNA research would bring, not only in medical \nbreakthroughs, but in so many different aspects of our lives. We didn't \nknow then that DNA fingerprinting would one day ensure that criminals \nare punished and the wrongly imprisoned are released. But that is what \nis happening today. We did not know then that scientists would learn to \nput thousands of genes on a tiny chip, so that medicines can be \ncustomized for the genetic signature of an individual patient. But that \nis what is happening today. We did not know any of this in the 1970s. \nBut we did know that recombinant DNA research offered extraordinary \npromise and that it should not be banned.\n  Because Congress rejected those arguments then, patients across \nAmerica today can benefit from breakthrough new biotechnology products \nthat help dissolve clots in the arteries of stroke victims, fight \nleukemia, and help those with crippling arthritis lead productive \nlives.\n  When in vitro fertilization was first developed in the 1980s, it too \nwas bitterly denounced. And once again, there were calls to make this \nmedical breakthrough illegal. Because Congress rejected those arguments \nthen, thousands of Americans today can experience the joys of \nparenthood through the very techniques that were once so strongly \nopposed.\n  Even heart transplants once seemed new or strange. Some denounced the \nidea of taking a beating heart from the chest of one person and placing \nit in the body of another.\n  But this debate is not about abstract ideas or complex medical terms. \nIt is about real people who could be helped by this research. Dr. \nDouglas Melton is one of the nation's foremost researchers on diabetes. \nFor Dr. Melton, the stakes involved in this research could not be \nhigher. His young son, Sam, has juvenile diabetes, and Dr. Melton works \ntirelessly to find a cure for his son's condition.\n  One of the most promising areas of research on diabetes involves \nusing stem cells to provide the insulin that Sam, and thousands of \nchildren like him, need to live healthy, active lives.\n  But a shadow looms over this research. A patient's body may reject \nthe very cells intended to provide a cure. To unlock the potential of \nstem cell research, doctors are trying to reprogram stem cells with a \npatient's own genetic material. Using the breakthrough technique of \nnuclear transplantation, each one of us could receive transplants or \nnew cells perfectly matched to our own bodies. Can we really tell Sam \nMelton, and the millions of Americans suffering from diabetes, or \nParkinson's disease, or spinal injuries that we won't pursue every \nopportunity to find a cure for their disorders?\n  Some who support the Brownback proposal say that the science is still \nuncertain, that we should delay this research because we can not \npredict what avenue of scientific inquiry will be the quickest pathway \nto a breakthrough.\n  The Brownback amendment makes certain that breakthrough cures will \nnever see the light of day. If Congress adopts that proposal, we can be \ncertain that doctors will never use this medical research to develop \nnew pancreas cells for diabetics that are perfectly matched to the \npatient's own body. We can be certain that doctors will never use these \ntechniques for important new insights into the basic mechanisms of \nParkinson disease or Alzheimer's disease. We can be certain that \npatients in every community in every State in the Nation will be denied \nthe hope and the benefits that this research brings.\n  That is the kind of certainty the Brownback amendment brings. If you \nwant to accept this false and dangerous certainty, then you should vote \nfor his amendment.\n  But if you want to promote life saving medical research, if you want \nto side with patients, if you want to take a chance on hope, then I \nurge you to vote for patients, for medicine, for hope and for the \nbipartisan proposal that I have introduced with Senator\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nSpecter, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hatch, and many other colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I listened to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Massachusetts speak on the cloning issue. I thought it \nmight be a good opportunity to offer a few thoughts on that issue.\n  When one says cloning, most people automatically think of human \ncloning. They don't know that there is an aspect of it which is called \nnuclear transplantation or stem cell research. The two issues become \nsomewhat blurred. In fact, if you ask people, do they think stem cell \nresearch should proceed, the answer you get invariably, once they \nunderstand it, is yes.\n  I deeply believe that stem cell research today in America is one of \nthe brightest scientific fields we know of and offers unparalleled hope \nand opportunity for so many victims of a myriad of chronic, \ndebilitating, and often fatal diseases. It is the bright rainbow out \nthere in medical research.\n  I understand last night the Senator from Kansas placed an amendment \nbefore the body. I rise to indicate my strong opposition for that \namendment. As I understand it, it would prevent stem cell research from \ngoing ahead. I also know there is discussion in the Halls of this \ndistinguished body about presenting legislation for a 2-year moratorium \non both human cloning and stem cell research. I would oppose that as \nwell.\n  What would that say to an ALS victim who maybe has 5 years to live \nwith the understanding that all research which could be of help to that \nvictim will be stopped for 2 years? It is a mistake. It is throwing the \nbaby out with the bathwater. It should not happen.\n  A number of us, including the Presiding Officer, have put together a \nbill on a bipartisan basis which satisfies the overwhelming majority of \nthe people in America as well as a substantial majority of this body. \nIt says: We recognize the fact that the cloning of a human being is \nunacceptable. It is immoral, and it should not be done. Therefore, our \nlegislation would make it a crime punishable by up to 10 years in \nprison to clone or attempt to clone a human being, without exception. \nIt would establish a fine of $1 million or three times any profits \nmade, whichever is greater, on any person who clones or attempts to \nclone a human being. The financial penalty is in addition to the 10-\nyear prison term.\n  It is very strong. It is definitive on making the cloning of a human \nbeing illegal and subject to a 10-year prison sentence and strong \nfines.\n  The beauty of our legislation is that it would also allow this most \npromising form of stem cell research, somatic cell nuclear \ntransplantation, to be conducted on a human egg for up to 14 days only, \nunder strict standards and Federal regulation. This 14-day requirement \nis consistent with the standard established in the United Kingdom and \nrecommended by the California Advisory Committee on Human Cloning. \nThere is precedent for it.\n  The reason for 14 days is to limit any research before the so-called \nprimitive streak can take over that egg.\n  This stem cell research can only take place on an unfertilized egg. \nThis is important because many of the opponents of stem cell research \nsay: Aha, this is an organism capable of being a living being.\n  It is no different than a clump of blood cells. They are alive. Those \nblood cells are not capable of becoming a human being.\n  Skin cells are alive. They are not capable of becoming a human being, \nnor are any cells in the human body capable of that. An unfertilized \negg is not capable of becoming a human being. Therefore, we limit stem \ncell research to unfertilized eggs.\n  We would ban profiteering and coercion by requiring that all egg \ndonations for this stem cell research be voluntary, and that women who \ndonate eggs can only be compensated minimally--large payments to induce \ndonation would be prohibited.\n  We would prohibit the purchase or sale of unfertilized eggs, \nsomething called oocytes or blastocysts. We would require that nuclear \ntransplantation occur in laboratories, completely separate from labs \nthat engage in invitro fertilization, to prevent a ``blurring of the \nlines,'' to avoid the risk that eggs used in legitimate and important \nnuclear transplantation research would then be implanted in a woman.\n  We would prohibit the export of eggs that have undergone nuclear \ntransplantation to any foreign country that does not ban human cloning. \nThis prohibition is designed to avoid the risk that valuable research \nin the United States will result in a human clone anywhere in the \nworld.\n  We include strong ethics requirements that mandate informed consent \nby egg donors, review of any nuclear transplantation research by an \nethics board, and safety and privacy protection. And we have applied to \nthis the strict Federal regulations that are appropriate in this area.\n  Any researcher who violates the bill's ethics requirements--even \nwithout attempting to clone a human being and becoming subject to the \n10-year prison term and $1 million fine--will face civil penalties of \nup to $250,000 per violation.\n  So the legislation that you, Senator Hatch, Senator Specter, Senator \nHarkin, Senator Thurmond, and myself, in a bipartisan way, have put \ntogether, we believe, offers this body the soundest approach to make \nhuman cloning illegal and, yet, to permit stem cell research to go \nahead only on an unfertilized egg, only up to 14 days with strict \nethical and Federal regulatory standards; to prohibit export to any \ncountry that permits human cloning; to separate it from in vitro \nfertilization, so there can be no blurring of the lines.\n  I think it is a bill that is well thought out, a bill that will stand \nthe test of time and, most importantly, it is a bill that, while \nprohibiting the cloning of the human, will permit this bright rainbow \nof research to go forward.\n  Mr. President, you and I know that today there are 90,000 people \nawaiting organs or tissue replacement. We know that 4,000 people a year \ndie because they didn't get it or because their body rejects that \norgan. Let's talk about what stem cell research is.\n  You have a human egg. That egg is unfertilized. Before it exists for \n14 days, its nucleus is withdrawn. Into that space of the nucleus in \nthis egg is injected the DNA from a sick person--a person who may have \ncancer, or ALS, or a brittle child who may be subject to amputation, \nblindness or death; it could be a Parkinson's patient or a burn \npatient. That egg is then forced to differentiate. As it goes through \nthat period, it then can be encouraged to grow into tissues, or an \norgan, which then, when given to the sick person, there will be no \nrejection of that tissue or that organ. It also can be used with blood. \nIt also can be used for cancer patients.\n  I cannot stress too much, when we get to the actual debate, there is \nanecdote after anecdote of individuals who have lost hope, for whom \nstem cell research gives back that hope. We have 40 Nobel laureates \nsupporting us. We have hundreds of patient advocacy groups all across \nthis Nation supporting us. We have the hopes and dreams of hundreds of \nthousands of people who are otherwise condemned to a life of \ndisability.\n  Mr. President, you and I stood at a press conference with Christopher \nReeve, one of America's great and talented human beings. We listened to \nhim plead to be able to go ahead because this is the first time that, \nif you have had your spine severed, there is an opportunity to \nregenerate, to do something that has never been done in history--to \ngive a paraplegic or a quadriplegic the opportunity to walk again.\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\n  In the Judiciary Committee, we heard testimony from a young woman by \nthe name of Chris Golden. She was an Arlington, VA, police officer and \na marathon runner. She was out running and she was hit by a car and her \nspine was severed. All of her dreams and hopes of continuing in the \nArlington Police Department and of running once again were severed. She \nsays she now hopes and dreams that one day she will wake up and they \nwill have found a treatment that can regenerate her spinal system. \nInstead, today she wakes up to a wheelchair, and she even has a problem \nbeing able to brush her teeth.\n  There is story after story of people who have lost hope and, because \nof this new scientific frontier, they can have hope again.\n  Life is for the living. It is important to improve that life. I \ncannot understand how people want to resist this. I cannot understand \nhow they would prevent stem cell research. I cannot understand how they \nwould say an unfertilized egg is something we have to protect, when \nwomen lose hundreds of these every month. It makes no sense. It is \narbitrary; it is capricious; it is unscientific; it is wrong. And, yes, \nif we know of hundreds of thousands of suffering Americans who might be \nhelped, it is also immoral.\n  So those of us who have put together this legislation believe it will \nstand the test of time. We are very close today to that 60-vote \nnecessity to move ahead with it. So I am hopeful that sometime during \nnext week we will be able to say, yes, in fact we have the 60 votes \nand, yes, in fact the Senate of the United States of America is going \nto stand tall to cross this frontier of stem cell research and be able \nto offer the hope and the dream of a good life to literally hundreds of \nthousands of people.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The National League of Cities has designated this \nday, June 14, 2002 as second annual National Small Cities Day to call \nattention to the role of small cities and towns in American life.\n  The vast majority of cities throughout our Nation have populations of \nfewer than 50,000 people. These communities play an essential role in \nnurturing families, cultivating values, and building a strong sense of \ncommitment and connection. In fact, the theme for National Small Cities \nDay is building quality communities by making decisions by choice and \nnot by chance.\n  Millions of Americans live better lives because small cities provide \nservices and programs that meet the needs of their citizens. In the \nwake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, millions of Americans have \nlooked to the leaders of their small communities to help ensure their \nsafety and security by working in partnership with other levels of \ngovernment.\n  Businesses, civic organizations, and citizens across the nation are \npartners in building quality communities and must be encouraged to \ncontinue to support efforts that make these cities and towns better \nplaces in which to live. The Federal government, too, must continue to \nbe a good partner by supporting important efforts that help strengthen \ncommunities, such as the Community Oriented Policing Program, the \nCommunity Development Block Grant program, and funds for local \nterrorism preparedness programs.\n  We must continue to work together and look for ways to further \nstrengthen our small cities and towns through creativity, innovation, \nand collaboration.\n  I join the National League of Cities and the Small Cities Council in \nencouraging President Bush, my Congressional colleagues, state \ngovernments, community organizations, businesses, and citizens to honor \nthe efforts of ``small town America'' today and renew our commitment to \nwork together on this day and in the future to build quality \ncommunities that improve the lives of citizens throughout the nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5581-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5581-S5582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       COMMEMORATION OF FLAG DAY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, two hundred and twenty-five years ago \ntoday, the United States was engaged in its War for Independence. I \nnote that the American Continental Army, now the United States Army, \nwas established by the Continental Congress, just 2 years earlier on \nJune 14, 1775. I express my congratulations to the United States Army \non its 227th birthday.\n  At the start of that War, American colonists fought under a variety \nof local flags. The Continental Colors, or Grand Union Flag, was the \nunofficial national flag from 1775-1777. This flag had thirteen \nalternating red and white stripes, with the English flag in the upper \nleft corner.\n  Following the publication of the Declaration of Independence, it was \nno longer appropriate to fly a banner containing the British flag. \nAccordingly, on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a \nresolution that ``the Flag of the United States be 13 stripes alternate \nred and white, and the Union be 13 stars white in a blue field \nrepresenting a new constellation.''\n  No record exists as to why the Continental Congress adopted the now-\nfamiliar red, white and blue. A later action by the Congress, convened \nunder the Articles of Confederation, may provide an appropriate \ninterpretation on the use of these colors. Five years after adopting \nthe flag resolution, in 1782, a resolution regarding the Great Seal of \nthe United States contained a statement on the meanings of the colors: \nRed: For hardiness and courage; White: For purity and innocence; and \nBlue: For vigilance, perseverance, and justice.\n  The stripes, symbolic of the 13 original colonies, were similar to \nthe five red and four white stripes on the flag of the Sons of Liberty, \nan early colonial flag. The stars of the first national flag after 1777 \nwere arranged in a variety of patterns. The most popular design placed \nthe stars in alternating rows of three or two stars. Another flag \nplaced twelve stars in a circle with the thirteenth star in the center. \nA now popular image of a flag of that day, although it was rarely used \nat the time, placed the thirteen stars in a circle.\n  As our country has grown, the Stars and Stripes have undergone \nnecessary modifications. Alterations include the addition, then \ndeletion, of stripes; and the addition and rearrangement of the field \nof stars.\n  While our Star-Spangled Banner has seen changes, the message it \nrepresents is constant. That message is one of patriotism and respect, \nwherever the flag is found flying. Henry Ward Beecher, a prominent 19th \ncentury clergyman and lecturer stated:\n  A thoughtful mind, when it sees a nation's flag, sees not the flag \nonly, but the nation itself; and whatever may be its symbols, its \ninsignia, he reads chiefly in the flag the Government, the principles, \nthe truths, and the history which belong to the nation that sets it \nforth.\n  Old Glory represents the land, the people, the government and the \nideals of the United States, no matter when or where it is displayed \nthroughout the world. The flag has proudly represented our Republic \nbeyond the Earth and into the heavens. The stirring images of Neil \nArmstrong and Edwin Aldrin saluting the flag on the moon, on July 20, \n1969 moved the Nation to new heights of patriotism and national pride.\n  Today we pause to commemorate our Nation's most clear symbol, our \nflag. President Woodrow Wilson signed a Presidential Proclamation \ndesignating June 14, 1916 as Flag Day. On a prior occasion President \nWilson noted:\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\n  Things that the flag stands for were created by the experiences of a \ngreat people. Everything that it stands for was written by their lives. \nThe flag is the embodiment, not of sentiment, but of history. It \nrepresents the experiences made by men and women, the experiences of \nthose who do and live under the flag.\n  Flag day was officially designated a National observance by a Joint \nResolution approved by Congress and the President in 1949, and first \ncelebrated the following year. This year, then, marks the 52nd \nanniversary of a Congressionally designated Flag Day.\n  It is appropriate that we pause today, on this Flag Day, to render \nour respect and honor to the symbol of our Nation, and to review our \ncommitment to the underlying principles it represents. Today, let us \nreflect on the deeds and sacrifices of those who have gone before and \nthe legacy they left to us. Let us ponder our own endeavors and the \ninheritance we will leave to future generations. Since the tragic \nevents of last September 11, the display of the flag has taken on a \nrenewed emphasis. It is a visual representation of our commitment to \nfreedom, peace and liberty. Today, the flag is a banner which proudly \nproclaims, ``United We Stand.''\n  Finally, as we commemorate the heritage our flag represents, may we \nas a nation pledge not only our allegiance, but also our efforts to \nfurthering the standards represented by its colors, courage, virtue, \nperseverance, and justice. Through these universal concepts, We the \nPeople can ensure better lives for ourselves and our children, for \nthese are the characteristics of greatness. In doing so, we can move \ncloser to the goal so well stated by Daniel Webster at the laying of \nthe cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument on June 17, 1825. On that \noccasion he said:\n  Let our object be our country, our whole country, and nothing but our \ncountry. And, by the blessing of God, may that country itself become a \nvast and splendid monument, not of oppression and terror, but of \nWisdom, of Peace, and of Liberty, upon which the world may gaze with \nadmiration forever.\n  I have long supported legislation which imposes penalties on anyone \nwho knowingly mutilates, defaces, burns, tramples upon, or physically \ndefiles any U.S. flag. I have also supported a constitutional amendment \nto grant Congress and the States the power to prohibit the physical \ndesecration of the U.S. flag. I regret that the Senate has yet to adopt \na Resolution for a flag protection Constitutional amendment.\n  I am pleased that each day the Senate is in session, a designated \nSenator leads the Senate in reciting the Pledge of Allegiance to the \nFlag of the United States. This has added greatly to the opening of the \nSenate each day.\n  Today I encourage my colleagues and all Americans to take note of the \nhistory and meaning of this 14th day of June. We celebrate our Flag, \nobserving its 225th birthday, and the 227-year-old Army which has so \nproudly and valiantly defended it and our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5582-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5582-S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 227TH BIRTHDAY OF THE UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Madam President, I rise today to commemorate the 227th \nBirthday of the United States Army. On June 14, 1775, as our Republic \nwas struggling to emerge, the Second Continental Congress enacted \nlegislation creating the American Continental Army. The founding \nfathers knew if the citizens of this Nation were to be secure in their \nliberty, the Nation would require the ability to defend and protect \nitself. Fortunately, this Congress also selected George Washington to \ncommand this new force. His sense of purpose, integrity, and leadership \nwere an inspiration to the troops he led to secure the independence of \nthe Nation. His vision of the citizen soldier defending his home, \nfamily, and country were critical to founding of the Republic.\n  From humble beginnings, at Lexington and in the forge of battles such \nas Charleston, Cowpens, and Kings Mountain and from the winter \nencampment at Valley Forge, the Army secured victory at Yorktown. From \nChippewa, New Orleans, Palo Alto, Buena Vista, to the numerous \nskirmishes on the frontier known as the Indian Wars, the Army proudly \ndefended this Nation. The entry of the United States into World War I \nwith the Army leading the way, sealed the allied victory. During World \nWar II, the Army fought worldwide with troops in the Americas, Europe, \nAfrica, Asia, and the Pacific. The defense of our freedoms continued \nwith the Korean War, the Viet Nam War, and Desert Storm. Today our \nsoldiers are found throughout the world, Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan \nand elsewhere, courageously defending our Nation and the ideals it \nrepresents.\n  Our Army reflects the values of our Nation's citizens. Our citizen \nsoldiers serve to protect our freedoms today just as they did to gain \nour freedoms over 200 years ago. I am proud of our soldiers and \nappreciate their selfless service. I was proud to wear the uniform of \nthe United States Army. Happy Birthday to the United States Army.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise today to wish the United States \nArmy happy birthday. It was 227 years ago today, in 1775, that the \nContinental Army of the United States was formed. The United States \nArmy has had a monumental impact on our country.\n  Millions of men and women over the past 227 years have served in the \nsenior branch of our military forces. The Army is interwoven into the \nculture of America. Those who have had the great privilege of serving \nour country in the U.S. Army understand that.\n  This year is an especially important anniversary. The United States \nMilitary Academy at West Point this year celebrated their bicentennial \nanniversary. The newly commissioned class of Lieutenants from the West \nPoint Class of 2002 will face a future much like those faced by their \npredecessors in the Class of 1942, a world where the United States \nfinds itself in a struggle to protect our precious values of liberty, \nfreedom, and democracy.\n  This struggle will not be easy. As of today, we have soldiers \nstationed or deployed in 125 nations. Today we are at war with the \nscourge of our time, terrorism. We must go at the root and strike at \nthe heart of terrorist organizations and those nations granting them \nsafe harbor. And to do so we depend on our United States Army.\n  This mission is not easy. Our soldiers will spend holidays in far \naway countries, miss anniversaries with their spouses and birthdays \nwith their children. They do this out of love for our nation and a \nsense of the greater good. But we must remember that these are the \nlucky ones. Since military operations started in Afghanistan, the \nfollowing Army soldiers have given their lives in service to our great \nnation during Operation Enduring Freedom: Pfc. Kristofer Stonesifer; \nSpc. John J. Edmunds; Pvt. Giovany Maria; Staff Sgt. Brian ``Cody'' \nProsser; Master Sgt. Jefferson Donald Davis; Sgt. 1st Class Daniel \nPetithory; Sgt. 1st Class Nathan R. Chapman; Spc. Jason A. Disney; Spc. \nThomas F. Allison; Staff Sgt. James P. Dorrity; Chief Warrant Officer \nJody L. Egnor; Sgt. Jeremy D. Forshee; Staff Sgt. Kerry W. Frith; Major \nCurtis D. Feisner; Captain Bartt D. Owens; Staff Sgt. Bruce A. \nRushforth, Jr.; Sgt. Bradley S. Crose; Spc. Marc A. Anderson; Pfc. \nMatthew A. Commons; Sgt. Philip J. Svitak; Chief Warrant Officer \nStanley L. Harriman; Staff Sgt. Brian T. Craig; Staff Sgt. Justin J. \nGalewski; Sgt. Jamie O. Maugans; Sgt. 1st Class Daniel A. Romero; Sgt. \nGene Vance, Jr.; and Sgt. 1st Class Peter P. Tycz II.\n  ``Duty, honor, country'' is the motto of the U.S. Army. It is \nAmerica. Every generation of Americans who have served in the U.S. \nArmy, from the Continental Army to today's fighting men and women, have \nbeen shaped by this motto. It has molded lives in ways that are hard to \nexplain, just as the Army has touched our national life and history and \nmade the world more secure, prosperous, and a better place for all \nmankind.\n  On this 227th birthday of the U.S. Army, as a proud U.S. Army \nveteran, I say happy birthday to the Army veterans of our country. We \nrecognize and thank those who served and whose examples inspired those \nof us who have had the opportunity to serve in the U.S. Army.\n  It is the Army that has laid the foundation for all of this nation's \ndistinguished branches of service and helped build a greater, stronger \nAmerica.\n  On this, the 227th birthday of the Army, I say Happy Birthday and, in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\ngreat rich tradition of the U.S. Army, I proclaim my annual Senate \nfloor ``Hooah!''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5583-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GROUPS SUPPORT CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, since 1968 it has been illegal for \nconvicted felons, illegal aliens, individuals involuntarily committed \nto a mental health facility, individuals who have renounced their \ncitizenship, drug addicts, those dishonorably discharged from the \nmilitary, and fugitives who possess or purchase a firearm. In 1996, \nCongress passed legislation to extend the prohibition on firearms to \nindividuals who were under a domestic violence restraining order or \nconvicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor. I supported that \nlegislation because of growing evidence that people who had committed \nacts of domestic violence were buying guns and using them.\n  According to the Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, \n40 percent of women killed with firearms are murdered by an intimate \npartner. According to a Violence Policy Center analysis, a woman is 14 \ntimes more likely to be murdered by a spouse, intimate acquaintance or \nclose relative if there has been a history of domestic violence. And, \nhaving one or more guns in the home makes a woman more than seven times \nmore likely to be the victim of homicide.\n  The threat posed by some domestic abusers was highlighted by a \nFederal court case, Emerson v. United States. Timothy Joe Emerson was \nsubject to a domestic violence restraining order that required him to \nstay away from his wife and her young daughter. Because of the \nrestraining order, he was prohibited from possessing a firearm. Emerson \nwas indicted for violating that provision after an incident in which he \nthreatened his wife with a Beretta pistol and pointed it at her child. \nThis is not an isolated case, and we need to prevent these people from \npossessing and purchasing firearms.\n  On Wednesday morning my staff met with Kathy Hagenian of the Michigan \nCoalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence. Kathy is in Washington \nthis week as part of the National Network to End Domestic Violence \nAnnual Meeting and Legislative Day. The Coalition's mission is to \ncombat all domestic and sexual violence by supporting prevention and \nintervention programs in communities throughout the State of Michigan. \nOne of the issues she raised was her organization's support of Senator \nReed's Gun Show Background Check Act. I, too, support this common sense \ngun safety legislation. This bill would simply apply the background \nchecks that are mandatory for guns purchased in stores to gun shows.\n  In 1996, the Congress closed the domestic violence loophole. Now it \nis time to close the gun show loophole. The lack of background checks \nat gun shows leaves battered women and their children vulnerable to \nviolence. I urge my colleagues to support this important gun safety \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5583-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE MADRID PROTOCOL IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout an important piece of legislation, S. 407, the Madrid Protocol \nImplementation Act, which continues to be blocked from Senate \nconsideration. As I said in an earlier statement on June 7, 2002, there \nare important bills that have cleared the Democratic side of the aisle \nand that have bipartisan support, but are being blocked by holds placed \nby anonymous Republican Senators. Last week, I spoke about legislation \nconcerning national security and law enforcement, including S. 1770, \nimplementing legislation for two anti-terrorism treaties. Fortunately, \ntoday, the Senate overwhelmingly passed the Leahy-Hatch substitute \namendment to S. 1770 to help ensure that the United States continues to \nlead the world in the global fight against terrorism. I rise today to \nspeak about protecting the intellectual property of American business.\n  I introduced S. 407, the Madrid Protocol Implementation Act, with \nSenator Hatch last year to provide implementing legislation for an \nimportant treaty, the Madrid Protocol. This bill promises to help \nAmerican businesses better protect their intellectual property in the \ninternational marketplace.\n  The Clinton administration transmitted the Madrid Protocol to the \nSenate for ratification in 2000, but no action was taken while the \nSenate was under majority control by the Republicans. Under the \nleadership of Chairman Biden, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, \nin November, 2001, reported the Madrid Protocol to the Senate with the \nrecommendation that the Senate give its advice and consent to accession \nto the Madrid Protocol.\n  S. 407 would implement this new treaty. The legislation would make no \nsubstantive change in American trademark law. The bill would set up new \nprocedures for trademark applicants to file a single trademark \napplication with the Patent and Trademark Office. This single filing \nwould give the applicant ``one stop'' international trademark \nregistration--a process only available to signatory countries to the \nProtocol. This would benefit American businesses and companies who need \nto protect their trademarks as they sell their goods and services in \ninternational markets, including over the Internet.\n  The House version of this bill, H.R. 741, has already passed the \nRepublican House of Representatives, as it has for the past three \nCongresses. The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported this \nbill favorably to the full Senate in July, 2001, and we have been \ntrying unsuccessfully to get it passed by unanimous consent ever since.\n  This bill is critical in keeping our trademark laws up-to-date. It \nrepresents a significant step in our efforts to ensure that American \ntrademark law adequately serves and promotes American interests. It is \ntime for the anonymous, secret Republican holds on S. 407 to be lifted \nso that the Senate can pass this important legislation to protect the \nprivate intellectual property of Americans in the global economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5583-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I rise today to speak about \nhate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of \nlast year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 9, 2002 \nin Riverside, CA. An attack outside a popular gay bar left one gay man \ndead and another wounded. Jeffery Owens, 40, died of multiple stab \nwounds while coming to the aid of Michael Bussee, 48, who was being \nbeaten and stabbed in the bar parking lot. Before stabbing Owens, one \nattacker was heard to yell ``You want some trouble . . . fag, here it \nis!'' Police are currently looking for the assailants, four men with \nshaved heads, and are investigating the incident as a hate crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5583-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5583-S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RAYMOND D. EVANS\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the staple \nof the Missouri conservation community, Mr. Raymond D. Evans. Mr. Evans \nis retiring after 35 years of service with the Missouri Department of \nConservation and he is a major contributor to the development of \nconservation provisions for the State of Missouri. Mr. Evan's \nfundamental efforts have played a role in developing provisions that \nhelped land owners implement management practices to improve \nprofitability and wildlife values by helping to protect the soil and \nwater resources that are the foundation of agriculture and wildlife \nproductivity. He has maintained the highest standard of excellence in \nhis service to conservation and received several awards from his peers \nand associates as a result. These awards include the management Award \nfrom the Southeast Section of The\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\nWildlife Society, and Award of Merit from the ASCS for helping write \nand pass the Farm Bill. Mr. Evans has also received the American Motors \nConservation Award for his many contributions to the success of the \nMissouri Conservation Department's coordinated forest habitat \nmanagement program, and the E. Sydney Stephens Award for his career \ncontributions to Missouri's wildlife resources. I wish to honor and \nthank him for his hard work and dedication to the preservation of \nwildlife and the environment.\n  To people in Missouri, Mr. Evans has always been known as ``Ray''. \nHis trademark ribbon tie, warm smile and commitment to his neighbors \nand the land they live on will remain his legacy. On the national \nscene, Ray has been a tireless advocate of Federal assistance to \npromote local initiatives. Ray has always understood that conservation \nis a ``public good'' and, consequently, the public should help \nlandowners provide that public good. As a practicing farmer, Ray also \nunderstands and helps our urban friends understand that farmers are the \nmost committed practitioners of conservation because it is good \nbusiness and because they want to leave more value to their children \nand future generations. In other words, they want to leave it better \nthan they found it. It is that understanding that won him the trust of \nlandowners which is a key element to the success with which Ray is \nassociated.\n  Ray's advocacy has been tireless, both for him and those of us he \npursued constantly. With Ray, the ``to-do'' list is never complete and \nevery success is followed by a new initiative. Recently, after Ray \nwitnessed President Bush signing the 4th consecutive Farm Bill Ray \nworked on, Ray innocently succeeded in lifting the President's speech \nand convincing the President to sign it for him. While Ray was a good \nenough salesman to pull that off, he couldn't get past the staff who \nhave obligations to the National Archives but if anyone deserves a \nhigh-level souvenir for his work in conservation, it would be Ray. \nNevertheless, I am pleased that Ray got some face time with the \nCommander-in-Chief out of the deal.\n  On behalf of many citizens who benefited from his friendship, work, \nand guidance, I thank Ray and I thank his wife Carole for lending him \nto us. While I trust he will continue sharing his presence at many \nconservation-related events, I am pleased that he and Carole will have \nmore time to enjoy time together. I recommend that he take her for long \nwalks in the countryside so they can both appreciate what they have \ndone for the landscape.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5584-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5584-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5584-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n       S. 2624.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, along with my colleagues, Senators, \nMiller and Kennedy, I am very pleased to announce the introduction of \nthe Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of 2002.\n  A prescription drug benefit is the most fundamental shift we can make \nin the health care of older Americans. Adding a prescription drug \nbenefit to Medicare will represent a 180 degree turn, a change in the \nfocus of how we deliver health care to our Nation's seniors.\n  Quite simply, including prescription drugs will transform Medicare \nfrom a sickness program to a wellness program. Failure to provide a \nprescription drug benefit will continue to confine millions of elderly \nAmericans to a system that is antiquated, one that only looks backward, \nnot forward.\n  The sponsors of this legislation do not buy the conventional wisdom \nthat nothing significant can be enacted in an election year. We are \ncommitted to meeting our goal this year: passage of a universal, \ncomprehensive, and affordable prescription drug benefit.\n  To be sure, there are questions in this debate which still remain. \nBut, the most important question, ``will our drug benefit meet seniors' \nneeds?'', can be answered with a resounding ``YES.''\n  The voluntary benefit we are offering to all seniors is very simple, \nno gimmicks, gotchas or ``gaps'' to fall into. With our benefit, ``what \nyou see is what you get.'' Seniors will know exactly what they will \npay, and exactly what they will get: the monthly premium is $25, no \nmatter where a person lives; all beneficiaries get assistance from the \nvery first prescription of the year.\n  For the first two years, seniors will pay $10 for each generic \nprescription, and no more than $40 for all medically-necessary brand-\nname medicines. All other drugs would cost no more than $60. After two \nyears, the co-pay will be indexed to the increase in prescription drug \nprices.\n  Seniors who either pay $4,000 out of their own pocket or have a third \nparty contribute towards this $4,000 spending level would pay no more.\n  Seniors with very low incomes, below 135 percent of poverty, would \npay no premiums. Seniors with incomes between 135 and 150 percent of \nthe poverty level would pay reduced premiums.\n  And no senior will be faced with a burdensome ``asset test'' that \ncould deny them the very drugs they need.\n  This kind of certainty, and this kind of help, is what beneficiaries \nneed. Take, for example a 68-year-old man with two conditions very \ncommon among the elderly, congestive heart failure and diabetes, and no \ndrug coverage. He would have to spend over $5,100 annually for a \ntypical medication regimen. Under our plan, this gentleman would get \nthe medicines he needs to stay healthy, and would save nearly $3,300.\n  In addition to being affordable, comprehensive, and universally \navailable to all of America's seniors, we need a drug benefit that will \nbe attractive to beneficiaries. Why? Because voluntary participation of \nall seniors will ensure that we will have a program that is sustainable \nfor the long run. A program that attracts only the sickest \nbeneficiaries is doomed to fail.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has evaluated our plan and has stated \nthat it does not leave a single Medicare beneficiary without access to \ndrug coverage.\n  How does this bill achieve this goal? By following the principle that \nthe drug benefit should track the prescription drug benefits that \nseniors have been accustomed to in their working years. We have an \nattractive benefit with an affordable premium and a catastrophic \nprovision that is an insurance policy for all elderly, in particular, \nfor those seniors who are healthy right now, but who may face health \nproblems later in life. We have modeled our bill after what works for \nmost Americans right now. Our benefit includes tiered copayments, and \nwe use as our delivery system the private sector model in place today \nin every part of the country.\n  Addition of a prescription drug benefit will be the largest expansion \nof the Medicare program since it was initiated in 1965. This fact \nchallenges Congress to be sure that we get it right. In light of the \nscope of the changes we are making, we are suggesting that, after seven \nyears, Congress should examine how well the benefit is working and to \nmake whatever modifications are necessary and appropriate. Not only \nwill we learn about how our delivery system has worked, but we can \ndiscover that access to prescription drugs will save Medicare money. \nHow? By doctors prescribing medications instead of performing costly \nmedical procedures. A physician on my staff recently told me that his \nstudents had never seen an ulcer operation. Why? Because prescription \ndrugs have ended the need for this surgery.\n  Improving Medicare by including a prescription drug benefit is a \nserious and critical undertaking, and deserves our most serious \nefforts. We all know that our seniors cannot afford to wait out another \nelection cycle.\n  I am pleased to announce that the American Association of Retired \nPersons, America Federation of State and County Municipal Employees, \nthe National Council on the Aging, Families USA, the AFL-CIO, the \nAlliance for Retired Americans, the National Committee to Preserve \nSocial Security and Medicare, and the Generic Pharmaceutical \nAssociation support our legislation. I ask unanimous consent that their \nletters of support be printed in the Record. With their help, we can \nget this done this year.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                         AARP,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham and Hon. Zell Miller,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We are pleased to restate our position on \n     your revised Medicare prescription drug proposal. Action on a \n     bipartisan prescription drug benefit is a top priority for \n     AARP, our members and the nation.\n       Medicare beneficiaries have waited long enough for access \n     to meaningful, affordable prescription drug coverage. We know \n     from our membership that in order for a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit to provide comprehensive coverage it must \n     include:\n       An affordable premium and coinsurance;\n       Meaningful catastrophic stop-loss that limits out-of-pocket \n     costs;\n       A benefit that does not expose beneficiaries to a gap in \n     insurance coverage;\n       Additional assistance for low-income beneficiaries; and\n       Quality and safety features to curb unnecessary costs and \n     prevent dangerous drug interactions.\n       AARP supports your initiative in incorporate these goals. \n     We commend you for including key elements in your proposal \n     that Medicare beneficiaries and our members have indicated \n     they find valuable. For instance, your proposal includes a \n     premium that many Medicare beneficiaries view as affordable \n     and a benefit design that does not include a gap in insurance \n     coverage. Your proposal also now includes co-payments \n     specified as dollar amounts, an approach that our research \n     shows our members prefer to coinsurance. In our view, this \n     plan could provide real value to beneficiaries in protecting \n     them against the high costs of prescription drugs.\n       It is important that any prescription drug benefit be made \n     a permanent and stable part of Medicare, and we want to work \n     with you to achieve this before enactment.\n       Thank you for your leadership on this issue. We look \n     forward to working with you and your colleagues as the \n     legislation moves forward. AARP will continue to urge \n     Congress to work in a bipartisan manner to enact affordable, \n     meaningful Medicare prescription drug coverage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William D. Novelli,\n     Executive Director and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            The National Council on the Aging,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the National Council on \n     the Aging (NCOA)--the nation's first organization formed to \n     represent America's seniors and those who serve them--I write \n     to commend and thank you for your proposal to provide \n     meaningful Medicare prescription drug coverage to America's \n     seniors. The Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act of \n     2002 is consistent with the principles supported by the vast \n     majority of\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\n     organizations representing Medicare beneficiaries. It \n     provides the foundation for a vehicle that we hope can \n     achieve bipartisan consensus on this issue this year.\n       NCOA is particularly pleased that your legislation would \n     provide prescription drug coverage that is universal, \n     voluntary, reliable, and continuous. Other proposals being \n     offered include significant coverage gaps and would fail to \n     solve the problem. Under such bills, a significant number of \n     beneficiaries would not want to participate in the program, \n     and many of those who do participate would continue to be \n     forced to choose between buying food and essential medicines.\n       We commend many of the modifications you have made to your \n     Medicare bill from last year. These improvements include a \n     significantly lower premium, the option to provide a flat \n     copayment, an earlier effective date, and assistance with the \n     very first prescription. We believe these changes will make \n     the coverage affordable and attractive to the vast majority \n     of beneficiaries, which is so critical to making a voluntary \n     prescription drug program work. While we have concerns about \n     the need to reauthorize the program after 2010, we understand \n     the budget trade-offs needed to provide meaningful and \n     attractive coverage, and fully expect that the Congress would \n     reauthorize the program.\n       NCOA is also pleased that your proposal does not include \n     price controls and that the program would promote stability \n     and efficiency through administration by multiple, competing \n     Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), using management tools \n     available in the private sector in which PBMs would be at \n     risk of their performance, including effective cost \n     containment.\n       NCOA deeply appreciates your efforts to move this critical \n     debate in a direction that guarantees access to meaningful \n     coverage--even in rural and frontier areas of the country--\n     and responds in a constructive manner to many of the specific \n     concerns that have been raised regarding other Medicare \n     prescription drug proposals.\n       It is impossible to have real health security without \n     coverage for prescription drugs. Prescription drug coverage \n     is the number one legislative priority for America's seniors. \n     Virtually every member of Congress has made campaign promises \n     to try to pass a good prescription drug bill. The time has \n     come to get serious and to work together to achieve consensus \n     on the issues in controversy. Your proposal provides us with \n     an excellent starting point.\n       NCOA looks forward to working on a bipartisan basis with \n     you and other members of Congress to pass legislation this \n     year that provides meaningful, continuous, affordable \n     prescription drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Firman,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Sen. Bob Graham,\n     Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the millions of members \n     and supporters of the National Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, I write in support of your Medicare \n     prescription drug legislation that will provide much needed \n     relief to seniors. Your bill contains all of the elements \n     that seniors need in a comprehensive drug benefit under \n     Medicare, such as universal, voluntary, affordable, not means \n     tested and most importantly, with a defined benefit, so that \n     seniors can plan accordingly. Prescription drug prices are \n     increasing over 17% per year (faster than inflation) and \n     seniors are spending more on out-of-pocket drug expenditures \n     than ever. The time is now to enact a drug benefit that will \n     provide the Medicare beneficiary with some assistance.\n       We are pleased that your plan would be available for \n     seniors, no matter where they live. Our members have \n     expressed to us that a prescription drug benefit must be \n     affordable. We believe that a plan such as yours, with no \n     annual deductible and a $4,000 cap on out of pocket \n     expenditures, is reasonable and one that most seniors would \n     be able to afford.\n       We applaud you for your leadership in this area. Please let \n     me know how we can further support your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barbara Kennelly,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Families USA,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2002.\n     Sen. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: We congratulate you and Senators \n     Miller, Kennedy and Rockefeller on the introduction of your \n     bill, ``The Medicare Outpatient Prescription Drug Act,'' \n     which provides a prescription drug benefit for Medicare \n     beneficiaries.\n       This is an issue of utmost importance to all Americans who \n     need prescription drugs, especially to seniors and people \n     with disabilities. As you well know, seniors' ability to \n     afford prescription drugs is a particularly difficult problem \n     today. In our 2001 report entitled, ``Enough to Make You \n     Sick: Prescription Drug Prices for the Elderly,'' we \n     concluded that the 50 top drugs used by seniors rose 2.3 \n     times the rate of inflation between 2000 and 2001. We are in \n     the process of updating this report for last year, and our \n     preliminary data shows that this devastating rate of price \n     increases continues. Millions of seniors have limited income \n     and no, or limited, drug coverage and will find themselves \n     deciding whether to buy drugs or to pay for other essentials.\n       Your bill addresses many important design issues that we \n     care about in a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The \n     benefit is universal, comprehensive, and is delivered through \n     the Medicare program, ensuring that seniors know it will be \n     available to them when it is needed. Low-income people get \n     extra assistance. Also, there are provisions to assure that \n     costs will be contained and quality maintained.\n       Please let us know how we can assist you to move this bill \n     toward enactment so that all Medicare beneficiaries can have \n     access to the prescription drugs they need.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Ronald F. Pollack,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Senators Edward Kennedy, Bob Graham, and Zell Miller,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the 1.3 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I am writing to express our support for the \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit proposal you unveiled \n     today.\n       AFSCME has long supported the creation of a Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit that is comprehensive in coverage, \n     affordable and voluntary for all Medicare beneficiaries. We \n     believe that your proposal is a solid step forward in meeting \n     these standards.\n       In particular, we applaud your proposal's provisions for \n     continuous coverage. We believe that it is one of the most \n     critical components of a meaningful prescription drug \n     benefit. Beneficiaries must have coverage they can count on, \n     with no gaps in coverage. Doing anything less would force our \n     seniors to pay all prescription costs out of their own pocket \n     when they will need the coverage the most.\n       Since Medicare was started over 35 years ago, many \n     illnesses that were once only treatable in a hospital can now \n     be effectively treated with prescription drugs. Adding a drug \n     benefit to the program is the most urgently needed Medicare \n     reform. We applaud you for not holding the prescription drug \n     benefit hostage to force radical privatization proposals that \n     would cut benefits and increase costs for retirees.\n       We look forward to working with you and the other sponsors \n     of this important legislation. A Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit is long overdue, and our nation's seniors deserve no \n     less.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n     Director of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the 13 million members of \n     the AFL-CIO, I am writing to commend you for your efforts to \n     provide much-needed relief to Medicare beneficiaries. Your \n     proposal to create a voluntary drug benefit within the \n     Medicare program represents an encouraging and solid step \n     toward enacting the one reform most urgently needed for \n     Medicare.\n       Seniors need a real benefit that provides comprehensive, \n     continuous and certain coverage. The Graham-Miller-Kennedy \n     bill provides that benefit, giving seniors coverage they can \n     count on. A Medicare drug benefit must also be affordable for \n     beneficiaries. The $25 monthly premium and zero deductible in \n     your proposal means seniors need only pay an affordable \n     premium to begin getting coverage immediately. And no senior \n     will have to pay more than $40 for the drugs they need and \n     often will pay less.\n       In addition, your proposal would not put at risk those \n     retirees who currently have some prescription drug coverage \n     through an employer. Retiree health care is the primary \n     source of prescription drug coverage for seniors, and your \n     proposal rightly provides some relief for employers that \n     choose to continue that coverage.\n       A proposal widely reported under consideration by House \n     Republican leaders offers only unreliable, expensive and \n     unworkable coverage through private plans, with an enormous \n     gap in coverage that leaves seniors without any coverage at \n     all for drug costs between $2000 and $4500. And the only \n     relief for employers is if they drop the coverage they now \n     offer. Such a proposal will not move us any closer to a real \n     benefit.\n       As this debate moves forward, we want to work with you and \n     your co-sponsors to enact the best possible Medicare drug \n     benefit. We appreciate your role in advancing that process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               Alliance for Retired Americans,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the over 2.7 million \n     members of the Alliance for Retired Americans, I want to \n     thank you for your tireless work on behalf of older and \n     disabled Americans to create a Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit program. I also want to express our views on the \n     Medicare prescription drug legislation proposed by you and \n     Senators Graham and Miller. The Alliance supports this \n     proposal as a positive step forward in the effort to create a \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit program.\n       The Alliance for Retired Americans believes that all older \n     and disabled Americans need an affordable, comprehensive, and \n     voluntary Medicare prescription drug benefit now. Such a \n     benefit program should have low monthly premiums, annual \n     deductibles, and be administered as part of the Medicare \n     program. Your proposed legislation meets these Alliance \n     principles. Unlike other proposals that would begin in 2005, \n     your plan would start in 2004, which gives beneficiaries the \n     coverage they need a full year earlier.\n       The Alliance will work to enact your legislation. During \n     legislative deliberations, the Alliance will seek to improve \n     benefits because we believe that an 80/20 co-insurance \n     payment system, like the rest of Medicare, will provide the \n     best benefits for older and disabled Americans. The Alliance \n     also supports a $2,000 annual catastrophic cap. We will \n     continue to work to improve any legislation that moves \n     through Congress in order to reach these goals.\n       Older Americans will spend $1.8 trillion on prescription \n     drugs during the next decade. The inflation rate for \n     prescription drugs will continue at an annual double digit \n     pace as well. Our members and indeed all Americans simply \n     cannot afford these costs. We look forward to working with \n     you and Senators Graham and Miller to enact a comprehensive \n     Medicare prescription drug benefit as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Edward F. Coyle,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Generic Pharmaceutical Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 12, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the Generic \n     Pharmaceutical Association (GPhA), we would like to commend \n     you and Senators Miller and Kennedy for your leadership \n     introducing legislation to create a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit for our nation's seniors. We agree with you that \n     the passage and enactment of a voluntary Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit is long overdue. We are strongly \n     supportive of your innovative tiered co-pay structure, as \n     well as the other provisions advocated by you and your \n     colleagues, that are designed to increase the utilization of \n     high-quality, affordable generic medicines.\n       Generic pharmaceuticals have a proven track record of \n     substantially lowering drug costs. Studies have shown that \n     for every 1 percent increase in generic drug utilization, \n     consumer, business, and health plan purchasers save over $1 \n     billion. The increased use of generics can play an invaluable \n     role in helping Medicare, Medicaid, the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefit Plan (FEHBP) and other Federal and private \n     plans assure that beneficiaries have access to quality, \n     affordable medications. A tiered co-pay system with a \n     significant differential between brand and generic \n     pharmaceuticals will ensure an appropriate incentive is in \n     place for seniors to consider more cost-effective options \n     when making choices about pharmaceutical therapies. We \n     believe an explicit dollar co-pay will also provide seniors \n     with the comfort of knowing they will pay a fixed cost to \n     have their prescriptions filled.\n       With your leadership, the Graham/Miller/Kennedy bill \n     employs a number of private sector best practices that are \n     now widely used to assure access to cost-effective, quality \n     affordable medications. These provisions not only encourage \n     the appropriate and beneficial use of these products, but \n     provide unbiased and greatly needed educational information \n     to the public about the benefits of these medicines.\n       The Graham/Miller/Kennedy bill adheres to GPhA's principles \n     for creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit and steers \n     the Medicare reform debate down a prudent public policy path. \n     We look forward to working with you, your cosponsors and with \n     other Members of the House and Senate of both parties to \n     further our common objective of providing our nation's nearly \n     40 million Medicare beneficiaries and the taxpayers who help \n     support them with the most affordable and highest quality \n     prescription drug benefit possible. If the rest of the \n     Congress and the Administration follow your lead in \n     recognizing the role generics must play in reaching this \n     objective, we are confident we will achieve this goal.\n       Thank you again for your efforts. If we can be of any \n     assistance to you, please do not hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kathleen Jaeger,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I want to thank Senators Miller and Kennedy for their \nleadership and commitment to this issue, and urge all of our colleagues \nto join us in ensuring passage of this critical legislation this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2625\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, I am proud to tell America's seniors who \nhave been waiting in line for a long time that, finally, they have \nreached the front of the line. Their time has come. This Senate is \nready to take action on prescription drugs.\n  Our action cannot come soon enough. Most of our elderly in this \ncountry are not wealthy. Many live on fixed incomes. They are the ones \nwho are hurt first and hurt most by rising health care costs.\n  Our elderly have been waiting a long time. Waiting for Congress to do \nsomething. Waiting for Congress to help them with the skyrocketing \ncosts of their prescription drugs.\n  Our bill provides an affordable prescription drug benefit under \nMedicare for all seniors for the first time. Coverage begins with the \nfirst prescription filled because there is no deductible.\n  For the roughly 12 million seniors in this country who earn less than \n$11,900 a year, there is no premium and no copayment. For our neediest \nseniors, our bill gives them their medicine for free.\n  For those who earn more, our plan has an affordable a $25 monthly \npremium and a copayment of $10 for generic drugs and $40 for brand-name \ndrugs. Also, our bill has no gap in coverage and an out-of-pocket \nmaximum of $4,000 a year.\n  We realize it is a huge, complex and complicated undertaking. And \nthat is why this bill provides that in 2011, we will come back and re-\nevaluate this program, just like we do with other complicated \nlegislation.\n  We believe that is the wise and judicious thing to do. In fact, if \nthe original Medicare program had required such a reauthorization, we \nprobably would have had a prescription drug benefit added to it long \nago.\n  But since Medicare was permanently authorized from the beginning, \nthere was no requirement for Congress to re-evaluate and therefore \nmodernize the program as circumstances changed over the years.\n  And, reauthorization is not anything new or different. We re-evaluate \nmany programs on a regular basis: We just did it with the Farm Bill. \nWelfare Reform, the Elementary and Secondary Education program, Head \nStart, all of them are re-evaluated at regular intervals.\n  I hope that all members of the Senate will come together and pass \nthis bill in the next few weeks so that our elderly across this land of \nplenty, those folks who have played by the rules and worked hard, can \nhave some hope and some dignity in the last few years they are on this \nearth.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Medicare is a solemn promise between \ngovernment and its citizens and between the generations. It says, \n``Contribute to the system during your working years and we will assure \nyou health security in your retirement years.'' But that promise is \nbroken every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. \nThe Graham-Miller-Kennedy Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2002 sends \nthe message loud and clear: it is time to mend Medicare's broken \npromise.\n  There is no domestic issue that is more important to the American \npeople than assuring that senior citizens can afford the prescription \ndrugs they need. Senior citizens have an average income of $15,000, and \nthey spend an average of $2,000 of that limited income on prescription \ndrugs. Too many of our elderly citizens must choose between food on the \ntable and the medicine their doctors prescribe. Too many of the elderly \nare taking half the drugs their doctor prescribes, or none at all, \nbecause they simply can't afford them.\n  Every day we delay, the problem becomes worse. Prescription drugs \ncosts are escalating at double-digit rates. One-third of all senior \ncitizens don't have a dime of prescription drug coverage, and those who \ndo have coverage are in danger of losing it. The sad fact is that the \nonly senior citizens who have reliable, affordable, adequate coverage \nare the very poor on Medicaid. That is not good enough, and we are here \ntoday to say that America owes it to its senior citizens to do better.\n  Every politician understands that senior citizens, and their \nchildren, and their grandchildren want action. Every politician \nunderstands that opposition to a prescription drug benefit is not a \nsustainable position. The question is not whether Congress will pass a \nbill; the question is whether we will pass a bill that truly provides \nthe protection senior citizens need. The elderly do not need a \nprescription drug benefit that cannot pass the truth in advertising \ntest. They don't need a benefit that pays pennies on the dollar for the \nmedicines the elderly need to survive. They do not need a benefit that \noffers the pretence of relief but not the performance.\n  The bill we are offering today mends the broken promise of Medicare. \nIt offers real benefits at a price the elderly can afford. It is a \nlifeline for every senior citizen who needs prescription drugs. It is a \npriority for the American people.\n  It is time to pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. It is time \nfor Congress to listen to the American people instead of the powerful \nspecial interests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CLELAND:\n  S. 2627. A bill to protect marine species off the coast of Georgia; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto help protect marine species in the exclusive economic zone off the \ncoast of Georgia. Shark gillnetting causes bycatch of many marine \nspecies, including valuable gamefish such as tarpon, red drum, king \nmackerel, and cobia and leatherback sea turtles, a protected species. \nGillnets are already prohibited in Georgia's State waters, and my \nlegislation would also prohibit this gear from being used in the \nFederal waters off the coast of Georgia. This legislation is supported \nby the Georgia Department of Natural Resources, which has jurisdiction \nover the State's coastal resources.\n  My proposal does not prohibit shark fishing but rather affects the \nmeans of fishing. Shark fishers can use other methods for fishing such \nas long-lines or hook and line as alternatives. Additionally, this bill \nonly affects the waters off the coast of Georgia. The neighboring \nStates are still allowed to handle the bycatch, enforcement, and other \nissues as they believe is appropriate.\n  The waters affected by the legislation are home to many types of \nmarine life that are vitally important to Georgia's traditional and \nexpanding charter fishery, as well as the state's coastal communities \nand tourism industry. These businesses are negatively impacted by the \nshark gillnetting bycatch rates and its impacts on gamefish \npopulations, including some already overfished stocks. In August 2000, \nI was contacted by some of these Georgia business people who are \nconcerned over what they see as a dramatic decrease in the fish \npopulation and about the future viability of their businesses. These \ncitizens work to create a delicate balance between the environment and \ntheir livelihood by limiting their catches and releasing fish to help \ninsure the sustained health of local fish stocks and their habitats. \nShark gillnetting has disrupted this balance. My legislation is the \nfirst step to bringing this balance back in line.\n  As the Commerce Committee, of which I am a member, begins the \nreauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation Management \nAct, I will work with Chairman Hollings to address this issue. It is at \nonce an environmental issue, a small business issue, a state \nsovereignty issue, and it is the right thing to do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Harkin, Mr. McCain, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr.\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\n        Graham, Mr. Wellstone, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. \n        Reed):\n  S. 2626. A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food \nand Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco \nproducts; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, today Senator Kennedy, my colleague from \nMassachusetts, and I, Senator Durbin, and others are introducing a bill \ndesigned to help protect children from the dangers of tobacco. Quite \nsimply, our bill would finally give the Food and Drug Administration \nthe authority it needs to effectively regulate both the manufacture and \nthe sale of tobacco products.\n  My colleagues will all remember that we visited this issue a few \nyears ago, in 1998, when our colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, \nand others introduced the Universal Tobacco Settlement Act, which \nincluded a major section that provided the FDA with the authority to \nregulate tobacco products. Also, of course, during 1998, 46 States \nentered into an agreement known as the Master Settlement Agreement, \nMSA. They entered into that agreement with the major tobacco companies \nto settle all State lawsuits seeking to recover the Medicaid costs of \ntreating smokers.\n  Fast forward from 1998 until today. Tobacco proponents would have you \nbelieve this master settlement resolved the issue of tobacco use by \nimposing all these restrictions. But the truth is, it did not. Smoking \namong young people remains a huge national problem.\n  Every day in this country, nearly 5,000 young people under the age of \n18 try their first cigarette. In my own home State of Ohio, 33 \npercent--one-third--of children 18 and under smoke. These kids in Ohio, \nby themselves, go through 45 million packs of cigarettes each year.\n  If that is not bad enough, look at it another way: 90 percent of \nsmokers start smoking before the age of 19. More than 6.4 million \nchildren across this country will die prematurely because of a decision \nthey will make as children, as adolescents--a decision to start smoking \ncigarettes.\n  In my home State of Ohio, as I indicated, one-third of the children \nsmoke. We know the statistics are that one-third of people who smoke in \nthis country will die prematurely because of an alcohol-related \nillness. One-third of the one-third, therefore, in the State of Ohio \nwill die prematurely.\n  While States have limited options available for tobacco advertising \nunder this 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, the reality is that the \ntobacco companies still are able to choose the contents of their \nadvertisements. They are still able to get around this settlement. They \nare still able to run ads like this: ``Skol, A Pinch Better.'' Guess \nwhere that ad ran? In Sports Illustrated.\n  How many young people in this country every week wait for that Sports \nIllustrated to come in the mail, or buy it when it comes to the store?\n  The companies are savvy. They have really changed their marketing \nstrategies. They have concentrated more money into different \nadvertising markets. As a result, more than 3 years after the major \ntobacco companies agreed to stop marketing to children as part of this \ntobacco settlement, children are still twice as likely as adults to be \nexposed to tobacco advertising.\n  Let me repeat that. Children are still twice as likely as adults to \nbe exposed to tobacco advertising.\n  This chart shows and represents a poll which was done. The question \nasked was: Have you seen any advertising for cigarettes or tobacco in \nthe last 2 weeks? Among teens, 64 percent said yes; adults, only 27 \npercent.\n  In spite of the claim that tobacco companies are not targeting \nchildren, for whatever reason that is the market that is hearing it; \nthat is who is seeing the message; that is who is hearing the message; \nthat is whom the message is affecting.\n  According to the Federal Trade Commission's annual report on \ncigarette sales and advertising, the year 2000 represented the largest \nincrease ever in tobacco companies' spending on ``promotional \nallowances''; that is, the money tobacco companies pay retailers to \npromote their products in prominent locations in stores, or for high \nvisible shelf space. We know that is one of the greatest marketing \ntechniques--put it somewhere I can see it when I walk in the store. It \nis right at eye level for kids near the cash register, in an aisle \nwhere the customer must walk by to pay the cashier.\n  That same year--the year 2000--cigarette manufacturers spent a record \n$9.5 billion on advertising and promotion. That is an increase of 16 \npercent from the year 1999.\n  Tobacco companies also spend billions of dollars advertising through \nenticing promotional items--lighters, hats, and other products--they \ngive away for free at the ``point of sale,'' or, in other words, at the \ncash register or the place of checkout in the grocery store or the \nconvenience store.\n  In fact, spending on such promotional or value-added items increased \nby 37 percent between 1999 and the year 2000.\n  Let us not fool ourselves. These promotional strategies and \nadvertisements reach our children. Statistics show that 75 percent of \nour children visit a convenience store at least once a week.\n  I ask my colleagues. The next time you walk into a convenience store, \nlook at how many different times you see an advertisement for tobacco \nproducts. They are everywhere. You walk in the store, and it may be on \nthe clock--a little promotional clock that says when the store is open \nand when the store is closed. They will be at eye level. They will be \nby the cashier when you check out. They will be everywhere--image after \nimage after image. It is calculated, and it works. Convenience stores \nare a place--right or wrong--where kids go. Seventy-five percent of \nkids visit convenience stores, as I said, at least once a week. That is \na target area.\n\n  This isn't just about advertising and marketing schemes. It is also \nabout to be manufacturers' failure to disclose the specific ingredients \nin their products.\n  I realize full well that tobacco users and nonusers alike recognize \nand understand that tobacco products are hazardous to their health. \nEverybody knows that. That is not what I am talking about. I am talking \nabout requiring the tobacco companies to list the ingredients in their \nproducts. They do not have to do that today. Tobacco is an unregulated \nproduct. I believe it makes common sense that tobacco companies should \nbe required to list when they put arsenic--and they do--or put \nformaldehyde or ammonia in the cigarettes. They should have to at least \nlist it. It just makes common sense. Yet the law today does not require \nthem to do that.\n  While simply listing the ingredients, toxic as they may be, might not \nseem like much, think about it this way. Current law makes sure that we \nknow what is in products designed to help people quit smoking--products \nsuch as the patch or the Nicorette gum, which are regulated, but not \nthe very product that gets people addicted in the first place, the \ncigarettes. Doesn't that seem absurd?\n  Think about it this way: Right now, the Food and Drug Administration \nrequires Philip Morris to print the ingredients in its Kraft Macaroni \nand Cheese. They have to print all of the ingredients. Pick up a box. \nEvery single ingredient that is in there they have to print but not the \ningredients in cigarettes, a product, by the way, that contributes to \nthe deaths of more than 440,000 people a year.\n  Right now the FDA requires Philip Morris, which owns Nabisco, to \nprint the ingredients contained in Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers but \nnot the ingredients in Camel or Winston cigarettes, even though \ncigarettes cause one-third of all cancer deaths and 90 percent of lung \ncancer deaths. It is unfathomable to me--and I think it is unfathomable \nto everybody--that we would require the listing of ingredients on these \nproducts. We even require the listing of the ingredients on bottled \nwater. Yet we do not require the listing of ingredients for one of the \nleading causes of death and disease in this country.\n  Right now, the FDA requires printed ingredients for chewing gum, \nlipstick, bottled water, and ice cream, but not for cigarettes--a \nproduct that causes 20 percent of all heart disease deaths, 90 percent \nof lung cancer, which is the leading cause of cancer deaths among \nwomen, and the leading cause of preventable death in the United States.\n  Another way to look at it is if a company wants to market a food \nproduct\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\nas ``fat-free'' or ``reduced-fat'' or ``lite,'' that company is \nrequired to meet certain standards regarding the number of calories or \nthe amount of fat grams in that product. You can look right on that \npackage and find it. Yet cigarette companies can call a cigarette a \n``Camel Light'' or a ``Marlboro Light'' and not reveal a thing about \nthe amount of tar or nicotine or arsenic in that supposedly ``light'' \ncigarette.\n  Not having access to all of the information about this deadly product \njust makes no sense. It is something we need to change. With the bill \nwe are introducing, we can change it.\n  It is time we finally give the FDA the authority it needs to fix \nthese problems. The legislation that Senator Kennedy and Senator Durbin \nand I are introducing will do just that.\n  First, the bill would make changes regarding tobacco advertising. It \nwould give the FDA authority to restrict tobacco industry marketing--\nconsistent with the first amendment--that targets our children.\n  Additionally, our bill would require advertisements to be in black \nand white text only, unless they are in adult publications, and would \ndefine adult publications in terms of readership.\n  Next, our legislation would give consumers more information about the \ningredients in tobacco products. Specifically, the bill would provide \nthe FDA with the ability to publish the ingredients of tobacco \nproducts.\n  It would require a listing of all ingredients, substances, and \ncompounds added by the manufacturer to the tobacco, to the paper, or to \nthe filter.\n  It would require a description of the content, delivery, and form of \nnicotine in each tobacco product.\n  It would require information on the health, behavioral, or \nphysiologic effects of the tobacco products.\n  Further, it would require tobacco companies to provide information on \nthe reduction of risk to health available through technology.\n  And finally, it would establish an approval process for all new \ntobacco products entering the market--new products such as advance with \nits ``trionic filter'', which claims to have--and I quote--``all of the \ntaste . . . less of the toxins'' of other cigarettes.\n  Obviously, we already know that smoking is a health risk. We all know \nthat. But, what we don't know about is the harm caused by or what \nadverse health effects are created by the other ingredients in tobacco \nproducts or by how the tobacco is burned. We do not know all the \ndetails about that. Tobacco companies should share that. There are \ntobacco products on the market that are not conventional cigarettes. \nThey have carbon filters running down the center of them. They are \nsophisticated products that burn tobacco differently, that affect the \nbody differently, and that may cause people to smoke them differently. \nThese are all things that should be examined, they should be reviewed, \nand they should be commented on by the Food and Drug Administration, so \nthe public knows what they are choosing to consume.\n  Here we have a pack of Eclipse cigarettes, which claims it will--and \nI quote--``Change the way you smoke.'' It also claims that it--and \nagain I quote--``may present less risk of cancer, bronchitis, and \npossibly emphysema.'' This is what they say in the bold print. I don't \nknow who ``they'' are, and I don't know where they got their \ninformation, but the public should know.\n  Below the bold print in this same pack is the following, smaller \nprint:\n\n       Evidence suggests that smokers who already have \n     cardiovascular disease and who switch to Eclipse may further \n     increase their health risk.\n\n  So in the bold print we have a statement that is not cited and not \nsupported, and then in the fine print we have a statement that is \nsupported by numerous studies. Which claim are you more likely to \nbelieve? And which statement should be broadcast in bold lettering to \nthe consumer?\n  By introducing this bill, we are finally saying we are not going to \nlet tobacco manufacturers have free rein over markets and consumers \nanymore.\n  Today, we are taking a step towards making sure the public gets \nadequate information about whether to continue to smoke or even to \nstart smoking in the first place. We all know it is dangerous. But the \ntobacco companies no longer should be able to hide all the facts.\n  With this bill, we are not just saying, ``Buyer beware''--we all know \nthere are dangers--but what we are saying is, ``Tobacco companies, be \nhonest.'' We are saying, ``Tobacco companies, stop marketing to our \nkids.'' We are saying, ``Tobacco companies, tell consumers about what \nthey are really buying.''\n  Madam President, it is time we hold these companies to the same \nstandards we expect from other producers. It is time to give kids a \nfighting chance when it comes to resisting cigarettes. It is time to \nfinally just do the right thing.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I join my friend and colleague from \nOhio, Senator DeWine, in expressing our appreciation to all of our \ncosponsors for this legislation that we have introduced. And I commend \nhim for the excellent presentation and description of the legislation \nthat he has just given to the Senate this morning.\n  We indicate to our friends and colleagues that this legislation is \nvery similar to the legislation that was included in the larger tobacco \nlegislation the Senate considered several years ago. It was not really \nsubject to any amendments that I remember during that period of time. \nThat overall legislation, I believe, gained 58 votes on the floor of \nthe Senate. So we had broad support for the legislation. In many \nrespects, I think there is even broader support for this particular \nlegislation.\n  So we are very hopeful we will be able to make progress in \nconsidering this legislation favorably in the Senate, and in the House, \nand have it become law. We have every intention of holding hearings \nand, hopefully a markup in July. I believe we will have very broad \nsupport from our colleagues for the reasons Senator DeWine has \noutlined.\n  This legislation is focused on children and what we can do to \ndiscourage children from becoming addicted to tobacco in this country. \nI will just take a very few moments to review the highlights.\n  Just very quickly, every day, 5,000 children try their first \ncigarette. More than 2,000 become new daily smokers. A third will die \nprematurely.\n  If the current trend continues, 6.4 million children, who are under \n18 years of age, will die prematurely from smoking related illness. \n400,000 people a year die from smoke related illness. We are telling \nthe youth of America their lives are going to be greatly shortened as a \nresult of this kind of addiction.\n\n  As I mentioned, 400,000 Americans die each year from smoke-caused \ndisease, and tobacco costs $75 billion in annual health care costs. \nThese are costs that are spent by Medicare, Medicaid, veterans \nhospitals, and expended privately.\n  Again, to give the focus of where the advertising is going, this \nchart shows the number of teens between 12 and 17 who were reached five \nor more times by tobacco advertising in the year 1999.\n  A March 2002 study asked teenagers and adults, ``have you seen any \nadvertising for cigarettes or spit tobacco in the last 2 weeks?'' For \nthe teenagers, 64 percent had seen advertising; while for adults, just \n27 percent.\n  What we are maintaining is that the industry is targeting children. \nThese are commercial surveys, and they substantiate our point.\n  The money that is being expended for these extraordinary advertising \nbudgets is targeted to teenagers, to effectively hook them and addict \nthem.\n  This chart shows the very substantial increase in promotional \nexpenditures from 1997 to the year 2000. As the chart showed, \nexpenditures totaled $5.660 billion in 1997 and increased to $9.5 \nbillion in the year 2000.\n  Over the last 5 years, it has virtually doubled. Where is it being \ntargeted? The children. Are the children seeing it? Yes. Are they \nbecoming more addicted? Yes. Is this really a national problem? Yes. \nCan we do something about it? Yes. Will this legislation do something \nabout it? Yes, because it incorporates many of the recommendations made \nby former heads of the FDA as well as from the many experts we have \nheard from at a range of hearings we have held.\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\n  The bottom line: If smoking rates do not decline, over 6 million \nchildren who are alive today under the age of 18 will suffer premature \ndeath.\n  This is a matter of enormous importance. It is of importance to \nfamilies, to parents, to children, and to our country. We have \ntargeted, responsible legislation to deal with this issue. We are \nserious about presenting it to the Senate, which we will do. We are \nlooking for broad support from the American people.\n  We are grateful for all of the public health agencies that support \nit: cancer, heart, lung, all of the various health-related agencies \nthat support this legislation. They are going to be strong allies.\n  Mr. Myers, who is with Tobacco Free Children, has done such an \nextraordinary job and has made this a high priority. We are serious \nabout it, and we hope to be able to help the families in this country \nby doing something about children being addicted to cigarettes.\n  This bill will give the Food and Drug Administration broad authority \nto regulate tobacco products for the protection of the public health. \nWe cannot in good conscience allow the federal agency most responsible \nfor protecting the public health to remain powerless to deal with the \nenormous risks of tobacco, the most deadly of all consumer products.\n  The provisions in this bill closely track those in the bipartisan \ncompromise reached during Senate consideration of comprehensive tobacco \ncontrol legislation in 1998. Fifty-eight Senators supported it at that \ntime. That legislation was never enacted because of disputes over \ntobacco taxation and litigation, not over FDA authority.\n  This FDA provision is a fair and balanced approach to FDA regulation. \nIt creates a new section in FDA jurisdiction for the regulation of \ntobacco products, with standards that allow for consideration of the \nunique issues raised by tobacco use. It is sensitive to the concerns of \ntobacco farmers, small businesses, and nicotine-dependent smokers. But, \nit clearly gives FDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth \nsmoking and to reduce addiction to this highly lethal product.\n  I believe that any attempt to weaken the 1998 language would \nundermine the FDA's ability to deal effectively with the enormous \nhealth risks posed by smoking. This concern is shared by a number of \nindependent public health experts. The bipartisan compromise agreed to \nin 1998 is still the best opportunity for Senators to come together and \ngrant FDA the regulatory authority it needs to substantially reduce the \nnumber of children who start smoking and to help addicted smokers quit. \nNothing less will do the job.\n  The stakes are vast. Five thousand children have their first \ncigarette every day, and two thousand of them become daily smokers. \nNearly a thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced \ndiseases. Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in the \nnation today. Cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand Americans \neach year. That is more lives lost than from automobile accidents, \nalcohol abuse, illegal drugs, AIDS, murder, suicide, and fires \ncombined. Our response to a public health problem of this magnitude \nmust consist of more than half-way measures.\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  The tobacco industry currently spends over nine billion dollars a \nyear to promote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways \ndesigned to tempt children to start smoking, before they are mature \nenough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk. The industry \nknows that more than 90 percent of smokers begin as children and are \naddicted by the time they reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' \nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Recent studies by the \nInstitute of Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the \nsubstantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people \nto use tobacco products. If we are serious about reducing youth \nsmoking, FDA must have the power to prevent industry advertising \ndesigned to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children. \nThis legislation will give FDA the ability to stop tobacco advertising \nwhich glamorizes smoking from appearing where it will be seen by \nsignificant numbers of children.\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and \nfrequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious \nenforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling \ntobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that \nchildren under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes.\n  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-\nyear rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will give \nthe youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA \nthe immediate force of law, as if they had been issued under the new \nstatute.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings will be more explicit in their description of the medical \nproblems which can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the \nauthority to change the text of these warning labels periodically, to \nkeep their impact strong.\n  Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say that \nit is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. \nNo one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under \noath before Congress as recently as 1994 that smoking cigarettes is not \naddictive. Overwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through \nthe discovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this \naddictiveness for decades, but actually relied on it as the basis for \ntheir marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers \nchemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even \nmore addictive.\n\n  The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These \ncompanies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far \nless hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product \ndesign seem far more significant for the health of the user than they \nactually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous \nauthority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest \ndisinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA regulate them for the protection of the public health. Over forty \nmillion Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible \npublic health official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban \nwould leave forty million people without a way to satisfy their drug \ndependency. FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help \naddicted smokers overcome their addiction, and to make the product less \ntoxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA \nmust have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from \ncigarettes, to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible. The \ninherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded.\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nThis legislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced \nrisk'' products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No \nhealth-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified \nto the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent \ndeceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public \ninto a false sense of health safety.\n  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. \nCongress must vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating \ntobacco products, but with full authority to do the job effectively.\n  This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs: To \nreduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets \nchildren; to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors; to help \nsmokers overcome their addiction; to make tobacco products less toxic \nfor those who continue to use them; and to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n  We cannot allow the tobacco industry to stop us from doing what we \nknow is right for America's children. I intend to do all I can to see \nthat Congress enacts this legislation this year. The public health \ndemands it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Kennedy and \nDeWine in support of legislation to empower the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, to regulate tobacco products.\n  During my time in the Senate, I have become very involved with \ncancer. I am the Co-Chair of the Senate Cancer Caucus and the Vice-\nChair of the National Dialogue on Cancer, which is Chaired by former \nPresident and Barbara Bush.\n  The cancer community is united in the belief that the single most \nimportant preventive measure is to place tobacco products under the \nregulatory control of the FDA. I stand behind the cancer community and \nexpress the same belief.\n  Smoking causes one-third of all cancers, and is the cause of \napproximately 165,000 deaths annually.\n  I firmly believe that cancer cannot be conquered without addressing \nsmoking and the use of tobacco products.\n  Smoking results in death or disability for over half of tobacco \nusers, according to the Centers for Disease Control, CDC. Smoking costs \nthe health care system over $70 billion annually.\n  Over the past two decades, we have learned that tobacco companies \nhave manipulated the level of nicotine in cigarettes to increase the \nnumber of people addicted to their product.\n  There are more than 40 chemicals in tobacco smoke that cause cancer \nin humans and animals, according to the CDC. Tobacco smoke has toxic \ncomponents, as well as tar, carbon monoxide and other dangerous \nadditives.\n  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and \ncurtail the marketing of these products to young people. I believe that \nempowering the FDA to regulate tobacco will help do that.\n  The U.S. Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention have unequivocally demonstrated that, for example, anti-\nsmoking campaigns can reduce smoking, a major cause of cancer.\n  California is a good example: My state started an aggressive tobacco \ncontrol program in 1989 and throughout the 1990s, tobacco use dropped \nat two to three times faster than the rest of the country.\n  Ninety percent of adult smokers begin before age 18 and every day, \n3,000 young people become smokers.\n  This bill will provide meaningful regulation by the Food and Drug \nAdministration of the content and marketing of tobacco products, \nespecially the addicting and carcinogenic components.\n  Dr. C. Everett Koop, former US Surgeon General, and Dr. David \nKessler, former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, in \n1997 report, cited FDA and other studies and said:\n\n       Nicotine in cigarettes and smokeless tobacco has the same \n     pharmacological effects as other drugs that FDA has \n     traditionally regulated . . . nicotine is extremely addictive \n     . . . and the vast majority of people who use nicotine-\n     containing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco do so to satisfy \n     their craving for the pharmacological effects of nicotine; \n     that is, to satisfy their drug-dependence or addiction.\n\n  They go to recommend that the ``FDA should continue to have authority \nto regulate all areas of nicotine, as well as other constituents and \ningredients, and that authority should be made completely explicit.''\n  I am pleased that to note that even the Philip Morris Companies has \nacknowledged the need for FDA to regulate tobacco. On their website, \nthey say:\n\n       We believe federal legislation that includes granting FDA \n     authority to regulate tobacco products could effectively \n     address many of the complex tobacco issues that concern the \n     public, the public health community and us.\n\n  It is long past time to reduce the addictive nature of cigarettes and \ncurtail the marketing of these products to young people. This bill \ngives FDA the power to regulate tobacco products' content, design, \nsale, and marketing.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2626\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of epic and worsening proportions that \n     results in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and \n     adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n     by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the sale, \n     promotion, and distribution of such products are needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products. The benefits \n     to the American people from enacting such legislation would \n     be significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $110,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 1999, the tobacco industry spent close to \n     $8,240,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco advertising \n     than adults, they smoke the most advertised brands, and \n     children as young as 3 to 6 years old can recognize a \n     character associated with smoking at the same rate as they \n     recognize cartoons and fast food characters.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text-only requirements, while not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (62 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the standards set forth in the amendments \n     made by this Act for the regulation of tobacco products by \n     the Food and Drug Administration and the restriction on the \n     sale and distribution, including access to and the \n     advertising and promotion of, tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations are substantially related to accomplishing \n     the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those product before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion plays a crucial role in the \n     decision of these minors to begin using tobacco products. \n     Less restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not \n     and will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed \n     by such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop and introduce less harmful \n     tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that adults are better informed, to \n     require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers; and\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry\n\n     SEC. 4. SCOPE AND EFFECT.\n\n       (a) Intended Effect.--Nothing in this Act (or an amendment \n     made by this Act) shall be construed to--\n       (1) establish a precedent with regard to any other \n     industry, situation, circumstance, or legal action; or\n       (2) affect any action pending in State, Tribal, or Federal \n     court, or any agreement, consent decree, or contract of any \n     kind.\n       (b) Agricultural Activities.--The provisions of this Act \n     (or an amendment made by this Act) which authorize the \n     Secretary to take certain actions with regard to tobacco and \n     tobacco products shall not be construed to affect any \n     authority of the Secretary of Agriculture under existing law \n     regarding the growing, cultivation, or curing of raw tobacco.\n\n         TITLE I--AUTHORITY OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n     SEC. 101.

Madam President, the first national observance of Flag Day \noccurred on June 14, 1877, when Congress ordered that the flag be flown \nover public buildings every June 14. June 14 officially became National \nFlag Day when President Truman signed an act of Congress on August 3, \n1949. This year marks the 225th anniversary of the signing of the Flag \nAct resolution on June 14, 1777. What a historic day this is, June 14. \nThe resolution was a model of simplicity in just 32 words:\n\n       Resolved that the flag of the United States be made of 13 \n     stripes, alternative red and white; that the Union be 13 \n     stars, white in a blue field, representing a new \n     constellation.\n\n  Thus, was our national flag established. The last phrase \n``representing a new constellation'' carries tremendous weight in just \nfour words. The new United States of America was truly a new \nconstellation in the firmament of nation states, and it blazes just as \nbrightly today, 225 years later.\n  The poet, Joseph Rodman Drake, said it best, in the ``American \nFlag.''\n\n     When freedom from her mountain height\n     Unfurled her standard to the air,\n     She tore the azure robe of night,\n     And set the stars of glory there.\n     She mingled with its gorgeous dyes\n     The milky baldric of the skies.\n     Then from his mansion in the sun\n     She called her eagle bearer down,\n     And gave into his mighty hand\n     The symbol of her chosen land.\n\n  So our flag, our standard, is known throughout the world and beyond. \nNo other flag flies on the face of the Moon. Our flag is instantly \nrecognizable in every capital and in the emptiest quarters of the \nworld. Even those who revile that flag, even those who would attack \nthat flag in our Nation, recognize America's dominant, even preeminent, \nrole in world affairs, symbolized by that flag.\n  There it stands. For over 200 years, the American flag has led the \nway. It took us west to California, a great State--one of whose \nSenators at this moment presides over the Senate with a degree of \ndecorum, aplomb and dignity that is so rare as a day in June.\n  Yes, it took us west to California, north to Alaska. It led brave men \nto the North and South Poles. It has flown atop Mount Everest. It has \nbeen emblazoned in the sides of deep-diving submarines. It has led \ncharges. It has held fast against terrible odds, and it has risen from \nthe ashes to soar over Iwo Jima and the World Trade Towers. In every \nbleak hour, the snap and the crack of that mighty banner has rallied \nour courage and given us hope.\n  Without words, the American flag instantly sums up all that is best \nabout our Nation: Our courage, our leadership, our generosity, our \ndetermination, our freedom.\n  That first Flag Act forever shaped our flag, but in the early years \nof the Nation, several variations existed for the Flag Act was not \nprecise about the exact arrangement of the stars. As new States joined \nthe Union, additional stripes, as well as additional stars, were added \nto the flag.\n  An act passed in 1794, for example, provided for 15 stripes and 15 \nstars after May 1795. By 1818, the flag was growing unwieldy, and a \nsubsequent act of April 4, 1818, signed by President Monroe, provided \nfor 13 stripes for the original 13 colonies and one star for each State \nto be added to the flag on the 4th of July following admission of each \nnew State to the Union.\n  Almost a century later on June 24, 1912, which is the year the great \nTitanic went down--1,570 people lost their lives that year on April 15, \n1912--\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\nan Executive Order of President Taft established the proportion of the \nflag and set the arrangement of the stars in six horizontal rows of \neight each, a single point of each star to be upward.\n  The continued expansion of the United States required further \nmodification to the flag, and an Executive Order of President \nEisenhower, dated January 3, 1959--I was here at that time--provided \nfor the arrangement of the stars in seven rows of seven stars each \nstaggered horizontally and vertically.\n  A quick schoolchild who knows his or her multiplication table, \nsometimes referred to as the times table, knows that 7 times 7 is 49.\n  With the addition of Hawaii to the Union in 1959, a further Executive \nOrder on August 21, 1959, was required to establish the flag as we know \nit today with the stars in nine rows staggered horizontally, and 11 \nrows staggered vertically.\n  Will the flag change again as it has in the past? I do not know. But \nsome things will never change. The love and respect that patriotic \nAmericans have for this chosen symbol of our native land will never \ndie, so long as the Government remains true to the spirit and the words \nof this Constitution, which I hold in my hand.\n\n  Equally immutable is the power of our flag to lift our hopes and our \nmorale. The blossoming of flags across the Nation on and after \nSeptember 11 has proved that Old Glory, Old Glory, Old Glory, the Stars \nand Stripes, by any name, is our own beloved flag. And there it stands \nin all its glory, beside the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  Madam President, hats off to the flag! That is the appropriate \nresponse to the sight of an American flag passing by. To my mind, no \none has ever said it better than Henry Holcomb Bennett, in his stirring \npoem ``The Flag Goes By.'' Let it be my salute and birthday salutation \nto the American flag.

Madam President, the Bible commands us to ``honor thy \nfather and thy mother.'' Last month, we honored mothers. It was \nmother's day. This month, this Sunday, it is the fathers' turn. On that \nday, we honor men in their role as fathers, not as any of the many \nother titles they may wear: not for their accomplishments at work, \nthough that is how many men define themselves; not for their \naccomplishments at home that are not family related, such as in their \nrole as gardeners or home builders or mechanics; but as fathers.\n  Fatherhood requires no special training, no advanced degree, but it \ndoes require a long commitment and a considerable level of effort. It \nis not always easy. It requires a certain warmth. It is not for the \nfaint-hearted or the self-centered. Though it has its hero moments, it \nis not a popularity contest. As a father, a man will hunt buggers, as \nthey used to say; buggers or monsters in closets on dark nights, \ninvestigate all strange sounds, and kill a lot of bugs and spiders. \nJust ask any father. He will be expected to know how to make volcanoes \nout of plaster of Paris and 2-liter soda bottles. He will become the \ninstant authority in all manner of arcane subjects like sports rules. \nHe will become the ultimate authority in all matters of discipline. \nFather will set, and enforce, limits and intimidate all prospective \nsuitors of his daughters. He becomes the man by whom all other men are \njudged. It is difficult to over-estimate the importance of a father \nfigure.\n  If you ask a child what he or she likes best about their father, they \nlikely will not mention the father's job. They won't comment on how \nnicely he mows the lawn, or how the car gleams, the chromium shines, \nthose fenders which mirror themselves. It is more likely to be that dad \nmakes funny faces--yes, that is what they will comment on, dad makes \nfunny faces--plays catch, makes waffles on Saturday mornings, or gives \npony rides on his shoulders. Maybe dad does a great cannonball jump \ninto the pool, maybe he cooks the best hamburgers on the grill, or \nmaybe he takes his kids fishing. It is those times that a father is \nmost engaged with his children that makes a moment special to a child. \nAs we grow older, we can appreciate the effort that fathers put into \ntheir jobs, so that they might provide for their families, but that \nappreciation only sweetens the treasured times when dad plays with his \nkids.\n  I have spoken many times about my dad. He was not my biological \nfather. But he was my biological father's sister's husband. He and my \naunt raised me as my mother died when I was a year old, a little less \nthan a year old, in the great influenza epidemic of 1918.\n  I was just reading last night a Senate hearing by the Appropriations \nCommittee on a resolution appropriating $1 million to fight influenza \nin 1918. That hearing was conducted in September of 1918. Less than 2 \nmonths later, my mother died of that influenza.\n  So she asked, per her wish, that my father's sister--he had eight or \nnine sisters, two or three brothers; there were large families in those \ndays--my mother's wish was that one of my father's sisters who had \nmarried Titus Dalton Byrd take me, the baby. I had three older brothers \nand a sister, but take me, the baby, and rear that baby. And so because \nof a mother's wish, my uncle, Titus Dalton Byrd, and his wife, my aunt, \nVlurma Byrd, took me to West Virginia from North Carolina, and there in \nthe coal fields of West Virginia they reared me. They took care of me. \nThey loved me. My memories are of that tall man, with a red mustache \nand the black hair, who went to the mines every day and worked hard for \nme and for his wife, my aunt--the only mother I ever knew. And he was \nthe only father I ever knew.\n\n  As a matter of fact, I didn't know that he wasn't my father until I \nwas a high school senior. In that year, 1934, this man whom I called my \ndad took me and sat me down and told me the story of how the influenza \nhad taken away my angel mother and how he and his wife, whom I knew as \nmy mom, had taken me as an infant, just a few days under 1 year old, \nand raised me.\n  And I can remember him, that old coal miner, honest as the day is \nlong. He had no enemies. When he died, he didn't owe any man a penny. \nHe was honest, as I say, as the day is long. He worked hard in the \nbowels of the Earth.\n  I never heard him use God's name in vain in all the years that I was \nwith him--never. I never heard him talk about his neighbor. I never saw \nhim sit down at the table and grumble at whatever was on the table, \nwhatever it was--never, ever a grumble.\n  As I say, I didn't know for a long time that Titus Dalton Byrd was \nnot my father. I called him Pap. He was my dad.\n  He was a quiet, hard-working man, worn down by the strenuous life of \na coal miner in the days before the mechanized and much safer practices \nof modern mining. He would come home--I see the coal dust sometimes in \nhis eyes. I see him coming down the railroad tracks. I see him coming \nhome from a hard day's work in the mines.\n  Many times in those mines the roof was so low that the miners had to \nwalk on their knees. They had knee pads and they would walk on their \nknees, sometimes working in waterholes, lifting that slate and lifting \nthe shovels of coal and heaving them into the coal car. They worked \nhard.\n  There was little hope for them, not much to look forward to in that \ncoal miner's life. Day after day, day after day, the same old grind, \nlifting that\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\ncoal, shoveling that coal into the coal car.\n  I would see him coming down the railroad tracks from afar. I would \nrun to meet him. As I came to him, I could see that tall man with the \nred mustache and the black hair set down his dinner pail on a crosstie. \nAs I came near, he would lift off the lid from that dinner pail. And \nwhen I came up to him, he would reach into that dinner pail and bring \nout a cake that my mom had bought, a 5-cent cake--a 5-cent cake from \nthe company store. He had taken it to work. He had taken it to eat for \nhimself, but he didn't eat it. He always saved the cake for me. He \nalways saved the cake for me.\n  What a man that was. I have met Presidents and Governors and \nSenators, Members of Congress and Kings and Shahs and Ambassadors--all \nthe great people of the Earth. In my time as majority leader, I met \nwith the Shah of Iran, the old Biblical country of Persia, just a few \nweeks before he left Iran forever. I met with him in his palace, just \nhe and I and his wife and my wife.\n  I met with the King of Saudi Arabia, the great royal family of Saudi \nArabia. I met with President Sadat, one on one. I met with Prime \nMinister Begin of Israel; President Assad of Syria; the King of Jordan. \nI knew the King's father. I met with Vice Premiere Deng, the real \nleader in Communist China. I met with President Brezhnev, down in the \nCrimea, just he and I sitting across the table, he with one person who \nwas an interpreter, I with an interpreter and one assistant, that was \nall, sitting down, in the Crimea. Brezhnev, he reminded me of an old \ncounty commissioner back in West Virginia. I bet there are some of \nthose county commissioners in Missouri, just oldtimers, people of the \nsoil, people of the Earth.\n\n  So I met with these people: Margaret Thatcher, the King of Spain, I \nmet with all this great array of world leaders.\n  Who was I? I was a country boy from southern West Virginia, a coal \nminer's son. But the greatest of all these people that I have met on \nEarth, one of the greatest--I knew he was great because I lived with \nhim--the greatest was my old coal miner dad, coal miner dad.\n  Well, I would walk along with him, kind of feeling grown up, you see. \nHere I was, a little old boy. He saved me a cake and then I would walk \non down to the house with him. I felt pretty grown up, walking with my \ndad.\n  So he always saved the cake for me. He never forgot to save me \nsomething. He would always give it to me with one of his quiet smiles. \nThose short walks were a special time just for us, and the memory of \nthem gives me a warm feeling to this day.\n  I have no doubt that there is a Heaven. I have no doubt that in that \nHeaven right today is that mother who died on the evening before \nNovember 11, 1918. And because of her wish, I am here today. If it \nhadn't been for her wish, that I be taken by Titus Dalton Byrd and his \nwife, I probably would have grown up in North Carolina. It is hard to \ntell what I might have amounted to but because of a mother's wish.\n  My dad was the one who gave me pencils and paper, drawing books and \nwatercolors at Christmas. He didn't give me a cowboy suit or a cap \nbuster. He gave me drawing tablets and watercolors, urged me to learn \nhow to draw and how to write and how to read. He was the one who bought \na violin for me and encouraged me to play.\n  The fiddle was a big gift in a day and place where there wasn't much \nmoney for frills. I got a lot of enjoyment out of that fiddle playing. \nAnd because of that fiddle, I really had a political advantage, and I \nwas advised by a Republican--as I told some of these fine pages here, \nearlier today--a Republican lawyer advised me to take that fiddle. He \nsaid: You take that fiddle, Bob, and everywhere you go you make that \nfiddle your briefcase. You play a tune or two and then you put that \nfiddle down and you give them a straight story on why you want to go to \nthe West Virginia Legislature. And quote a little poem or two, but they \nwill remember you because of that fiddle. Nobody else who is running \ncan play a fiddle. They will remember you not because of the fiddle but \nbecause it got their attention and caused them to remember you. But it \nis what you say that really counts.\n\n  I ran my first campaign for elected office. I was an underdog. I was \nvery young. I was unknown. I was untested. But my fiddle playing at \ncampaign stops got people's attention and left them with a memory \nassociated with my name. They were willing to listen to me talk as the \nprice for getting to hear me play.\n  So in that way you could say that my dad helped me to win an \nelection--my first election. He did, because he bought that fiddle for \nme. Without that fiddle, I wouldn't have won that first campaign, and \nprobably wouldn't have been reelected when I ran for the West Virginia \nSenate. I had to go into additional counties, and I took the fiddle \nthere. When I ran for the House of Representatives, there were \nadditional counties. I took the fiddle around.\n  So that was what my dad gave me--that fiddle. It was because of his \nand my mother's wish, you see, that I am here today. It is how far I \nwas influenced.\n  My dad also encouraged me in school. He did not want me to follow him \ninto the mines. He knew the dangers too well. He had seen those dangers \nup close. He had seen too many of his fellow coal miners killed. He had \nseen the men on the floor of the house with a piece of canvass \nstretched over them who had been run over by a motor, or executed by a \nfallen cable, or killed by falling slate. He had seen those dangers up \nclose. So he pushed me to do well in school. He wanted me to do well in \nschool. He encouraged me. He always wanted to see that report card. And \nthere was one category on the report card entitled ``deportment.'' He \nalways looked at that deportment. How well did Robert do in school? How \nwell does he mind the teacher? Does he do what the teacher says? Is he \na rowdy or is he not? He always watched that.\n  From him and from my aunt, I developed a love of learning that has \nlasted my whole life.\n  I was the first in all of my family--going back many generations to \nWilliam Sayle who settled in Virginia in 1657 on the banks of the \nRappahannock River. He was the ancient forbear of my father, my real \nfather, my biological father--I was the first in my family, going all \nthe way back to England, to go to college.\n  I am proud to say that my children and my children's children have \nexcelled in challenging academic fields. My grandson, Frederick, is a \nphysicist, following in his father's footsteps. I may be biased, but at \nthe rate my family is going I wouldn't be surprised if one of my great-\ngranddaughters won a Nobel Prize, thanks to the academic legacy \ninspired by my dad who himself had practically little or no schooling \nwhatsoever.\n  I know he must look down and be proud of all of us, just as we strive \nto make him proud.\n  I have another grandson who is a physicist also, Darius. I have a \ngrandson who is on one of the appropriations committees as a staff \nperson. I have a granddaughter who works in the Senate. I have a \ngranddaughter who lives in Leesburg. She is a wonderful granddaughter. \nThese daughters of mine and the grandchildren and now three great-\ngrandchildren--three are great-granddaughters--I have no doubt that \nthey will win some Nobel Prize or something even more worthy.\n  I know that I am not alone today in cherishing the memories of my \ndad--the man who raised me. Nor am I alone in seeing the reach that a \nfather's encouragement can have through many generations who cannot \nfeel the warm touch of that long-gone father's smile. History books are \nreplete with the stories of famous men and women who owed their start \nto some early encouragement from their fathers or their mothers.\n  Benjamin West, an early American painter, said, as I understand it, \nthat he owed his becoming a great painter to his mother--his angel \nmother--who, when he was a little infant, a little child, came to her \nwith his child's drawings of flowers and birds and showed his mother. \nShe would take him upon her knee and say, Benjamin, you will grow up to \nbe a great painter. And Benjamin West grew up to be a great painter. He \nsaid he was made a great painter by a mother's kiss. That is the way it \nis.\n  It is what we celebrate on Father's Day. It is not the work, it is \nnot the accomplishments, it is not the titles, it\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\nisn't the bank account that bring children home to visit with their \nfather and share a meal with him or send him a funny yet sentimental \ncard. The moments of a father's love made manifest--these are the \npieces of gold in memory's treasure chest. Those moments of joy, of \nlaughter, of mutual pride at being in the same family make the labors \nof the week drop away like a heavy winter coat in the warm rays of the \nsummer sun.\n  For myself, of course, and also for all fathers, I hope that this \nSunday is filled with family and with laughter and with warm feelings. \nLet us all look upon, think upon, and remember our fathers and our \nfather's father, and glory in their greatest and most lasting \nachievement--happy families.\n  Let us not forget that Biblical admonition, honor thy father and thy \nmother. We only have one of each. That is it. That is the sum total--\nonly one.\n  I close with the words of an unknown who wrote the ``Little Chap Who \nFollows Me.''\n  I am sure that my dad, although he never had the luxury of sitting in \na schoolroom reading that poem, the ``Little Chap Who Follows Me,'' \ncertainly in his life typified that poet's thought as a father who \nthinks of the ``Little Chap Who Follows Me.''\n  Many of the poems, like these simple little poems, have a message:\n\n     A careful man I ought to be;\n     A little fellow follows me;\n     I do not dare to go astray\n     For fear he'll go the self-same way.\n     I must not madly step aside,\n     Where pleasure's paths are smooth and wide,\n     And join in wine's red revelry\n     A little fellow follows me.\n\n     I cannot once escape his eyes;\n     Whate'er he sees me do, he tries--\n     Like me, he says, he's going to be;\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n     He thinks that I am good and fine,\n     Believes in every word of mine;\n     The base in me he must not see,\n     The little chap who follows me.\n\n     I must remember as I go,\n     Through summer's sun and winter's snow,\n     I'm building for the years to be,\n     A little fellow follows me.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/14/senate-section/article/S5621-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5621]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 17, 2002, AT 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
