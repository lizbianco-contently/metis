Madam President, I have applauded the actions of my \ncolleague, Senator Murkowski, as our senior Republican on the Energy \nCommittee. Because of my involvement in other matters, particularly \nappropriations, it has not been possible for me to be here to join him \nas much as I would like to do so.\n  I consider the opening of the coastal plain of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge area for environmentally sound oil and gas development \nto be the issue of highest national security we will vote on this year. \nThe President of the United States shares that view. I believe many in \nthis body do.\n  Last week President Bush said: It is in ``our national interest to \nget [an energy bill] to [his] desk.'' I am paraphrasing that. I believe \nthe vast majority of Americans share the President's view. Just last \nnight while speaking in Atlanta, President Bush called upon Congress to \nsend an energy bill to his desk again ``to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil.''\n  When the President said that, there was such a unanimous outpouring \nof support from the people in the audience. It was probably the loudest \nreaction to his whole speech.\n  I believe that is correct. It is a national concept and there is \nnational support for that goal. Today we still do not have a commitment \nto bring up and complete action on this energy bill. This morning I \nrise to again highlight some of the implications of failure to act now.\n  The stability of some of the nations principally responsible for \nsupplying oil to the United States can no longer be taken for granted. \nIn 1979, when the instability of the Middle East was of paramount \nconcern, we took action to protect Israel. As our major ally in the \nMiddle East, we should proceed with energy legislation not only to \nprotect our own interests but to ensure that we\n\n[[Page S11638]]\n\ncan continue to support Israel as we have agreed to do.\n  In 1979, our Government entered into a bilateral agreement with \nIsrael to ensure that Israel would have access to the oil it needs to \nmeet its daily requirements. Everyone in the Senate should be familiar \nwith that agreement. We understood then that some Middle Eastern \ncountries had the power to hold Israel hostage by denying access to \noil.\n  Let me read from a relevant portion of the agreement we signed with \nIsrael to protect its supply of oil:\n\n       If the oil Israel needs to meet all its normal requirements \n     for domestic consumption is unavailable for purchase . . . \n     the United States Government will promptly make oil available \n     for purchase by Israel to meet all of the aforementioned \n     normal requirements of Israel.\n\n  Our Government renewed that agreement in 1994 to ensure that Israel \nis protected through 2004. When we finally take up the comprehensive \nenergy bill, we should include an amendment to extend that agreement \nwith our Middle Eastern ally, Israel.\n  The point is, Israel produces less than 500 barrels of oil per day. \nIt consumes nearly 300,000 barrels of oil a day. Regardless of what \nhappens in the Middle East, Israel needs guaranteed access to oil just \nto maintain its economy. And regardless of what happens in the Middle \nEast, we have to be able to produce and provide to Israel at those \n300,000 barrels of oil per day in accordance with that agreement.\n  My understanding is that Alaska's oil is the oil that would fulfill \nthat agreement because it is the same quality of oil that Israel's \nrefineries run and could be run in those refineries without change.\n  Given our current dependence on foreign oil, and 57 percent of our \noil is imported, Middle Eastern supplies of oil are unstable as far as \nwe are concerned. We have to have a way to fulfill the commitment we \nhave made to Israel, our primary ally in that part of the world.\n  Our own vulnerability to protect unstable oil supplies is a national \nsecurity issue for us. Think what it is for Israel.\n  I am deeply disturbed about our continued reliance upon Saddam \nHussein's oil. We are using more than 700,000 barrels of oil per day in \nthis country imported from Iraq. From press reports, we know that one \nof Osama bin Laden's goals is to overthrow the House of Saud and to \ngain access to the vast oil reserves in Saudi Arabia.\n  How secure would those supplies be if that unfortunate event should \ntake place? Today Saudi Arabia is the largest single supplier of oil to \nthe United States. We import over 1.8 million barrels a day from Saudi \nArabia.\n  At the height of the Persian Gulf War, 2.1 million barrels a day were \nsent through the Alaska oil pipeline. In the time of need, then we had \noil to produce. Today, we send just over 1 million barrels a day \nthrough that pipeline because we don't have the production necessary to \nfill the pipeline. Today, our pipeline is half full as the production \nat Prudhoe Bay declines. As it declines, we send more American money to \nSaddam Hussein to buy his oil.\n\n  We must consider the implications of our Government having just \nrecalled our Ambassador to Venezuela as we consider the stability of \nour oil supplies. For those who missed it, let me quote from a November \n6 story in the Wall Street Journal discussing Venezuela:\n\n       Relations have deteriorated steadily since the September 11 \n     terrorist attacks on the United States. President Chavez and \n     his ministers have made what U.S. officials have described as \n     ``contradictory'' and ambiguous statements. In the most \n     recent incident, Mr. Chavez last week criticized U.S. bombing \n     raids in Afghanistan during a televised speech. . . . \n     Venezuela is especially important because it is one of the \n     top three suppliers of oil to the United States market. . .\n\n  Madam President, this is the same President Chavez who was the first \nhead of state to break the multilateral sanctions on Iraq by visiting \nSaddam Hussein after the gulf war. No wonder President Bush has \nrecalled our Ambassador for consultations. Keep in mind that nearly 1.6 \nmillion barrels of oil per day come to the United States from \nVenezuela, and they are subject to the control of President Chavez.\n  When we talk of potentially unstable sources of crude oil, we cannot \nignore Iraq. My colleague, Senator Murkowski, has continued to remind \nthe Senate that the United States now imports 700,000 barrels of crude \noil per day from Saddam Hussein. As I said last week, by the end of the \nyear, we will have imported 230 million barrels of oil from Iraq. Over \n40 million barrels of that oil went to California to replace oil that \nCalifornia used to get from Alaska. At $20 per barrel, Americans will \nsend over $5 billion to Saddam Hussein's terrorism machine by this \nChristmas--$5 billion, and hundreds of thousands of jobs that we don't \nhave now because we don't have permission to increase production to \ncontinue filling the Alaska pipeline daily.\n  This year, we have thousands of American troops stationed in the \nMiddle East and around Afghanistan. They risk their lives to protect \nour interests and our security. I believe we must do something about \nour growing dependence on these potentially unreliable supplies of oil. \nWe must begin to explore for oil in our own country, and we know where \nthe largest potential supply of oil is. It is in the Coastal Plain of \nAlaska. We just need the opportunity to go get it.\n  The Energy Information Agency released a new report last week \ndetailing all of the proven reserves in the United States. That report \nsays in the entire State of Texas there are now 5.27 billion barrels of \nproven reserves. Texans don't like me to remind them, but that State is \nless than half the size of Alaska.\n  The House-passed energy bill, H.R. 4, contains authorization for oil \nproduction in the Coastal Plain of ANWR. That Coastal Plain, as \ndesignated by the Jackson amendment in the 1980 act, is 1.5 million \nacres, and it is estimated to contain a minimum of 5.7 billion barrels \nof oil, with a very good possibility, I am told, of recovering up to 16 \nbillion barrels of oil--enough to fill the Alaska pipeline for another \nthree decades and beyond.\n  Madam President, people forget when I stood here on the floor and \nurged approval of the Alaska oil pipeline, the estimate for production \nfrom Prudhoe Bay was 1 billion barrels. This year, we have produced the \nthirteen-billionth barrel of oil from Prudhoe Bay. These estimates are \nalways on the very conservative side.\n\n  The House energy bill limits oil production to just 2,000 acres of \nthe 1.5 million-acre area. Remember, the million and a half acres was \nset aside for oil and gas exploration. Now, if the oil in ANWR could \nreplace our imports from Iraq, Saudi Arabia, or Venezuela--and that is \npossible--it could produce enough oil to replace at least one of our \nthree largest suppliers. Can anyone really doubt that this is an issue \ninvolving our national security?\n  Madam President, as we approach Veterans Day, I am proud to stand \nhere as a World War II veteran and applaud the veterans groups of our \ncountry. They understand the vulnerabilities of our country. They \nunderstand the importance of reducing our reliance on the Middle East \nand increasing our domestic production.\n  I want to quote from two recent letters. This is an October 26 letter \nfrom the National Commander of AMVETS:\n\n       Our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the United \n     States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-exporting \n     countries, many existing in the unpredictable and highly \n     dangerous Persian Gulf. . . .Passage of H.R. 4 would greatly \n     assist in our ability to secure a more dependable and \n     diversified domestic supply of energy.\n\n  And I would note that since the Persian Gulf war our security has \nbecome more threatened with our dependence on foreign sources of oil \ngrowing from 35 percent of domestic supply to nearly 60 percent. AMVETS \nfirmly believes we cannot wait for the next crisis before we act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. In an October 25 letter, the National Commander of the \nAmerican Legion said:\n\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the U.S. on imported oil. \n     During times of crisis, such reliance threatens our national \n     security and economic well-being. It is important that we \n     develop domestic sources of oil, contained within our public \n     lands--such as the supplies within the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n\n\n[[Page S11639]]\n\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that letter and additional letters be printed \nin the Record after these remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, action is required now to protect our \nnational security. The advice of these veterans groups representing the \nvoices of all men and women who have fought for our freedom should be \nfollowed. Their advice to increase our economic security by opening the \nCoastal Plain of ANWR needs to be adhered to.\n  The advice of organized labor, which wants to see us create hundreds \nof thousands of jobs by opening this Coastal Plain of ANWR, is also \ncompelling.\n  Israel needs even greater assurance that we can fulfil our \nobligations to meet her energy needs. In short, responding to these \nrequests and to the President of the United States to promote our \nnational security by passing the comprehensive energy bill, H.R. 4, \ncontaining authorization to proceed to use 2,000 of the 1.5 million \nacres of ANWR, should be our No. 1 goal before we leave for the \nholiday.\n  Passing a comprehensive energy bill that contains environmentally \nsound provisions by producing the largest single potential oilfield on \nthe North American Continent is a goal of most Americans. If we act \nnow, our men and women serving overseas will know that we stand behind \nthem.\n  Passing this bill before we go home for the holiday will tell \nfamilies from New England to Minnesota that the fuel oil they burn in \nthe future, after our Arctic Plain begins to produce, is American oil, \nnot oil from Saddam Hussein, from Iraq, or from any of these unstable \nsources.\n  In short, I believe we must act before we go home for this holiday so \nwe will know we have acted to protect the security of our Nation, our \ntotal national security. A filibuster against a national security issue \ninvolving energy has never taken place in this Chamber. It did not take \nplace when the oil pipeline was built, and there was severe, even \nworse, opposition at that time than there is now. That pipeline passed \nby one vote, the vote of the Vice President of the United States.\n  The opponents at that time knew they could filibuster, but they did \nnot because it was a matter of national security. I call upon the \nSenate to recognize the tradition of this body and not filibuster a \nnational security issue as we raise H.R. 4 next week.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article by the eminent Charles \nKrauthammer from today's Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Nov. 9, 2001]\n\n                         War and the Polar Bear\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       So you thought that Sept. 11 changed everything, that the \n     era of game-show frivolity, ``Survivor'' silliness and \n     general self-indulgence had given way to an era of \n     seriousness. Well, not quite. Here we are, for the second \n     time in a decade, risking American lives in a war against an \n     enemy fueled and fed by oil money. Here we are again decrying \n     our dependence on oil from a particularly unstable, \n     unfriendly part of the world. Here we are in desperate need \n     of both energy conservation and new energy production. And \n     here we see (in the Oct. 30 Post) that we may be prevented \n     from drilling in the single most promising area on this \n     continent because of a . . . polar bear treaty: ``New Species \n     Enters Debate on Arctic Oil; Polar Bear Agreement Cited by \n     Drilling Foes.''\n       Now, I like polar bears as much as the next guy. I like \n     pandas and caribou and all the furry cuddlies on God's good \n     earth. But I also like people, particularly Americans, and \n     particularly American soldiers. And I do not like seeing them \n     shot and killed in wars that would be both more avoidable and \n     more winnable were we not so disastrously dependent on energy \n     supplies from a nasty part of the world with nasty people who \n     use our oil money for nasty purposes.\n       At a time when Washington should be working on a crash \n     program of conservation and new drilling, a six-year-old \n     report from the Fish and Wildlife Service is leaked in the \n     hope that a 28-year-old polar bear treaty might derail \n     drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Outrage! \n     ``This is a classic Bush administration strategy of running \n     roughshod over international agreements,'' charged Kieran \n     Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological \n     Diversity and leaker of the report. The Interior Department \n     stoutly maintains that the polar bear agreement does not \n     prohibit oil exploration. Alaska's Sen. Frank Murkowski \n     points out that the 25,000 or so Arctic polar bears that he \n     represents seem to be quite happily lolling around the \n     existing oil drilling in Alaska.\n       I too have little doubt that the polar bears will do fine, \n     just as the caribou have thrived around the Prudhoe Bay \n     field. But the whole debate is surreal. We are at war, are we \n     not? Americans are fighting. In Washington and New York, \n     nearly 5,000 have already been killed. Fifteen of the 19 \n     murderers were Saudi. Their leader is Saudi. Most of their \n     money is Saudi. And that same Saudi money funds the \n     madrassas, the fundamentalist religious schools where poor \n     Pakistani, Afghan and Arab children are inducted into the \n     world of radical Islam and war against the American infidel. \n     And yet we bow and scrape to the Saudis. We beg and borrow. \n     We tolerate their deflecting onto America the popular hatred \n     that would otherwise be directed at their own corruption. \n     Why? Because we need their oil.\n       The war on terrorism will be fought in many places. Alaska \n     is one. We have known since 1973 that we need to reduce our \n     dependence on Persian Gulf oil. But we have never been \n     serious. It was assumed that Sept. 11 would make us serious. \n     Instead, we are engaged in exegeses on polar bear mating \n     habits and a ridiculous debate that pits conservation vs. \n     drilling. Why one and not the other is beyond me. Of course \n     we need conservation. I have been an advocate of a dollar-a-\n     gallon gasoline tax for 20 years. Whatever it takes: auto \n     efficiency standards, higher taxes, incentives for new fuels.\n       But why stop there? We need more oil still. Every \n     additional barrel that substitutes domestic oil for foreign \n     oil is a victory. Drilling in the Arctic will involve less \n     than 1 percent of the Arctic Refuge. It might produce an \n     additional million barrels a day. The sea of natural gas \n     beneath could be the largest in North America. And yet the \n     Luddites stand firm, as if Sept. 11 never happened. Sen. John \n     Kerry vows a filibuster if anyone dares legislate Arctic \n     drilling.\n       Imagine where we would be if those railing against Arctic \n     drilling today had prevailed 30 years ago and stopped Prudhoe \n     Bay. The million barrels a day we now get from Alaska would \n     be coming from Saudi Arabia. We would be even more in their \n     debt and under their thumb. A concerned citizenry is yearning \n     to do something significant for the war effort on the home \n     front. But this is not World War II. We do not need rubber. \n     We do not need war bonds. We do not need Rosie riveting. We \n     desperately do need energy independence. And that is a home-\n     front battle: conservation--and a willingness to disturb a \n     few acres of snow in a vast wilderness as remote as \n     Afghanistan.\n       There's a war on, senators. Lets get serious.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                       AMVETS,\n\n                                     Lanham, MD, October 26, 2001.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, The U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: On behalf of AMVETS, I am writing to \n     encourage you to bring H.R. 4, the Securing America's Future \n     Energy Act of 2001, before the full Senate for consideration \n     at the earliest possible moment prior to the close of the 1st \n     Session of the 107th Congress.\n       As you know, our current reliance on foreign oil leaves the \n     United States vulnerable to the whim of individual oil-\n     exporting countries, many existing in the unpredictable and \n     highly dangerous Persian Gulf. And it cannot be overstated \n     that energy supplies touch nearly every aspect of our lives \n     from our economy to our national security.\n       Passage of H.R. 4 would greatly assist in our ability to \n     secure a more dependable and diversified domestic supply of \n     energy. And, I would note that since the Persian Gulf War our \n     security has become more threatened with our dependence on \n     foreign sources of oil growing from 35 percent of domestic \n     supply to nearly 60 percent.\n       AMVETS firmly believes that we cannot wait for the next \n     crisis before we act. H.R. 4, as approved by the House, is a \n     critical part of an overall policy America requires to \n     promote dependable, affordable, and environmentally sound \n     production and distribution of energy for the future. We urge \n     your expedited approval of this legislation.\n           Dedicated to service,\n                                               Joseph W.

Tom Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: We write today out of a sense of \n     urgency concerning our national security, as it relates to \n     our need for energy independence. The development of \n     America's domestic energy resources is vital to our national \n     security. We respectfully urge you to adopt the provisions \n     contained in H.R. 4, the ``Securing America's Future Energy \n     Act of 2001.''\n       War and international terrorism have again brought into \n     sharp focus the heavy reliance of the United States on \n     imported oil. During times of crises, such reliance threatens \n     our national security and economic well being. The import of \n     more than 50 percent of our petroleum from the Persian Gulf \n     further compounds our foreign trade balance at a time when \n     our energy demands continue unabated. It is important that we \n     develop domestic sources of oil, contained within our\n\n[[Page S11640]]\n\n     public lands--such as the supplies within the Arctic National \n     Wildlife Refuge.\n       Working for a comprehensive energy policy and achieving \n     responsible energy independence are critical national \n     security and economic goals. H.R. 4, as passed by the House \n     of Representatives, is a major step forward to achieving \n     these imperative goals. We strongly urge your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J.

We applaud the \n     House of Representatives for its bipartisan work in \n     addressing our energy vulnerability by passing H.R. 4. We \n     believe the Senate should consider and vote on H.R. 4 so that \n     our nation has an energy plan for the future and can move \n     forward quickly with a comprehensive plan to develop our \n     domestic energy resources.\n       Keeping in mind the horrific events of September 11 and \n     mindful of the threats we are facing, we strongly believe \n     that the development of America's domestic energy resources \n     is a vital national security priority. We need to take steps \n     to reverse our growing dependence on Middle East oil as \n     quickly as possible. By passing H.R. 4, the Senate will be \n     supporting our troops serving in combat on Operation Enduring \n     Freedom, the American people, and our national security with \n     a comprehensive energy legislation that is desperately needed \n     to diversify the energy supply for our country and chart a \n     course for the future.\n       The VFW strongly urges the Senate to consider and vote on \n     H.R. 4 as passed in the House in this session of Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

Daschle opposes the bill's \n     provision allowing oil drilling in part of ANWR.\n       Secretary of Veterans Affairs Anthony J. Principi and \n     Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK), Larry Craig (R-ID), Rick \n     Santorum (R-PA) and George Voinovich (R-OH)--who all support \n     the energy legislation--joined the veterans groups at a news \n     conference today.\n       American Legion National Commander Richard J. Santos wrote \n     in his letter to Daschle: ``War and international terrorism \n     have again brought into sharp focus the heavy reliance of the \n     United States on imported oil. During times of crises, such \n     reliance threatens our national security and economic well \n     being . . . . It is important that we develop domestic \n     sources of oil, contained within our public lands--such as \n     the supplies within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.''\n       Robert E. Wallace, executive director of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars, wrote Daschle: ``By passing H.R. 4, the Senate \n     will be supporting our troops serving in combat on Operation \n     Enduring Freedom, the American people and our national \n     security with a comprehensive energy legislation that is \n     desperately needed to diversify the energy supply for our \n     country and chart a course for the future.''\n       J. Eldon Yates, chairman and founder of the Vietnam \n     Veterans Institute wrote Daschle: ``The development of \n     America's domestic energy resources is vital to our national \n     security. We respectfully urge you to immediately pass H.R. \n     4, the comprehensive energy legislation . . . . Following the \n     horrific events of September 11, 2001, failure to pass this \n     bill would pose a threat to our people, our economy, and our \n     national security, that we all wore the uniform to \n     maintain.''\n       Also attending the news conference was Roger Thomas, 81, of \n     Frederick, MD, who was a Navy radioman at Kaneohe Bay near \n     Pearl Harbor when Japanese warplanes dropped bombs around him \n     on December 7, 1941. Thomas was uninjured and went on to fly \n     combat missions in World War II. ``The terrorist attacks of \n     September 11 were worse than the attack on Pearl Harbor, \n     because unarmed civilians were murdered and many more died,'' \n     Thomas said. ``In World War II, America could produce all the \n     oil we needed to fight back and defeat our enemies in battle, \n     but today we're in a dangerous situation because we rely on \n     other countries to provide our oil.''\n       Today's military uses far more fuel than in past wars. For \n     example, the 582,000 U.S. military personnel in the Persian \n     Gulf War in 1991 consumed more oil on a daily basis than the \n     2 million men of the Allied armies that liberated Europe in \n     World War II.\n       The United States gets about 55 percent of its oil from \n     foreign nations--up steadily over the years from almost \n     nothing during WWII, to 36 percent in 1973 and 46 percent as \n     recently as 1991. America sends about $100 billion a year to \n     foreign nations to pay for imported oil.\n       Experts believe ANWR may contain the largest supply of oil \n     ever found in American history--an estimated 16 billion \n     barrels of recoverable oil, which could be turned into 742 \n     billion gallons of gasoline. That's the equivalent of total \n     U.S. gasoline consumption for nearly six years.\n       According to an analysis by Wharton Econometrics \n     Forecasting Associates, development of oil reserves in the \n     coastal plain of ANWR could create as many as 736,000 jobs in \n     the United States--most of them outside Alaska--and pump \n     billions of dollars into the U.S. economy.\n       ANWR covers 19.6 million acres, but the energy legislation \n     before the Senate would open up only 1.5 million acres to \n     exploration. Just a tiny fraction of that--about 2,000 acres \n     of surface land--would experience oil drilling activity if \n     oil were found.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Statement of Our Nation's Veterans Groups\n\n\n       ``Our Domestic Energy Security is Our National Security''\n\n       We, the undersigned, representing our nation's veterans, \n     strongly believe that the development of America's domestic \n     energy resources is a vital national security priority. The \n     horrific events of September 11, 2001, constitute a threat to \n     our people, our economy, and our nation's security.

Madam President, President Bush's speech to the American \npeople last night was exactly the right medicine. America is truly \nconcerned over terrorism and bioterrorism and what it means to our \ncountry.\n  I listened carefully to the President's speech in Atlanta, GA. I \nthought he struck the right tone. As concerned as we are--and we should \nbe concerned--we take heart in the fact that this country has been \nstrengthened by this crisis and this challenge. We have come together \nin what has been called the ``re-United States of America.''\n  Many people understand patriotism from a different perspective than \nthey did just a few weeks ago. We stand in awe, in respect, and in \nadmiration of many heroes in America. The President acknowledged them \nlast night--the firefighters in New York City and across America, the \npeople who are in law enforcement, medical rescue teams, teachers, \npostal workers, and of course the men and women in uniform who daily \nput their lives on the line for America. It is appropriate that we \nremember them as we try to wrestle with our personal concerns about \nsafety and security since September 11.\n  I thought the President struck just the right chord in calling on \nAmerica to bring out the very best in our Nation.\n  Within the last several weeks, Congress has been called on by the \nPresident many times to provide him with the authority and the \nresources to deal with this crisis. Without exception, Congress has \nresponded in a strong bipartisan manner in an effort to make certain \nthe President and certainly the armed services have all they need to \nexecute this war effectively.\n  This week, the Senate considered the intelligence authorization bill \nwhich gives additional resources to the intelligence community. This is \nan important component of our effective defense of America and defense \nof our values. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I know \nfull well that one of the most heartening events that has occurred \nsince September 11 is the fact that countries around the world are now \ncooperating with the United States in fighting terrorism. Some of those \ncountries, which have been our closest allies for years, frankly, did \nnot take this subject as seriously as they should have. Now they do. As \nthey cooperate with us, we have an opportunity to reach out and try to \nstop the spread of terrorism across the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11641-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONFLICT DIAMONDS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, yesterday I had a press conference with \ntwo of my colleagues, Senator DeWine of Ohio and Congressman Tony Hall \nof Ohio as well. We are cosponsors of legislation which deals with a \nphenomenon that has become increasingly important in this discussion.\n  It is not enough we search out Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants in \ntheir caves in Afghanistan and stop those cells of terrorist activity \naround the world. We have to find a way to starve them of the assets \nand resources they need to succeed. The President made it clear this \nweek that this has to be an immediate response by the United States. So \nas part of antiterrorism, we have created new authority to deal with \nmoney laundering--money laundering and transfers of money that have \nbeen used to finance the terrorist network.\n  A little over a week ago, though, we came to learn that there was \nanother source for the terrorist operation. That source is diamonds. It \nappears that in west Africa in particular, and in Sierra Leone, where \nterrorist organizations have taken control of the production of \ndiamonds, they are not only using these diamonds to promote their \nterrorism in west Africa, but they are exchanging these diamonds in \ninternational commerce among terrorist groups.\n  In Sierra Leone and other countries, we have seen absolutely barbaric \nconduct by these terrorists in west Africa. We have seen people who \nhave been killed and mutilated, hundreds if not thousands of people who \nfaced amputations of their hands, arms, legs, and feet as terrorist \npayback for their lack of loyalty to the terrorist cause.\n  How do these terrorists keep moving along? They are mining diamonds \nwhich eventually find their way into some of the most comfortable, \ndemocratic, and peaceful parts of this world.\n  We have introduced legislation, the Conflict Diamonds Act, which will \nrequire a certification of the country of origin for diamonds so we can \nstarve out the diamonds that are coming out of west Africa and other \nplaces where they are supporting terrorism.\n  This is so important. It was important before September 11. It is \nmore important now because we have come to learn that Osama bin Laden \ngathered these diamonds before September 11 as his way of bankrolling \nhis terrorist operation. Diamonds do not leave a paper trail. A person \nwith a handful of diamonds worth many thousands of dollars can stick \nthem in his pocket or in a purse or in a packet and move through any \nmetal detector, any security device undetected. That is a reality.\n  We have joined in a bipartisan fashion with the jewelry industry and \nwith the diamond industry to promote the conflict diamonds bill to stop \nthis illicit terrorist trade in diamonds.\n  The United States plays such a critical role when it comes to this \nissue. We in the United States import 65 percent of all the diamonds in \nthe world. If we put strong standards in place and our allies who have \njoined us in this war against terrorism also pass similar standards, we \ncan starve off a source of money, a source of terrorism that is clearly \nbecoming rampant, even as we speak.\n  Diamonds have always been a symbol of enduring love. Unfortunately, \ntoday they have become the currency of terrorism. I know the House Ways \nand Means Committee had a hearing on this bill last week. I am happy \nthe Senate passed this bill earlier this year, and we are going to have \nto address it again.\n  I call on all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to consider \nthis a matter of great urgency and join us in a bipartisan fashion. \nSenator Feingold, Senator DeWine, I, Congressman Tony Hall, and \nCongressman Frank Wolf, in a true bipartisan fashion, have tried to \nmove this important issue forward.\n\n  I close on this issue by giving special credit to Congressman Tony \nHall, who has been a leader on this for years--not for months but for \nyears. It is his good work that has brought us to this point. I am \nhappy to be an ally of Tony Hall in any cause, but when it comes to a \ncause of this importance, I hope my colleagues will take a close look \nat this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11641-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11641-S11642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMERICA'S ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as part of the challenge facing America \ntoday, we have to consider the state of America's economy, and it is a \nsad state of affairs. After almost 10 years of unparalleled prosperity \nin the history of the United States, during the past year we have seen \nterrible things occur--a massive growth in unemployment. The number of \npeople who have been laid off across America is now reaching, \nunfortunately, historic levels. Last month saw the biggest 1-month \nincrease in unemployment in 21 years. Nearly 7\\1/2\\ million Americans \nare now out of work, and the economists have warned us that a 1 or 2 \nmillion more may be losing their jobs over the next 12 months. Small \nand large businesses have faced this.\n\n  A friend of mine who deals with bankruptcies has told me we will be \nshocked as we hear the names of the major corporations and businesses \nwhich are going to go bankrupt in the near future. It is a fact of life \nthis downturn in the economy is touching us in virtually every area of \nAmerican life.\n  This is a time of year when many American businesses hope to show \ntheir greatest profit and success. This retail season around the \nholidays means so much to companies across America. Unfortunately, the \nsales are slow and the indication is clear that the American people are \nholding back. It is an understandable impulse on\n\n[[Page S11642]]\n\ntheir part, understandable because they are not certain of their own \nstability in their job or their small business. They are uncertain \nabout the future of our economy and, of course, the war which we are \nwaging has led people to have a certain personal austerity, a little \nless flamboyance when it comes to their lifestyle. It is \nunderstandable. It reflects the spirit of sacrifice.\n  So what we need to do in Congress is to consider what it will take to \nturn this around. How can we breathe life back into this economy and \nget it moving forward? They have called it an economic stimulus package \nor an economic recovery package. Whatever the description, it is clear \nto me Congress should do something and do it immediately.\n  Several weeks ago, I called together business and labor leaders in my \nhome State of Illinois, in the city of Chicago. Some of the largest \ncorporations were represented, as well as small businesses and labor \nunions, and I said to them: Tell me what the problem is as you see it; \nwhat do you think the solution should be.\n  They came amazingly to a consensus. Seated around this table were \nDemocrats and Republicans and Independents, people in labor, people in \nbusiness. They said: It is our impression we have too much production \nin America and not enough consumption. There are too many cars and \nrefrigerators and washers and dryers waiting for buyers. So we need to \ngive the American people the resources and the confidence to take \nmoney, go to the store, and make an important purchase. They said that \nconsumer confidence is critical to any kind of economic stimulus; focus \non the consumers.\n  Secondly, they said to do it in a hurry because if there is going to \nbe an impact on this economy, do not wait. Congress has a tendency to \nidentify problems and then spend months, if not years, waiting to \nrespond. Well, when it comes to the economy, we cannot afford to do \nthat.\n  The third thing they said is, do not do anything today that you will \nregret tomorrow. Make this a temporary fix so when it is all over, we \nwill not have a problem we have to cope with for years to come.\n  This is the advice of a diverse group of people who came together in \nChicago. It is exactly the same advice which we have been given on \nCapitol Hill. Economist after economist has come into this building and \ntold us, these are the three things: Help the consumers move forward, \ndo it quickly, and do not do anything that will jeopardize the economy \nin the long run.\n\n  So how do we achieve that? Well, it is very clear to me if we want to \nmove the economy forward and help consumers, we ought to focus on those \nindividuals in our economy who are most likely, with additional \nresources, to spend them.\n  My basic course in economics, which I took many years ago at \nGeorgetown, said people in lower and middle-income groups will spend \ntheir money and do it more quickly, and they are more likely to spend \nit than those in higher income categories.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

It is a 10-minute limitation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In response to the Senator from Alaska, I gave the same \naccommodation to his colleague who just left, who asked for additional \ntime to speak, but I do not want to keep anyone from catching their \nplane.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. My concern was to accommodate the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to accommodate my colleague from Missouri, too. I \nyield 5 minutes to her and then ask for an additional 10 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11642-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11642-S11643]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REVITALIZING THE AMERICAN ECONOMY\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Alaska and \nmy colleague from Illinois for their kindness this morning.\n  I add my voice to those who believe we must act quickly to revitalize \nthe American economy. Even before the terrorist attacks, our economy \nwas slowing down. New reports now indicate the unemployment rate is \nrising, that consumer confidence is low, and that businesses are \npostponing investments. The convergence of these important indicators \nspells trouble for us in the months ahead. That is why Congress must \nact now.\n  The American people expect us to find solutions. All across America, \nthe fires of patriotism are burning brightly while in the Congress we \nsmolder in indecision. In fact, we in this Congress can learn from the \nunity and patriotism of the American people. They want us to work \ntogether across party lines to do the urgent business of this Nation.\n  Leading economists in the country have repeatedly told us what needs \nto be done. We can jump-start our sluggish economy, we are told, by \nproviding immediate tax relief and economic assistance targeted to \nthose who are most likely to invest and spend. These economists have \nalso warned us that if we abandon fiscal discipline, long-term interest \nrates will rise. It is time for us to heed their sensible advice.\n  The Democratic and Republican leaders of the Budget Committee in both \nthe House and the Senate have laid out very useful principles for an \neffective stimulus package. They all agree the legislation ought to be \nimmediate, it should be temporary, and it should be focused on \nindividuals and businesses most likely to spend the stimulus dollars. I \nbelieve if we abide by these bipartisan principles, we can craft a \nstimulus package that would give a boost to the American economy, and \nwe can do that without jeopardizing our long-term fiscal health.\n  Using these guidelines, we can craft a package that will garner \nsupport from both parties and one that President Bush can sign quickly. \nOur goal is to get the Nation back to work again and back to growing \nagain. By getting cash into the hands of businesses, we can create new \njobs and new investments in plants and equipment.\n  A number of promising ideas have been suggested that would provide \nthis needed cash infusion into businesses. It has been proposed that \nbusinesses could accelerate the rate at which they depreciate new \nassets. Doing this would help businesses of all sizes decrease their \ncosts this year and free up investment capital.\n  For example, let me tell my colleagues about a company in my hometown \nof Rolla, MO. It is called Brewer Science, Inc. It is a successful and \ngrowing company that employs 235 people. It produces the chemicals used \nin the manufacture of integrated circuits. The proposed increase in \nallowable deductions would enable this small business to expand faster. \nAdditional cash in this business could be spent on additional research \nand development, and that is the kind of investment and expansion that \nwill get our economy back on track.\n  Increasing business investments address only part of the problem. \nWhile the economy goes through its natural business cycle, many \nAmericans are facing immediate unemployment. Creating new jobs for \nthese workers is crucial, but it will take some time. In the meanwhile, \nwe must help these families in crisis. Last Friday, the Labor \nDepartment released some alarming figures. Seven hundred thousand \nAmericans lost their jobs in October. The unemployment rate surged to \n5.4 percent this month. There are now a total of 7.7 million Americans \nout of work. These are staggering numbers. Families all across America \nare hurting.\n  Shortly after September 11, I encouraged my colleagues to act quickly \non\n\n[[Page S11643]]\n\nbehalf of the workers in the airline industry who lost their jobs \nabruptly. To my great regret, they did not act.\n\n  At that time, many in this body claimed it was appropriate to wait. \nThey said we ought to deal with assistance to the unemployed when we \nconsider broader legislation to stimulate the economic recovery. Now \nalmost 8 million Americans are worrying about how they will pay the \nrent or their mortgage. Millions of American parents have lost their \nhealth care insurance, and they are worrying what they will do if a \nchild gets sick. Millions of families are wondering how they will put \nfood on their Thanksgiving table this year. It would be unconscionable \nto tell these people to wait any longer. Extended unemployment benefits \nand help with health care coverage must be included in a stimulus \npackage.\n  By extending unemployment compensation, we will be putting dollars \ninto the hands of people who need the money immediately for their basic \nneeds. The money will be spent quickly, which in turn provides the \nneeded remedy for an ailing economy. We have an opportunity to do the \nright thing at the right time and for the right reasons. We must act \nquickly and in a bipartisan fashion. We cannot afford to wait until \nmore people are laid off or more businesses fail. We must not leave our \nfamilies to struggle without help or without hope.\n  If we have the will, we can forge a just and reasonable compromise \nthat will ease the pain of this recession. When Holocaust survivor Elie \nWiesel was asked what was the most important commandment, he replied: \nThou shall not sit by idly. That response points up the importance of \nacting when we have a chance to influence an outcome. During this time \nof crisis, let it not be said of the U.S. Congress that we sat idly by. \nLet us act with courage, and let us act now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I congratulate my colleague from Missouri. She said in \njust a few moments exactly what we need to hear as we consider this \neconomic stimulus package.\n  I believe she has put a finger on it: We are being called on, across \nAmerica, to rally behind our flag, our President, and our cause, that \nwe should make certain when it comes to the economic stimulus package, \nwe also keep in mind that all America is involved. It is the working \nfamilies in America paying the payroll taxes into the Social Security \ntrust fund who are funding all we are doing. The money we are spending \nto defend America against terrorism, the money we are spending to \nrebuild New York, the money we are spending to help the airline \nindustry, the money we are spending for an economic stimulus all comes \nout of the Social Security trust fund, and all of that money comes from \nthe payroll workers across America.\n  When we talk about invigorating this economy and getting it moving \nforward again, what a difference in approach we have between the two \npolitical parties. On the House side, the Republicans came up with a \nstimulus package which I am afraid doesn't meet the test of encouraging \nconsumer spending, doing it in a timely fashion, and not damaging the \neconomy. Instead, what the House Republican package came up with was, \nsadly, a great deal of tax relief for the biggest corporations in \nAmerica. This is profiteering in the name of patriotism.\n  Consider for a minute that these corporations would receive rebate \nchecks for 15 years' worth of Federal income tax under the stimulus \nplan supported by the House of Representatives. IBM would receive $1.4 \nbillion from the Social Security trust fund; Ford, $1 billion; General \nMotors, $833 million. The list goes on and on. Billions and billions of \ndollars in corporate relief from the House Republican stimulus plan and \nprecious little or nothing for the workers across America.\n\n  We know what will get this economy moving again. Give some money to \nthe people who are having a tough time--having just lost their jobs--to \nkeep their families together, and they will spend it. Of course they \nwill. Give the people who just lost their jobs help in paying for \nhealth insurance, and they will use that help because they are as \nfrightened as anyone that family members or their children will not be \nprotected with health insurance. Those are the pillars of the Senate \nDemocratic plan for stimulus: That we help those who have just been \nlaid off, who are facing a difficult time.\n  We also provide tax rebates for 45 million low-income taxpayers who \nreceived no rebate earlier this year. People pay payroll taxes, pay \ninto the Social Security trust fund. This time around, we believe they \nshould receive some tax assistance.\n  We have business tax cuts, as well--a 10-percent bonus appreciation. \nI heard from businesses across Illinois: Give us some help in \ndepreciating some of the things we purchase and we will purchase more. \nThat can move the economy forward. It is a sensible plan.\n  We want to extend unemployment benefits an additional 13 weeks in all \n50 States. This is not a radical suggestion. This is the course \nfollowed by President Bush's father. In the teeth of a recession, he \nsaid: We have to stand by the people who have lost their jobs. In \nAmerica we have 7.5 million Americans who are out of work. We ought to \nstand by them and any laid off in the near future. We need to expand \ncoverage to the people who do not receive unemployment insurance today.\n  We also know when it comes to this health insurance, unless we help \npeople buy health insurance once they have lost a job, they will have \nnone; they are not likely to do so. Just do the math. The average \nunemployment check is $230 a week; the average payment for private \nhealth insurance when you have lost your job is $588 a month. It just \ndoes not work.\n  We have quite a contrast between the Republican approach of getting \nthis economy moving forward and the Democratic approach. The Republican \napproach embodies tax cuts for the wealthy and profitable corporations \nand nothing for homeland security. I hope I get a moment to get to this \nissue.\n  When it comes to tax cuts for the wealthy, by speeding up the rate \ncuts, the Republican plan would give a new $16,000-a-year tax break to \nthe wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Those are people making over $1 \nmillion a year, receiving $16,000 from the Republican tax stimulus. \nWhat a stimulus that is: For citizens making $1 million a year, we want \nto give you $16,000 more. That is not going to put money back into the \neconomy, not nearly as much as helping the economy by giving the money \nto the average working family, the middle-income family across America.\n  When we give every millionaire a check from the Treasury for $16,000, \nthat is money being thrown away that could be used to deal with \neconomic stimulus. That $16,000 goes right out of the Social Security \ntrust fund. Payroll taxes paid by average workers into the Social \nSecurity trust fund are being spent to give a $16,000-a-year check to \nthe wealthiest people in America--and to do it for 4 years under the \nRepublican plan.\n  The Republican plan, in addition, with the accelerated tax cuts, \ncosts $27 billion in 2002--next year--and increases to $121 billion \nover 10 years. Remember the advice we receive from people: Don't do \nanything that will hurt us in the long term. They are going to \nbasically eat up any surplus we have in the future to give tax cuts to \nthe wealthiest people in this country. That makes no sense at all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11643-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11643-S11644]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have a limited amount of time and will now reflect on \nthe issue of homeland security. There are two ways to move the economy \nforward: Tax cuts and spending. The faster way, the more effective and \nimmediate way, is through spending because as we spend on important \nprojects and the money is spent, people are employed to do things \nimportant for America.\n\n  Senator Byrd of West Virginia and others have offered as part of the \nstimulus package a $20 billion package dealing with homeland security. \nWhere would that money go? For example, it would go to law enforcement. \nIn my State of Illinois, my Republican Governor has asked me to help \ncome up with $20 million so we can have a statewide communications \nnetwork to deal with any emergencies, any crisis, any act of terrorism. \nThis is money well spent. I want to give the Governor that money, but \nunless Senator Byrd's package moves forward, it is not likely that will \nhappen.\n\n[[Page S11644]]\n\n  The same thing on bioterrorism: We want to see money going into \npublic health departments, State and local, to help them fight the war \nagainst bioterrorism. We need them. We have realized that with the \nanthrax crisis.\n  Look at the contrast: What the administration has called for to help \npublic health departments on bioterrorism is $300 million a year to go \nto State and local public health agencies. That amount is nothing. \nRemember, as well, the Republicans, in their stimulus plan coming from \nthe House, want to give $1.4 billion to one corporation--IBM. To give \nfour or five times as much as might be spent to fight the war against \nbioterrorism is clearly a loss of our priority.\n  We also need to put money into security for Amtrak, for our airports, \nfor our highways, for critical infrastructure across America. The money \ncalled for by Senator Byrd would go for that purpose. I think that is \nmoney well spent and invested in the infrastructure of this country.\n  People expect us to respond to this crisis with not only tax cuts \nthat will truly move the economy forward but also with a spending \npackage that makes America safer. It doesn't make America safer to give \na $16,000 check to a millionaire out of the Social Security trust fund. \nIt might make America safer if we take that money and invest it in law \nenforcement, in protecting critical infrastructure such as water \nsupplies, nuclear power plants, and the highways, and infrastructure \nacross America.\n  Those are the differences, and they are critical differences.\n  I also make note of the fact that the editorial response to the \nRepublican stimulus package so far has been uniformly negative. As a \nmatter of fact, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill referred to the House-\nRepublican-backed stimulus package as just so much show business. We \ndon't need show business on Capitol Hill; we need to get down to \nserious business. That serious business involves responding to our \neconomic crisis and doing it in a timely fashion and a fair manner.\n  I salute the Senate Finance Committee for moving forward a package \nyesterday, on a partisan rollcall, I am sorry to report, but one that \nwe will consider next week. I hope the Republicans will work with us \nquickly pass a bipartisan package. The sooner we can respond to this \neconomy and its needs, the better it will be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I listened carefully to my colleague \nfrom Illinois. I think what we are going to see next week is almost \nclass warfare on the issue of the stimulus.\n  What is a stimulus? Stimulus is what really stimulates the economy. I \nthink as we look at the difference in the positions of both parties, we \ncome to the conclusion that for those who happen to have the \ncircumstances that allow them to have accumulated capital, it is in our \ninterests to encourage them to invest in inventories, expenditures, and \nso forth, so this economy can move. It doesn't move necessarily simply \nby government spending. These should be determined to be true stimulus \nmatters.\n  I would like to reflect, as a member of the Finance Committee, on how \nwe got into this situation relative to putting a bill together, under \nthe Finance Committee leadership of the two leaders, Senator Baucus and \nSenator Grassley, who had worked together extraordinarily well on the \ntax package. It was a bipartisan package, so unlike what came out of \nthe Finance Committee yesterday. It seemed as if the Republican \nparticipation in the process had been virtually eliminated by the \nDemocratic majority and the Democratic majority leader. In the manner \nin which he dictated the terms and conditions, there would be virtually \nno input from the Republicans in that package.\n  As a consequence, I do admire the chairman, Senator Baucus, for \ninsisting that the process at least go through the committee because, \nunlike what happened in the Energy Committee where the Democratic \nleader simply pulled the energy bill and there was no committee \nprocess; there was no input from the authorization committee, so the \ncommittee basically shut down, and the Democratic leader took it upon \nhimself to work up an energy bill that we have yet to see. What we are \nseeing here is an extraordinary dictate of power from the Democratic \nleader who says: We are going to do it my way. We are not going to go \nthrough the process associated with the authorizing committees.\n\n  As a consequence, what happened yesterday in the Finance Committee \nwas a partisan vote. We are going to start in with that package on \nTuesday. If we are going to get anywhere, we are going to start in \naccommodating each other's points of view, working towards a bipartisan \nsolution. Clearly, this country, and the President, wants to have this \nissue resolved. It should be resolved. But it has to be a true \nstimulus.\n  What I am doing is drawing a little bit of a parallel to the power \npolitics of what is occurring here. We saw initially on the energy \nbill, as I have indicated, where the authorizing committee's \njurisdiction was basically eliminated and the chairman of the committee \nsaw fit to simply leave the obligation up to the Democratic leadership. \nThat almost occurred in the Finance Committee but not quite.\n  As we look at the stimulus, I want to reflect one more time on what \ntrue stimulus is. True stimulus is the creation of jobs, the creation \nof jobs by urging the private sector to invest, initiate action. There \nis one issue before this body, and it is either going to be on the \nstimulus bill or perhaps we can make an arrangement with the Democratic \nleadership to take it up, debate it, vote up or down, and address the \nissues as they should be--and that is the issue of an energy bill.\n  One of the issues in that bill is the contentious issue of ANWR. \nShould it be opened? Should it not? We have seen the position of our \nPresident on numerous occasions who says it is an integral part of the \nNation's energy policy to reduce our dependence on imported oil. The \nAmerican Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, Vietnam Veterans, \nthe Catholic War Veterans, what do they say? I could go on and on. They \nhave implored the Democratic leader to put this on the calendar, to \ntake it up, vote on it. Their particular view of this issue is they \ndon't believe we should send any more men and women to fight a war on \nforeign shores.\n  I am reminded of the comments of a former Member, Mark Hatfield, who \nwas a pacifist. He said: I would vote for opening ANWR any day rather \nthan send another man or woman to fight a war on foreign shores over \noil.\n  I think that says a lot for American veterans. Make no mistake about \nit; we fought a war over oil in the Persian Gulf. Today we are buying \noil from our enemy, whom we basically conquered in that war, Saddam \nHussein. We are importing over a million barrels a day. Yet at the same \ntime we are enforcing a no-fly zone over that country. We are putting \nat stake the lives of American men and women. As we take the oil from \nIraq, put it in our planes, and enforce the no-fly zone, we bomb him. \nThe consequence of that is he takes our money, develops a missile \ncapability, maybe a biological capability, and aims it at our ally, \nIsrael. Maybe that is an oversimplification of foreign policy, but it \nis not too far off.\n  Organized labor is totally aboard. For the International Brotherhood \nof Teamsters, maritime unions, seafarers unions, operating engineers, \nplumbers, pipefitters, carpenters and joiners, this is a jobs issue. \nWhere can you find a stimulus that will generate roughly 250,000 jobs--\nthese are U.S. jobs, these are union jobs in this country--other than \nthis particular issue of opening up that sliver of ANWR?\n  The interesting thing is we are creating jobs. We are also generating \nrevenue to the Federal Government because those lease sales are \nestimated to generate about $3.6 billion from the private sector.\n  What we have here is an opportunity, an extraordinary opportunity to \nrecognize the realities associated with what this stimulus would do to \nthe economy. There is not one other thing any Member can identify that \nwill not cost the taxpayer one red cent and that will employ more \npeople in this country, generate more jobs.\n  From where do these jobs come? We will have to build another 19 or 20 \nU.S.-\n\n[[Page S11645]]\n\nflagged vessels, tankers, to move the oil because we have to move it in \na U.S.-flagged vessel. They are going to be built in U.S. yards with \nU.S. workers. We don't make steel or pipes or valves in Alaska. They \nare built all over the United States. This is real stimulus.\n  The Hispanic community, the Latin-American Management Association and \nLatino coalition, the United States-Mexico Chamber of Commerce, all \nsupport this. We even have the seniors organizations and of course the \nAmerican businesses, manufacturers, and so forth.\n  What is this all about? This is an issue that America's extreme \nenvironmental community has latched onto over a period of time, \ngenerated a lot of revenues and a lot of membership, and they are going \nto hang onto this issue because they recognize the value of it.\n  Some Members, obviously, are looking to the political support from \nthese issues. I think we have to stand up for what is right for \nAmerica.\n  We see a remark made by a spokesman for the Democratic leader:\n\n       Everyone knows we will not get a drop of oil out of Alaska \n     for a decade, and it won't last more than a few days.\n\n  That is a statement made by a person who obviously has no knowledge \nof reality. The reality is, if it ranges between the estimates of 5.6 \nbillion and 16 billion barrels, it would be as much as we import \ncurrently from Saudi Arabia over 30 years and as much as we are now \nimporting from Iraq for 50 years. That is reality.\n  How can we frame this in any sense?\n  Let's look at Prudhoe Bay. Everybody is somewhat familiar with that. \nThat came on line 27 years ago. The arguments today against opening up \nANWR are basically the same that existed 30 years ago when we were \ntalking about opening Prudhoe Bay. We built an 800-mile pipeline along \nthe length of Alaska. Is it going to be a fence? Are the animals going \nto be able to cross it? Is it a hot pipeline over permafrost. Will it \nmelt? Will it withstand earthquakes? It is one of the construction \nwonders of the world.\n  Prudhoe Bay was supposed to provide 10 billion barrels. It has now \nproduced 13 billion barrels. It is still producing 17 percent of the \ntotal crude oil produced in this country today. Those are the \nrealities.\n  I am very disappointed that some people who have never been up there \nspeak with such eloquence and knowledge. They do not know what our \nNative people want. Our Native people want a lifestyle that provides \nbetter job opportunities and better health care. The people in my State \nof Alaska within that 1,002 area of ANWR own 59,000 acres. It is their \nown private land. They can't even get access to drill for gas on their \nown land. This is an injustice.\n  There is a rather interesting dichotomy here because we are all \nconcerned about public opinion. The New York Times, in 1987, 1988, and \n1989, supported opening this area. I will read a little bit from the \nNew York Times, April 23. It says:\n\n       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has the most promising \n     untapped source of oil.\n\n  It further states:\n\n       This area could be opened up safely, and we could avoid any \n     disaster associated with the dangers.\n\n  Further, in 1988, they say:\n\n       The potential is enormous. The environmental risks are \n     modest.\n\n  In March of 1989, they say:\n\n       Alaska's oil is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n\n  That is where they were then. Of course, they are in a different \nposition now. They say now that we shouldn't open it.\n  The Washington Post, April 23, 1987:\n\n       Preservation of wilderness in Alaska is important. Much of \n     Alaska is already protected under the strictest of \n     preservation. That part of the Arctic coast is one of the \n     bleakest, most remote places on this continent. There is \n     hardly any other place where drilling would have less impact \n     on the surrounding wildlife.\n  In April 1989, they said:\n\n       If less is produced here at home, more will have to come \n     from other countries. The effect will be to move oil spills \n     to other shores. As a policy to protect the global \n     environment, that is not very helpful. The lessons of \n     conventional wisdom seem to be drawn . . . that this \n     country should produce less and turn to greater imports is \n     exactly wrong.\n\n  How quickly we change with no explanation. It is just the influence \nof America's environmental community on these newspapers. But that is a \nturnaround.\n  My colleague this morning entered an excerpt from the Washington Post \nby Charles Krauthammer entitled ``War and the Polar Bear.'' It is very \ninteresting. I advise all people to read it.\n  But I will again reflect on reality. Thirty years ago in this Chamber \nwe were arguing the issue of opening Prudhoe Bay. It passed by one \nvote. The Vice President broke the tie.\n  The same issues prevail today. Now, in a time of war, when do we face \nup to reality and address the opportunities to open this area and \nreduce our dependence on imported oil and stimulate our economy? It is \nnot a few days' supply. It is the largest potential oil field that we \ncould possibly find in North America. It can flow within 18 months of \nopening as a consequence of the process simply of moving the \npermitting. We all know this.\n  Let's get on with the stimulus at hand and recognize the greatest \nsingle stimulus that we can identify. That is simply opening up ANWR.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank the Chair. I have come to the \nfloor to speak this morning about the various ideas proposed to help \nour economy recover from the recession that we are in currently.\n  I say to my friend and colleague from Alaska that he will not be \nsurprised that I respectfully disagree with most of what he just said \nabout drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. But I \nhave the feeling that either next week or sometime soon we will have \nthe opportunity to debate these matters at length. I look forward to a \ngood, constructive debate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11645-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11645-S11647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A SENSIBLE ECONOMIC STRATEGY\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I do want to go back to the fiscal \nstimulus and put it in the context of where we are now.\n  America is a nation at war. It is a war that challenges our values \nand our security as fundamentally as the great wars we fought in the \nlast century against Nazism and communism. So a war of this kind \nnaturally affects most everything else we do in ways that we may not \nyet see in America. That includes the ways we in Congress conduct our \nbusiness.\n  It is a time to put national interests ahead of narrow partisan or \nideological agendas. But when there are important disagreements, we \ncannot sweep them under the rug. After all, democracy, in all its \nfractious glory, is one of the most fundamental values that unites us. \nIt is a value that we are fighting to defend in the current war against \nterrorism. The moment we stop practicing democracy is the moment we \nstart giving in to the terrorists.\n  It is in that spirit that I wish to speak today--not negatively, but \nconstructively, and not divisively, but I hope in a spirit of what I \ntake to be the national interest.\n  I want to speak in disagreement with the fiscal stimulus plan passed \nby the House of Representatives, which is really a House Republican \nplan passed almost entirely on partisan grounds. This plan has \napparently now been endorsed and supported by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  The fact that our economy was weakening before September 11th is \nclear, particularly in the information technology, telecom, and high-\ntech sectors. But after September 11, unfortunately, the terrorists \nhelped to push the American economy from weakening into recession. That \nhas challenged all of us to regain the kind of psychological, let alone \neconomic, confidence that will once again create growth.\n  Unemployment has risen now to 5.4 percent. That is a statistic which \nexpresses itself in hundreds of thousands of our fellow Americans being \nout of work. Demand in the business sector and the personal consumption \nsector is just not where it was or where we want it to be.\n  We must always recognize that the American economy is the strongest \nin the world and that we have the most vibrant, productive private \nsector in the world--both those who invest and\n\n[[Page S11646]]\n\nmanage it and those who work in it. In fact, it is from that private \nsector that the recovery to this recession will ultimately come.\n  It is also important for us to acknowledge that we in government have \nsome options by which we can facilitate and encourage the private \nsector to do what it does best in helping to create economic growth.\n  It is important as we put together a fiscal stimulus package to \nremember, ironically enough, the Hippocratic oath that every doctor \nknows very well. It is, ``First, do no harm.'' I say respectfully that \nthe stimulus package passed by the House of Representatives, reflected \nin part in the Republican proposals that are surfacing here in the \nSenate, does not pass the test of the Hippocratic oath.\n  They will harm our economy by not only being unfair but by bringing \nus further into long-term debt--building, unfortunately, on the \nprecedent set when we passed President Bush's tax cut earlier in the \nyear. That tax cut plan made the most glowing assumptions about the \nfuture of the economy, and then spent the revenue that was predicted \nbased on those assumptions. That was not fiscal responsibility. And, of \ncourse, now the multi-trillion dollar estimates of surplus on which \nthat tax cut was based have evaporated, have been altered.\n  The Republican proposals for fiscal stimulus, particularly by \naccelerating some of the President's tax cuts that were adopted, not \nonly do nothing to increase demand by individuals which will stimulate \nthe economy and create growth and jobs, but they increase America's \nlong-term debt. That means increasing long-term interest rates. And \nthat means inhibiting the flow of capital, money that is the \nunderpinning of growth in the private sector of our economy.\n  So I say, respectfully, the Republican proposals for fiscal stimulus \ndo harm. Our economy needs help, not harm. Frankly, I believe we would \nbe better off passing no stimulus than passing the package that was \nadopted by the House of Representatives, because I really believe it \nwill hurt our economy, not help it.\n  Our economy is ready and waiting for a quick, significant, temporary \nshot in the arm. But if the Federal Government makes the wrong choices, \nwe will effectively be shooting ourselves in the foot.\n  In the current economic climate, we need to discard the stale, knee-\njerk debates of the past and come together now to craft a commonsense \nsolution that again puts the national interest ahead of narrow partisan \nor ideological interests, and ahead of the paying of old political \ndebts. We need to act to produce economic growth and to protect jobs.\n  I want to speak, for a moment, about a very significant event that \noccurred just over a month ago, on October 4. The chairmen and ranking \nmembers of the House and Senate Budget Committees--Democrats and \nRepublicans alike--released basic principles that they thought should \nguide any economic stimulus proposal. They agreed that the package--and \nI quote--``Should be based on the recognition that long-term fiscal \ndiscipline is essential to sustained economic growth. Measures to \nstimulate the economy should be limited in time so that as the economy \nrecovers, the budget regains a surplus that is at least equal to the \nsurplus in Social Security. Any short-term economic stimulus should not \nresult in higher long-term interest rates.''\n  The Republican proposals simply do not meet that test. Given the \nspending demands of prosecuting the war on terrorism, of upgrading our \nhomeland defense, of rebuilding the City of New York, President Bush \ninitially said he supported enacting a stimulus package of between $60 \nand $75 billion which would be balanced--half and half--between \nspending and tax incentives.\n  The President asked for a finely tuned performance vehicle. Instead, \nthe House has given him a broken-down jalopy. The House Ways and Means \nCommittee reported a $212 billion plan that meets few, if any, of the \nbipartisan principles of the Budget chairs and ranking members issued \non October 4.\n  At the heart of the House Republican package is a large corporate tax \ncut, retroactive to 1986--before my youngest child, my 13-year-old \ndaughter--was born. It totals about $25 billion in cost. And $6.3 \nbillion of that ends up in the bank accounts of just 14 large \ncompanies.\n  Madam President, I am all for tax cuts, as I know you are, including \ntax cuts for business. But if our goal is to jump-start the economy \nnow, these big tax breaks to a select group of our largest companies \nsimply make no sense. In the first place, they will not get their \nrefunds until next year. Even then, there is no guarantee they will \nspend the money, which is what we need to spur economic growth. There \nis no guarantee they will invest in acquiring new equipment and funding \nthe kind of research and development that will support economic growth. \nWe are just going to have to cross our fingers and hope they use it in \nthe right way, and don't use it to pay off their debts or buy back \nstock. It's the wrong strategy.\n  The same is true, as I said briefly earlier, of the House \nRepublicans' plan to accelerate the reduction in income tax rates \nadopted earlier this year. That is not going to prime the pump; it is \nsimply going to pump up the incomes of those who need it least. It is \nnot likely to spur new investments or job growth, but, instead, to \nreward past success--which is not what our economy needs now. It is not \nthe quick action we need, but a slow road to budget deficits and higher \ninterest rates.\n  There are only two provisions in the House fiscal stimulus bill that \nmeet the agreed-upon, bipartisan standards: A grant of rebates to those \nworking Americans who did not receive them this summer, and accelerated \ndepreciation for companies, businesses that buy and place in service \nnew equipment in the coming year. Those are both good ideas. They are \nthe beginning of the basis of an agreement. And they are both contained \nin the Senate Finance Committee's package that was reported out \nyesterday.\n  This is not the time for serving old, stale, narrow party and \nideological agendas. It is the time for unity, for leadership, for \ndiscipline, and for bipartisanship.\n  I think the Senate Finance Committee has reported a bill that meets \nthose standards. It is focused. It is disciplined. It is short term. It \nis a real stimulus. It will cost $75 billion over 10 years. It contains \nno permanent changes in law. It has minimal negative out-year impact on \nour budget.\n  And, unlike the House Republican bill, it includes reasonable and \neffective assistance to those who are unemployed or are about to lose \ntheir health care benefits. In fact, half of the cost of the bill goes \nto temporarily extending and expanding unemployment insurance and a \nsubsidy for COBRA health insurance premiums. That gives balance to the \nproposal. It gives heart to the proposal. And it will help to stimulate \nthe economy because every additional dollar that goes to an unemployed \nworker will surely be spent.\n  Over the last couple of weeks, I have been talking to workers who are \nunemployed and those who fear they will soon be unemployed.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for two additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I find that the greatest fear of those who are \ncurrently unemployed or who fear that they will, in this recession, be \nunemployed, is: How in the Good Lord's name am I going to be able to \ncontinue health insurance for my family?\n  I spoke to one couple last weekend who said their health insurance \npremiums are $600 to $700 a month. How can they afford to pay those \npremiums through COBRA to keep their insurance going?\n  The Senate bill, in an act of not only humaneness but an expression \nof classic American values, said why would we not want to help working \nfamilies who, through no fault of their own, have been laid off, to at \nleast cover the cost of health insurance for their families? The Senate \nfinance bill will do that up to the tune of 75 percent.\n  This is a good, balanced program. It is the medicine our economy \nneeds to help it grow. I hope we will not find the debate on the \nstimulus to be rigid, to be unthinking, to be unyielding. I think we \nneed to be open-minded because the threat to our economy is real and \nprofound.\n\n[[Page S11647]]\n\n  The American people not only need help, but they will not tolerate a \npartisan debate that ultimately produces sound and fury but nothing to \nhelp them hold their jobs or help their families.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to talk a bit about the economic \nrecovery plan.\n  I begin by saying that yesterday, I chaired a hearing dealing with \nthe U.S. Postal Service. My colleague, Senator Byrd from West Virginia, \nattended the hearing and asked the Postmaster General a series of \nquestions. As with a lot of areas in our country since September 11, \nthe U.S. Postal Service has been dramatically affected, perhaps more so \nthan others. They have had postal workers die as a result of terrorists \nwho used the system as a delivery mechanism for terror and death from \nthe anthrax spores sent through the mail.\n  I told the Postmaster General that this country expresses its sorrow \nfor what has happened to the Postal Service workers. These are \nwonderful people.\n  I mentioned one of the stories about the two Postal Service workers \nwho died which described both of them in quite remarkable terms. One of \nthem had worked 15 years on the night shift and had never, in 15 years, \nused 1 day of sick leave. One should not judge someone by whether or \nnot they use sick leave. The point is, this person's neighbors talked \nabout what a wonderful human being this person was.\n  The U.S. Postal Service is populated with men and women who do their \njob, as we say, in rain, sleet, and snow; regrettably now with anthrax, \nwhich has taken the lives of a couple of them.\n  I told the Postmaster General yesterday about a town meeting I had in \nGlenburn, ND, a small town with hundreds of people. At my town meeting, \na fellow stood up and said: There is a lot of criticism about things \nand good government. I want to give you one piece of good news about \nthe U.S. Post Office.\n  I asked: What is that?\n  He said: I got a letter out at my farm that was addressed ``Grandpa, \nGlenburn, ND.'' It was from my grandson.\n  I asked: How on earth could that have been? How would you have gotten \na letter addressed ``Grandpa, Glenburn, ND''?\n  He said: You can ask the postmaster over there.\n  So I asked the postmaster: How would that have happened?\n  He said: We got the letter that said ``Grandpa, Glenburn, ND.'' We \nlooked at the postmark and it was Silver Spring, MD. We knew the only \nperson around here that had relatives in Silver Spring was Frank, so we \nsent it out to Frank's farm. Sure enough, it got to the right grandpa.\n  I told the Postmaster General that story. So many others like it \ndescribe quite a remarkable system that has worked for a long while and \none that we must preserve and keep and nurture and protect during these \ndifficult times.\n  I rise to talk about all of the challenges, not just to the U.S. \nPostal Service but to our country. We face several challenges now. One \nis the challenge dealing with national security. One is a challenge \ndealing with economic security. And another is the challenge dealing \nwith energy security. Some of my colleagues spoke about that earlier.\n  National security doesn't need much more description. Most of us \nunderstand that some sick, twisted minds hatched a plot that murdered \nthousands of Americans in cold blood. Terrorism has visited our land in \na manner that we never thought before possible. Now this Nation is one \nin its determination to find and bring to justice those who committed \nthese acts of terror.\n  It is a different time. There is a pre-September 11 and a post-\nSeptember 11. We have a President who has spoken to the American people \nabout putting the men and women in America's uniform in harm's way to \ntry to find the terrorists and bring them to justice, to root out the \nterrorist cells formed around the world who would commit acts of these \ntypes. This country supports our President and the men and women in \nuniform who are risking their lives to do that.\n\n  I toured Ground Zero in New York about a week after the tragedy. I \nsaw on the highest twisted metal beam yet standing where an iron worker \nhad climbed and attached an American flag to that highest metal beam. \nAs we came upon that tragic site, that is what we saw, carnage, \ndestruction, but also an American flag gently blowing in the breeze \nthat morning.\n  Two days later, I was in North Dakota driving between Bismarck and \nDickinson, ND, on interstate 94, a patch where you couldn't see a \nstructure of any kind anywhere, just rolling prairies. Someone had \ntaken a flag pole with a flag on it and attached to it a fence post \nthere in the middle of the prairie where you could see nothing that was \nmade by human hand except from this fence post--a single American flag \nalso blowing in the gentle morning breeze in North Dakota.\n  The connection between the flag and the Trade Center and the flag in \nNorth Dakota was a connection of unity of spirit and one Nation doing \nwhat it needs to do to protect itself and to bring to justice those who \ncommitted these terrorists acts.\n  Our Nation was having some difficulty even prior to September 11 with \nan economy that was very week. Our economy had softened a great deal \nand people were beginning to lose jobs. Our economy was losing steam \nand strength. September 11 cut a hole right through the belly of this \ncountry's economy.\n  The news since that time has been more layoffs. Hundreds and hundreds \nof thousands of Americans have lost their jobs. They, too, in many ways \nare victims of terrorist attacks.\n  What do we do about the soft economy in the aftermath of these \nterrorist attacks? We are unified as a Nation in going after the \nterrorists and trying to prevent terrorist action from occurring again. \nAre we unified with respect to how we come together as a nation to try \nto provide a boost to the American economy?\n  The answer to that is, no, not so unified these days. We have a lot \nof different ideas about how you promote economic growth and how you \nhelp the\n\n[[Page S11648]]\n\nAmerican people during an economic downturn.\n  This is the political system. I don't regret the fact that there is \ndebate about these things. With respect to national security issues, \nthis country has unity. On some of the other issues, we have debate. I \ndon't regret that. It strengthens us. There is an old saying when \neveryone in the room is thinking the same thing, no one is thinking \nabout much. I don't shrink from debate. We should not shrink from \ndebate. When in debate we get the best of what everyone has to offer, \ndemocracy is served.\n  Groucho Marx once said: Politics is the art of looking for trouble; \nfinding it everywhere, diagnosing it incorrectly, and then applying the \nwrong remedies.\n  Groucho Marx was a humorist. Politics takes a lot of humor and should \nover many years. But politics is the process by which we make judgments \nand decisions about the country. That is politics; that is the best of \nthe American people. It is what served this country well for a long \ntime. So as we talk now together in this country about how we apply \nsome remedies and develop policies that strengthen America's economy, \nwe have ideas coming from all sides. Let me describe some of them. Some \nof them are wonderful, challenging, interesting; some of them are \nnutty--but that is the way the process works.\n\n  We have, for example, one piece of legislation that was developed by \nthe other body, and it was described as something that is a stimulus \npackage and is going to help the country. I will give you a couple of \nexamples: They put in a $21 billion tax piece that benefits many of the \nlargest corporations in the country for the purpose of incentivizing \nthem to move and keep needed investment capital overseas. How would I \nclassify that? Nutty.\n  Does anybody think that is going to strengthen our country, \nstrengthen our economy, by saying to big companies: What we would like \nyou to do, by the way, is keep investing overseas. We would like you to \nmove capital overseas because we think that is just great.\n  Well, that is not the way to strengthen our economy, the way to \nprovide a lift and boost and helium to the American economy. But that \nis exactly what came out of this package from the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. There are so many other items in that bill that it's \nalmost hard to start when you describe things you think are kind of off \nbase.\n  Another provision would retroactively repeal the corporate \nalternative minimum tax. That means that IBM, for example, would get a \n$1.4 billion tax cut. General Motors would get a $833 million tax cut.\n  It seems to me that is kind of larding up a piece of legislation that \nis supposed to be designed to help our country recover. Instead, it \nbecomes a carrier for the favored old tax cuts for the biggest and most \npowerful economic interests among us.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator spoke of ``larding up.'' Would he say that is a \ncholesterol-laden piece of pork?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I hadn't thought about that.\n  Mr. BYRD. When I was a young man, which was quite a while ago, I \nworked in a meat shop in a coal mining camp. All of the ladies who came \nto the store, including my mother and my wife's mother, bought lard. \nThose coal miners, before they went into the bowels of the earth and \ndid that back-breaking work, ate sausage and bacon fried in a deep \nskillet with lard. We never heard of the word ``cholesterol'' in those \ndays. That is a new word in my lexicon, coming along probably about in \nthe middle of my life. So I was interested when the Senator used the \nwords ``larding up.'' Was he talking about a spending measure or was he \ntalking about pork? What did the Senator have reference to? I missed \nthat. Would he say that again?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I was actually using that term to describe \nsomething done on a tax bill in the other body. I described it as \n``larding up.'' It is plugging the arteries of this system by putting \nin place certain provisions. I will give you an example.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would that be cholesterol?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. When I talk about larding up, the Senator from West \nVirginia is talking about how people always refer to spending bills as \npork, but never refer to tax bills as pork. In fact, there is more lard \nand larding up of tax bills than almost anything else.\n  The retroactive repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax in \nthe House tax bill does as I said it would--it provides the biggest tax \nbenefits to the biggest, most powerful corporations in the country.\n  Here is what the chief economist from Merrill Lynch said about it \nbecause, remember now, the only reason we are going through this \nexercise is to try to determine how we help the American economy. Bruce \nSteinberg, chief economist, said:\n\n       The silliest idea is the retroactive AMT payments. If you \n     want to stimulate spending in the future, you don't give out \n     tax breaks for things that already happened.\n\n  It is as simple as that.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the epitome of pork, isn't it? It drips with lard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator describes it in a way that makes it visual. \nBut it is a slow turn on a medium-hot spit--or ``pit,'' I guess it \nwould be in West Virginia. Let me continue.\n  Will Rogers said something I want to put up on a chart.\n  Will Rogers said this a long time ago:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we will get \n     round to them soon as we get everybody else fixed up OK.\n\n  Now, while IBM, General Electric, and others are prepared, according \nto the House bill, to get hundreds of millions of dollars in tax cuts \nretroactively, last Friday it was announced that 415,000 people lost \ntheir jobs in October. What about those folks? When you talk about \nstimulating the economy, what about giving the people who lost their \njobs some assistance? How about a helping hand to somebody who got a \npink slip or a notice that said: By the way, you do a good job and I am \nglad you are here. It is just that our company is shrinking. We don't \nhave as much business. So guess what, we don't have room for you. Tell \nyour family tonight when you go home and sit at the supper table that \nyou have lost your job. Tell them it is not your fault, that you worked \nhard, we appreciated you, but you can't go to work on Monday because \nyou no longer have a job.\n  What about those people? For example, in New York, when that act of \nterrorism struck the World Trade Center, it is true that the people who \nwere climbing those stairs, even as the buildings were collapsing, were \npeople making $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 a year, willing to risk their \nlives in public service--firefighters, law enforcement folks, and \nothers. There are a lot of folks around this country of ours who don't \nhave a lot, don't make a lot, and don't ask for a lot. They don't have \na million dollars. They are not going to get $1.4 billion in tax \nrefunds. They are not on this list with K-Mart, American Airlines, and \nEnron. They are the folks who, last month, had to tell their families \nthey were no longer employed. And if the families asked why, is it a \npart of a soft economy or part of terrorist acts? The answer is: Yes, \nit is.\n  What do we do about that? Do we in the U.S. Congress have a concern \nabout those folks, or is it just about the upper income and the big \neconomic behemoths who really have clout? Is there anybody within 100 \nyards of this building today, Friday, who is here because they are \nlobbying on behalf of somebody who lost their job last month? No one. \nIt is just the folks who have a lot of money, a lot of assets and a lot \nat stake. They are here and they are trying to get more than their \nshare.\n  I will tell you, they succeeded in the U.S. House. So we are trying \nto write a stimulus package, something that provides economic recovery.\n  We have a couple of thoughts in mind. One is there is no quicker or \nmore effective way, and there is no way, in my judgment, that provides \nmore justice to this system as well than to help people who are out of \nwork. They are going to spend that money instantly. When we extend \nunemployment benefits, that money goes right back into the economy. All \neconomists tell you: Step one, help those who lost jobs because that is \nstimulative, helps the economy. It is not only just and the right thing \nto do, it is the most effective thing to provide some lift to this \neconomy.\n  So we are going to have a debate about that because some don't want \nto\n\n[[Page S11649]]\n\ndo much for these folks. That is wrongheaded, in my judgment. We have a \nresponsibility to the country to reach out and tell them they are not \nalone; we want to help them and we want to help this economy.\n  Obviously, what we want in the end is for the economy to get back on \nits feet and for those folks who have lost jobs to become employed once \nagain.\n  That is what we want. There is no social program much better than a \ngood job. There is nothing like a good job that pays well and has \nsecurity. What we are trying to do is put together a recovery package \nthat recognizes what is just, what is right, and what will be effective \nin providing lift to this country's economy.\n  Extending unemployment benefits, paying for 75 percent of the COBRA \nbenefits--all of that provides lift to this economy and is the right \nthing to do.\n  In addition, coming from the Finance Committee, we have put in place \nsome tax provisions we think will provide a lift to this economy. We \nhad a tax cut for people in this country earlier this year. Not \neverybody got a tax cut. More than 70,000 North Dakotans did not get a \ntax cut. They did not get a tax cut because it was based on percentage \nof income taxes paid.\n  Everybody who works pays payroll taxes. In fact, that is a \nproportional tax. Everybody pays the same rate; it does not matter how \nmuch you make. Yet those folks did not get a tax cut. So we propose a \ntax rebate for those people. That also will be spent immediately and \nprovide lift to the economy.\n  We have a whole series of items we have proposed that we think \nrepresent the first step in the right direction to provide lift to this \ncountry's economy.\n  Let me make the most important point about all of this. The only way \nour economy is going to experience a recovery is if the American people \nare confident about the future. We do not have a ship of state in which \nthere is an engine room with dials, knobs, gauges, and levers and we \nhave some people in there fiddling with the dials, knobs, gauges, and \nlevers and get it just right with tax cuts and move the ship along.\n  That is not how the system works. What propels this economy is \npeople's confidence in the future. If people are confident about \ntomorrow, next month, next year, they will do things that represent \nthat confidence. They will take a trip. They will buy a car. They will \nbuy a house. They will make life decisions that express their view \nabout the future.\n  Confidence means expansion. If they are not confident, they will not \ntake the trip, they will defer the purchase of the car, they will defer \nthe purchase of the house, and our economy will contract.\n  There is nothing more important than instilling confidence. Our job \nis to, one, prosecute the war abroad. We have to do that and support \nour President doing that--and increase security at home. Part of our \neconomic recovery package is investment in security at home. Senator \nByrd has a homeland security proposal that is stimulative. It is not \nonly stimulative and gives lift to the economy because it invests in \nthis country and our security, but it is also the right thing and the \nnecessary thing to do.\n  When we can marry the right and necessary things to do with actions \nthat will give lift to our country's economy, that is exactly the \ncourse people expect us to take.\n  We need to prosecute the war, increase security at home, and give \nbusinesses and individuals the extra incentives they need to make those \nkey purchases and key investments, not 6 months from now, not over a \nyear from now, but now. Now. This needs to be temporary. It needs to \nhave a significant, compelling urge to it to give the American people \nconfidence about the future that we are doing the right thing.\n  If we err as a Congress, I want us to err on the side of doing \nsomething, even doing too much. I do not want to err on the side of \ndoing nothing because there are too many families out of work. Our \neconomy is perilously close to a very deep recession, and it could be a \nlengthy recession. We have a responsibility to blend good fiscal policy \nin the Congress with monetary policy at the Federal Reserve Board to \nsay to the American people: We are going to put in place the right \nplans to give you hope for the future.\n\n  Winston Churchill gave many stirring speeches in the Second World War \nto fire up the interest and urgency of his countrymen to the cause of \nthe war. At one point, he challenged his countrymen to imagine a \nthousand years in the future and what they would say about that current \ngeneration's efforts. He asked that they do things now that would allow \npeople in the future to look back and say that this was their finest \nhour, even in the face of substantial challenge.\n  That is what we, it seems to me, need to do now in confronting \nterrorism, in the challenge to provide economic security. We must fight \nas hard as we can possibly fight for the right policies now that give \nthis country and economy a chance to do well so all American families \ncan, again, do well and will not have to worry about next week or next \nmonth having to tell their family they lost their job.\n  This is about hope. It is about opportunity. It is about expanding \nthis country's economy. The New York Times last week had the headline: \n``Attacks Hit Low Paid Jobs the Hardest.'' I had a hearing 2 weeks ago, \nand the head of the hotel and restaurant union testified. He had a \ndozen of his members behind him. Each one stood up and told me their \nname, told me where they worked, when they got fired, how long they had \nworked there, and what it meant to them to lose their job. It was just \ngripping. It just breaks one's heart to see someone who struggled all \ntheir life, found a good job and worked for 8 years or 10 years or 15 \nyears and had a good record and was making it on their own, only to \nlearn a pink slip has come that says this economy has shrunk and you \nare out of a job.\n  It requires us to understand this is not about numbers, this is about \npeople. It is about our future. That is why we must get this right.\n  I am pleased with the work the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, \nSenator Daschle, all of us have done together to try to get the right \nsolution in place for this country's future. We are going to have a \ndebate about this next week. Let us not shrink from it. Let us not \nthink that debate injures this country or hurts this country. It \nstrengthens this country.\n  At the end of the debate, I hope we can convince everyone there is a \nright way and a wrong way. The wrong way leads to economic trouble, and \nthe right way leads to hope, confidence, and economic expansion. That \nrides on our making the right decision on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nrecognized at the completion of the remarks by the distinguished junior \nSenator from New York and that I may be recognized for as much time as \nI may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee and a great leader of this \nbody and our country, for that courtesy. I thank my colleague from \nNorth Dakota for very thoughtful and thought-provoking remarks. I join \nthose remarks, and I ask that as we do move toward this debate on how \nwe stimulate our economy and how we take care of our people, we put it \nin a broader context.\n  I sometimes worry that talk about economic stimulus, talk about Tax \nCode provisions, talk about a lot of the issues that come before the \nFinance Committee and then come before the Senate may not be \ncommunicating directly and effectively with the public who need to \nfollow this debate closely because what we will be or will not be \ndeciding over the course of the next several weeks will have profound \neffects on our daily lives, on our quality of life, on our national \nsecurity at home and abroad, and on the future of our economic growth \nand opportunities.\n  The Finance Committee came out with a package that should deserve the\n\n[[Page S11650]]\n\nsupport of Senators on both sides of the aisle. I am well aware there \nis a very different point of view on behalf of my colleagues on the \nother side, so we are going to have a debate. I agree with my colleague \nfrom North Dakota; it is an important debate. But we cannot look at \nwhat is being proposed today without recognizing several very important \nfactors.\n  First, we are now moving into deficits. We thought we had deficits \ntamed. We thought the struggle, sacrifice--economic, personal, \npolitical, and public--of the last 8 years meant that we were on strong \nfiscal footing, that we did have a policy for economic growth that \nwould demonstrate fiscal responsibility, pay down the debt, free up \ninvestment capital, and keep this great engine of economic prosperity \ngoing.\n  We did not repeal the law of business cycles, so understandably there \nwill be ups and downs, but we moved the economic plain to a higher \nlevel and had a consensus in the country that the smart fiscal policy \nwas the responsible one; that trying to continue to pay down our debt \nin order to relieve the burdens not only from future generations but \nfrom ourselves, not to crowd out investment capital so that businesses \ncould come into the market and have long-term interest rates at an \naffordable level, meant we knew the direction in which the economy \nshould go.\n\n  Now it will not surprise anyone in this Chamber that I ascribe to the \nClinton-Rubin economic policies. I happen to think they make sense. I \nbelieve in a global economy, fiscal responsibility, investment \npolicies. Making it possible for people to pursue their own futures by \ncreating economic opportunities goes hand in hand with keeping deficits \ndown, in fact keeping surpluses growing and giving us a chance to know \nwe are going to have for the foreseeable future strong economic times.\n  That is not the philosophy of the other side, and I respect their \nright to hold that contrary philosophy. So we stand here now in \nNovember, having passed a very large tax cut in the spring which \nundermines our long-term economic future, which demonstrates clearly we \nare going to have some very hard choices to make even had September 11 \nnever occurred because we had already seen that we were going into \ndeficits, that we were taking from the Medicare and Social Security \nsurplus dollars that hard-working people believed would be there for \nMedicare and Social Security, and as a result we now are facing much \nmore difficult choices which, had we been more fiscally responsible, we \ncould have avoided.\n  That is water under the bridge. There is nothing we can do about it. \nA majority of our colleagues in both Houses voted for a U-turn away \nfrom fiscal responsibility. So here we are.\n  What do we do now? Again, I do not think we can look at this stimulus \ndebate in some kind of vacuum. We were attacked on September 11. We are \nat war. We have men and women from Fort Drum in northern New York over \nin central Asia. We have Special Forces. We have carriers. We have \npeople who wear the uniform of our country who are in full-time service \ndefending us because this is an act of self-defense, attempting to \nuproot and destroy the terrorist networks. We have many from the \nNational Guard and the Reserves called to duty, disrupting their lives. \nWe know we are at war.\n  If we go back and look at history, we know when we are at war we have \nto think differently about our priorities than when we are not at war. \nSo what are those priorities? First, to do everything we possibly can \nto support the President, to support our military leadership, in waging \nthis war successfully and victoriously. I do not think there is one \ndissenting voice in this body to that proposition.\n  We also know this is a war that has been brought home tragically to \nus, that those on the front lines are not just our men and women in \nuniform, they are also our firefighters, our police officers, our \nemergency responders, our doctors and our nurses, our postal workers, \nmen and women who got up on September 11 and in the weeks since to do \ntheir job as part of the great American mosaic where people, through \ntheir individual efforts, create this extraordinary democracy we so \ntreasure.\n  We know we have to do more to protect ourselves at home. That is why \nthe President has named Governor Ridge the Director of Homeland \nSecurity. So we have to take a very close look at what it is we need, \nboth for our men and women in uniform and on the homeland front to \nprotect ourselves.\n  We did not have to think about that when this big old tax cut was \nvoted on last spring. Maybe people should have, but nobody really \nstopped and said, well, we cannot take all this revenue away because \nHeaven knows we might have anthrax attacks that will cause the Postal \nService and the Federal Government and local communities across our \ncountry to spend literally millions and billions of dollars to protect \nthemselves and us. We did not imagine that, but now we not only imagine \nit, we have lived with it. That raises a whole new set of \nresponsibilities that we ignore at our peril.\n\n  So part of what we have to figure out how to do is provide enough \nresources to protect us, to wage the war on both fronts that we are \nwaging, and to create economic opportunities by getting our economy \nmoving again.\n  I have listened very closely to what my colleagues have said, and I \nhave consulted with people in the business world, people who run big \ncompanies, people who are economists, some of whom sit in ivory towers, \nothers of whom actually get out and talk to people on the street about \nwhat is happening.\n  The real core of our challenge is, how do we inspire confidence? How \ndo we get consumer confidence, citizen confidence up? How do we get \npeople back into the normal give and take of their lives?\n  When I first joined the Senate last January, and all through the \nspring and summer, I could not walk through these halls. They were \ncrowded with people, especially school groups. I used to be so thrilled \nto think I was honored to serve in a body of the greatest democracy in \nthe history of the world that was open, where people could come, like \nthose who are here today but in far smaller numbers than they ever have \nbeen.\n  Now, of course, we can walk through the halls and not see anybody. I \ndo not have young people coming up to me and saying, oh, Senator, what \nare you doing today? Or, I am from New York. Or, how are you?\n  They are not here. Why? Because schools do not want children to \ntravel. Parents understandably are concerned. We have not done what we \nshould do to take care of airline security. That is still being \ndebated. So we have to inspire confidence.\n  How do we inspire confidence? I think there really are several ways \nwe should address it. Some of it does go directly to the points the \nSenator from North Dakota was making. We have to have a balance. We \nhave to have a balance between what we believe will work for business \nand what we believe we should do for workers and citizens who \nthemselves deserve both help and motivation to go on with their lives, \nto be productive.\n  I think the Finance Committee has struck the right balance. Spending \nmoney on unemployment insurance is not only the right thing to do--a \nlot of people are out of work not because they were sloughing off on \nthe job, not because they did not show up on time, but because we were \nattacked--we owe an obligation to these people. I think unemployment \ninsurance will enable people to get back on their feet, and if there is \nany dollar that will be spent immediately to stimulate the economy, it \nis a dollar in unemployment insurance. There is not an economist in the \nworld who disagrees with that, unless they are blinded by some \nideological prejudice. That is what they all tell us.\n  Health care is increasingly a problematic issue. My colleagues know I \nhave had a few things to say about that in the past, and I am still \nvery concerned about it. I am especially concerned because I see the \nprice of health care going back up. I see employers pushing down on \nemployees and making it more difficult for people to afford health \ncare. We are going to have to address that issue.\n\n  What we are worried about right now are all of those people who have \nlost their health care because it came through employment they no \nlonger have. They cannot afford the COBRA extension. They need help.\n  We also are stimulating the economy in the Finance Committee package \nby\n\n[[Page S11651]]\n\ntrying to do in a targeted way what we have been advised will work in \nbusiness, not these big, irresponsible giveaways in which the House \nengaged. I do not understand how with a straight face they can put a \nprovision into their package which pays people back for taxes they paid \nall the way back to 1985 without a promise that it is going to create a \nnew job, without a promise that it will be invested in a new plant and \nequipment right now.\n  As Senator Dorgan rightly pointed out, they actually give an \nincentive to businesses to move American jobs overseas. What on Earth \nare they thinking about? That is just unbelievable to me. So I think \nthe Finance Committee, with their vote last night, really struck the \nright balance. I hope we go forward with that.\n  I also hope we recognize the additional program that Senator Byrd and \nSenator Reid have advocated is essential. We have not made the \ncommitment of resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. We have not made the commitment of resources we need to \nour public health system, to our fight against bioterrorism, to the \nkind of security we need in our powerplants, our chemical plants. I \nthink we have a lot more to do. I commend Senator Byrd for his \nleadership.\n\n  Finally, a special word of appreciation to the Finance Committee for \ntheir recognition and support of New York. We know this was an attack \non America. The epicenter of the attack was on New York City. It was \nNew York City firefighters who went up those towers when people were \ncoming down. It is the firefighters and the police officers and the \nemergency responders who have been going to countless funerals. It is \nthe people who worked in those buildings who have scrambled to try to \nmake sense of their lives, to restart their jobs, and many of them are \nno longer employed. The estimate is about 100,000 have been dislocated.\n  The ripple effect through the city and the State has been even \ngreater. Because of those 100,000 who directly lost their jobs in lower \nManhattan, many of them work for companies that bought from smaller \ncompanies, that did work with banks and law firms and advertising \nagencies that had catering and restaurant business to give out. They no \nlonger do that. We are now looking at a loss of about 250,000 \nindividuals in New York alone by the end of this year.\n  We have seen unemployment go up around the Nation, but it has gone up \neven more in New York City. We are not sure the end has been reached. \nWe know this has had a ripple effect through the entire State, not just \nthrough the city. In Syracuse we lost 400 employees of USAir when they \ndecided to close a call center after losing so much business. In \nBuffalo, with the loss of tax revenues--because 15 percent of all the \nState's tax revenues came from Ground Zero; those are gone--we are \nlooking at laying off up to 500 teachers in Buffalo, which is at the \nopposite end of the State.\n  The package coming out of the Finance Committee will help enormously. \nI am particularly grateful for the tax incentives that will help us \nrebuild Lower Manhattan, will help us recover some of that lost office \nspace to get back into the business of being the global financial \ncapital of the entire world. It will take a long time. New York will \nneed a lot of help. This is a very welcome start.\n  The tax credits for employers to keep their offices in Manhattan will \nhelp tip the balance in favor of doing just that. Tax-exempt bonding \nauthority for construction will give an extra boost to rebuilding, and \nreinvesting insurance proceeds will enable people to make that \ndecision. We are still working on something to keep residents downtown, \nwhich is a very big challenge, and to provide additional relief for \nadvance refunding for the port authority and the metropolitan \ntransportation authority and for their infrastructure projects.\n  We lost our subway lines. We lost the PATH Train from New Jersey. We \nwill have a lot of work ahead. I thank and commend the Finance \nCommittee, particularly the chairman, Senator Baucus, for a job well \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for such time as he may consume.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11651-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11651-S11653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FAST-TRACK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the \nadministration's top trade legislation priority: Fast track, known in \nadministration circles as ``trade promotion authority.''\n  How crass. How crass. ``Trade promotion authority.'' To denominate \nfast track as ``trade promotion authority'' is the acme of crassitude. \nHear me down there at the other end of the avenue: The acme of \ncrassitude! To denominate fast-track legislation as trade promotion \nauthority, or by its acronym, TPA, is the acme of crassitude. One might \nbetter interpret the acronym TPA as standing for ``tactic to prevent \namendments''; TPA, ``Tactic to Prevent Amendments.''\n  Hear me! Colleagues on the other side of the Capitol Building, where \nthe administration has put on its big push for the acme of crassitude: \nFast track authority, calling it trade promotion authority. But it is a \ntactic to prevent amendments. That is what fast track is, a tactic to \npreclude Congress from fulfilling its constitutional obligations to \ndebate and, if necessary, to amend.\n  I hope they can stop this oafish piece of legislation on the other \nside of the Capitol. If they can't, then bring it onto the Senate \nFloor.\n\n     Come one, come all,\n     This rock shall fly\n     From its firm base\n     As soon as I!\n\n  Yes, come one, come all. Hear me down there at the other end of the \navenue, the White House: Bring on your TPA. Yes, ``tactic to prevent \namendments.''\n\n     Come one, come all,\n     This rock shall fly\n     From its firm base\n     As soon as I!\n\n  Those words from, I believe it was Scott's ``Lady of the Lake,'' are \nvery apropos here. This tactic to prevent Congress from fulfilling its \nconstitutional obligations to debate and, if necessary, to amend trade \nbills.\n  The administration hoists its flag on the flagpole of trade promotion \nauthority. This is my flag, the Constitution of the United States! I \nhold it in my hand. Those who would defy the Constitution will find the \nbattle lines formed here.\n  I oppose this surrender of our constitutional authority. That is what \nthe White House would have us do. I oppose this surrender. ``We've just \nbegun to fight.'' The authority to ``regulate commerce with foreign \nnations'' is granted exclusively to Congress in Article I, section 8, \nof the Constitution. Congress, the House, and Senate of the United \nStates--not the President--has this authority under the Constitution \nand has this responsibility under the Constitution.\n\n  So let us not be persuaded by administration attempts to promote fast \ntrack as an antidote to the events of September 11, 2001. There are \nthose who attempt to promote the idea that, under the rubric of a \nstimulus bill, Members in the House and the Senate would add language \nthat would promote their pet ideas, their pet projects. Well, under the \nrubric of ``stimulus,'' the administration is attempting to promote its \nown pet project--TPA. Trade promotion authority? Fast track. Let us not \nbe persuaded by these furtive attempts.\n  U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick has stated that fast track \nis necessary because ``we need to strengthen the U.S. and global \neconomies as they reel from the shocks of September 11.''\n  Who is Robert Zoellick? Was he elected by the people of any State? \nDid he stand before the bar of judgment of the electorate? Is that how \nhe became Trade Representative? No! Yet he, U.S. Trade Representative \nRobert Zoellick, has stated that fast track is necessary because ``we \nneed to strengthen the U.S. and global economies as they reel from the \nshocks of September 11.'' I do not understand Mr. Zoellick's logic. Now \nis the time for the President and the Congress to stand by the \nConstitution; stand by the Constitution and work together.\n  Now is the time for Congress to respond to the September 11 terrorist \nassault upon the American way of life.\n\n[[Page S11652]]\n\n This is not the time for us to short-circuit our deliberative \nprocesses. Let us debate. Let us debate the trade measures. What are \nyou afraid of, Mr. Zoellick? Moreover, the Ambassador cannot support \nhis attempt to link fast track to global economic recovery. With or \nwithout fast track, it is going to take years, not months, for the \nPresident to negotiate a new world trade agreement.\n  I question whether, in the current international climate, we should \neven desire to have a new global trade round. As the United States \nforges a coalition to fight terrorism, those countries that have been \nattacking the framework of fair trade for the past several years have \nabsolutely no incentive to agree to mutually beneficial trade \nproposals. Rather, they will attempt--as they have in the past--to use \ncooperation on security issues as a bargaining chip--a bargaining chip \nto extract trade concessions from the United States.\n  Just look at the so-called Harbinson text being considered at this \nvery moment in Doha, Qatar. Is there any question that our trading \npartners are asking that our trade laws be substantially weakened? Is \nthere any question that the administration is indicating a willingness \nto put those laws on the negotiating table? If we allow our trade laws \nto be gutted--gutted, what will happen to essential U.S. industries? \nWhat will happen to the steel industry? What will happen to other \nessential U.S. industries that are being picked apart by predatory \nforeign trade practices?\n  In any event, it is indisputable that Congress and the President can \nwork together, under the Constitution, to conclude and implement \ninternational trade agreements. Immediately after the September 11 \nterrorist attack, Congress passed the U.S.-Jordan trade agreement, one \nin a long series of trade agreements concluded and implemented by the \nUnited States since fast track lapsed in 1994.\n\n  Bring it on. Trade promotion authority--ha, ha, ha--trade promotion \nauthority! Of all the gimmicks that I have heard in my 84 years of life \non this Earth, that one takes the cake. It is plain old fast track!\n  The constitutional system works and the administration has not made \nthe case for tinkering with it.\n  President Bush claims to need this extra-constitutional negotiating \nauthority in order to exercise leadership in opening up world trade. On \nJune 21, 2001, he sent many of his highest ranking trade officials, \nincluding Secretary of Commerce Evans--for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect--and Ambassador Zoellick, to the Senate Finance Committee to \ntestify on the supposed need for fast track. Ambassador Zoellick \nmaintained that fast track is needed in order for the administration \n``to reassert America's leadership in trade.''\n  I remember very well the old-fashioned vaudeville shows where they \nsold those patent medicines, that snake oil. This is snake oil that Mr. \nZoellick is peddling--snake oil! It will curl your hair. If you don't \nhave any hair, it will grow hair for you: Snake oil!\n  The United States can, and should, lead in opening up world trade by \noffering other countries arrangements that are mutually advantageous, \nnot by undermining a key provision of the Constitution.\n  Senators might well consider the impact of normal debate and \namendment rules on the basic leverage available to U.S. trade \nnegotiators. Normal rules should be a matter of enhanced leverage for \nU.S. negotiators in terms of including provisions that are of strong \nappeal to Congress, the people's elected representatives in the \nlegislative branch, the people's elected representatives who take an \noath when they stand before that Presiding Officer and put their hand \non the Holy Bible. They take an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and \ndomestic.\n  Let's remember that oath.\n  The threat that an agreement might be amended by Congress to include \na provision gives all parties to a negotiation an incentive to conclude \nrealistic and politically viable agreements. If I were a negotiator, I \nwould like to have the leverage of being able to say, ``if we don't \ninclude this provision in the agreement, Congress may include it \nanyway.''\n  Congress may include it anyway. Fast-track Trade Promotional \nAuthority--TPA--fast track eliminates this form of leverage.\n  When you go to negotiate over the purchase of an automobile, are you \nbetter off going in on your own with your own free will? You can take \nit, you can leave it, or you can go somewhere else. It is common \nknowledge that you can strike a better deal if you are able to suggest \nto the seller that there is someone back home who may amend or modify \nany agreement that you might reach.\n  The Administration, I think, has it exactly backwards: instead of \nconcentrating its energies on accumulating as much leverage as possible \nvis-a-vis our trading partners, it is marshaling those energies to \nconvince Congress to reduce its leverage on behalf of hardworking \nAmerican families and their communities. This can only hamper our \nefforts to maintain, and enhance, U.S. leverage abroad.\n  The Administration is implicitly saying: ``If you are for \nshortchanging the legislative process, you are for opening up world \ntrade and combating terrorism.'' That makes no sense to me. I am for \nfree trade that is fair to all parties. What is wrong with that? And I \nam certainly for rooting out terrorism and enacting measures to ensure \nour national security. We need not, however, abandon the Constitution \nin order to achieve these objectives!\n  I didn't take an oath up here before this Presiding Officer to \nabandon the Constitution. That is what we are doing.\n  I am not saying we ought to debate every little duty on every little \ntoothbrush that comes into this country, or every little paper clip or \nevery fiddle bow or every violin string. I am not saying we ought to \ndebate the duties on toothpicks if they come from China or wherever. \nBut I am saying, the elected representatives of the people ought not \neven to be asked to give up the cherished right to debate and amend \ntrade legislation when the people's interests are involved.\n  We need not abandon the Constitution in order to achieve these \nobjectives. We Senators need carefully to consider and analyze the \nclaims that we hear about the benefits of fast track.\n  There may be one amendment or two amendments or three that go to \npolicy when we deal with trade matters. I am not saying, as I have \nalready indicated, that we ought to take a microscope and go over a \ntrade bill and get ourselves involved in the teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy \nlittle pieces here or there. But I am saying that there may be major \npolicy amendments that we may wish to debate or on which we may want to \nvote.\n  Now, I have a letter dated June 28, 1993, from then-United States \nTrade Representative Kantor, urging support for what he called ``the \nfast track negotiating authority needed to complete the Uruguay \nRound.'' He wrote: ``As the world's leading exporter and the world's \nmost open economy, the U.S. stands to benefit greatly by reducing \nbarriers and opening markets around the world for manufactured goods, \nagricultural products and services.'' How accurate was this \nprognostication? If, as the former Ambassador suggested, the last round \nof multilateral trade agreements was focused on reducing foreign trade \nbarriers--not opening up the floodgates to imports--shouldn't our \noverall balance of trade have improved in the 1990s?\n  The facts belie the fast-track sales pitch. That is what it is--a \nfast-track sales pitch. In the year 2000, the United States ran a trade \ndeficit on the current account of $435 billion. That is nearly nine \ntimes the trade deficit in 1992. How much longer can this go on? Even \nmore disturbingly, it equals 4.5 percent of America's total national \noutput. On a percentage basis, that is the worst trade performance in \nU.S. history!\n  How long can the United States continue to run these deficits? Have \nthe laws of international economics been repealed? Is the so-called \n``New Economy'' a land flowing with milk and honey, in which we no \nlonger need a real economy, that is, an economy that produces goods and \nservices, and employs workers? Have we entered the Promised Land of \nperspiration-free economics? I am afraid not. Even our foreign trading \npartners cannot be sanguine as the United States, historically\n\n[[Page S11653]]\n\nthe engine of growth for the entire world, is left without the means to \nplay that role.\n  America is becoming ever more dependent on foreign suppliers of basic \nmanufactured products, even in areas--such as steel--where our \nproducers are the most technologically sophisticated and efficient in \nthe world. Has anyone stopped to consider the impact on our national \ndefense of this foreign dependence? Has anyone attempted to determine \nhow our international position will be affected as we become more \nsusceptible to economic blackmail? Has anyone taken full account of how \nunfair international trade has helped to restrict income growth at \nhome, particularly in the case of middle class families? Many such \nfamilies now need two incomes--both parents out in the workplace--to \nmaintain the kind of lifestyle that single-earner families could expect \na generation ago.\n  We hear a lot about the projected economic benefits of fast track. Of \ncourse, this administration does not dare call it fast track. No, it is \n``trade promotion authority''--``trade promotion authority.'' That is \nan attempt to hoodwink those who would fall for it: fast track!\n  We hear a lot about the projected economic benefits of trade \npromotion authority, fast track. Yet, as a recent study by the Economic \nPolicy Institute pointed out, the forecast model most frequently cited \nby fast track advocates relies on unrealistic assumptions. For example, \nthe model assumes that there is no unemployment here or anywhere else \nin the world and that there are no national labor or environmental \nstandards. Moreover, the model assumes that denying elected officials \nthe authority to set the rules of the marketplace has no costs either \nin terms of the functioning of the global economy or the achievement of \ndomestic economic and social objectives. These assumptions tell us more \nabout the prejudices of a global trade elite than they do about the \neconomic circumstances in which we find ourselves.\n  Let us have a trade policy for the new millennium. Let us demand that \ntrade negotiations become a two-way street, both in form and in \nsubstance. Let us make it clear to our trading partners that we will \nnot be duped by those who would grant America the mantle of \n``leadership''--the mantle of ``leadership''--only in exchange for \nunilateral concessions. All countries stand to benefit from expanded \ninternational trade, and all countries should bear the costs of \nconstructing the framework of that trade. American workers should no \nlonger be left holding the bag in international trade negotiations. The \nsteel workers have been left holding the bag all too long, the textile \nworkers have been left holding the bag all too long in international \ntrade. The automobile workers have been left holding the bag all too \nlong in international trade negotiations.\n\n  U.S. trade negotiators need congressional input. Let's debate it. \nLet's talk about it, and, if necessary, let's amend it. U.S. trade \nnegotiators need congressional input in the negotiating process. \nRemember the ad? ``Do it here. Do it now.'' The same with trade \nnegotiations. U.S. trade negotiators need congressional input. Enhanced \nlegislative participation will help them in their efforts to reinforce \nthe framework of fair trade. Is it only fair trade when the United \nStates continues to run up huge deficits in the billions of dollars or \nin the hundreds of billions of dollars? It will give the results of \ntrade negotiations greater legitimacy and increase public understanding \nof the costs and benefits of globalization. The Constitution--ah, there \nis the Rock of Gibraltar, the Constitution--the Constitution requires \nthat we make this effort, and the American people expect it.\n  Mr. President, toward the end of his life, in a letter to Henry Lee, \nThomas Jefferson brilliantly analyzed the fundamental issue upon which \nthe debate over fast track turns. This is what he said:\n\n       Men by their constitutions are naturally divided into two \n     parties: Those who fear and distrust the people, and wish to \n     draw all powers from them into the hands of the higher \n     classes, and, Those who identify themselves with the people. \n     . . . In every country these two parties exist; and in every \n     one where they are free to think, speak, and write, they will \n     declare themselves.\n\n  Mr. President, from 1974 to 1994, Congress was, unfortunately, asleep \nat the wheel as the one-sided trade jalopy--I wonder if our little \npages here have ever heard that word, ``jalopy''?--as the one-sided \ntrade jalopy rumbled down the fast track. The people's branch of \nGovernment--ha, ha, ha--let's let that other branch of Government down \nthe avenue become aware again that there is the people's branch, that \ndoes not bend before any President, that isn't elected by any \nPresident, that isn't sent here by any President, that cannot be fired \nby any President--let them hear it from Capitol Hill. Bring on your \ntrade promotion authority. You will get your fight right here.\n  The people's branch of the Government--the Congress--allowed itself, \nI am ashamed to say, to be shunted aside in the process of formulating \nand implementing U.S. trade policy. Let us resolve to seize the day, to \nrestore the constitutional balance--bring it on; there isn't enough \ntime left in this year, if we did nothing else, to pass it in this \nbody--and to make international trade agreements reflect the interests \nof hard-working Americans. There is not enough time left in the year to \npass ``fast track'' here, unless I am very, very badly and sadly \nmistaken.\n  Now is the time to move past the failed trade paradigm of recent \nadministrations, both Republican and Democratic. Now is the time to \nrestore the people's faith that they can have an impact on the policies \nthat shape their lives. Mr. Zoellick, we are talking about the people's \nlives. ``I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.''\n  Mr. President, I come to bury fast-track authority, not to praise it! \nNow is the time to reject fast track and to embrace republican self-\ngovernment as it has been bequeathed to us by the Framers of the \nConstitution, by those who debated the Constitution, by those who \nratified it in the State conventions.\n  We must be steadfast in our loyalty to the Constitution. Forget about \npolitical party. Think of the Constitution and think of the people who \nsend us here. We are not to be yeasayers or naysayers. We are here to \ndebate and to amend and to render our considered judgment on behalf of \nthe people who send us here, who pay our salaries, and who can bring us \nback home when the day of judgment comes.\n  We must be steadfast in our loyalty to that Constitution. Here it is \nin my hand, the Constitution. There is my trade promotion authority! \nSee it? There is my trade promotion authority, my TPA, the Constitution \nof the United States!\n  We must be steadfast in our loyalty to the Constitution, that \nexquisitely balanced instrument of the people, by the people, and for \nthe people. We must stand together and resist the temptation to once \nagain ignore the clear dictates of our most fundamental law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11653-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11653-S11654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN THE COMPANY OF HEROES\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the nights are growing chilly, though the \ndays remain warm and dry--dry for too long, really, over in McLean. The \nbrilliant crimson maple and bright yellow poplar leaves have nearly \ndisappeared, replaced by the more somber late autumn tones of deep \nbronze oak and rich golden hickory leaves falling in swirling waves \nacross the road to join the drifts of leaves awaiting the rake.\n  The more subdued coloring is in keeping with the holiday that \napproaches this Sunday. For, despite any attempts to mask the nature of \nthis holiday behind sales and pre-Christmas hype, Veterans Day remains \ntrue to its purpose. It was the old Armistice Day when I was a boy--\nArmistice Day, November 11.\n  To say Veterans Day is to hear the haunting echo of taps being played \non a lone trumpet on a West Virginia hill far away--I can hear its \ntones being wafted by the autumn air to this Capital City--and the \nsharp report of a 21-gun salute ricocheting across a field of sad white \ncrosses. Out of the corner of one's eye is glimpsed the silent rank and \nfile of heroes who came home, some whole and some not, but all remade \nby the shared experience of warfare.\n  On Veterans Day, we travel in the company of heroes. Veterans Days, \nArmistice Day. My mother died on the eve of Armistice Day 1918; my \nmother, whom I never saw, as far as my recollection is concerned--the \n11th hour of\n\n[[Page S11654]]\n\nthe 11th day of the 11th month, the day on which the guns fell silent \nat the end of the war to end all wars, World War I.\n  Today it honors the veterans from all wars, and, sadly, there have \nbeen far too many of those: World War II, the cold war, the Korean war, \nthe Vietnam conflict, the Persian Gulf war, and none-too-peaceful \npeacekeeping missions around the globe. America has in the last century \nbeen embroiled in some form of conflict far more often than she has \nknown peace.\n  No conflict is ever truly finished. In addition to the troops we \nleave buried in foreign soil, a living guarantor remains behind to \nprotect each fragile and precious truce. United States forces remain in \nEurope, in Korea, a legacy of this war or that war. United States \ntroops stand at the frontier between the two Koreas. They were there \nwhen I looked with binoculars at the Communists just across the \ndividing line in Korea 46 years ago this month. They have been there \nsince the 1950s.\n  More United States troops remain in Saudi Arabia and Turkey, vigilant \nagainst further aggression from Iraq. In these last months, the United \nStates has been thrust unwillingly but unhesitatingly into a conflict \nof a new and more ambiguous kind, the war against terrorism. Already \nthis conflict has added new names to the honor roll of heroes whom we \nhonor on Veterans Day. Already active-duty Reserve and National Guard \ntroops have responded to this latest call to arms. Much rides on their \nshoulders, beyond an understandable thirst to avenge the senseless \nslaughter of innocent men and women, leaving innocent widows and \norphans behind. This war on terrorism must succeed.\n  The New Testament's--``testament'' meaning covenant--admonition to \nturn the other cheek does not work here. The New Covenant's admonition \nto turn the other cheek does not work here, but rather we must hew to \nthe Old Testament's--Old Covenant's--harsh warning regarding an eye for \nan eye. This attack must be answered or the scope and scale of terror \nattacks worldwide will be forever increased. That universal \nunderstanding is reflected in the broad consensus supporting the \ncurrent U.S. military action and in the concerted efforts to cut off \nfunding for terrorists. So this year, as we honor the veterans of past \nwars, it is appropriate to salute those who are still in uniform and to \ngive them our support.\n\n  In 1961, a veteran of World War II gave his Inaugural Address, his \nfirst speech as the new President of the United States. He said, in \npart:\n\n       Since this country was founded, each generation of \n     Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national \n     loyalty. The graves of young Americans who answered the call \n     to service surround the globe. Now the trumpet summons us \n     again--not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need--not \n     as a call to battle, though embattled we are--but a call to \n     bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year \n     out, ``rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation,''--a \n     struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, \n     disease, and war itself.\n\n  To President Kennedy's list of the common enemies of man, we can now \nadd terror.\n  Though we may hope for a quick and conclusive end to this new \nstruggle, we must be prepared for the long haul, for a ``long twilight \nstruggle, year in and year out . . .'' and for eternal vigilance. We \nhave but to look to our own history to know that we can muster the \nwill, we can muster the determination, we can muster the perseverance \nto achieve our goal and to preserve the liberty that this Nation has \nheld dear through long centuries.\n  In the wake of September 11, Americans have rallied by proudly flying \nAmerican flags on their homes, on their mailboxes, on their cars, yes, \nand on their lapels. On November 11, those flags fly in remembrance not \nonly of those who so recently lost their lives in New York, Washington, \nand Pennsylvania, but also for all those men and women who have \nstruggled or died to defend our freedom, our liberty, our Nation \nthrough the years. I am proud to salute them all, to remember them all, \nto honor them all. No amount of bloodshed and no amount of fear can \nturn this great Nation from the ideals that were forged in war in 1776, \n1777, 1778, 1779, 1780, and 1781, and defended ever since. Our flag--\nthere it is standing beside the presiding officer's chair, in all of \nits grandeur, in all of its stately magnificence, in all of its quiet \nbeauty. It still flies!\n  Mr. President, I close with one of my favorite poems, by Henry \nHolcomb Bennett, entitled ``The Flag Goes By.'' It eloquently puts \nwords to the message being sent by the many, many flags now bedecking \nour Nation.\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n     A flash of color beneath the sky:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n     Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n     Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n     Hats off!\n     The colors before us fly;\n     But more than the flag is passing by:\n\n     Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,\n     Fought to make and to save the State;\n     Weary marches and sinking ships;\n     Cheers of victory on dying lips:\n\n     Days of plenty and years of peace;\n     March of a strong land's swift increase;\n     Equal justice, right and law,\n     Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n     Sign of a nation great and strong\n     To ward her people from foreign wrong:\n     Pride and glory and honor,--all\n     Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n     And loyal hearts are beating high:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before proceeding, I wish to express on \nbehalf of the majority leader and myself our profound gratitude to the \nPresiding Officer for his patience and for his equanimity and for his \ngood humor always, for the work he has done on behalf of his country \ntoday, sitting in the Chair for longer than he should.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11654-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11654-S11655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 A NEW COMMITMENT TO AMERICA'S VETERANS\n\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, in the past few weeks, I have often \nthought of that scene in one of Shakespeare's plays where two friends \nmeet, but one does not recognize the other. One explains: ``Grief hath \nchanged me since you saw me last.'' Yes, grief has changed the face of \nAmerica. We are tear stained by tragedy, but we are triumphant in \nspirit.\n  It has been nearly 60 years since we experienced such a lethal and \ncowardly attack on our Nation. Though I was a young child at the time, \nI still remember the shock and sadness of Pearl Harbor. But I also \nrecall the spirit of unity and partiotism that swelled up within us \nfollowing that attack.\n  At a time when half of our Navy lay at the bottom of the ocean, \nPresident Roosevelt spoke of our ``inevitable triumph.'' He placed his \nconfidence in what he called ``the unbounding determination of the \nAmerican people.''\n  We all pulled together in the years that followed. We conquered \nfascism and communism, we rescued democracy, and we built a better \nworld. America's veterans led the way.\n  Today, our President has called us to a similar resolve. And we will \nanswer that call again. We must start by making a new commitment to all \nthose who serve today, and to every one of America's veterans.\n  I have proposed legislation that would extend Tri-Care benefits to \nour citizens soldiers for up to four months after they return from \nactive duty. It has passed the Senate, and I am working to make sure it \nbecomes part of the Defense bill.\n  I also support a bill to provide Tri-Care for life to every American \nveteran, because I think we owe them that much.\n  I believe we should extend the Montgomery G.I. bill, and allow \nveterans to transfer half of their education benefits to their family.\n  I also support the President's efforts to improve the Veterans' \nAdministration's response to benefit claims. It is shameful that \nsomeone who risked their life for our country should have to wait for \nmonths, even years, to get the benefits they deserve, the benefits they \nhave earned.\n\n[[Page S11655]]\n\n  There might be those who say we can't afford to care for our Nation's \nveterans, that the price is too high. But I say, if we don't stand by \nthose who fought for us, we are unworthy of their sacrifice.\n  So on the Veteran's Day 2001, a day of remembrance and commitment, we \nsalute the fighting men and women of our Nation, active duty, reserves, \nand veterans.\n  We look to them in our time of national need. They have never let us \ndown. We pledge our support in the defense of freedom. We declare to \nthem, we declare to each other, we will not allow the American dream to \nbe diminished by fear, or our eyes dimmed by tears.\n  From the ashes of terrorism, we will build a new tower to freedom \nthat will cast its light around the world. With God's help, we will \nprove again what the poet Carl Sandburg once said: ``We are Americans. \nNothing like us ever was.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11655-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VA-HUD APPROPRIATIONS\n\n\n                             water projects\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

LEE HARTWELL\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to share with the Senate and \nthe American people the remarkable work of Dr. Lee Hartwell, a \nrespected scientist in Washington State. Dr. Hartwell was recently \nawarded the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research in cell \ndivision and cancer.\n  I'm especially proud that Dr. Hartwell conducted much of his research \nat the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, where he \nserves as president and director.\n  On October 8, 2001, the Nobel Assembly announced that Dr. Hartwell, \nalong with Paul Nurse and Timothy Hunt, has won the 2001 Nobel Prize in \nphysiology or medicine. The award honors Dr. Hartwell's more than 30 \nyears of pioneering work in yeast genetics. Dr. Hartwell's research \ninto cell division has helped scientists throughout the world to better \nunderstand cancer and has laid the foundation for future cancer \ntreatments.\n  Dr. Hartwell leads one of the finest research teams in the world at \nthe Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. In the past five years, \nI've worked in Congress to double funding for the National Institutes \nof Health (NIH). This investment is intended to support the kind of \ngroundbreaking research being conducted at the Research Center. In \nfact, as a member of the Senate HELP Committee and the Senate Labor, \nH.H.S. and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I often point to the \nlifesaving research and care the center provides as an example of why \nthis investment in NIH is so important.\n  Dr. Hartwell is not just a talented scientist. He is a real champion \nfor cancer patients and their families. During consideration of a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, Dr. Hartwell often spoke out on behalf of \ncancer patients and explained the importance of access to clinical \ntrials, which is sometimes the only hope for patients. Thanks to the \nadvocacy of cancer researchers like Dr. Hartwell, the final legislation \nincluded this protection for patients.\n  Dr. Hartwell was born on October 30, 1939 in Los Angeles, California. \nHe earned his Bachelor of Science in 1961 from the California Institute \nof Technology and his Ph.D in 1964 from the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology. From 1965-68, he served as Associate Professor at the \nUniversity of California. In 1968, he joined the faculty of the \nUniversity of Washington and became a professor of genetics in 1973. In \n1997, he became President and Director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer \nResearch Center. In 1987, he became a member of the U.S. National \nAcademy of Sciences. He has received numerous honors including: the \nGeneral Motors Sloan Award (1991), Gairdner Foundation International \nAward (1992), Genetics Society of America Medal (1994) and the Albert \nLasker Basic Medical Research Award (1998).\n  Dr. Hartwell will be presented with the award on December 10, 2001, \nwhich is the 100th anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, after whom \nthe award is named. The Nobel Committee has recognized what we in the \nNorthwest have known for a long time; namely that because of Dr. \nHartwell's hard work and dedication, the world is a better place. It is \nan honor and a distinct pleasure to join with the Nobel Committee in \nformally recognizing Dr. Lee Hartwell's many accomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11655-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            KOREAN WAR VETERAN 1ST LT. LEON J. JACQUES, JR.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the late 1st Lt. Leon J. Jacques, Jr., of Milford, NH, for \nhis heroic services to the United States of America during the Korean \nwar.\n  Leon was a graduate of Saint Anselm College and the United States \nMilitary Academy at West Point who also attended the Ground General \nSchool at Fort Riley, KS and the United States Army Infantry School at \nFort Benning, GA.\n  He was assigned to the 21st Infantry Regiment, 24th Infantry Division \nin Kumamoto, Japan. After the outbreak of war in Korea on June 25, \n1950, Leon was committed to combat in Korea. During the first two weeks \nof combat, more than forty percent of the men fighting were killed, \nwounded, prisoners of war, or missing in action.\n  On July 12, 1950, Leon and his men were captured as prisoners of war \nand it was later learned that Leon had been killed by the enemy. He was \nin charge of several soldiers who were harassed by the enemy. Leon \ndemanded that they stop and for making this statement, he was killed. \nAccording to a report received, ``Lt. Jacques' complete disregard for \nhis personal safety and valor in response to enemy aggression were in \nthe finest tradition of military service and reflected great credit \nupon himself, the 21st Infantry Regiment and the United States Army.''\n  Thanks to the generous efforts of Colonel Phil Day US Army (Ret), \nLeon has been honored with ten award medals including: Bronze Star \nMedal with ``v'' device, United Nations Service Medal, Presidential \nUnit Citation and the combat infantryman badge.\n  As the son of a World War II Naval aviator who was killed in a war \nrelated incident and a veteran of the Vietnam war, I empathize with the \nJacques family. Leon is an American hero whose selfless dedication to \nhis State and country has benefitted his fellow citizens with the \nblessings of freedom and liberty. It is truly an honor and a privilege \nto represent his family in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11655-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11655-S11656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING THE HEROES OF THE ALEUTIANS CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to share a story about a \nremarkable group of veterans that fought for our freedom over 50 years \nago. During October 4-7, 2001, a small band of World War II veterans \nand their families gathered in Anchorage for what was probably their \nlast reunion. They shared the common experience of having fought an air \nwar in one of the most difficult theaters of operations during World \nWar II, the Aleutian Islands.\n  For those of you who have not had the opportunity to visit the \nAleutians, let me tell you what you are missing. Some of the harshest \nand most unbearable weather exists in this region of my State. Some \ncall the Aleutians the birth place of the winds. It is my honor to \nrecognize these fine men who fought to protect our nation.\n  These courageous individuals are also the founders of today's \nEleventh Air Force. Appropriately, those who spent their youth \ndefending Alaska elected ``Back to Our Roots,'' as their reunion theme.\n  The men and women of the Eleventh Air Force served their Nation well, \nhelping drive the Japanese from the western Aleutian Islands of Attu \nand Kiska during the Aleutian Campaign. It was the only campaign fought \non the\n\n[[Page S11656]]\n\nNorth American continent during the war. It was also the first time \nsince the War of 1812 that a foreign military force had occupied North \nAmerican soil.\n  Later, the men of the Eleventh Air Force flew some of the war's \nlongest missions against Japanese installations in the northern Kurile \nIslands from bases on Attu and Shemya Islands. During the Aleutian \nCampaign, the veterans of the Eleventh Air Force flew 297 missions and \ndropped 3,662 tons of bombs on Japanese installations on Attu and \nKiska. One hundred and fourteen men were killed; another forty-two were \nreported missing in action and another forty-six died as a result of \naccidents.\n  Following the end of the campaign, the Eleventh Air Force was reduced \nin strength from a high of 16,526 in August 1943 to a low of 6,849 by \nthe war's end. The two bomber squadrons that remained along with Navy \nair units flew bombing and reconnaissance missions against Japanese \ntargets in the northern Kurile Islands. The military used the highly \nclassified operation, code named Wedlock, which also involved submarine \npatrols and shore bombardment, to divert Japanese attention north and \nmislead them about U.S. strategy in the Pacific.\n  It succeeded in its objective. The Japanese increased their garrison \nin the northern Kuriles from 8,000 in 1943, to 41,000 in 1944. They \nmaintained 400 aircraft there in anticipation that America was planning \nto invade Japan by a northern route.\n  During this time, Eleventh Air Force bombers flew 276 missions, \nlosing 74 crew members killed in action and 11 taken prisoners of war, \nof which 3 died in captivity. Another 179 were interned in the Soviet \nUnion--where they landed after experiencing difficulties returning to \ntheir home bases. They were among the 291 young American aircrews who \ntemporarily wound up in Soviet hands as the result of the air war in \nthe Pacific.\n  Unlike other World War II theaters of operations, the Aleutians has \nnot been properly recognized. The men and women who served on those \nwind swept and hauntingly beautiful islands have not been forgotten. \nAlaskans are grateful for what they did to defend our freedom and land. \nTheir efforts, and those who served elsewhere in the territory, \ncontributed immeasurably to the growth and development of my State. \nThey helped provide the foundation that ultimately led to the \nachievement of statehood.\n  Those who fought for our Nation's values during a difficult time in \nthe Aleutians and the North Pacific Theater are truly heros. It is my \nhonor to say thank you and recognize them on this Veterans Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11656-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VETERANS DAY, 2001\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my privilege to rise and thank \nthe men and women who have served in our Nation's armed forces. This \nSunday, November 11, 2001, our country takes a moment to recognize the \nmen and women who have made our country a free Nation for over 225 \nyears.\n  Veterans Day is a day that is as diverse and as rich in history as \nthe many battles that were fought defending our freedom. November 11, \n1918 is the date most remembered as the 11th hour of the 11th day of \nthe 11th month. This day began with the laying down of arms and blowing \nof whistles. Impromptu parades were held and shops closed for the day \nto honor veterans. 83 years ago November 11 became known as ``Armistice \nDay.''\n  For 16 peaceful years following World War I, the United States along \nwith other countries such as Canada, Australia and Britain celebrated \nthis day. A moment of silence at the allotted hour of 11AM was held to \nremember the sacrifices that men and women made in order to ensure that \nfreedom reigns.\n  Sadly, as we all know, war is a part our lives. Around every corner \nadversity and evil exists. However, Americans being steadfast and \nalways determined to live life peacefully continued to observe a day of \nremembrance and appreciation on November 11.\n  In 1938 Congress passed a bill that November 11 ``shall be dedicated \nto the cause of world peace and. . .hereafter celebrated and known as \nArmistice Day.'' But shortly thereafter World War II broke out. Over \nSixteen million--I repeat, over sixteen million--Americans took part in \nWorld War II. Veterans Day was officially recognized in 1954 when the \nlate President Eisenhower signed a bill that proclaimed November 11 as \nVeterans Day.\n  We also pay tribute to those soldiers who made the ultimate \nsacrifice. In 1921 an American soldier, whose name was ``known but to \nGod,'' was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. This soldier became \nthe personification of dignity and reverence for America's veterans. In \n1958, two more unidentified fallen American soldiers from World War II \nand Korea were interred next to their comrade of World War I. These \nbrave soldiers, and all those who have died on the battle field who \nhave never returned home for a proper burial, are guarded day and night \nby men and women in the armed services.\n  Today America is facing a new kind of war, one that does not quickly \nassimilate with previous conflicts our soldiers have faced, a war that \nis being fought by men and women who, as thousands before them, have \nanswered the call to duty to protect and defend our freedom.\n  Our military is engaged in conflict overseas with a vile and inhumane \nenemy, an enemy that lives in shadows, strikes at innocent civilians, \nand finds victory in terror. It is a new kind of war. But one thing \nremains the same. Our armed forces carry on the fight for freedom.\n  On September 11, our world changed. Once again, we are a nation at \nwar. Once again, our troops are engaged in conflict overseas. And once \nagain, they will prevail.\n  It is my sincere honor to thank all veterans who have served in our \narmed forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11656-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDWARD A.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Edward Laurie of Enfield, NH, an exemplary public official \nwho dedicated himself to serving the people of New Hampshire for more \nthan 26 years. As chief of police for the city of Lebanon since 1991, \nhe has brought to the office the professional skills and knowledge of \nlaw enforcement which has benefitted the citizens of Lebanon and the \nentire State.\n  Edward began his career as a patrol officer in 1975, and was promoted \nthrough the ranks of the Lebanon Police Department serving positions \nincluding: police sergeant from 1984-1985, police lieutenant from 1985-\n1986, police captain from 1987-1991 and police chief from 1991-2001.\n  He was an active member of the law enforcement who participated in \nprograms including: chairman of the New Hampshire Regional Drug Task \nForce, executive board member of the New Hampshire Attorney General's \nDrug Task Force, president of the New Hampshire Police Association, \nassociate of the FBI National Academy, and member of the New England \nand Grafton County Chiefs of Police Associations.\n  Edward was active in the Lebanon community and provided dedicated \nservice to area charities including the New Hampshire Special Olympics \nand Lebanon Lions and Kiwanis Clubs.\n  Throughout his career, Edwards has served the city of Lebanon and the \nState of New Hampshire with dedication and pride. The people of Lebanon \nowe a debt of gratitude to Edward for the contributions which he has \nmade making the city and the State a safer and more pleasant \nenvironment in which to live.\n  It is an honor and a privilege to represent Edward Laurie in the \nUnited States Senate.

Mr. President, as we again approach Veterans \nDay, it is vital that we pause, more so than on any Veterans Day in \nrecent memory, to give tribute to the more than 48 million heroic \nveterans who have served in our military since the start of the \nRepublic and who have fought so that the freedom and safety of this \ngreat Nation would not be compromised. We owe our veterans our \nheartfelt gratitude for answering the call and serving us all in the \nUnited States Armed Forces.\n\n[[Page S11657]]\n\n  Today, as it should be, military service is being held in high \nesteem. The events of September 11 have renewed America's sense of \ngratitude toward the men and women of the Armed Forces for the great \nsacrifices they make everyday on behalf of our Nation. America has been \nsteadfast in its commitment to the world to be a beacon for freedom. \nOur military personnel have honored our commitment to the world, time \nafter time, in every part of the globe.\n  At present, the members of our Armed Forces are fighting the \nterrorist regime responsible for the deaths of thousands of Americans \non September 11th. We will win this fight. And once again, our men and \nwomen in uniform will honor our commitment to the world. What strikes \nme with enormous poignancy is the age of those who have answered the \ncall to duty throughout our history. In this war, as in those of our \npast, we send our young to honor our commitments abroad and to protect \nour great Nation. They are the best of the best. Their motto might well \nbe, in the words of Alexander Pope, ``Act well your part, therein all \nhonor lies.''\n  As we observe Veterans Day, let us remember that we owe our veterans \nour gratitude and appreciation year round, and not merely on the day \nset aside for the commemoration of their service and sacrifice. It \nwould be truly disgraceful if veterans were made to feel forgotten \nexcept for this one day per year. Indeed, our gratitude should be as \nsteadfast as the great monuments that Americans have built in \ncommemoration of the very service and sacrifices our veterans made. \nThere should be no ambivalence in our attitude toward those who serve \nin the United States Armed Forces.\n  I am proud to represent the State of West Virginia in the Senate. \nWest Virginia has one of the highest veteran populations per capita of \nany State. The deep patriotism and loyalty to our country of the people \nof my State of West Virginia fills me with gratitude, and inspires me \nin my role as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. In \nthat position, I am fortunate to represent not only the veterans of \nWest Virginia, but veterans all over our country.\n  As Chairman, I have fought very hard for improvements in benefits and \nservices to veterans. We have made significant strides this year in \nfulfilling the pledge of Abraham Lincoln, ``to care for him who shall \nhave borne the battle, and for his widow and his orphans.''\n  A critical need for veterans is long-term care. Our veteran \npopulation is aging rapidly and it is our responsibility to care for \nthem. I am dedicated to this need, and in groundbreaking legislation, I \nwas able to secure a significant expansion in the eligibility for and \ntypes of treatment that will soon be available to veterans.\n  It is my belief that the Montgomery GI Bill must be sufficient to \nrecognize the commitment and sacrifices that individuals make to serve \nin the military. In keeping with that belief, the Committee has \nendorsed legislation under which the basic rate of the MGIB benefit \nwill be raised over the next 3 years. In addition, accelerated payments \nof MGIB benefits will be authorized to accommodate the compressed \nschedule of courses that leads to employment in a high technology \nindustry. We should make every effort to accommodate the educational \nneeds of our veterans, and this change is an important step in doing \nso.\n  Additionally, the Committee endorsed legislation under which the \nmaximum amount for the popular VA home loan guaranty will be increased. \nIt will now be within the reach of veterans to buy homes in major \nmetropolitan areas where home prices have skyrocketed. Many years have \npassed since a VA home loan guaranty increase, and high housing costs \nin certain areas had put homeownership beyond the reach of our veterans \nwho live in those areas. This increase will add value to the existing \nbenefit.\n  Today, and everyday, we should honor those who have worn the uniforms \nof our Nation. All those who served deserve our appreciation, our \nrespect, and our compassion. They are indeed, the best of the \nbest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11657-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JESSICA CATANESE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire, Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Jessica Catanese, of Groton, MA for being honored as the \n2001 recipient of the Veteran's Affairs Hands and Heart Award. The \naward is an annual recognition given to one employee in each VA medical \nfacility whose ``sustained, compassionate, direct patient care is \nexceptional.''\n  Jessica is a recreation therapist for the Manchester VA Medical \nCenter Nursing Home who provides emotional support, help and guidance \nto patients above and beyond the call of duty.

As a veteran of the Vietnam \nwar and senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I applaud \nher achievements and professionalism. The citizens of New Hampshire own \nJessica a debt of thanks for her exemplary services.\n  I wish Jessica continued success in her professional endeavors at the \nManchester VA Medical Center Nursing Home.

Mr. President, today I rise to honor the memory \nof a fearless leader and influential figure in Missouri politics, State \nSenator Paula J. Carter.\n  A native of Saint Louis, Senator Carter got involved in politics in \nthe '60s. Her rise from Democratic precinct worker to an influential \nfigure in the Missouri General Assembly clearly demonstrates the fact \nthat one person can make a tremendous difference in the lives of all.\n  During her tenure in the Missouri House and Senate, she was a fierce \ndefender and protector of peoples' rights. To her it never mattered who \nher foes were. At a time when many accepted inequity and injustice as \nthe way it always was, she saw them as challenges to be overcome. When \nother politicians asked, ``Can we win?'' Senator Carter asked ``Should \nwe fight?'' More often than not, the answer was a rousing ``Yes!'' Her \nefforts on behalf of women and minorities will never be forgotten.\n  In addition to her legislative and civic successes, Senator Carter \nwas proud of her role as a mother and grandmother. Wardell, Gregory, \nKeena, and Willie Christopher will attempt to carry on their mother's \ntradition, each in their own way, as will, also, her seven \ngrandchildren.\n  Though there are still causes to champion and battle to fight, this \ntireless advocate has been called to rest. May we all find inspiration \nin her deeds and renew our commitment to public service, a calling \nworthy of our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11657-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak \nabout hate crimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in \nMarch of this year. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 6, \n1996 in Washington, D.C. The assailant, Michael J. Monts, 29, was \ncharged with simple assault and assault with a deadly weapon for \nallegedly attacking a gay man in July 1996. Monts was ultimately \nconvicted of assault with a deadly weapon in connection to that crime.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11658-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11658]]\n      WESTERN KENTUCKY UNIVERSITY MOBILE HEALTH AND WELLNESS UNIT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL, Mr. President, I rise this morning to pay \ntribute to the Western Kentucky University, WKU, Mobile Health and \nWellness Program. I worked vigorously to secure funding for this \nimportant initiative which will provide needed health care services to \nthe families of rural Kentucky. I am pleased to announce that the WKU \nMobile Health and Wellness Unit will be dedicated this afternoon in a \nceremony in Morgantown, KY.\n  America has led the world in developing exciting medical advances and \ninnovations during the last decade. New diagnostic tools, like PET \nScans and MRI's, allow physicians to detect serious diseases in their \nearliest stages and treat patients before they become seriously ill. \nAdvancements in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, and medical devices \nalso allow doctors to successfully cure illnesses that would have been \nfatal just a few years ago.\n  Unfortunately, many of the miracles of modern medicine are not always \navailable to the citizens of rural Kentucky. For far too many rural \nKentuckians, economic and geographic barriers impede access to even the \nmost basic medical and dental screenings. As a result, these men, \nwomen, and children frequently lag behind their peers in many accepted \nmeasures of general health.\n  Western Kentucky University recognizes that limited access to health \ncare services is a critical problem confronting the people of south-\ncentral Kentucky. To address this problem, WKU decided that if families \nliving in rural communities are not able to travel to receive adequate \ncare, then WKU should bring health care services to rural communities \nthrough a Mobile Health Clinic.\n  When Dr. Gary Ransdell, President of WKU, approached me with the idea \nfor their mobile health program, I was immediately impressed by the \npotential of this vehicle to bring quality health care to the citizens \nof rural Kentucky. Our shared vision is that such a clinic can provide \nbasic health care services such as physicals, well-child check-ups, \nPSA's, mammographies, and basic dental screenings. With that in mind, I \nwas proud to use my position on the Senate Appropriations Committee to \nsecure $700,000 for this important initiative in the Fiscal Year 2001 \nLabor, Health and Human Services, Education Appropriations Bill.\n  I believe that all Kentuckians, whether they live in the smallest \nhollows or the biggest cities, should have access to basic health care \nservices and the most modern screening technologies. WKU's Mobile \nHealth and Wellness Program, which will be dedicated today, is an \nimportant step in that direction. I look forward to working with \nWestern Kentucky University on this and other successful programs \ndesigned to improve the lives of Kentucky's citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11658-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO BAE SYSTEMS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the Business Unit of BAE Systems of Nashua, NH, for being \nnamed as one of five companies in the country to receive the Pro Patria \nAward. The award is given to companies which are supportive of military \nreservists.\n  The Information and Electronic Warfare Systems business unit received \nthe award on October 11, 2001, at a ceremony at the Pentagon following \na presidential proclamation ceremony in the Rose Garden of the White \nHouse.\n  BAE was nominated for the Pro Patria Award by Pete Kilger, department \nmanager for BAE's Systems Engineering in the Information Dominance \nSystems area and a member of the Naval Reserve. BAE was chosen for the \nprestigious award because of its outstanding support and understanding \nfor employees in the military reserves.\n  BAE does work for the U.S. military services and values the exemplary \ncontributions of employee reservists and the contributions they make to \nNew Hampshire and the country. BAE is one of the largest employers of \nreservists in the state providing benefits including paying reservists \non military duty the difference between their military and civilian \npay.\n  I commend BAE Systems for the many contributions they have made to \nthe defense industry. Their concern for company employees who are \nreservists in the United States military is exemplary. The people of \nNew Hampshire and the country owe a debt of gratitude to BAE Systems \nfor the economic and defense benefits provided by their hard work and \ndedication.\n  BAE will continue to provide expertise which will be of benefit to \nthe military personnel in the country with its involvement in the \nproduction of the next generation fighter jets. BAE Systems will have \ntwo teams working on electronic warfare systems for the F-35, also \nknown as the Joint Strike Fighter.

A bill to prevent terrorist hoaxes and false reports; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Punishing \nTerrorist Hoaxes Act of 2001.\n  In the days since September 11, all of us have learned that anthrax \nhoaxes are no joking matter. They are acts of terror in the true sense \nof the word because they inflict great fear and anxiety on innocent \npeople. In addition, these hoaxes drain resources from police and \nemergency workers--resources desperately needed not only for the real \nwar on terror, but for all of the ordinary emergencies that continue to \narise every single day.\n  According to recent reports, there have been some 160 anthrax and \nother terrorism hoaxes since September 11. In Connecticut, one hoax \ntriggered the evacuation of 800 government employees for two days. \nHoaxes in Virginia and Oregon have shut down post offices. In my State \nof North Carolina, from Greensboro to Chapel Hill, hoaxes have targeted \nand terrified workers at family planning medical clinics--workers who \nalready must live with death threats day in and day out.\n  I have spoken with law enforcement officials in North Carolina who \nbelieve we need new Federal legislation specifically to fight hoaxes. \nAt a hearing of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Technology, \nTerrorism, and Government Information earlier this week, officials from \nthe Bush Administration requested that legislation. In response to \nseveral questions that I asked, they articulated the very real need: \nCurrent law prohibits terrorist ``threats,'' but terrorism hoaxes may \nnot always be viewed as threats because the people perpetrating the \nhoaxes are not able and do not intend to carry out actual terrorist \nacts. Yet these hoaxes must be punished.\n  The legislation I propose builds on proposals by other Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle, including Senator Leahy, Senators Biden and \nHatch, and Senators Schumer and DeWine. There are two things that \ndistinguish the legislation I propose, and I want to highlight those.\n  First, my proposal includes ``findings'' about the need for this \nlegislation. In recent decisions holding that Federal laws are not \nproper exercises of Congress's ``commerce clause'' power and therefore \nare not constitutional, the Supreme Court has said that ``findings'' \nabout a real Federal need are important. Although I don't agree with \nthose recent cases, I want to do everything I can to make sure this \nstatute is upheld in the courts. The addition of findings is one way to \ndo that while still enacting the ban we need.\n  Second, my proposal establishes two Federal hoax crimes, not just \none. All persons who perpetrate hoaxes are punishable by up to two \nyears in prison. In addition, persons who perpetrate hoaxes with intent \nto cause fear, in a manner reasonably likely to cause an emergency \nresponse, are punishable by up to five years in prison. The line we are \ndrawing is a line between people who really and truly think they are \n``just joking'' and people who want to terrorize others.\n  Both kinds of hoaxes should be felony crimes. And the person who \nwants to inflict fear deserves a stiffer sentence than the person who \ndoes not. That is a line we regularly draw in the criminal law. We \npunish people with evil motives more than people who are reckless or \nstupid. Federal law makes that distinction in the Bomb Hoax Act, 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. 35, which sets up a lesser offense requiring no criminal \nintent, and a greater offense requiring that the perpetrator act \n``maliciously.''\n  I ask the Congress to enact the Punishing Terrorist Hoaxes Act of \n2001. And whether we enact this legislation or one of my colleagues' \nproposals, I ask the Congress to enact an anti-hoax bill before we go \nout of session. We owe it to police officers, public health officials, \nand the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/09/senate-section/article/S11661-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11661]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 177--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT UNITED \n     STATES POSTAL SERVICE EMPLOYEES SHOULD BE COMMENDED FOR THEIR \n   OUTSTANDING SERVICE AND DEDICATION SINCE THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF \n                           SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Akaka) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
