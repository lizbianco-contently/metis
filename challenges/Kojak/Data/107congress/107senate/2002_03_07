EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by sections 503(a) and 504 do not apply \n     to any nuclear incident that occurs before the date of the \n     enactment of this subtitle.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to offer the Price-\nAnderson reauthorization bill as an amendment to the Energy Policy Act. \nLast year, as the former chairman of the Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, I \nintroduced the Price-Anderson reauthorization bill, S. 1360, that \nreauthorizes the insurance program for commercial nuclear reactors.\n  The Price-Anderson Act was first passed back in 1957 and has been \nrenewed three times since then. The current authorization expires on \nAugust 1 of this year.\n  This amendment provides the insurance program for commercial nuclear \npowerplants and Department of Energy contractor employees. In my State \nof Ohio, this is very important for the contractor employees who are \ncurrently working at the Mound and Fernald facilities, former sites of \nnuclear facilities of the Department of Energy.\n  This is the type of must-pass legislation that keeps the trains of \nGovernment running on time.\n  I think it is important to note that during the previous \nadministration, both the Department of Energy and the\n\n[[Page S1623]]\n\nNuclear Regulatory Commission issued reports to Congress recommending \nthe reauthorization of Price-Anderson.\n  The DOE and the NRC reports also called for a doubling of the annual \npremium paid by the nuclear reactors from $10 million to 20 million.\n  This recommendation was made prior to the relicensing process. At \nthat time, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission projected that up to half \nof our nuclear reactors would be retired instead of being relicensed. \nWe have something like 103 nuclear reactors out there.\n  However, thanks to regulatory improvements made in the process, \nlargely due to the oversight of the Nuclear Safety Subcommittee, the \nNRC believes that most of our nuclear reactors will be in fact \nrelicensed. Therefore, the NRC issued a statement last year revising \ntheir projections and recommending that the annual premium not be \nincreased. This amendment follows those recommendations.\n  It is important for the American public to understand how the Price-\nAnderson liability program works. First of all, it is important to \nunderstand it is not a Federal subsidy. The nuclear industry actually \nfunds the program. Each nuclear powerplant purchases liability \ninsurance to cover the first $200 million from private insurers for \nimmediate response in the case of an accident. If the costs exceed $200 \nmillion and additional funds are needed, all the other nuclear \nreactors--and there are 103 of them--contribute up to $88 million each. \nThat totals $9.3 billion.\n  These funds are contributed by other reactors in increments of $10 \nmillion per year. If more than the $9.3 billion would be needed, \nCongress could then go back to the industry and demand a larger \ncontribution.\n  I know of no other industry in which all of the competitors agree up \nfront to pay for the mistakes or acts of God that impact upon any one \ncompany.\n  In addition, I know of no facilities of any type anywhere in the \ncountry which are insured for $9.3 billion. It is incredible.\n  It is also important to note for the American public that the \nindustry does something else that is very unusual. It waives its \ntraditional tort defenses so that the fund begins making payments \nimmediately instead of fighting out claims in the courts. If we had \nsome kind of a nuclear disaster somewhere, as we did at Three Mile \nIsland, immediately the insurance companies start paying out claims. As \na matter of fact, after Three Mile Island, claims offices were on the \nsite within 24 hours. It provides more insurance coverage for Americans \nand provides the coverage up front.\n  America's nuclear energy industry currently provides approximately 20 \npercent of our energy, while fossil fuels, such as oil, coal, and \nnatural gas, provide the bulk of the remainder. Nuclear energy is \nparticularly used in the northeast part of the United States.\n  Nuclear power is a safe and reliable energy source. It is also a \nzero-emission source of energy.\n  As I discussed in the Senate on Tuesday, just since the nuclear \nenergy has prevented 62 million tons of sulfur dioxide, a key component \nof acid rain, and 32 million tons of nitrogen oxide, a precursor to \nozone, from being released into the atmosphere. It has probably \ncontributed more to a reduction in emissions than any other source of \nenergy but for solar and wind and hydroelectric.\n  This has had a tremendous positive effect on the environment and \npublic health. In my view and in the view of many, coal and nuclear \npower have been inappropriately demonized over the last few years. \nThese characterizations are patently unfair if we look at the record.\n  Both are efficient and cost-effective sources of energy, and given \nour current energy consumption rates, we are going to be dependent upon \nthem for the foreseeable future.\n\n  The truth is, we are not meeting our energy needs currently \ndomestically. And if we look at 20-year projections, we are going to \nneed another 30 percent production of energy if we are going to be \ncompetitive.\n  We are taking steps to make coal a cleaner burning fuel. We should \nalso do whatever we can to promote a safe and efficient nuclear energy \nindustry for our Nation and encourage the development of new nuclear \nreactors such as modular reactors which we have been discussing of \nlate. Reauthorizing the Price-Anderson Act is a major step in that \ndirection.\n  I thank my colleagues for cosponsoring this amendment: Senators \nBingaman, Bob Smith, Inhofe, Murkowski, Domenici, Landrieu, Hagel, \nCrapo, Thomas, Bond, Campbell, and Frist. I urge all of my colleagues \nto support this amendment. This should not be something that is \nextremely controversial. It is long overdue. It is something we have \nhad since 1957. We should get on with it and make it part of Senator \nDaschle's energy legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I commend the Senator for offering \nthis amendment. I am cosponsoring the amendment. Title V of the \nunderlying bill we are debating renews the provisions of the Price-\nAnderson Act that relate to Department of Energy contractors, but it \ndoes not renew those that relate to NRC licensees.\n  The reason is that jurisdiction over the contractor provisions was in \nthe Energy Committee, which was where we were largely developing this \nbill. The jurisdiction over the NRC licensee provisions is in the \nEnvironment Committee that Senator Smith chaired. Some members of the \nEnvironment Committee asked us not to include provisions that were \nunder its jurisdiction in this substitute. The pending amendment \nSenator Voinovich has offered now provides a substitute for the Price-\nAnderson provisions in the underlying bill.\n  It repeats the provisions that renew DOE contractor portions of \nPrice-Anderson that are already there, and in addition, it adds the new \nprovisions related to the NRC licensee part of the act.\n  Let me give a short summary of what the pending amendment would do. \nSection 502 of the amendment extends the NRC's indemnification \nauthority for another 10 years. That has been recommended by the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission, and it is part of what Senator Voinovich \nis proposing. It extends the indemnification authority of the \nDepartment of Energy indefinitely. That is also consistent with the \n1998 report of the Department of Energy.\n  Section 503 of the amendment raises the liability limit for DOE \ncontractors and hence the amount that DOE indemnifies its contractors \nup to $10 billion, which would be adjusted in the future for inflation.\n  Under current law, the liability limit for DOE contractors is tied to \nthe maximum liability of Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensees, which \nis currently at $9 billion.\n  Section 504 increases the liability limits and indemnification for \naccidents involving government-owned nuclear facilities or devices \nlocated outside the United States from the $100 million, where it \npresently is, to $500 million. This increase also was recommended by \nthe Department of Energy. It is consistent with international nuclear \nliability standards.\n  Section 505 requires both the Department of Energy and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to submit new reports on the need to continue or \nmodify the act in 2008.\n  Section 506 requires the Secretary of Energy to adjust the $10 \nbillion liability limit every 5 years for inflation. This is consistent \nalso with the provision in existing law that requires the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to adjust the limit for Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission licensees.\n  Section 507 repeals two provisions in current law that exempt \nnonprofit Department of Energy contractors from civil penalties for \nnuclear safety violations.\n  Section 507 subjects nonprofit contractors to set civil penalties. It \nlimits the total amount of those penalties to the fee the contractor \nreceives in any year under the contract.\n  Finally, section 508 provides two or more so-called ``modular'' \nreactors that are located at one site should be treated as a single \nnuclear powerplant for purposes of assessing premiums under the Price-\nAnderson Act. This provision has been added to allow for the use of \nsome of the new advanced technology reactor designs that make use of \nseveral small reactor modules to do the work of a single large nuclear\n\n[[Page S1624]]\n\nreactor. The provision will permit the NRC to treat a collection of \nthese modules at a single site as a single reactor for Price-Anderson \npurposes.\n  In summary, the Price-Anderson Act has served this nation well for 45 \nyears, by enabling utilities to generate 20 percent of our Nation's \nelectricity with nuclear power, universities to conduct important \nnuclear research, and corporations to build nuclear weapons for our \nnational defense without the threat of unlimited liability.\n  At the same time, the act has ensured that the public will be \ncompensated in the event of a nuclear accident, that adequate funds \nwill be available to pay claims, and that victims will be able to \nrecover through an efficient no-fault liability system, which waives \nmany of the legal obstacles that would confront victims in the absence \nof the act.\n  The important pending amendment renews this important law with a \nminimum number of changes, and in ways consistent with the strong \nrecommendations we have received from the two agencies charged with \nadministering it. I urge its adoption.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I rise in very strong \nsupport of the Voinovich-Bingaman Price-Anderson amendment.\n  Senator Voinovich has long been a leader at the EPW Committee on \nnuclear issues. I am proud to join him as a cosponsor of this \namendment. Last year, Senator Voinovich introduced S. 1360 to \nreauthorize Price-Anderson for NRC licensees--a bill of which I was an \noriginal cosponsor, as the ranking member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. I am also pleased to be joining my colleagues on both \nthe Energy Committee and on my own committee in cosponsoring this \namendment. I especially thank Senator Bingaman for his cooperation with \nus on this issue.\n  Price-Anderson addresses two classes of nuclear facilities: \ncommercial nuclear reactors and Federal nuclear facilities operated by \n``DOE contractors.'' It combines both NRC licensee and DOE contractor \nprovisions of Price-Anderson.\n  I want to speak for a couple of minutes to the provisions of the \namendment that deal with NRC licensees, as that is where the EPW \nCommittee has focused its efforts. It does two very simple things. No. \n1, it reauthorizes Price-Anderson for NRC licensees for an additional \n10 years--consistent with NRC recommendations. Secondly, the amendment \nrecognizes that new nuclear technologies--technologies that provide \nsmaller, modular, cost-effective, and even safer reactors--are on the \nhorizon. That is the future. This amendment allows for that new \ntechnology to come forth and to be used.\n  For the purposes of secondary protection requirements, this amendment \ntreats modular reactor facilities containing modules of 100 to 300 \nmegawatts, up to a total of 1,300 megawatts, as a single facility.\n  These modular units--now being developed--are the future of nuclear \npower, and it is important that Price-Anderson recognize the difference \nbetween these smaller modular units and the current larger facilities. \nAgain, this legislation--this amendment--will allow for this modular \nconcept to take hold and bring us into the future with nuclear power.\n  The background has been stated on Price-Anderson by my colleagues, \nbut just briefly to summarize, it was a law passed in 1957 in order to \nprovide immediate compensation in the event of a nuclear accident.\n  Price-Anderson is the best mechanism for providing the highest level \nof compensation in the shortest period of time, without having to put \nvictims through an arduous and protracted legal process.\n  Equally important, it is the best deal for the taxpayer. With Price-\nAnderson, if there were a nuclear accident or incident, up to $9.5 \nbillion would be available to compensate any victims. Not one dime of \nthat money would come from taxpayers. It comes from a combination of \ninsurance coverage and the industry itself--the entire nuclear industry \npooling their collective resources--and this is compensation without \nhaving a lengthy judicial process to determine liability or \nculpability. So the law requires the insured and the insurers to waive \nmost standard legal defenses. Fault does not need to be established. \nThat is very important. Absent Price-Anderson, victims would have to \nrely on the court system, and damages would effectively be limited by \nthe assets of a single company.\n  It is unlikely that any one company, on its own, would ever be \ncapable of paying out $9.5 billion in damages in the case of an \naccident. So the bottom line is that without Price-Anderson there would \nbe less money available and it would take years for the dollars to work \ntheir way through the courts and then to those who need immediate \nassistance. That assumes there would be something left after the \nlawyers have taken their share. We don't know whether that would be the \ncase or not. It is likely that the taxpayer, via Congress, would \nalready have stepped in and provided whatever financial assistance was \nneeded. The events of September 11 showed how quickly Congress can act \nin a disaster situation.\n  Price-Anderson is a good deal for the taxpayers, for the industry, \nand for victims seeking damages.\n  I understand there are those who don't like nuclear energy and will \nsee the Price-Anderson debate as a means to stop nuclear power. I \nrespect the rights and integrity of those who hold this view. I don't \nthink they are right. We will have a lot of energy needs in the coming \ndecades, and nuclear power can provide them cleanly and efficiently.\n  There are enormous benefits to nuclear power. The majority of energy \ngenerated in New Hampshire is from nuclear power from the Seabrook \nnuclear powerplant--about 60 percent of it to be exact. I wonder where \nwe would be today for our energy needs had that reactor not been built, \nin spite of the controversy and hard times we had to get it built. \nSeabrook Station has proven to be a safe, reliable source of power, not \nonly for New Hampshire but for a large part of New England.\n  These are great benefits. They are tremendous benefits. It can't be \noverlooked. I have spent the better part of 2 years working to come up \nwith a bipartisan plan for reducing utility emissions without \ncompromising our long-term energy security. In fact, Senator Voinovich \nhas been a valued partner in that effort.\n  Nuclear power allows us to generate enormous amounts of energy at low \ncost and with zero emissions. I know the issue of the waste comes up \nand it is very controversial; that is an issue we are going to have to \nconfront. But when you are talking about emissions, this nuclear power \nis safe and efficient. It allows us to generate this power, as I said, \nat low cost with zero emissions, no SOX, NOX, \nmercury, and no carbon dioxide. Zero.\n  Nuclear provides 20 percent of our Nation's energy production, with \nno emissions. We need to be able to not have that diminished further as \nthese powerplants get older and older. One way to do that is with this \nmodular concept for which we provide. If we want clean air and energy \nsecurity, nuclear has to be a part of any reasonable energy plan.\n  We should be encouraging the development of new, more effective and \nsafe nuclear technologies. I am not saying this to the exclusion of \nother sources of power--renewables such as water, wind, solar, and \nothers; we are not excluding those. We want to continue to do research \nthere. I want to make it clear from this Senator's position, it is not \nonly about nuclear power, it is all sources of power that can be \nefficient, clean, and produce what we need.\n  At a minimum, we ought not to be discouraging this kind of technology \nand what this nuclear industry can do. If we don't reauthorize Price-\nAnderson, we effectively kill all the new promising technologies that \nare the next generation of emissions-free power production. We can't \nafford to do that.\n  This amendment recognizes the recommendations made by the NRC, and \nthey should be adopted. Price-Anderson enjoys strong bipartisan support \nin this body, as well as on the other side of the Capitol in the House.\n  Again, I thank Senator Voinovich and Senator Bingaman for their \nleadership. It has been a pleasure to work with them and Senator Inhofe \non nuclear issues in the committee. They deserve a great deal of \ncredit--Senators\n\n[[Page S1625]]\n\nVoinovich and Inhofe--for the work they have done. I particularly thank \nmy friends on the Energy Committee for their collective effort in \nbringing this bipartisan amendment to the floor--in particular, \nSenators Murkowski, Domenici and, again, Senator Bingaman.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \namendment to reauthorize the Price-Anderson Act. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I join my colleague from New Hampshire in \nthanking Senator Voinovich, Senator Inhofe, a good number of folks on \nour side of the aisle, and certainly a good number on the Democratic \nside of the aisle for crafting what I think is truly a bipartisan \namendment to a necessary and important mix of our energy portfolio in \nthis country.\n  As you know, the Price-Anderson Act provides a substantial amount of \nthe necessary insurance protection for the commercial sector to deal \nwith nuclear energy in our country.\n  The Price-Anderson Act removed the deterrent to private sector \nparticipation in nuclear activities when there was a substantial threat \nof liability.\n  As we know, the historic management of our nuclear facilities on the \nprivate side, the commercial side of the equation has proven to be very \nsuccessful and very safe throughout their operation.\n  The kind of protection we have offered in no way has ever deterred or \nlessened the desire or the responsibility of good management. In fact, \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission has not only ensured that by its \nconstant and vigilant oversight--and certainly the private sector in \noperating these reactors for the benefit of the country has known \nthat--but has demonstrated that very clearly. It is truly one of the \ngreat success stories of energy generation in our country that is not \noften told.\n  Why? Because when we talk nuclear, there are automatic reactions and \nsome risks are argued even though those risks have never effectively \nplayed out in an area of effective regulation, quality management of \nthe kind we have seen historically within the nuclear industry of this \ncountry.\n  Price-Anderson is an act that has been working well since its \norigination in 1957. We will need nuclear energy as we meet the growing \nenergy needs of our country. My colleague from New Hampshire was just \ntalking about clean energy and its importance. There is no cleaner \nenergy than that which is produced by a nuclear reactor and electrical \ngenerator. That has clearly demonstrated itself historically.\n  All I can say today is, thank goodness that 20 percent of our energy \nbasket in this country is nuclear. I wish it were more. If it were \nmore, I think we would have less concern today about the climate change \nissue and other issues such as greenhouse gases released into the \nenvironment. That is going to push us, as it should, toward ever-\nincreasing higher levels of technology and the application of that \ntechnology to make cleaner fuels.\n  While doing that, many of us in this body and the other body have \nrecognized the value of advancing nuclear reactor design. Over the last \nseveral years, Senator Domenici from New Mexico, chairing the \nAppropriations Energy Subcommittee, and I have worked to increase \nbudgets to allow for that kind of experimentation and development.\n  The administration in its new budget has come forth with a proposal \ncalled 2010 to invest money in the new technologies of nuclear \nreactors, to get that technology to the marketplace and to the private \nsector and to allow an ever-increasing amount of our energy portfolio \nto become nuclear generated.\n  As a result, reauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act is absolutely \ncritical because without it, and without that kind of protection, the \nreality of expanding that energy base simply would not happen.\n\n  As we know, just in the last 3 weeks the President has proposed a new \nand dramatic direction for climate change in our country with the \nbringing together of science, the application of new computer models, \nand the idea of not picking winners and losers but allowing the great \ntechnology and the human mind in this country to lead the world to a \ncleaner environment.\n  We cannot get there and have an abundance of energy that will drive \nthis wonderful economy of ours and create the jobs that it can and has \ncreated without nuclear energy as a part of it. There is no technology \ntoday that builds at those levels of commercial power production \nwithout nuclear energy being a part of it and an increasing part of \nthat overall energy basket.\n  That is why we are here today. I think that is why we have arrived at \na bipartisan approach to this issue. Some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle who a decade ago were archcritics of nuclear energy \nare quietly saying today: We recognize that new technology in this \narea, new reactor design, has to come about if we are going to lead the \nworld and have safer and more abundant forms of energy. That is why \nthis overall energy bill is critical, with all of the new approaches \nthat we bring, along with assuring current levels of hydrocarbon \nproduction and new levels of hydrocarbon production, and, at the same \ntime, clearly technology and the application of that brings us to a \ncleaner environment that can be and must be abundant in energy.\n  I do appreciate the opportunity to speak briefly on the \nreauthorization of the Price-Anderson Act. It is an important part of \nany national energy policy for our country. I am confident it can pass \nbecause it has been brought before this body in a bipartisan effort.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to express my concern about the \nprovisions of this amendment, and state my reasons for opposing it.\n  As Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which \nhas jurisdiction over the licensing and regulation by the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission of the Nation's commercial nuclear power plants, \nI have a very strong interest in the application of the provisions of \nPrice-Anderson.\n  Under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission has the obligation to assure the safety and security of our \nNation's nuclear power plants, and to oversee compensation to the \npublic in the event of a catastrophic accident. This is the most \nserious of responsibilities.\n  My State of Vermont receives much of its power from the Vermont \nYankee Nuclear Power Plant. While I am supportive of nuclear power and \nthe many benefits it brings, I am deeply and personally aware of the \npotential dangers to the public that a nuclear power plant could pose, \nshould something go wrong.\n  Since the events of September 11, of course, intense scrutiny has \nbeen given to security at nuclear plants, and chairman of the EPW \nCommittee, I am committed to ensuring that our obligations to protect \nthe public are fully met. Because this amendment fails to satisfy that \nresponsibility,I must oppose it.\n  The Price-Anderson Act establishes a system of liability, and \ncompensation to the general public for damages in the event of a \nnuclear accident, an ``extraordinary nuclear occurrence'' in the \nlanguage of the Atomic Energy Act. The current language provides that \nevery commercial reactor having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical \nkilowatts or more must obtain insurance as provided in the act.\n  Section 508 of the amendment would make an exception for modular \nreactors, which are small reactors in the 100 to 110 kilowatt range, \nthat must be clustered together in order to be economically viable. The \namendment would treat them as a group of units comprising a single \nnuclear reactor. This would prevent each module from being treated, for \npurposes of liability coverage under Price-Anderson, as an individual \nreactor. Without this protection, construction of these modular \nreactors would not in all likelihood be economically viable.\n\n[[Page S1626]]\n\n  The safety and performance of these reactors is still a matter of \nconsiderable speculation. I am not satisfied that these issues have \nbeen sufficiently reviewed within my committee or elsewhere to justify \nencouraging their continued development at this time. Particularly with \nthe events of September 11 heavy in our hearts and in our minds, I \nbelieve we must act with due caution in authorizing activities which we \nare not fully satisfied meet our obligations for protection of the \npublic health and safety.\n  Along those same lines, there are a number of issues relating to the \nadequacy of Price-Anderson that should be given greater scrutiny \nfollowing the events of September 11. We must determine whether \nliability limits established under the Act are sufficient, given the \npotential for terrorist attack as we now perceive it. In so doing, we \nmust carefully examine what are likely to be the full scale impacts to \nthe public from a terrorist attack resulting in an ``extraordinary \nnuclear occurrence.''\n  We have requested this information from the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, but have not yet received a full response. I intend to work \nwith my colleagues to develop language to address some of these \nconcerns. I do not believe the amendment adequately addresses these \nissues, and for that reason, I will oppose it.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2984 to Amendment No. 2983\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2984 to amendment No. 2983.\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In lieu of the matter to be inserted, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5____.

Madam President, the Price-Anderson Act was created nearly \n50 years ago to stimulate the fledgling nuclear power industry by \nshielding owners from the full cost of an accident. The nuclear \nindustry is now a mature electric industry and is no longer in need of \nliability protection.\n  The Price-Anderson Act has actually led to a decrease in the amount \nof private insurance available instead of increasing it. In the 1950s, \nthe private insurance industry was willing to insure an accident for \n$50 million despite limited experience with the new technology. Today, \nthe private insurance industry only provides $200 million in insurance. \nI say only, Madam President. Think about that. One accident, think what \nit would do.\n  On public radio today, there was a segment that dealt with your \nState, New York. What would happen if a dirty bomb were dropped on New \nYork? What is a dirty bomb? A dirty bomb could be TNT surrounded by the \nsame piece of equipment that is used to irradiate food. That little \npiece of equipment would cause 1 out of 100 people in New York City to \ndevelop cancer.\n  Madam President, $200 million sounds like a lot of money, but it is \nnot very much money when we talk about the damage nuclear power can \ncause.\n  Today, Price-Anderson serves to shield the nuclear power industry \nfrom the true costs of producing power, providing an unfair economic \nadvantage over other traditional and alternative electrical sources. \nFor example, wind has a tax credit--or, if we extend it, will have and \nhas had one--solar, geothermal, nothing; biomass, nothing; but yet we \ngive this sweetheart deal to nuclear power. The nuclear power industry \nmust assure compensation to the public in the event of an accident, as \nany other business. The nuclear power industry must not shirk its \nresponsibility.\n  Although an event we hope is unlikely, we are also hopeful that an \naccident never occurs. We must acknowledge the possibility of a \ncatastrophic event. We know that the Titanic was unsinkable but, of \ncourse, it sank on its first voyage.\n  To address the shortcomings I have spoken about, and more, my \namendment would modernize the Price-Anderson coverage for existing \nreactors and would require new reactors to obtain private insurance to \ncover the full amount of a nuclear accident. It would raise the maximum \nannual contribution for reactor owners from $10 million to $20 million. \nThe Nuclear Regulatory Commission recommended this increase in 1998 and \nthen backed down.\n  My amendment also would require each reactor owner to guarantee the \nfull financial commitment of each reactor using hard money resources \nsuch as surety bonds, letters of credit, private insurance, escrow \ndeposit accounts. Currently, the NRC requires only a 3-month cashflow \nstatement to demonstrate the reactor owner can pay $10 million. Based \nupon Enron accounting and Andersen accounting, this is not the way to \ndo it.\n  My amendment would establish a Presidential commission to examine the \npublic health and environmental consequences of a catastrophic \naccident. My amendment would protect the Price-Anderson payments for \nvictims if the owner of a reactor filed for bankruptcy.\n\n  Finally, my amendment would require the President to determine if an \nintentional act against a nuclear powerplant was an act of terrorism \ncovered under Price-Anderson.\n  Together, these amendments make Price-Anderson a viable system, \nperhaps, or at least a more viable system, for existing reactors and \ntake away the training wheels for the next generation of nuclear \npowerplants so they can succeed on their own merits. Taken together, \nthis amendment will let the nuclear industry stand on its own two feet. \nTaken together, these amendments will protect the environment and the \nAmerican people for generations to come.\n  This is a very serious issue with which we are dealing. A resident of \nthe Chair's State, Christy Brinkley, who is a famous woman--not only \nbecause of how she looks but how she thinks--has become really involved \nin things nuclear. She has testified at hearings in Washington.\n  Our committee, of which the Presiding Officer is a member, held a \nhearing on Price-Anderson. We do not have all the jurisdiction of \nPrice-Anderson. The Energy Committee that is handling this bill has \nsome of the jurisdiction. But if there were ever things legislative \nthat the Environment Committee should deal with, it would be nuclear \npower. Christy Brinkley is one of many who recognize the problems \ninvolved.\n  Every environmental--I should not say every environmental group; \nthere may be a few missing, but most environmental groups in Washington \nsigned a letter supporting the amendment I have offered, recognizing \nthat it is important Price-Anderson be changed. It is not fair the way \nthings now are. Why should they have the benefit of government \nhandouts, really, when other electricity generators do not? My \namendment would give financial protection for licensees. It would be a \nguarantee of preferred premium. There would be financial \nqualifications. We would have a Presidential commission on incident \nconsequences.\n  Of course, the section clarifies acts of terrorism involving nuclear \nlicensees would be covered under Price-Anderson, but this section \ndirects the President to determine whether an attack on a nuclear \npowerplant is an act of terrorism or an act of war for the purposes of \npaying claims for public liability.\n  The act and regulations under Price-Anderson are really flawed. Most \noperators meet the current provisions through a loophole. That is to \nmake sure they are financially sound to respond to what largess the \nFederal Government has given them. But even there they ``Enron'' us. \nThe acting regulations are flawed in this regard. Most operators meet \nthe current provisions through a loophole by providing only an annual \ncertified financial statement, which is essentially an auditor's \nstatement. The public deserves, especially in light of what has \nhappened since the Enron debacle, more protection than that offered by \na potentially misleading certified financial statement, particularly, \nas I have mentioned, after the Enron mess involving its financial \nauditor, Arthur Andersen.\n  The amendment I have submitted would ensure real financial safeguards \nsuch as a bond, a letter of credit, or a loan. Escrow funds, or even \ninsurance, would be the only measure of a nuclear operator's ability to \nmeet its financial obligations to the public.\n  Under the present legislation, I repeat, all that is needed is an \nannual certified financial statement showing there is a cashflow or \nsomething can be generated, not then but within 3 months. All operators \nwho propose to build new plants to produce electricity from nuclear \npower, particularly in the context of deregulated wholesale electricity \nmarkets, should be expected to incorporate the cost of obtaining \ninsurance, the economics of generating electricity, but not under \nPrice-Anderson. Many of these companies are owned by limited liability \ncorporations, thinly capitalized, highly leveraged, legally structured \nto avoid exposing their parent corporate entity to liability in the \nevent of insolvency and, of course, in the event of accident.\n  This amendment establishes minimal financial qualifications to ensure \noperators can meet their monetary obligations to the public in the \nevent of an accident or terrorist attack. This amendment is supported \nby the U.S. PIRG, the Environmental Defense Fund, Union of Concerned \nScientists, Defenders of Wildlife, Sierra Club, Friends of the Earth, \nNuclear Information Resources, League of Conservation Voters, Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense, National Environmental Trust, National Resources \nDefense Council, Public Citizens Critical Mass, STAR, Safe Energy \nCommunications Council, and Greenpeace.\n\n[[Page S1628]]\n\n  A 1992 analysis of energy subsidies by the U.S. Department of Energy \nindicates a Federal regulation that continues to have a cost-reducing \neffect on the nuclear power industry is simply unfair. These liability \nlimits provide a subsidy to the nuclear industry to the degree private \ninsurance premiums paid by operators of individual plants are reduced.\n  In 1983--almost 20 years ago--the NRC concluded the liability limits \nwere sufficiently significant to constitute a subsidy, and it has \nreally been magnified during the last 19 years. However, a \nquantification of the amount of subsidy was not attempted at that time.\n  One of the questions raised is: Are acts of terrorism covered by \nPrice-Anderson? The Nuclear Regulatory Commission indicated, in \nresponse to questions from the same hearing I have talked about \nearlier, on January 23, courts would likely have to settle the \nquestion. We had leading scholars present from the legal academic \nworld, and they said it would lead to significant delay or even \ntermination of victim compensation.\n  Are victims guaranteed to receive payments from reactors that file \nchapter XI bankruptcy? In the same hearing we had in January, the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission stated that the NRC could potentially \nface a conflict with other claims in a bankruptcy proceeding if there \nwere an accident sufficient to trigger these industry payments. The NRC \nwould presumably require a licensee to pay the assessment, but the \nbankruptcy court could order the licensee to pay it. The NRC also \nindicated it would support legislation to address this concern.\n  In the Economist magazine, they have a very in-depth article about \nnuclear power generally. Among other things in this long article of May \n19 of last year, they talk about when costing nuclear power, it is \nessential to remember the scope, scale, and subtlety of the subsidy it \nreceives. Liability insurance is a good example of this subsidy. The \nAmerican industry's official position is there is no subsidy involved \nin Price-Anderson. To do that, you would have to be without any common \nsense, let alone academic prowess.\n\n  Since there is no subsidy involved, why not let the act lapse when it \ncomes up for renewal next year? What we were told by our Vice President \nis that it needs to be renewed; if not, nobody will invest in nuclear \npowerplants.\n  That answers the question.\n  In the end, the article continues, nuclear energy's future may be \nskewed by the same sword that is making it fashionable today, the \nderegulation of electricity markets.\n  Why is that? Because, Madam President, right now nuclear power is the \nmost expensive, even with the subsidies. Yet the article continues: \nLiberalization is also exposing the true economics of new plants and is \naiming a fierce spotlight at the hefty subsidies that nuclear power has \nlong enjoyed. As these fade, the industry once again will be brought \ndown to earth.\n  Now, this is not me speaking. This is from the Economist magazine. \nThey say these are significant subsidies and once they are attached, \nnuclear power will no longer be in vogue.\n  The New York Times published an article entitled ``Hard Questions On \nNuclear Power,'' written last year. Among other things, they say the \nCongress will need to take a close look at whether it should renew one \nof the industry's economic underpinnings, the so-called Price-Anderson \nAct, that limits companies' liability in the event of an accident. If \nthe industry is safe, they may not need such subsidized protection.\n  A lot of this has come to light following September 11, and whether \nwe have to be more concerned about acts of terrorism. I know the \nPresiding Officer, this Senator, and the junior Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Lieberman, have looked closely at the safety of \nnuclear powerplants. He is right. They have different standards at \ndifferent plants, different companies, different private contractors. \nIf someone going through a baggage checkpoint is examined by someone \nwho works for the Federal Government, should we not have a system \nwhereby nuclear powerplants have Federal employees? The answer is yes. \nThey should not have rent-a-cops determining the safety of those \nfacilities.\n  Today, thinly capitalized, limited liability corporations operate \nnearly half of the Nation's nuclear reactors. Taxpayers, I suggest, by \ndefault, shoulder secondary insurance costs whenever it is determined \ninsurance claims would constitute undue hardship.\n  It is reported the NRC did not require the company purchasing the \nsingle largest fleet of 16 reactors to provide adequate evidence of \nfinancial stability as a condition of granting a license. Some \nadvocates of Price-Anderson argue that because the Government indemnity \nhas never been used, we don't need to worry about it. Price-Anderson is \nnot a subsidy, they say. However, every legal scholar has said it is. \nPrice-Anderson allows utilities to commit less capital to insuring \nnuclear plants so that the act results in a reallocation of resources \naway from more highly valued uses, so it is indeed a subsidy. Think of \nits advantage over solar, geothermal, biomass, clean coal, and \ncertainly natural gas.\n  Despite continuing claims concerning the safety of nuclear power, the \namount of private liability insurance available has actually declined \nin real terms since 1957. The reason is they figured ways to get around \nthat. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission report states it is unlikely \nthat the amount of available liability insurance would increase much \nbeyond the $200 million level without strong pressure from outside \nthe insurance industry. The obvious question is, What could be expected \nwith repeal of Price-Anderson? One could argue, as Richard Howell does, \nthat the more likely result is that sufficient insurance will be \nprovided to maintain the viability of the industry.\n\n  These companies make a lot of money. As every other business, they \nwill buy insurance to cover their liability. Why should the Federal \nGovernment have to provide that? Utilities needing more liability \ninsurance would have an incentive to accept stricter safety standards \nfrom insurance companies. An increase in the role of the insurance \nindustry would be a welcome development by regulators and an economic \nincentive for safe operating methods and not relying on the Federal \nGovernment to give them a subsidy.\n  If Price-Anderson were allowed to expire, the determination for what \nsort of tort liability, strict liability, or negligence to which the \nplants are subject reverts to States. We have been debating in the \nSenate for the many years I have been here whether or not we will have \na national standard for product liability. The answer is no. We let the \nStates determine that. That is the way it should be.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 2984, Withdrawn\n\n  I will withdraw my amendment. I hope people will vote against this \namendment. I know there will be people wanting to vote for this simply \nbecause the two managers of the legislation support this legislation. I \nhave the greatest respect for my friend from New Mexico. He has been \nsomebody I have looked up to the entire time I have been in the Senate. \nI will continue to look up to him even though he is wrong on this \nissue. He is simply wrong. Price-Anderson needs to be changed.\n  I hope Senators vote against this mischievous and unworthy amendment. \nIt is not good for the country. It is not good for the country for so \nmany reasons, not the least of which is the liability aspect of it, not \nthe least of which the Federal Government should get out of subsidizing \nnuclear power. But also, if we got rid of this amendment, people living \nnear nuclear powerplants would know there is sufficient insurance to \ntake care of their family if something went wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Without objection, the amendment \nis withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 2984) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Voinovich amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There does not appear to be a sufficient second.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I will mention that I have the highest \nregard for Senator Reid. Much of what he just discussed came up in the \ncommittee hearing we had. Perhaps the Presiding Officer was at the \nmeeting.\n\n[[Page S1629]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Could I ask my friend to yield for a brief second?\n  I will ask for the yeas and nays on the Senator's amendment. It is my \nunderstanding everyone wants to vote on it. We did not get a second \nfrom the Republicans.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the Voinovich amendment No. 2983.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I apologize to the majority whip and the manager of \nthe bill. I apologize. I have not been active in the discussion this \nmorning. But as I understand it, the Senator from Nevada offered a \nsecond degree which he intends to withdraw--or is it withdrawn? It is \nwithdrawn, so we are on Price-Anderson. I certainly support the call \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  It is my understanding the majority side will introduce the next \namendment. At this time I wonder if they will indicate what that \namendment might be.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response to my friend from Alaska, \nonce the debate is concluded on the Price-Anderson amendment Senator \nVoinovich has offered, it is our intent to set that aside and go to an \namendment on hydraulic fracturing, which I would offer. I think Senator \nInhofe and various other Senators are cosponsoring that.\n  Then I believe it is the whip's intent to have us stack a couple of \nvotes on those two issues right after lunch.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield for a minute, we are now showing \nto the minority the proposal. We have two votes at 2 o'clock, with the \ntime between now and 2 o'clock to be divided to speak on both \namendments, Price-Anderson and also the hydraulic fracturing. We would \nhave a vote on both those. We are not in a position to offer that as a \nunanimous consent agreement because we have to clear it with the two \nleaders, but that is the intention.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, what I am concerned about is the whip \nindicated 2 o'clock. Will we break for lunch or is it the intention to \ngo right through?\n  I just have been alerted there are a couple of our Members who are \ngoing to want to speak on the fracturing amendment. Unless there is any \nextended debate, I am certainly willing to agree to a vote at 2 \no'clock. Obviously, we are about through with Price-Anderson.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Alaska will yield, I think we are just \nabout finished on Price-Anderson. The Senator from Ohio wants to speak, \nand maybe the Senator from New Mexico, briefly, on it. But I think we \nwill have quite a bit of time on fracturing.\n  I will propound that at a subsequent time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I assure the whip we want to work with him. We have a \ncouple of more Members, I am advised, who want to speak very briefly on \nPrice-Anderson. We are going to urge them to come here now and speak, \nand then we will have no objection to moving to the fracturing.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, it doesn't matter if they come \nnow or later. The agreement will be that during this next period of \ntime they can speak on either amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Either amendment; that is certainly fair enough.\n  I am going to make a short statement on Price-Anderson. Since the \nsecond degree has been withdrawn, I will not belabor that other than to \nsay I am very pleased the Senator from Nevada saw fit to withdraw it \nbecause had his amendment prevailed, clearly it would have basically \namounted to the demise of the nuclear industry from the standpoint of \nany future facilities being built, because that is the whole \njustification of Price-Anderson. I will put that behind me and simply \nsupport speaking of the Price-Anderson reauthorization amendment.\n  I think Congress has been derelict in not resolving this issue some \ntime ago. It is an important issue, to encourage further development of \nour nuclear industry.\n\n  For those who are critical of the nuclear industry, I remind you it \nhas an extraordinary safety record, considering the hyperpublicity \ngiven to almost any irregularity associated with the operation of the \nplants.\n  The point is, to a large degree the system has worked. Any mechanical \nfunction has a certain degree of exposure. So you back it up with \nchecks and balances. When you talk about Three Mile Island and the \nmistakes that were made, the reality is the system worked. If you talk \nabout what happened in Chernobyl, you recognize human activity overrode \nthe systems, which is just what happened when the Exxon Valdez went on \nthe rocks. It was human activity--inattentive, in spite of the bells \nand whistles--that simply allowed this ship in a 10.5-mile-wide channel \nto hit a rock.\n  My point is I think the nuclear industry in this country deserves a \nfair assessment of its extraordinary record. As a consequence, I think \nwe must recognize the significant contribution nuclear energy makes.\n  It is emission free. As we look at concern over global warming/\nemission reductions, the one area that generates tremendous potential, \neven further than the 20 percent of the electric power generation that \ncomes from nuclear energy, is the nuclear industry.\n  The critics who would like to see this industry simply go away and \nnot expand have to come up with an alternative, other than \nconservation, because conservation is simply not enough. Conservation \nwill not pick up for the 20 percent of our energy mix that comes from \nnuclear energy. So we must continue to recognize the nuclear industry \nis going to play a greater role in the future if we want to meet our \nenergy needs and protect our air quality.\n  It is interesting to look on occasion at what the Joneses do. In \nFrance, obviously, nuclear power has been accepted. It is the area of \ntechnology that has the highest recognition in the higher educational \nsystem of France. The Japanese are moving towards greater dependence on \nnuclear energy because of the significant advantages associated with \nthat.\n  One of the problems, of course, is the nuclear waste issue. We will \nbe getting into that at a later time. But I think it represents the \nfrustration here in the United States with our nuclear industry, not \nbeing able to come to grips with what we do with the waste that is \ngenerated by the reactors that, of course, are subject to yearly \nexamination when their fuel rods are removed. The question is, What is \ndone with that high-level waste and how is it stored? It is not \ndesigned to be permanently stored necessarily in casks. We even \nembarked on an effort to try to find a repository. The solution appears \nto have been a selection in Nevada, at Yucca Mountain.\n  I think it should be recognized we have expended some $7 billion of \ntaxpayers' money on this repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. I \nthink we should also recognize the ratepayers have paid, for this \nnuclear power, into a special fund, which was supposed to fund the \nconstruction of a site, that expended approximately $11 billion. So the \nFederal Government entered into a contractual relationship to take that \nwaste in 1998.\n  Mr. President, 1998 has come and gone and the Federal Government has \nnot lived up to the terms of its contractual agreements. It is in \nviolation of its contract. As a consequence, litigation associated with \nsuits filed against the Federal Government are somewhere in the area of \n$40 billion. As we simply put off the decisionmaking process, what to \ndo with this waste, clearly the liability to the taxpayer continues. So \nwe simply have to come to grips with this issue.\n  I am pleased to say this administration is facing it head on with a \nseries of steps and procedures that will eventually get us to a final \ndecision on how and on what terms this waste is stored, so we can get \non with a clear bridge, if you will, to what we are going to do with \nthe waste. That will, to a large degree, address the expansion of \nnuclear energy in this country because we are not going to expand \nnuclear production, nuclear energy, until we resolve what to do with \nthat waste.\n  It is important we get this issue behind us. But an important part of \nthis, indeed, is Price-Anderson because that supplies, if you will, the \nnecessary underwriting by the Federal Government of catastrophic \nexposure.\n  Solid nuclear baseload power provides our grids with stability and \nreliability. In California alone, nuclear\n\n[[Page S1630]]\n\nsupplies about 16 percent of the energy. Without it, last summer the \nCalifornia energy situation would have faced a collapse. High natural \ngas prices and low uranium prices help to make electricity produced by \nnuclear some of the cheapest in the country. Perhaps someday we might \nreach the fabled ``too cheap to meter'' goal. I am not sure that is \ngoing to happen, but nevertheless it is a reasonable objective.\n  We have had, as I have indicated, safe and efficient operation of \nU.S. plants. They are operating at record efficiencies as they have \nrecognized the procedural efficiencies.\n  The point is that they are very efficient, and as a consequence they \nhave become very attractive investments. We have seen more \nconcentration by utility companies picking up some of the newer and \nmore efficient plants.\n  In 1999, U.S. nuclear reactors achieved close to 90 percent \nefficiency. The total efficiency increase during the nineties at the \nexisting plants was the equivalent to approximately 23 1,000-megawatt \npowerplants. I think that is pretty significant. During the 1990s, a \n10-year period of existing plants, the equivalent efficiency was 23 \n1,000-megawatt powerplants. I think that more or less speaks for itself \nrelative to the advantages and attractiveness of nuclear power. Keep in \nmind that this is clean, it is nonemitting generation.\n  With that efficiency, the industry is on an upswing. Four or five \nyears ago, you wouldn't have thought you would hear talk about buying \nand selling plants, or even building new plants. Today the discussion \nis occurring.\n  By the end of the 2002, the Chicago-based Exxon corporation will have \ninvested a total of $25 million in a South African venture to build a \npebble bed modular reactor.\n  I see my friend from New Mexico, the senior Senator, in the Chamber. \nHe is very familiar with this particular technology, which I think \nprovides greater attractiveness for the nuclear industry.\n  If we ever hope to achieve energy security and energy independence in \nthis country, we cannot abandon the nuclear option which is an \nimportant and integral part of our energy mix. Our economy depends on \nnuclear energy. Our national security depends on nuclear energy. Our \nenvironment depends on nuclear energy. And our future, to a large \ndegree, depends on nuclear energy.\n  Critical to the future continuation of this industry is Price-\nAnderson. I have been a strong advocate of reauthorization of Price-\nAnderson. Senator Bingaman and I have worked together with our staff to \nagree on language in the last Congress to renew the Price-Anderson Act. \nBoth of our comprehensive energy bills introduced in the first session \nof this Congress contain the same language based on recommendations \nfrom the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \nRenewal of the act was supported by the last administration. Renewal of \nthe act was also one of President Bush's 105 recommendations in the \nnational energy policy. For over 40 years, the act has ensured ample \ninsurance for the industry, and it will provide a mechanism for the \nprompt payment to victims in the unlikely event of a nuclear exposure \nof some kind. Renewal of this act is necessary if we are to continue \nnuclear energy, new plants, and ensure the relicensing of our existing \nplants.\n  I don't understand really why the majority leader excluded the NRC \nlicensees from the substitute. But this amendment is going to rectify \nthat oversight.\n  I am very pleased to see the level of support on the floor of the \nSenate. I thank the Senator from Ohio, Mr. Voinovich, for his \nleadership in this area, and Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman, \nchairman of the Energy Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that early in the \ndiscussion of the energy bill an amendment on Price-Anderson extension \nis before the Senate. I am also very pleased that it has so many \ncosponsors and that it is very bipartisan, in particular on the issue \nof nuclear power and its role in America and the world's future. If we \nare looking for the energy of the future and if we are looking to have \nclean air, obviously nuclear power has to be looked at.\n  I am grateful that today Senator Bingaman, the manager of the bill \nand chairman of the committee, is a cosponsor of the Voinovich \namendment. It also has a number of other Senators as cosponsors, all of \nwhom from time to time have expressed great interest in nuclear energy.\n  I also would like to commend the manager of the bill, even though we \ndidn't mark up all the way through the committee. Senator Bingaman's \nstaff, the majority staff, are fully aware of the nuclear power issues \nthat confront our country.\n  If there are Senators who wonder why there are not a series of \namendments on nuclear power and its future that are going to be \noffered--there will be two or three--it is because this bill contains \ngeneral type language that will permit nuclear power to be a player in \nthe future. If, in fact, there are utility companies here and elsewhere \nin the world privately and publicly owned that want to produce nuclear \npower because of its efficiency and, equally important, because clean \nelectricity is produced, and if we are worried about underdeveloped \ncountries developing and using a lot of energy, and because America \nneeds more energy over the next 20 or 30 years, it is good that we have \nnot locked out the option of nuclear energy.\n  There are some things that could be said about nuclear power in terms \nof the shortage we have found ourselves in. Just the past year, we \nfound that of all the power sources in the country, the cheapest after \nhydropower is, and has been for some time, nuclear power. Per unit of \nelectricity, the cheapest power generation of any major size in America \nhas been nuclear power.\n  Nuclear powerplants have gone without incident or accident for years. \nAs a matter of fact, they have increased productive capacity in the \nneighborhood of from 70 to 75 percent of capacity to the low 90s for \nthis entire period of time when we needed more energy because we were \nin the position as a nation of being sort of ambivalent about our \nenergy supply. We weren't quite sure where we were going.\n  There are also some exciting occurrences in terms of the next \ngeneration of nuclear powerplants. Perhaps before we finish we will \nhave time to discuss events that are occurring around the world. Even \nAmerican companies are thinking about nuclear plants in terms of future \nsupply of electricity.\n  The future is very bright. New technology will make nuclear power \nsafer, if that can be. It will make it cheaper. It will permit us to \nlocate nuclear powerplants more easily. They won't have to be the \nlarge-megawatt plants. They can be small and rather mobile plants built \nmuch more easily than in the past, and with far less permit time with \nthe kind of work we have to do in that regard.\n  Already the United States is ahead of the crisis. We have begun to \nbuild back into our Department of Energy some significant nuclear \nactivities. We have had an Energy Department during the last 25 years \nwhen the Department was acting as if it were embarrassed about nuclear \npower and didn't even want it to be part of the Department of Energy. \nIt is back, and we are now spending some money every year to help \ngenerate enthusiasm among engineers and those who would join the corps \nof experts in physics and chemistry and the like who will work on \nnuclear powerplants in the future.\n  In producing this bill, Senator Bingaman took many of the things we \nhad appropriated and made them permanent law with reference to the \nfuture of nuclear power.\n  I will insert in the Record at a later time, rather than itemize them \nnow, the numerous areas where the bill already takes into consideration \nthe need for us to put nuclear power on a neutral footing with other \nkinds of power and to see if we can't come out winners both as to \nenergy and as to the environment.\n  So I want to state my very strong support for the renewal of Price-\nAnderson, which is going to expire later this year--I think in August. \nIt has been extended by Congress three times since becoming law in \n1957. Price-Anderson provides a framework for payment of public \nliability claims for any accident at a commercial nuclear powerplant. \nThis law is vital to ensure that our taxpayers continue to receive the \nbenefits\n\n[[Page S1631]]\n\nof nuclear energy and allows the industry to consider the construction \nof new plants.\n  The Price-Anderson amendment, as it is structured--the one that is \npending--takes care of and provides coverage for future plants. Some \nhave wanted to cover the past but not the future. I am very pleased, \nand am certain that those who think there is a new day for the \nproduction of energy in the United States ahead, and that it might \ninvolve nuclear power, are also strongly supportive and delighted that \nthis amendment is the broad amendment that also covers the future, not \njust the past.\n  Many bills pending before the Senate incorporate renewal of Price-\nAnderson. As I indicated, I have introduced a bill, S. 472, which \ncontained renewal provisions. I was very pleased that 18 cosponsors \njoined me in that bill. Earlier bills from Senator Bingaman and Senator \nMurkowski had also incorporated renewal.\n  This renewal amendment should enjoy strong bipartisan support in the \nSenate. I am very pleased that it will receive strong support because \nthat in and of itself sends a signal that was not around 10 or 15 years \nago when we thought we had an abundance of energy and the supply was \nnot a problem. There was a small cadre of those who did not like nor \nwant us involved in nuclear power. They prevailed. It would appear that \nwe are moving in the direction of a neutral approach and that nuclear \npower will have to prove itself alongside all the other energy sources \nas being efficient and safe and the kind of power that we would truly \nlike to have in our country, and it would be good for the world.\n  In addition to coverage of commercial nuclear plants, Price-Anderson \nenables companies to accept the challenges that are involved in the \ncleanup of past nuclear weapons activities without charging the \nGovernment for insurance for coverage of very large possible, although \nhighly unlikely, claims. It assures the availability of funds to \nprovide prompt compensation to any member of the public who is harmed \nby nuclear activities. Without renewal, no new nuclear powerplants \nwould be covered and progress on the cleanup of weapons activities \ncould indeed be seriously jeopardized.\n  That will not be the case once we have reported out a bill. \nHopefully, before this year ends, the Senate and the House will find a \nway to do that.\n  Since taxpayer funds are not used to pay claims resulting from a \nnuclear incident, there is no ``subsidy'' to industry, as some claim. \nOver the last 43 years of Price-Anderson protection, the insurance \npools, never the Federal Government, have paid claims totaling $180 \nmillion. Price-Anderson, with its risk-pooling among all nuclear \ncompanies, provides a far greater measure of certainty to the public \nfor any liabilities that any one company could provide.\n  Again, I appreciate Senator Bingaman's work on the basic bill, the \nunderlying bill, as it pertains to nuclear power and various activities \nthat will bring it into the future and line itself up along with other \nmajor energy sources not only for America but for the world.\n  One area involves the appropriate treatment for \nnonprofit contractors. We have agreed that these contractors should \nhave some degree of liability, but we have carefully limited their \nliability to the fee they are receiving at the time of any penalty. \nWithout such a limitation, nonprofits could undertake a contracting \nrole with the Department, but they would have to charge excessive fees \nto the Government and, obviously, would not be awarded any kind of \nwork.\n\n  There is a second provision for the treatment of modular reactors. \nWhen Price-Anderson was first drafted, it was assumed that all \ncommercial reactors would be very large, maybe 1,000 megawatts or even \nmore. But lately, there is growing interest in very small powerplants \nthat might utilize modular construction and deliver much less power, \nperhaps only 100 megawatts per module.\n  These small plants have some very interesting features, of which the \nmost important is the ability to make them absolutely safe against \nmeltdown incidents. Yes, that is a reality. That is what those who are \ninventing and putting together these new modular constructed \npowerplants, with new technology, will be able to do. They will not, by \ntheir own physics, be able to have a meltdown.\n  I appreciate that this version of an extended Price-Anderson law \nprovides equitable treatment for modular reactors to ensure that the \nact becomes viable in the future and is not a disincentive to \nconsidering new technology of the kind that is exciting many people.\n  The renewal of Price-Anderson is one of the key actions needed to \nensure that nuclear energy continues to provide clean, safe power for \nour Nation.\n  Again, I am grateful for the leadership shown by the chairman of the \ncommittee. I am hoping that before this year is out, we will come out \nof conference with a Price-Anderson that is intact and that contains \nthe language that is before the Senate today. We will have done \nsomething worthwhile.\n  For those who wonder if anything is happening on this energy bill \nthat is good and healthy and salutary and futuristic, I hope they will \njoin us in saying that we did one thing, and it became less and less \ncontroversial, that is to extend the underpinnings, in terms of \nliability coverage, the underpinnings of nuclear power for today and \nnuclear power for the future.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Chair for recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLincoln be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think it is significant, Mr. President, that the two \nSenators from New Mexico--one a Republican and one a Democrat--are both \ncosponsors of this amendment. I do not believe there is anyone in this \ncountry who speaks out more eloquently on behalf of nuclear power than \nSenator Domenici. This has been a cause of his for many years. I think \nit is important that he underscored the fact that not only does this \ndeal with the nuclear power industry, but it also deals specifically \nwith the cleanup of over 100 DOE facilities; that without this \nlegislation the contractors would not be willing to go forward with the \nwork they are now doing at those facilities. And it also provides a \nsituation so that in the event that new reactors come on board--that \nis, more nuclear power facilities are built--that it would include \nthose new facilities.\n  Before I conclude on this amendment, I would like to point out and \nclarify the fact that the $10 million this bill continues to be asked \nfor is adequate to get the job done.\n  With the Presiding Officer's permission, I would like to read from \nthe testimony of William F. Kane, who is the Deputy Executive Director \nfor Reactor Programs because I think, in a nutshell, he can clarify to \nour colleagues just exactly what this is about.\n  In his testimony on January 23rd, he said:\n\n       Further developments in the electric generating industry \n     since the 1998 report to Congress have led the Commission to \n     review its 1998 recommendations and to reevaluate its \n     recommendation that Congress consider increasing the annual \n     installment to $20 million. There is now a heightened \n     interest in extending the operating life for most, if not \n     all, of the currently operating power reactors, and some \n     power companies are now examining whether they wish to submit \n     applications for new reactors or complete construction of \n     reactors that have been deferred. As a result, contrary to \n     our former recommendations, the commission does not \n     believe there is now justification for raising the maximum \n     annual retrospective premium of $10 million. The level is \n     adequate and does not need to be changed.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       In summing up, I would like to leave these thoughts with \n     you: To date, the United States Government has not paid a \n     penny for claims against nuclear power licensees. In the \n     event a serious accident were to occur, over $9 billion would \n     be available to pay compensation for any personal injury or \n     off-site property damage. The money will come from insurance \n     policies bought by the industry and from retrospective \n     premiums that will be paid by the industry. If these funds \n     are inadequate, Congress will be called upon to decide what \n     action is needed to provide assistance to those harmed. We \n     believe the public is protected by the broad base of prompt \n     funding. The Price-Anderson Act further aids the public by \n     establishing important procedural reforms for claims arising \n     from nuclear accidents. It channels liabilities to the \n     licensee, establishes a single Federal form for all claims, \n     eliminates the need\n\n[[Page S1632]]\n\n     to prove fault, requires waivers of other significant \n     defenses, makes prompt settlements possible, and if \n     litigation is needed, establishes the legal management \n     process to assure fairness and equity and distribution of \n     damages.\n\n  That lays it out in a nutshell in terms of why it is that we need to \nreauthorize Price-Anderson.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from New Mexico will be \nintroducing another amendment. For the Members of the Senate, those who \nstill would like to speak on Price-Anderson will be able to continue to \ndo that, as well as those who will be supporting Senator Bingaman's \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, just a couple of other words about the \nPrice-Anderson amendment: First, I thank my colleague from New Mexico \nfor his kind words about provisions that are included in this bill. He \nhas authored many of those provisions, particularly the ones related to \nnuclear power, and he has been a tireless advocate for peaceful use of \nnuclear power in this country for many years. We are all well aware of \nthat.\n  We have included in the bill those provisions he suggested which \nclearly do contemplate and envision continued contributions by the \nnuclear power industry to our energy needs. That is certainly my \npurpose and, I know, the purpose of Senator Voinovich as well. We were \ntalking in one of the asides about the fact that the Price-Anderson Act \nwas originally proposed by Representative Price from Illinois, Mel \nPrice, and also by Senator Clinton Anderson from New Mexico. It has \nserved the country well for 45 years, as we have indicated before. We \nthink it is important that it continue to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set \naside, and it be in order for me to send another amendment to the desk \nfor consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I would like to ask the \nSenator from New Mexico, could I have maybe 2 minutes to say something \nabout Price-Anderson? I am anxious to get to the next amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I withdraw my request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, we have been talking about a complete \nenergy policy for America. This is a bipartisan effort. I tried to get \nthe Reagan administration to do it, then the Bush administration, the \nClinton administration. None of them had done it. Now we have an \nopportunity to do it. An essential part of that is going to be nuclear \nenergy. Maybe it has been said before, but I only want to put into the \nRecord that after going through this long arduous thing on ambient air \nand the problems of other forms of energy, each year the U.S. nuclear \npowerplants prevent 5.1 million tons of sulphur dioxide, 2.4 million \ntons of nitrogen oxide, and 164 million metric tons of carbon from \nentering the earth's surface.\n  Consequently, there are many people who were out protesting against \nnuclear energy just 20 years ago who now realize this is an abundant \nand safe and cheap form of energy.\n  It is necessary in order to do that to have the Price-Anderson Act \nreauthorized.\n  I yield the floor\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2986 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bond, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Conrad, \n     Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. \n     Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered 2986 to amendment No. \n     2917.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To study whether there is a need to regulate hydraulic \n                              fracturing))\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 610.

Mr. President, this is a bipartisan amendment offered \nby myself, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, and by various other of our \ncolleagues--Senators Baucus, Bond, Breaux, Campbell, Conrad, Dorgan, \nLandrieu, Lincoln, and Thomas. I thank my colleagues.\n  The proposed amendment concerns hydraulic fracturing. That is a \nvaluable tool in reducing our dependence on foreign energy supplies. It \nis one that the oil and gas industry uses on a very regular basis. It \nis necessary if we are to develop the majority of our onshore natural \ngas wells. Hydraulically fractured wells produce about 10 trillion \ncubic feet of natural gas annually. Through injecting fluids under high \npressure, hydraulic fracturing creates pathways for gas to flow to the \nwell.\n  The amendment I have sent to the desk and have offered sets up a \nstudy process to determine whether high fracturing should be regulated \nby the Federal Government under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Let me \ngive the context for this proposed amendment.\n  States already have the authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing. \nThey do that through measures such as requiring casing or lining of oil \nand gas wells where those wells cross through aquifers. The State \nregulatory programs have been effective to date. And although there \nhave been over a million hydraulic fracturing jobs conducted in the \nlast 5 years, there have been zero confirmed instances of hydraulic \nfracturing contaminating drinking water. There is not one time that \ncontamination has been established.\n  Where no one has been able to confirm any harm from hydraulic \nfracturing, it is sensible to study whether there is a real problem \nbefore we rush forward to impose additional Federal regulation. That is \nprecisely what the amendment I have sent to the desk would do.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency must first study whether \nhydraulic fracturing has any effects on underground sources of drinking \nwater. After that, the National Academy of Sciences, as an independent \nscientific body, would review EPA's study. Then based upon all the \nevidence, EPA must determine whether in addition to State regulation, \nFederal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking \nWater Act is necessary to protect underground sources of drinking \nwater.\n  While the study is being prepared, States would fully retain their \nown existing programs and EPA would fully retain its emergency powers \nto prevent any contamination of drinking water that would immediately \nthreaten public health.\n  The proposed amendment's reliance on existing State programs while a \nstudy is prepared has received extensive bipartisan support. It has \nreceived that support both in the Senate but also in the executive \nbranch. During both the previous administration, the Clinton \nadministration, and the current administration, the EPA has maintained \nthat Federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing is not required.\n  In fact, the previous administration's EPA argued in Federal court--I \nquote from one of their briefs:\n\n       Alabama is appropriately regulating production of methane \n     via hydraulic fracturing. There is no need for EPA to \n     supplant these efforts.\n\n  The previous administration's EPA also cited the absence of any \nevidence that hydraulic fracturing has harmed drinking water and \nAlabama's close regulation of hydraulic fracturing in denying a 1994 \npetition to impose Federal regulations on Alabama.\n  Mr. President, let me at this point submit for the record a letter \nfrom Carol Browner, then the head of the EPA, sent to David Ludder, \ngeneral counsel for the Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation. This \nis a 1995 letter in which she says:\n\n       EPA does not regulate--and does not believe it is legally \n     required to regulate--the hydraulic fracturing of methane gas \n     production wells under its UIC program.\n\n  Continuing the quotation:\n\n       There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue \n     has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of \n     underground sources of drinking water.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that letter be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, a cautionary word. We will need to use \nhydraulic fracturing of gas wells over the next decade. An unneeded \nregulation of hydraulic fracturing could make some of these wells \nuneconomical to produce and could defeat our important efforts to \nincrease our energy independence--particularly as it relates to natural \ngas.\n  My proposed amendment would sensibly allow hydraulic fracturing to \nassist efforts to increase our energy independence, while studying \nwhether there is any known environmental harm that would require \nFederal regulation. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to vote for \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                          EPA,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 5, 1995.\n     David A. Ludder, Esq.,\n     General Counsel, Legal Environmental Assistance Foundation, \n         Inc., Tallahassee, FL.\n       Dear Mr. Ludder: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     has received and carefully reviewed your May 3, 1994, \n     Petition for Promulgation of a Rule Withdrawing Approval of \n     Alabama's Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program. Based \n     on that review, I have determined that Alabama's \n     implementation of its UIC Program is consistent with the \n     requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 300h, et seq.) and EPA's UIC regulations (40 C.F.R. Part \n     145). EPA does not regulate--and does not believe it is \n     legally required to regulate--the hydraulic fracturing of \n     methane gas production wells under its UIC Program.\n       There is no evidence that the hydraulic fracturing at issue \n     has resulted in any contamination or endangerment of \n     underground sources of drinking water (USDW). Repeated \n     testing, conducted between May of 1989 and March of 1993, of \n     the drinking water well which was the subject of this \n     petition failed to show any chemicals that would indicate the \n     presence of fracturing fluids. The well was also sampled for \n     drinking water quality and no constituents exceeding drinking \n     water standards were detected. Moreover, given the horizontal \n     and vertical distance between the drinking water well and the \n     closest methane gas production wells, the possibility of \n     contamination or endangerment of USDWs in the area is \n     extremely remote. Hydraulic fracturing is closely regulated \n     by the Alabama State Oil and Gas Board, which requires that \n     operators obtain authorization prior to all fracturing \n     activities.\n       Accordingly, I have decided to deny your petition. Enclosed \n     you will find a detailed response to each contention in your \n     petition, which further explains the basis for this denial.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carol M. Browner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I ask that Senator Tim \nHutchinson and Senator Voinovich be added as cosponsors of this \namendment and the Price-Anderson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1634]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague from \nNew Mexico. I am happy to join him in proposing this amendment. I think \nit is very important for a number of reasons. I just came from the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, where we had all four of the chiefs of \nthe services. We were talking about this war that we are prosecuting \nright now. We were talking about the Nation's security.\n  I can remember all the way back in the 1980s, when then-Secretary of \nthe Interior Don Hodel and I went around the country and talked about \nthe fact that an energy policy is something that is important to our \nNation's security. It is a national security issue, not an energy \nissue. Consequently--and I said this a minute ago--this has not been a \npartisan thing. We tried to get President Reagan to come up with an \nenergy policy. He would not do it. I thought George ``the first,'' \ncoming from the oil fields, would have one, but he didn't do it either. \nThe last administration didn't do it.\n  A national energy policy is really necessary for national security \nreasons. Right now, we are dependent upon foreign countries for 57 \npercent of our energy supply--something that is not acceptable, \nparticularly right now in a time of war.\n  Where does this issue of hydraulic fracturing come in? I am from \nOklahoma, and I understand we have a tremendous reserve down there in \nterms of marginal production. I started many years ago--probably before \nmany fellow Members were born--in the oil fields in cable tool rigs--\nsomething they used before rotaries--the pounding method. I realized at \nthat time how much this meant to the country and how much our shallow \nproduction meant.\n  When we talk about energy policy, we talk about nuclear, as we did in \nthe last amendment, and we talk about ANWR--and it is necessary to get \ninto some of the deep stuff.\n  In terms of marginal production--wells that have 15 barrels a day, or \nless, and a comparable amount for gas wells--this has a tremendous \nprospect to be an important ingredient in a national energy policy. If \nwe had all of the gas wells that have been plugged in the last 10 \nyears, or oil wells that have been plugged, producing today--marginal \nwells, producing 15 barrels or less--it would equal more than what we \nare currently importing from Saudi Arabia. So it is necessary to have \nthese wells.\n  How does hydraulic fracturing fit into this equation? This system has \nbeen used--I remember using it myself--since the 1940s. In the 1940s, \nwe had a system of injection in order to get maximum production in both \noil and gas wells. Not one time in that period of time--after over a \nmillion wells have used this process--has there been any kind of damage \nto the environment. In the last 15 years, there have been over 100,000 \nwells using this, with no damage to the environment.\n  As the Senator from New Mexico points out, this is not a partisan \nthing. The Clinton administration supported this, the Bush \nadministration supports this, and Carol Browner supported this when I \nserved as chairman of one of the subcommittees of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee. This is necessary to have, and it does no harm \nto the environment.\n  I am honored to join my colleague, Senator Bingaman, in supporting \nthis amendment and in saying this is a necessary part of the national \nenergy policy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Carl Smith Assistant \nSecretary, Office of Fossil Energy, of the Department of Energy be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                         Department of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As the Senate considers legislation to \n     address our growing dependence on imported oil and to \n     consider ways to promote the production on of our domestic \n     energy resources, I am concerned that the impact of possible \n     restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing, the most \n     commonly used technique to stimulate domestic oil and gas \n     wells, may not be well known or fully understood. Therefore, \n     I thought it would be useful to provide you with some \n     information on the essential role this technology plays in \n     today's oil and gas industry.\n       Hydraulic fracturing is used on approximately two thirds of \n     the onshore gas wells drilled in the United States today and \n     since its inception in 1947, it has enabled the production of \n     over eight billion barrels of North American oil reserves \n     that otherwise would have been unrecovered. It is estimated \n     that hydraulically fractured gas wells produce 10 Tcf of \n     natural gas annually, or nearly sixty percent of the gas \n     produced from domestic gas wells. Further, production of one \n     of our fastest growing sources of onshore natural gas \n     supplies, coalbed methane, would be seriously diminished if \n     hydraulic fracturing was unavailable. Approximately seventy-\n     five percent of the 1.5 Tcf of coal bed methane produced \n     annually comes from wells that were hydraulically fractured.\n       I would also point out that hydraulic fracturing offers \n     several environmental benefits. By increasing the production \n     of oil and gas from reservoirs that have lower flow rates, \n     hydraulic fracturing reduces the number of wells needed to \n     deplete the reservoir, thereby protecting the environment by \n     minimizing the waste volumes and surface disturbance \n     associated with oil and gas drilling. Also, by increasing the \n     amount of methane recovered from mineable coal seams prior to \n     the start of mining activities, hydraulic fracturing promotes \n     coal mine safety and lowers the amount of methane gas that \n     escapes during mining operations, a significant source of \n     greenhouse gas emissions.\n       On August 24, 2000, while still Secretary of Energy for the \n     State of Oklahoma, I had the opportunity to raise these \n     points at a workshop held here in Washington by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Also speaking at that \n     workshop was Tom Stewart, Executive Vice President of the \n     Ohio Oil and Gas Association. I managed to find a copy of his \n     remarks on the internet and I thought you might be interested \n     in them. They mirrored many of the comments I heard from my \n     colleagues during the workshop. Tom noted that, ``With very \n     limited exceptions, hydraulic fracturing was used to complete \n     over 55,000 Ohio wells drilled since 1970. Exploitation of \n     the tight Clinton sand would not have been possible without \n     fracturing. The hydraulic fracturing process made the modern \n     Ohio oil and gas industry.''\n       In September 2001, the Department of Energy's concern with \n     the impact of proposed restriction on the use of hydraulic \n     fracturing, led the Office of Fossil Energy to ask the \n     National Energy Technology Laboratory's Strategic Center for \n     Natural Gas to conduct a study on, ``Quantifying the Impact \n     of Hydraulic Fracturing in Meeting U.S. Natural Gas Supply \n     Requirements''. The number and types of stimulation \n     treatments (hydraulic fracturing) will be quantified, \n     treatment costs will be identified, and natural gas \n     production and price relationships will be reviewed and \n     projected. Results of this study will be available in May of \n     this year but I anticipate that some useful information \n     regarding the important role of hydraulic fracturing will be \n     available over the next few weeks. I will provide this \n     information to you as it becomes available.\n       I welcome the opportunity to bring this very important \n     matter to your attention. If you need more information or \n     have any questions please contact Peter Lagiovane of my \n     office. He can be reached at, 202-586-8116 or via email at, \n     peter.lagiovane@hq.doe.gov.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Carl Michael Smith,\n                                          Office of Fossil Energy.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to express my opposition and deep \nconcern to the amendment being offered from my good friend from New \nMexico, Senator Bingaman.\n  This amendment would prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency \nfrom regulating hydraulic fracturing, an oil and gas operation which \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit has held should be \nregulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works, which has jurisdiction over \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, I am very disappointed that this matter is \nbeing added to the Energy bill without my committee having held \nhearings on the matter. Hydraulic fracturing is a method for \nstimulating recovery of natural gas and coalbed methane by fracturing \nrock formations through the injection of highly pressurized water \ntreated with various additives. There is substantial question as to the \nnature of these additives--which are not closely regulated under most \nstate and Federal laws--and whether they have the potential to migrate \nto public sources of drinking water when hydraulic fracturing occurs.\n  The amendment would in essence overturn the finding by the Court of \nAppeals that hydraulic fracturing must be regulated under the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. The amendment would require EPA to conduct a study \nto determine whether hydraulic fracturing would contaminate \ngroundwater. Only after completing the study would EPA\n\n[[Page S1635]]\n\nbe free to regulate the activity and protect drinking water wells, \nunless during the interim the EPA found emergency circumstances. I do \nnot believe the record provides ample support for a conclusion that \nlittle harm will occur during the course of this study, and the EPA \nshould not be barred from regulating hydraulic fracturing until the \nstudy is completed. Further, I do not believe the EPA should be the \nsole determiner of whether these activities should ultimately be \nregulaed. That issue is properly within the realm of Congress to \ndecide. Such a decision should be made after the benefit of full \ncongressional review. That has not occurred here.\n  This is not a question of blocking oil and gas development. Oil and \ngas development has been proceeding briskly within the State of Alabama \nsince the EPA instituted new regulations under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct for hydraulic fracturing operations, pursuant to the order of the \ncourt. Nobody has gone out of business. The industry simply objects to \nadditional costs they are incurring, costs which appear to be \nrelatively minor, and which are directed solely to helping protect the \nadequacy of the public's drinking water supplies. This matter is \nsquarely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, and as chairman, I must object to inclusion of this \namendment within the energy bill, without the matter being properly \nexamined and dealt with within the committee.\n  For the above reasons, I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n2 p.m. today be for debate with respect to the following amendments: \nthe pending Voinovich amendment No. 2983, and a Bingaman or designee \namendment regarding hydraulic fracturing to be offered; with the time \nto be equally divided and controlled with respect to these amendments; \nthat there be no second-degree amendments in order prior to a vote in \nrelation to these amendments; that the votes with respect to these \namendments occur in the order offered; and that if an amendment is not \ndisposed of, the Senate continue the vote sequence which was not \ndisposed of previously.\n  Before asking that the request be agreed to, I yield to my friend \nfrom New Mexico for sending a modification to the desk.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2986, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2986), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 610.

Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for Members, we have until 2 p.m. today to \ndebate these two amendments. We have been told other people want to \nspeak on Price-Anderson, and certainly others want to talk about \nhydraulic fracturing. We also have some people who have indicated to me \nand others that they wish to do so. This would be an appropriate time \nto do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I yield the Senator from Alabama 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank Senator \nInhofe for giving me this time. I particularly thank Senator Inhofe and \nSenator Bingaman for their leadership in moving forward on the \nhydraulic fracturing issue.\n  The purpose of this bill is to help us produce more energy, and \ncleaner energy, to meet our energy needs more at home from our domestic \nsources, but also to do it in a cleaner way. There are a lot of things \nwe can do to make that happen.\n  One significant and important event is to deal with the hydraulic \nfracturing issue. I believe we can make some progress. This is a \nprocess that is used for the production of coalbed methane. They use \nhigh-pressure water, carbon dioxide and sand to create microscopic \nfractures in coal seams, and that releases the methane that is in that \ncoal seam. That is the basic process.\n  Of course, carbon dioxide is readily available in the atmosphere. It \nis not a pollutant, the sand is not a pollutant, and water is not a \npollutant. They have never believed that this process in any way was a \npolluting enterprise.\n  Most States in which hydraulic fracturing is used--including my State \nof Alabama--have implemented regulations to ensure that hydraulic \nfracturing continues to be used in a safe manner. The technique has \nbeen used safely by coalbed methane oil and gas producers for over 15 \nyears, and there has never been a single event of contamination to \nunderground drinking sources.\n  The history of this issue is kind of simple. Currently, EPA has \ndirected the state of Alabama to regulate hydraulic fracturing under \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act. Neither EPA nor Congress ever intended to \nbe regulating this procedure. However, in 1995 a lawsuit was filed \nagainst EPA.\n  This was Carol Browner's EPA, which was very aggressive in regulating \nanything that needed to be regulated. They claimed that the hydraulic \nfracturing in Alabama should be regulated under not an obscure but a \nsignificant rule called the Underground Injection Control Program that \nwas established by the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n  The Underground Injection Control Program was designed to regulate \nthe disposal of hazardous waste underground, but fluids and sand used \nin hydraulic fracturing certainly are not hazardous waste.\n  The lawsuit was filed and the EPA defended it. They said we should \nnot be regulating this. They defended it in court: It did not fit \nwithin the purposes of the UIC Program, and that the State of Alabama \nalready sufficiently regulated the process, and the procedure itself \nposed little risk to underground drinking water sources or to the \nenvironment.\n  In 1997, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, in analyzing the \nstatute written by Congress, found that the language in the statute, \nwhether Congress intended to cover it or not, reading the plain \nwording, covered injection of carbon dioxide and sand in the ground and \nit is covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act. We have been trying to do \nsomething about this situation for quite some time. It has been a \nburdensome process.\n  Congress has come up with a number of ideas. The EPA pretty well \nindicated at the beginning they supported fixing this problem, and we \nhave moved forward on it. I believe this compromise which Senator \nBingaman and Senator Inhofe have talked about--a thorough scientific \nreview--will show that there is no environmental degradation \nwhatsoever. Once that is done, we can fix this process and get it back \ninto the normal scheme of things.\n  This is a big impact on my State. We are the second-largest producer \nof coalbed methane in the country. It is a process that started in \nAlabama. The technology was developed in Alabama. I guess that is why \nthey picked on our State to file the lawsuit. As a result, this has had \na significant adverse impact on the State of Alabama.\n  We have had 300 new hydraulic fracturing proposals submitted since \nthe lawsuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cleland). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask I be allowed 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield another 5 minutes to the \nSenator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. That is very \ngenerous.\n  It has fallen particularly hard on the Alabama Department of \nEnvironmental Management whose budget is strapped at this time. Their \nfinancial problems have made a lot of news, frankly. Since this is a \nmatter of national importance, I believe it is appropriate that \nAlabama, which is the State most adversely impacted at this time within \nthe Eleventh Circuit where the court ruling applies, be given some \ncompensation toward the cost of administering and reviewing these 300-\nplus proposals.\n  I am pleased we were able to work out an agreement that $100,000 will \nbe authorized for that purpose. I am pleased Senator Bingaman and \nSenator Inhofe, as I understand it, have agreed that if this continues \nto be a problem or if there is sound evidence that additional moneys \nare required to do this--more than the $100,000 that will be approved--\nthey will consider that in conference as we move forward with the bill.\n\n  Methane is one of the cleanest of all burning fuels. Methane produces \ngood energy and, at the same time, it is very clean energy. The fact \nthat we can draw the cleanest of all burning fuels from land within the \nUnited States is a good thing that we should be promoting. This is the \nkind of energy production that should be promoted in the country. I am \nglad we are moving forward finally to get this settled so we can \nenhance the production of coalbed methane throughout the country. It \nwill be a good step forward.\n  In conclusion, this is a new source. Every Btu of energy we take from \ngas, or from gasoline and oil, that we purchase from outside our \ncountry is a drain on the wealth of this country. It generates economic \nactivity in the country from which we purchase it. It does not generate \neconomic activity in the United States. It is a net transfer of \nAmerican wealth. That is why I believe this is not just an oil industry \nissue, this is not a big business issue, this is not simply an \nenvironmental or non-environmental issue. I believe we need to increase \nenergy production in America because it is a matter of economic \nimportance. It generates jobs and wealth in our country, not in \nVenezuela and the kind of government they have there, or Saudi Arabia, \nor Iraq. It creates wealth in the United States. It keeps our dollars \nhere. It generates jobs here.\n  To me, there is no more worthwhile energy production than one of the \ncleanest of all: Coalbed methane. I am pleased we are moving forward, \neven though it is going to take a little longer than I would like, to \nget this regulatory matter settled and to enhance this production. It \nwill be good for America.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama. We have \nbeen working on this for a long time. For 4 years, we have actually had \nan amendment that would accomplish this. The approach we are taking now \nis the right approach because it is letting scientists decide, not \npeople who come to this Chamber and say hysterically there is going to \nbe harm done to the environment. We can look at history, and, as we \nhave said several\n\n[[Page S1637]]\n\ntimes before, of the over 1 million of these processes that have taken \nplace, there is not one bit of evidence of a problem to the \nenvironment.\n  I have a letter from the Ground Water Protection Council. It is a \ngroup of EPAs throughout America. They strongly endorse this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                         GWPC,\n\n                                 Oklahoma City, OK, March 7, 2002.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Ground Water Protection Council (GWPC) \n     strongly encourages you to support the Bingaman-Inhofe \n     Hydraulic Fracturing Amendment.\n       The GWPC is a national association of state agencies who \n     regulate the nation's ground water and underground injection \n     control programs. Our members and Board of Directors are \n     professional geologists, hydrologist, geo-chemists and \n     petroleum engineers.\n       As the state agencies charged with protecting the nation's \n     ground water supplies and regulating the oil and gas \n     industry, we are very concerned that failure to pass the \n     amendment would result in an additional and unnecessary \n     regulatory burden on both states and the industries they \n     regulate, with no environmental benefit.\n       We are aware of a March 6, 2002 letter to you opposing the \n     Bingaman-Inhofe Hydraulic Fracturing Amendment and have the \n     following comments:\n       In no state is the oil and gas industry exempt from the \n     requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act. A number of \n     activities conducted as part of oil and gas exploration and \n     production are regulated under the UIC program, including \n     injection of produced water and some related wastes. \n     Hydraulic fracturing is fundamentally different because it is \n     part of the well completion process, does not ``dispose of \n     fluids'' and is of short duration, with most of the fluids \n     being immediately removed.\n       Fracturing fluids do not contain MTBE. Fracturing fluids \n     may contain small amounts of other hazardous chemicals but \n     constituents such as benzene do not appear in fluids that \n     would be used in fracturing shallow formations. Such fluids \n     are used in deeper formations that are usually thousands of \n     feet below the strata that drinking water wells actually tap \n     into.\n       Any ``regulatory rollback'' would occur only after careful \n     EPA study and only if EPA determined, based on the study and \n     the peer review by NAS, that federal regulation of hydraulic \n     fracturing is not necessary.\n       The letter ignores the fact that states already regulate \n     underground injection and hydraulic fracturing. In fact, the \n     ``exclusive deal'' for the oil industry that is alleged in \n     the letter was in actually a recognition by Congress in 1980 \n     that states were already effectively regulating oil and gas \n     exploration and production activities and had done so for \n     years. Congress further recognized that it did not make sense \n     to change these effective state programs by making the states \n     comply with redundant federal regulations.\n       The letter alleges that hydraulic fracturing threatens \n     underground sources of drinking water. The letter does not \n     allege that hydraulic fracturing has actually resulted in \n     adverse impacts to USDWs because no such impacts have ever \n     been confirmed.\n       The proposed amendment would not ``overturn two Court of \n     Appeals decisions.'' It certainly would not overturn LEAF II. \n     In fact, it codifies LEAF II. It doesn't even overturn LEAF \n     I, but would allow EPA to determine that the current state/\n     EPA regulatory partnership is working effectively and that \n     additional federal regulation is not necessary\n       The proposed amendments would not ``fully suspend'' \n     regulation of hydraulic fracturing. Current state regulations \n     would be unaffected and remain in force.\n       On behalf of the Ground Water Protection Council, we again \n     urge you to support the Hydraulic Fracturing Amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Michel J. Paque,\n                                          GWPC Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, again, we are saying let's not get \nemotional about this. Let's not come up with all kinds of accusations. \nInstead, let's let science decide. Right now, scientific studies \nsubjected to an independent peer review is an appropriate way to \ndetermine if Federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing is necessary. \nThe required National Academy of Sciences review of EPA's findings \napproves an independent verification of the study's results. When the \nstudy does come in, it does not necessarily mean EPA has to follow the \ndictates, the results of this study, but they can and they may decide \nto do another study. At least we are letting the scientists make a \ndecision as to who is right.\n  I cannot overemphasize, as the Senator from Alabama talked about how \nclean natural gas is, how clean it is. That is not even debatable. It \nis in such plentiful supply. We need this.\n  Eighty percent of the wells that are done have to use this technique \nin order to produce the natural gas that is necessary to fully utilize \nthat source. So I think this is a very balanced approach, and it is \ncertainly bipartisan.\n  I applaud our Senator from New Mexico, along with others who have \njoined us in supporting this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I also commend the Senator from Alabama \nfor his effort in this regard. I do think his proposed modification of \nour amendment makes a good deal of sense, and we were very pleased to \naccept that. He does have some peculiar problems in Alabama in trying \nto implement their regulatory program, and I think clearly we want to \nsee that State succeed. That is his objective as well. So I am glad we \ncould accommodate that concern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be counted equally against all the Senators who \nare controlling time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to share some thoughts as \nwe move toward a vote on the Price-Anderson nuclear liability amendment \nthat will be coming up later this afternoon. It is an important \namendment. It represents an extension of current policy, and it is \nsomething we should do. The reason we should do that, I am so firmly \nconvinced, is that nuclear power is an important component of our \nnational energy mix. One out of every five times Americans turn on \ntheir light bulbs, one out every five times Americans turn on their \nrefrigerators, or turn on anything else, one out every five times \nAmericans use electricity, that electricity is produced thanks to \nnuclear power.\n  Currently, 20 percent of our supply comes from nuclear power. I think \nit is time for us to consider not only maintaining that but actually \nincreasing that percentage. The Palo Verde Nuclear Generation Station \nin Arizona, for example, generates more electricity annually than any \nother power plant of any kind, including coal, oil, natural gas, and \nhydropower. We simply have to realize the potential of this energy \nsource and join many of the other leading nations in the world in \ncontinuing to implement nuclear as a major component of our energy mix.\n  The Energy Information Agency predicts a 30-percent increase in the \ndemand for electricity in this country by the year 2015--a 30-percent \nincrease in demand over the current level. Twenty percent of our power \ntoday comes from nuclear power. France produces over 60 percent from \nnuclear. Japan produces nearly 50 percent of its electricity from \nnuclear power sources. In 10 countries, there are 29 nuclear plants \ncurrently under construction. The United States has none. We should be \nfollowing suit. We simply do not need to allow the rest of the world to \nget ahead of us on the question of producing power by nuclear energy.\n  I have enjoyed visiting our nuclear plants in Alabama. The Tennessee \nValley Authority is setting records for safety, reliability, and \nproductivity at their Browns Ferry plant. They have 1,000-plus \nemployees making high wages and producing a steady source of energy 24 \nhours a day. They have the time to shut down those plants for \nrefurbishing, and the cost has been reduced quite significantly. It is \nan important part of our energy mix.\n  Shortly after I came to the Senate, I attended the 44th Annual \nSession of\n\n[[Page S1638]]\n\nthe North Atlantic Assembly in Scotland. Members of parliaments from \nthroughout the North Atlantic nations attended. At that meeting, the \nAmbassador to the United Nations International Energy Agency appointed \nby President Clinton, John B. Ritch, III, stated in his presentation \nthat electricity demands will double in the world by 2050 and the one \ntechnology capable of meeting a large baseload with negligible \ngreenhouse emissions is nuclear power.\n  He added:\n\n       In the century ahead, mankind must place great reliance on \n     harnessing the nuclear genie and using it to maximum effect, \n     if our needs are to be met and our security preserved.\n\n  In fact, he went into some detail about the cost and the benefits of \nalternative sources of power. He concluded that they all have some \nbenefit but that none can even come close to meeting this huge surge in \ndemand the world is going to be facing in the decades to come.\n  Nuclear energy is a clean source of energy. It is environmentally \nfriendly. I am astounded we have the debate that we have over whether \nor not nuclear energy is a positive thing for the environment. It most \ncertainly is. Nothing else can produce this kind of source of power \nwith no air pollution from it.\n  We would never have air as clean as we have today if we dropped all \nour nuclear plants and started producing that energy with coal or oil. \nWe could not come close to that. According to a study conducted by \nEnergy Resources International, nuclear energy has prevented the \nrelease into the atmosphere of 219 million tons of sulfur dioxide, 98 \nmillion tons of nitrogen oxide, and 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide \nsince 1973.\n  Annually, nuclear power prevents the release of 5.1 million tons of \nsulfur dioxide, 2.4 million tons of nitrogen oxide, and 33 million \nmetric tons of carbon.\n  In Alabama, there are currently two nuclear powerplants: Browns Ferry \nand Farley. In 1999, those powerplants avoided the release of \napproximately 163,000 tons of sulfur dioxide emissions, 90,000 tons of \nnitrogen oxide emissions, and 6.8 million metric tons of carbon \nemissions.\n  The building blocks of ozone, that we know is not a good thing in our \natmosphere, as we have created it in manmade quantities--an irritant to \nour lungs, a health risk to children and the elderly--are not emitted \nat all by nuclear powerplants. Ozone precursors are fossil fuel \nproduced.\n  Implementing nuclear energy is the only way we can meet our projected \nenergy demand while simultaneously reducing the release of sulfur \ndioxide and nitrous oxides. Furthermore, nuclear energy does not emit \ncarbon dioxide, which is what people blame for global warming. That is \na matter I think people cannot dispute.\n  It strikes me as hypocritical that those who complain most and \nexpress the most fear about global climate change are, in general--but \nnot always--the same people who are against nuclear power. Many of \nthese people, I believe, unfortunately, are not rational on this \nsubject. People have referred to them as ``nuke kooks.'' But, whatever, \nthey are obsessed with blocking nuclear power.\n  A few years ago the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, a \nreputable professional organization composed of innovative individuals, \nengineers, who design solutions to meet our energy needs, issued a \npaper regarding climate change. In the paper, they made numerous \nstatements regarding the importance of nuclear to our energy mix. They \nstated:\n\n       It is unlikely, however, that a worldwide, stable \n     atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration--\n\n  That is, a stable amount of carbon dioxide in the air--\n\n     can be reached without the use of nuclear, renewable, and \n     biomass energy for electric power generation.\n\n  Our legislation significantly promotes biomass and renewable energy. \nThere is little in this bill to really increase nuclear power.\n  I continue to quote:\n\n       Assuming that the historical trend continues in which \n     electricity consumption follows economic growth, it becomes \n     essential that the U.S. environmental policies include \n     retention of existing nuclear power generation capacity. \n     Indeed, these policies should include development and \n     implementation of additional nuclear power reactors to meet a \n     growing demand for electricity. . . .\n\n  Looking at this matter objectively, just at the overall picture of \nour energy demands, it is clear to me that nuclear energy is the only \nviable solution to meeting both our energy demands and our \nenvironmental objectives. It will produce power required to meet our \nenergy needs in a safe and environmentally friendly way.\n\n  People say: It is risky. It is dangerous. The people who live near \nthe nuclear reactors in Alabama with whom I meet and talk are very \nstrong supporters of nuclear power. The overwhelming majority of \nAmericans favor nuclear power. They favor the expansion of nuclear \npower.\n  But let's talk about the safety record.\n  The nuclear energy sector has, in any way you look at it, a stellar \nsafety record. We have not lost one life in this country--ever--as a \nresult of a nuclear power accident in the history of this country. How \nmany people have we lost in accidents with trucks and trains carrying \ncoal, or with pipelines carrying natural gas, or in coal mines, or in \nother ways where lives are lost in the production of other unclean \nsources of energy, the kind of sources of energy that produce NOx and \nSOx and the kind of adverse exposures to health that come from fossil \nfuels? So we have those kinds of unhealthy actions, too, in addition to \njust the safety factor in producing the energy.\n  The main reason the nuclear industry is so safe is that it is \noverseen--originally by the Atomic Energy Commission and now the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission. As a member of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee at the time, we had a number of hearings about \nthe oversight by NRC. They are meticulously reviewing and monitoring \nnuclear plants all over America. They do that on a constant basis. They \nare exceeding other countries in the cost of their supervision and in \nthe minutiae of it. But we have not had any accidents.\n  We had the problem at Three Mile Island. A major sea change has \noccurred since then. A recent study has shown that no one suffered \ninjury from the Three Mile Island accident, even though, if you asked \nAmericans, they would probably think people were injured from it. But a \nscientific study has indicated there were no injuries, whatsoever, as a \nresult of that accident.\n  But since then, we have learned and we have stepped up, even to a \nmuch higher degree, our supervision by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission of nuclear plants. I do not believe we will see that ever \nhappen again. I believe we would react so much better, if anything were \nto begin to happen like that, that we would not see that kind of event \noccur again.\n  We are also looking at new and special ways to produce nuclear power, \nnew kinds of reactors where it would be impossible to have a nuclear \nreactor explosion or break.\n  Last June, at the Economic Club of Chicago, in a major address, Alan \nGreenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board--the architect, I \nsuppose, of our economy--talking about what America needed to do, made \nthis statement:\n\n       Given the steps that have been taken over the years to make \n     nuclear energy safer, and the obvious environmental \n     advantages it has in terms of reducing emissions, the time \n     has come for us to consider whether or not we can overcome \n     the impediments to tapping its potential more fully.\n\n  Doesn't he always have a nice way of saying those things?\n  I think it is time for us to consider the impediments to the \nexpansion of nuclear energy. I agree with him, especially in light of \nour goal of cleaning up our air.\n  Every year, the Federal Government provides tax credits and financial \nincentives for solar cells and wind turbines and biomass sources. I \nsupported many of those. We are not providing anything here for nuclear \nenergy. I think we need to consider that.\n  Many people have objected, saying, you have no place to put nuclear \nwaste, and this is, somehow, the Achilles' heel of nuclear power. They \nact as if the amount of nuclear waste would cover the entire State of \nRhode Island, I suppose, and that nuclear waste is so hazardous, if you \nmove it on a rail or truck, it could blow up and kill us all.\n\n[[Page S1639]]\n\n  The truth is, if a truck loaded with nuclear waste were to roll over \nor a train were to roll over, as Senator Murkowski says, it does not \nblow up, it does not flow off into the air; you just pick it back up, \nput it on the track, and send it off.\n  We can move nuclear waste. There is no danger in that. It is an \nirrational thing that we have created this idea that somehow it is \ngreatly disastrous and risky to move nuclear waste to an acceptable \nsite to store it.\n  I applaud the work of the Secretary of Energy, Spence Abraham, a \nformer Member of this body, and President Bush who are moving forward \nwith a decision on Yucca Mountain to store this waste. It is the \nculmination of decades of scientific study, consultation with science \nand environmental advisers, and meetings with leaders and citizens in \nNevada. Finding a safe and central repository is mandated by a law \npassed years ago, and it is also necessary for America's homeland \nsecurity. For example, 40 percent of our Navy's fleet is powered by \nnuclear power. The lack of a repository drives up the cost of nuclear \npower, rendering this clean power generation less economical than it \nwould be and less competitive.\n  Certainly one of the main reasons we are not building new plants \ntoday is because of the waste problem. Of course, those who oppose \nnuclear energy, I strongly believe--and a fair person would agree--have \nused this as a tool to attack nuclear power and not allow us to proceed \nin a rational way.\n  Nuclear materials are now stored in 131 aboveground facilities in 39 \nStates in America; 161 million Americans live within 75 miles of these \nsites. One central site in the Nevada desert, where we exploded nuclear \nbombs on the surface when we were first learning how to make nuclear \nbombs, provides much more protection for America, much more security, \nand is much cheaper than keeping all these other sites that have been \nongoing.\n  Nobody has ever been injured from the 131 sites we now have. They are \ngoing to bury it in the ground, spending billions of dollars paid for \nby the nuclear energy companies, part of the rates they charge, to fund \nthis site. We need to use that. We have the ability to solve this \nproblem, to move ahead with it. The only objection I can see, other \nthan some of the people in Nevada that oppose it, is that it would \nrelieve an objection, it would remove an objection that the antinuclear \nsupporters have used to hide behind in their opposition to nuclear \npower.\n  This nuclear liability amendment we will be voting on this afternoon \nis critical to helping us maintain, not expand but maintain our current \nclean source of 20 percent of our electricity. We ought to pass that. \nWe ought to open our eyes to the possibilities for the world for the \nexpansion of nuclear power.\n  It has been said that the lifespan of human beings on this globe who \nhave ready access to nuclear power electricity is twice that of \ncountries where it is not readily available. Electricity is one of the \ngreat discoveries in the history of mankind. If you don't think so, \nwhat would it be like to have to cook by fire every day or wash your \nclothes in the river? It is an energy system that has done so much for \nthe world.\n  We have large portions of this world--think about India, China, South \nAmerica, not nearly at full capacity on electricity--that could use \nmuch more electricity. How are we going to produce it? What will happen \nto our global warming theorists when they start using coal and other \nfossil fuels in huge numbers to meet their growing demands for power \naround the world? Do they think they are not going to expand their \nelectricity? How could we ask them not to? How could we ask a poor \ncountry where people are dying at 40 and 45 years of age, with all the \nadverse consequences, not counting the quality of life, to not expand \ntheir energy? They are not going to be able to do it solely with solar \nand windmills and biomass. It is just not there; the numbers are not \nthere.\n  Yes, we can do conservation. Yes, we can reduce our use. Yes, we \ncould be more efficient. I visited an Alabama plant not long ago that \nmakes refrigerators. That product they produce uses one-half the \nelectricity of one of the same size used 10 years ago, but you can't go \nmuch lower. It takes a certain amount of electricity to run a \nrefrigerator. We have a limit on how much we can conserve.\n\n  In fact, many of our better and easier steps toward improving \nefficiency have already been found. We are using them. The new steps to \nmake ourselves more energy efficient are out there. Many more can be \ndone. But they will not make as big an impact as the ones we have \nalready undertaken. That is the law of science.\n  It would be an error of colossal proportions for our environment, for \nsafe energy, and for low-cost power, if we do not deal with the \nquestion of nuclear liability. I believe we will do that. I am \nconfident we will pass it later on this afternoon.\n  We also need to, as a nation, shake off the misinformation about \nnuclear power. Look at it. Consider the fact that we lost not one life \nin America as a result of the production of nuclear power, that we have \nnot lost any lives as a result of breathing pollutants, as we probably \nhave, as we certainly have, from coal and other plants, as a result of \nbreathing the air around nuclear plants.\n  This is a good environmental issue. It is a good energy issue. It has \nthe potential to move us forward. We need to be thinking about the \ngreat potential to make the plants that are more modern and more \nefficient and even more safe than today. In fact, some can be designed \nthat make it impossible to release radioactive material.\n  I know we will be voting later on this afternoon on this amendment. I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote that \nis now scheduled for 2 o'clock today be rescheduled for 2:15 p.m. under \nthe same conditions of the previous unanimous consent agreement, and \nthe only change I request is between the first and second vote there be \n2 minutes equally divided for those who wish to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have some further comments \nspecifically addressing the Price-Anderson insurance program for \nnuclear powerplants that we will be voting on a little later this \nafternoon, maybe around 2:15. Making some points about the details of \nit, 45 years ago the nuclear power industry said if they were going to \ngo forward with this new source of power, they wanted to be able to \ndevelop an insurance program that would work and that would assure the \ncommunities in which they are building these plants they would be \noperated safely, and if something bad occurred that everybody would be \ncompensated.\n  Those communities have been confident in that process ever since, but \nthe act does expire and it is time for us to extend it. It would be a \nterrible mistake if we did not. It would cause quite a bit of \nheartburn.\n  I will share a few thoughts about how this insurance program works. I \nbelieve people would feel good about it and want to go forward with it. \nThe average business in America that does the things they do every day \nmay have products on their premises that are somewhat dangerous. If a \nterrorist or somebody blows it up and it kills people, it is not their \nfault. They are not liable. They did not do anything wrong. They were \nnot negligent. They were not irresponsible. They were not reckless, and \nthey did business in a safe way.\n  Of course, the nuclear power industry operates precisely the way the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission tells them to\n\n[[Page S1640]]\n\noperate, in a safe fashion. At any rate, they are doing what they can \nto comply with the law and the regulations, and they have had \nthis insurance policy. Each plant has a $200 million policy for which \nthey are personally responsible. If anything happens, they carry their \nown $200 million policy. The entire industry has come together and \npooled up to $9 billion of a policy, and this is sort of structured by \nthe Price-Anderson Act, and it is all paid for by the nuclear power \nindustry.\n\n  Above that, if something were to happen so badly above that, then the \nFederal Government would have liability to pay under Price-Anderson. \nThat is what our American communities have had a right to expect. They \nwere told that when the plants were built, and we need to continue that \npolicy today. We certainly do not need to stop it. I believe the votes \nare there, and we will pass an extension of Price-Anderson. It would be \na bad thing, cause unnecessary heartburn, would be a breach of the \nfundamental promises of the Federal Government that we do that if we \ndid not extend it, and also it could weaken the nuclear power industry, \nfurther containing any hope of expansion of this 20 percent of our \nelectric-generating capacity that produces no pollution.\n  As I noted earlier, the U.S. nuclear powerplants prevent 5.1 million \ntons of sulfur dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere, 2.4 \nmillion tons of nitrogen oxide, NOX, and 164 metric tons of \ncarbon from entering the Earth's atmosphere. That is the kind of thing \nthey do on a regular basis, producing power cleanly and safely for the \nbenefit of humankind throughout this country.\n  For over 45 years, Price-Anderson has provided a guaranteed \ncompensation to the public in the event a nuclear accident were to \noccur. It provided coverage for precautionary evacuations and out-of-\npocket expenses, reducing delays that are inherent in any kind of \nlawsuit that would have been filed, maybe taking years. It guaranteed \nprompt payment by the insurance companies; no lawsuits. You are liable. \nYou accept strict liability, which is not the law, as I noted, for \nother businesses, and it consolidated the matters in a single Federal \ncourt so promptness and efficiency and fairness can occur. That is a \ngood policy. We ought not to end it now.\n  It is important for safe and clean power to be continued to be \nproduced for America, and I believe we will have a strong vote in favor \nof it this afternoon. Thus, I note there is concern by people, but even \nin Three Mile Island the total amount expended was less than $200 \nmillion, compensating everybody and doing all the things necessary to \ntest and examine and make sure the community was safe; $191 million. \nThat would all be covered by that insurance company's own policy, that \npower company's own policy. If it went above that, up to $9 billion, \nthen the industry would pay for it. Only above that would the taxpayers \nhave any risk. I think it is a good bargain for America. It is a sound \nprogram. We ought to continue it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was with Senator Lott during the lunch \nhour and was not able to hear all the remarks of the Senator from \nAlabama, my friend, Mr. Sessions, but my staff did outline for me some \nof the things he said.\n  This is not the time and the place for a discussion, debate, on \nthings nuclear in the true sense of the word. That time will come.\n  Price-Anderson points up the problems we have with nuclear power. If \nin fact nuclear power was such a good deal, why does it need a subsidy? \nWouldn't any other utility love to have the Federal Government backing \nits liability? That is, in effect, what Price-Anderson does.\n  Many years ago, when nuclear power was an experiment and was in its \ninfancy, and we, the Government, Congress, the President, decided to \ngive it a shot in the arm to see if it would work, even back then \neveryone recognized the dangers of nuclear power. We have had since \nthen Three Mile Island and other problems. It was simply a question \nthat they could not get the places insured.\n  We are now told these places are so safe, there is no reason for the \nsubsidy. If these places are so safe, they should be able to buy \ninsurance. If they can't buy insurance, then the amendment I offered \nshould have been followed; that is, there should be real, true \naccounting in determining liability of these companies. It is clear the \nnuclear power industry is now a mature electricity industry that no \nlonger needs liability protection.\n  Price-Anderson has actually led to a decrease in the amount of \nprivate insurance available. In the 1950s the private insurance \nindustry was willing to insure an accident for $50 million, despite \nexperience with the new technology. Today, the private insurance \nindustry only provides $200 million insurance. That does not keep up \nwith inflation.\n  One of the things that is wrong with Price-Anderson is, how do they \ndetermine the $200 million that they have available in case there is an \naccident? What they should do is have a surety bond, a letter of \ncredit, some type of escrow account, or perhaps government securities \nor insurance.\n  If there were ever an Enron example, it is this. They have a showing \nthat they either have a cashflow or cash reserve that can be generated \nand would be available within 3 months. Not now--within 3 months. That \nis, as far as I am concerned, sheer foolishness.\n\n  I wasn't born yesterday. I know this amendment is going to be agreed \nto, but it should not be agreed to. I think nuclear power should stand \non its own two feet. In Nevada, we are trying to develop large windmill \nfactories to produce electricity. They are going to put up their own \nmoney. There is no Government assurance if somebody gets hurt out there \nthe Government will pick up the expense. The same is true with solar, \ngeothermal, biomass, coal, and natural gas. So Price-Anderson should \nfail.\n  As I have indicated earlier today, virtually every environmental \ngroup in America is opposed to this legislation.\n  I offered an amendment. I talked about it this morning. Every \nenvironmental group was in favor of my amendment. But we have a \nsituation now where this amendment is being pushed forward. As I said \nin the presence of my friend, the junior Senator from New Mexico, I am \ndisappointed he is cosponsoring this amendment. I think it is wrong. I \nthink we should follow the Friends of the Earth, Sierra Club, \nEnvironmental Defense Fund, the Union of Concerned Scientists, \nDefenders of Wildlife, USPIRG, Safe Energy Communications Council, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, National Environmental Policy Act \nTrust, Nuclear Information Resource Service, League of Conservation \nVoters, Taxpayers for Common Sense, Public Citizens for Critical Mass, \nand STAR. These are entities that are concerned about the environment \nand they say Price-Anderson is not good for the environment.\n  So I hope Members will look closely at what they are doing. There \nwill be a few votes against this. There should be a lot more. I am very \ndisappointed that we cannot slow this down.\n  This bill is important legislation for the country, and I recognize \nthat. I think the work we did yesterday was so important, to allow a \npipeline to come from Alaska. That would have 50 million tons of steel \nto construct the pipeline. It would be 2,100 miles of pipe creating \n400,000 jobs. That is what we should be doing.\n  About 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas can come down that \npipeline. That is big. Of course, this is relatively new. It wasn't \nmany years ago that natural gas was just pumped out into the \nenvironment. It served no purpose. Now, of course, we use it to power \nmany of our powerplants in America today.\n  As I said earlier, there is going to be a time in the next several \nmonths to talk in more detail about nuclear waste, but this is not the \ntime or the place to do it. I look forward to a vote in approximately \n20 minutes to take care of the matter that Senator Bingaman offered \ndealing with hydraulic fracturing, and also the amendment\n\n[[Page S1641]]\n\ndealing with the Price-Anderson legislation. I hope the Price-Anderson \nlegislation gets a significant number of votes against it.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma, on his side of the \naisle, has no time remaining.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Oklahoma wishes time, how much time \ndoes he wish?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has 21 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Five minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for giving \nme some of his time, particularly since we are not in agreement with \neach other on one of the two votes that will be taking place.\n  I spent 30 years of my life in the insurance business. I know the \nChair knows a little bit about this business--he spent some time there, \ntoo. I think the Price-Anderson program as an insurance program is a \ngood deal for the public. For over 45 years, Price-Anderson has \nprovided immediate and substantial private compensation to the public \nin the event of a nuclear accident. It has provided coverage for \nprecautionary evacuations, out-of-pocket expenses, has reduced delays \nthat are inherent in court cases, and has consolidated all cases into a \nsingle Federal court.\n  I think it is also important to recognize it has never cost the \nGovernment any money. This is not a Government program.\n  Going back to my third point, if we didn't have something like this, \nthen we would be dependent upon the tort system in this country. We are \ngoing to hear about the delays and the cost. This is one of the \nprograms that has been successful for 45 years. When it gets down to \nsome of the people who are opposing the program, they are actually \nopposed to nuclear energy.\n  I am old enough to remember back in the 1960s and 1970s, the hysteria \nthat hit the streets when they were talking about nuclear energy and \npicketing and protesting. As the years went by, other problems came up \nwith other forms of generation of energy.\n  We went through a long period of time during the Clinton \nadministration with the EPA coming up with some ambient air targets \nthat were not realistic. It created great problems. So we started \ntalking about all the pollutants, emission problems, refineries--\nkeeping in mind all during that discussion our refineries were at 100 \npercent capacity. Yet we were trying to add more and more problems to \nthem with new source review and other programs, making it just a very \nexpensive program.\n  During that time, a lot of the people who 20 years before had been \npicketing because they were opposed to nuclear energy, realized that \nnuclear energy is safe now, it is clean, and it is abundant.\n  The thing that I stress when we are talking about energy is we want \nall forms of energy--we want renewables, we want nuclear energy, we \nwant fossil fuels, we want all the forms of energy because we do not \nwant an energy crisis.\n  As far as nuclear energy is concerned, we are only dependent on that \nfor 20 percent of our energy needs. France is 80 percent dependent. I \nthink we will see in the future that percentage is going to have to go \nup until some of the renewables and other experimental systems come \ninto play where we can depend on them for an abundance of energy. Until \nthen, we are going to have to be using some of the energy sources that \nwe know work and work today. Certainly this is one of them.\n\n  The assistant majority leader also mentioned we will have two votes \nstarting at 2:15. The other is on hydraulic fracturing. I think it is \nimportant to talk about that in the same vein because there you are \ntalking about natural gas. I am from Oklahoma. We know a little bit \nabout natural gas. We know it is among the cleanest forms of energy out \nthere. It is plentiful. It is inexpensive. But as far as being \nplentiful, one of the problems we are having is we have to be sure that \nwe can maintain what we are doing right now in bringing natural gas out \nof the ground.\n  Right now, and for the next couple of years, we will be able to do \nthat. However, because of the court decision that has already been \ndiscussed on the floor by a number of the Senators, we could be having \na problem. The system, the procedure of hydraulic fracturing where you \nare forcing the natural gas or the oil out of the rock formations, is \none that has been proven and has been used since the 1940s.\n  We are talking about 60 years we have been doing this. In 60 years \nand over 1 million wells where we have used this procedure, we have yet \nto have any environmental problem. So it kind of blows my mind there \nwould be people, after 60 years of success, who would say there might \nbe an environmental problem with it. There is no environmental problem \nwith it.\n  The only problem right now is a court case for which we are going to \nhave to go ahead and complete a study.\n  It is important for all my colleagues to realize on this vote today \nall we are talking about is completing the study that is underway right \nnow. The EPA does not have to follow the guidelines of that study. They \ncan authorize another study. But this amendment is to at least let \nscience step in and say: Since there has not been a problem before, \nhere are the risks of a problem in the future. If there is not a \nproblem, we need to go ahead and eliminate that obstacle so we will be \nable to continue using that system.\n  Mr. President, 80 percent of the wells right now--and it is a higher \npercentage when you go to my State of Oklahoma because most of those \nare marginal wells, wells with 15 barrels a day or less--but 80 percent \nof them are going to have to use hydraulic fracturing. That system is \nnecessary in order to come up with the natural gas we need.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I started out my legal career as an attorney \nfor insurance companies. I did lots of trial work representing insurers \nin automobile accidents, hospitals, and hotels. I have some knowledge \nof insurance. I have no question that Price-Anderson gives the nuclear \ngenerators a subsidy and an unfair advantage.\n  Having said that, I want to comment briefly on some of the things my \nfriend from Alabama said, I am told, about nuclear power and the high-\nlevel nuclear repository that is being contemplated in Nevada.\n  First of all, the GAO said there are 292 scientific investigative \nreports for which the Department of Energy is waiting. It wasn't time \nto go forward with that.\n  In addition to that, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, led by \nthe prominent American scientist, Jared Cohon, who was dean of the \nforestry department at Yale and is now president of Carnegie Mellon, \nand his group have said that the science at Yucca Mountain is poor.\n  I think before we get into a long debate here on the floor, which we \nare not going to do--I said there will be another time to do that--\nLeader Gephardt issued a statement just 2 days ago decrying the \nDepartment of Energy's action recently dealing with nuclear waste \nsaying that, among other things, St. Louis passed a resolution saying \nnuclear waste should not be brought through their city. There are other \nthings, and we will talk about those later.\n  I hope we can move forward generally on this legislation. By tomorrow \nwe will have spent a whole week on this. I am not certain how much more \ntime Senator Daschle can afford to stay on this. We have debt limits, \ncampaign finance, and a lot of other things to deal with. I hope those \nwho believe this bill needs a lot more work will move forward as \nquickly as possible and do what they think in the way of amendments \nwill improve this legislation, of course recognizing that a conference \ncommittee will take place. I think we should do everything we can to \nmove this legislation as quickly as possible.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I know our side is out of time. I would\n\n[[Page S1642]]\n\nlike to ask if I could have a couple minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, does the Senator from North Dakota wish to \nspeak prior to the vote at 2:15?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma may have 3 minutes. Will that be adequate?\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is fine.\n  Madam President, I respectfully disagree with what the Senator from \nNevada said about the subsidy. The Federal Government does not use \ntaxpayer money to pay claims in the event of a nuclear incident. There \nhas been no subsidy in the 43 years of Price-Anderson protection. The \nnuclear insurance pool is not the Federal Government. It has paid a \ntotal of, I believe, $191 million in claims. The Price-Anderson Act \nensures that full compensation will be available in the event of a \nnuclear attack. In the absence of the law, members of the public filing \nclaims would need to overcome substantial obstacles of tort law for \nrecovery. As we all know, that is very expensive and very time \nconsuming.\n  I think the key here is that no public funds have ever been paid out. \nFor that reason, there is no way one can say this is a subsidized \nprogram.\n  The Federal Government provides insurance mechanisms for losses \nassociated with agricultural disasters, floods, banks, savings and \nloans; to pay for home mortgages, Social Security, Medicare, crime, and \nmaritime accidents. It is not unusual for the Federal Government to do \nit. But under the current law, the limitation on liability exists for \noil spills, bankruptcy, and workers compensation, but not in the case \nof nuclear accident. While it is very common for the Federal Government \nto expend moneys to underwrite and to be in the insurance business many \ntimes to compete with the insurance industry, in this case it isn't \ntrue. There is no subsidy involved.\n  I am sure my time has expired. I yield the floor. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, what is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is to vote on amendment No. 2983.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Is that vote to occur immediately or is there time to \nspeak?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 2:15.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I see Senator Voinovich.\n  That is the Price-Anderson amendment, I believe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chair.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2983\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question occurs \non agreeing to amendment No. 2983 offered by the Senator from Ohio. The \nyeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nRockefeller be listed as a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment sets up a study process \nto determine whether hydraulic fracturing should be regulated by the \nFederal Government under the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is a \nbipartisan amendment with many cosponsors. It is good policy. It is a \npolicy that was supported by the Clinton administration. It is now \nsupported by the current administration.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing Senators be added as cosponsors: Senators Enzi, Murkowski, \nSessions, and Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to add to the remarks of the \nSenator from New Mexico. This procedure is being used today. It has \nbeen used since the 1940s. Over 1 million wells have used hydraulic \nfracturing. There has never been any documented case of any \nenvironmental damage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime in opposition?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I take the remainder of the time? I simply want to \nadvise Senators that, indeed, this matter has been cleared by both the \nminority and majority, and we concur in its adoption. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2986, as modified.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2987\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2987.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for multiple-year authorization for the fusion \n                        energy sciences program)\n\n       Strike subsection (e) of section 1254 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--From amounts \n     authorized under section 1251, the following amounts are \n     authorized for activities under this section and for \n     activities of the Fusion Energy Science Program:\n       ``(1) for fiscal year 2003, $335,000,000;\n       ``(2) for fiscal year 2004, $349,000,000;\n       ``(3) for fiscal year 2005, $362,000,000; and\n       ``(4) for fiscal year 2006, $377,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes outyear funding \nlevels for the Department of Energy Fusion Energy Sciences Program.\n  I appreciate Chairman Bingaman incorporating provisions of my bill on \nfusion science research in the Daschle-Bingaman substitute bill. \nHowever, the Daschle-Bingaman substitute did not incorporate outyear \nfunding authorizations for the Fusion Energy Sciences Program. This \ntechnical amendment authorizes funding for fiscal years 2003 through \n2006.\n  While we grapple with short-term remedies to our energy problems, we \nneed to stay focused on long-term investment in those areas which have \nthe potential to help secure our energy future. I believe fusion energy \nhas the potential.\n  I appreciate the support of the chairman on this issue. It is our \nunderstanding we might be able to voice vote this.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I support the amendment. I think this \nwill improve the bill. I urge all Senators to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2987) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am informed Senator McCain is ready to \noffer his amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2979\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2979 which is at \nthe desk, and I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Hollings, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mr. Wyden, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 2979.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment can be found in the Record of Tuesday, March 5, 2002, \non page S 1542.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Alaska has a \nsecond-degree amendment to the pending amendment. I know the Senator \nfrom Alaska is very busy. I have a statement which is probably about 10 \nor 15 minutes long, but if the Senator from Alaska wishes to propose \nhis second-degree amendment, I am willing to delay in my statement.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I can wait.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over a year ago the Senate passed S. 235, \nthe Pipeline Safety Improvement Act. That bill was approved by a vote \nof 98-0 on February 8, 2001, and is designed to promote both public and \nenvironmental safety by reauthorizing and strengthening our Federal \npipeline safety programs which expired in September 2000.\n  While the Senate has now passed pipeline safety legislation in both \nthe 106th and the 107th Congresses, the other body has yet to take \nmeaningful action to address pipeline safety. Despite efforts to \nencourage the other body to approve pipeline safety legislation and \nhelp prevent not only needless deaths and injuries but also \nenvironmental and economic disasters, there has been little movement by \nthe House on this important issue. Therefore, the Senate must take \nwhatever action we can to advance pipeline safety legislation.\n  Today I offer the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act as an amendment to \nthe pending energy bill. I believe it is appropriate to consider this \nissue in the context of energy legislation. I believe it is appropriate \nto consider this issue in the context of the post-September 11 \nenvironment. I think it is appropriate to consider this issue in the \ncontext that it is an issue which really needs to be addressed.\n  The Senator from Alaska, it is my understanding, will be proposing an \namendment that has to do with the damage to the Alaskan pipeline, which \nis probably an important amendment.\n  When one looks at this chart of the natural gas and hazardous liquid \npipelines of the United States, the first conclusion one draws is that \nthere is a need for pipeline safety and security. I don't need to draw \nscenarios as to what could happen in the event of the disruption or \ndestruction of one of these pipelines, many of which carry material \nwhich is highly toxic and hazardous. I am pleased to be joined in this \nbipartisan effort by Senators Hollings, Murray, Bingaman, Breaux, \nSmith, Domenici, Hutchison, Wyden, and Torricelli. Our goal is to enact \ncomprehensive legislation for pipeline safety for the public, the \nenvironment, and the economy.\n\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety, within the Department of \nTransportation Research and Special Programs Administration, oversees \nthe transportation of about 65 percent of the petroleum and most of the \nnatural gas transported in the United States. The Office of Pipeline \nSafety regulates the day-to-day safety of 3,000 pipeline operators with \nmore than 1.6 million miles of pipeline. I repeat, 1.6 million miles of \npipeline. It also regulates more than 200 hazardous liquid operators \nwith 155,000 miles of pipelines, as depicted on this chart. This chart \nshows the red lines as the liquid pipelines and the dark-colored lines \nas natural gas pipelines.\n  Given the immense array of pipelines that traverse our Nation, \nreauthorization of our pipeline safety programs is critical to the \nsafety and security of thousands of communities and millions of \nAmericans nationwide. That is why it is appropriate to include pipeline \nsafety provisions as a key component of any comprehensive energy \nlegislation under consideration.\n  The amendment being offered today is the product of many months of \nhearings, bipartisan compromise, and cooperation that began during the \n106th Congress. During the past 2 years, my colleagues and I have made \nrepeated statements discussing the critical need to enact pipeline \nsafety improvement legislation.\n  That necessity has been demonstrated by a number of tragic accidents \nin recent years.\n  For example, In June 1999, a fatal pipeline accident occurred in \nBellingham, WA, when gasoline leaked from an underground pipeline and \nwas subsequently ignited. That accident resulted in the deaths of two \nboys and a young man, in addition to a number of injuries and severe \nenvironmental damage to the area.\n  Other tragedies have occurred. On August 19, 2000, a natural gas \ntransmission line ruptured in Carlsbad, NM, killing 12 members of two \nfamilies. On September 7, 2000, a bulldozer in Lubbock, TX, ruptured a \npropane pipeline, resulting in the death of a police office. In total, \n71 fatalities have occurred as a result of pipeline accidents over the \npast 3 years.\n  I think that number is worth repeating: 71 fatalities over the last 3 \nyears\n\n[[Page S1644]]\n\nhave occurred. Meanwhile, Congress has not acted to enact legislation \nwhich, in the view of many experts, possibly could have prevented these \nfatalities. That is a pretty onerous burden, it seems to me, that is \nplaced on us as legislators in our failure to act.\n  I regret to report that just yesterday, there was a pipeline \nexplosion near Jeffersonville, KY. Thankfully, no fatalities have been \nreported, but I am informed it caused a fire so intense that it was \npicked up on a Federal Government satellite. Clearly, the amendment we \nare proposing today is not only timely but urgent.\n  As I mentioned, the Senate has worked to improve pipeline safety and \nreduce the risk of future accidents. During the last Congress, with the \nassistance of a bipartisan group of Senators, including Senators Slade \nGorton and Patty Murray, the Senate passed the Pipeline Safety \nImprovement Act of 2000. Unfortunately, the House failed to approve \npipeline safety legislation so we were never able to send a measure to \nthe President.\n  When the 107th Congress convened, one of the first legislative \nactions taken by the Senate was to consider and pass S. 235, the \npipeline safety Improvement Act of 2001, a measure nearly identical to \nwhat we passed in the prior Congress. Early attention by the Senate \ndemonstrated our firm commitment to improving pipeline safety. Once \nagain, my colleagues and I are seeking to advance pipeline safety \nlegislation by offering this amendment.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't point out that despite the tragic \naccidents I highlighted earlier, the pipeline industry generally has a \ngood safety record relative to other forms of transportation. According \nto the Department of Transportation, pipeline related incidents dropped \nnearly 80 percent between 1973 and 1998, and the loss of product due to \naccidental ruptures has been cut in half. From 1989 through 1998, \npipeline accidents resulted in about 22 fatalities per year--far fewer \nthan the number of fatal accidents experienced among other modes of \ntransportation. But this record should not be used as an excuse for \ninaction on legislation to strengthen pipeline safety.\n  The pipeline safety program expired nearly 18 months ago. Congress as \na whole must address this critical public and environmental safety \nissue. We need to reauthorize the pipeline safety programs. We need to \nprovide additional funding for safety enforcement and research and \ndevelopment efforts, as well as provide for increased State oversight \nauthority and facilitate greater public information sharing at the \nlocal community level.\n\n  Let me describe the major provisions of the amendment which is nearly \nidentical to S. 235:\n  First, it would require the implementation of pipeline safety \nrecommendations issued in March 2000 by the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General to RSPA. The Inspector General found \nseveral glaring safety gaps at Office of Pipeline Safety and it is \nincumbent upon us all to do all we can to ensure that the Department \naffirmatively acts on these critical problems.\n  The amendment would also require the Secretary of Transportation, the \nRSPA Administrator, and the Director of the Office of Pipeline Safety \nto respond to all NTSB pipeline safety recommendations within 90 days \nof receipt. The Department's responsiveness to the National \nTransportation Safety Board pipeline safety recommendations has been \npoor at best. while current law requires the Secretary to respond to \nthe NTSB no later than 90 days after receiving a safety recommendation, \nthere are no similar requirements at RSPA. Therefore, this legislation \nstatutorily require RSPA and Office of Pipeline Safety to respond to \neach and every pipeline safety recommendation it receives from the NTSB \nand to provide a detailed report on what action is plans to initiate in \nresponse to the recommenation.\n  The amendment would require pipeline operators to submit to the \nSecretary of Transportation a plan designed to improve the \nqualificaitons for pipeline personnel. At a minimum, the qualificaiton \nplan would have to demonstrate that pipeline employees have the \nnecessary knowledge to safely and properly perform their assigned \nduties and would require testing and periodic reexamination of the \nemployees' qualifications.\n  It would also require the Department of Transportation to issue \nregulations mandating pipeline operators to periodically determine the \nadequacy of this pipeline to safely operate and to implement integrity \nmanagement programs to reduce identified risks. The regulations would \nrequire operators to base their integrity management plans on risk \nassessment to periodically assess the integrity of their pipeline and \nto take steps to prevent and mitigate unintended releases, such as \nimproving leak detection capabilities or installing restrictive flow \ndevices. The integrity management provisions will not only be critical \nto advancing pipeline safety, but also to addressing potential security \nconcerns, which is a shared goal among all the sponsors of this \namendment.\n  The amendment also would require pipeline operators to carry out a \ncontinuing public education program to advise municipalities, school \ndistricts, businesses, and residents about a variety of pipeline \nsafety-related matters, including pipeline locations. It would also \ndirect pipeline operators to initiate and maintain communication with \nState emergency response commissions and local emergency planning \ncommittees and to share with these entities information critical to \naddressing pipeline safety and mitigating risks.\n\n  The amendment further directs the Secretary to develop and implement \na comprehensive plan for the collection and use of pipeline-related \ndata in a manner that would enable DOT to conduct incident trend \nanalyses and evaluations of operator performance. Operation would be \nrequired to report incident releases greater than 5 gallons, compared \nto the current reporting requirement of 50 barrels. In addition, the \nSecretary would be directed to establish a national depository of data \nto be administered by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics in \ncooperation with RSPA.\n  In recognition of the critical importance of technology applications \nin promoting transportation safety across all modes of transportation, \nthe legislation directs the Secretary to focus on technologies to \nimprove pipeline safety as part of the Department's research and \ndevelopment efforts. Further, the amendment includes provisions \nadvanced by Senator Bingaman, myself, and others, to provide for a \ncollaborative R effort directed by the Department of Transportation \nwith the assistance of the Department of Energy and the National \nAcademy of Sciences.\n  The amendment would provide for a 3-year authorization, with \nincreased funding for Federal pipeline safety activities, the State \ngrant program, and research and development efforts.\n  Additionally, the amendment requires operators, in the event of an \naccident, to make available to the DOT or NTSB all records and \ninformation pertaining to the accident and to assist in the \ninvestigation to the extent reasonable. It also includes provisions \nconcerning serious accidents that provide for a review to ensure the \noperator's employees can safely perform their duties. In addition, \npipeline employees would be afforded the same whistle-blower \nprotections as are provided to employees in other modes of \ntransportation. These protections are nearly identical to the \nprotections aviation-related employees were granted in the Wendell H. \nFord Aviation and Investment Reform Act for the 21st Century, P.L. 106-\n181.\n  I want to point out this amendment includes a few minor modifications \nto the Senate-passed version of S. 235. It extends the authorization \nperiod for an additional fiscal year which is necessary to reflect the \nfact that a year has passed since we considered S. 235. The amendment \nwould fund pipeline safety programs for fiscal years 2003, 2004, and \n2005 at $64 million annually.\n  The amendment also includes two new provisions intended to address \npipeline security concerns heightened in the wake of the September 11 \nattacks. While the pipeline safety provisions were not originally \ndeveloped as security legislation, I believe it is our duty to address \nidentified security concerns and will certainly consider any security-\nrelated proposals brought to our attention in the future by the \nadministration and other interested parties.\n\n[[Page S1645]]\n\n  In the meantime, the amendment seeks to strike a balance between \npublic access to pipeline information and the need to restrict security \nsensitive information. It would tie the new information disclosure \nrequirements of the legislation to the existing Freedom of Information \nAct standards that restrict the release of certain information based on \nnational security and national defense concerns. Again, it would apply \ncurrent FOIA exemption standards to the public disclosure provisions to \nprotect information critical to national security and defense. As this \nand other security-related measures continue through the legislative \nprocess, I plan to work with my colleagues to ensure the proper \nhandling of security sensitive data within the Federal Government. \nSecurity sensitive information must not be released into the wrong \nhands. This amendment should afford useful protection in the near term.\n  Finally, the amendment would authorize the Secretary to provide \ntechnical assistance to pipeline operators and state and local \nofficials to ensure that they are adequately prepared to respond to \nterrorist attacks or threats that could impact pipelines.\n  We must ensure that the Department has the tools it needs to carry \nout its critical pipeline safety responsibilities, to advance research \nand development efforts, and to protect pipeline security sensitive \ndata. I urge my colleagues to join with me in demonstrating their \nstrong support for improving pipeline safety by voting for this \namendment. I remain hopeful that the Congress will approve pipeline \nsafety legislation before we receive another call to action by another \ntragic accident.\n  We have not reauthorized pipeline safety. It is important that we do \nso. It has lapsed.\n  We can see by this chart the miles and miles of pipeline that cross \nAmerica. Many of them are perfectly safe. There are others that clearly \nneed renewed attention and renewed regulations as embodied in this \nbill. There are 3,000 gas pipeline operators with more than 1.6 million \nmiles of pipeline and 200 hazardous liquid operators with 155,000 miles \nof pipeline.\n  I don't like to refer to nor discuss various scenarios for acts of \nterror, but I think this chart in itself depicts the urgent need for \nreauthorization of this legislation. Also, it is of interest and value \nto put a human face on some of these issues and the importance of them.\n  As I mentioned in my remarks earlier, there was a tragic accident in \nBellingham, WA. Two young boys were killed. I will not describe the \ncircumstances of their deaths. It aroused the entire community.\n  With the assistance of Senator Murray and Senator Gorton, hearings \nwere held in Bellingham on this issue, its cause, and what needed to be \ndone. The people, the families, and the mayor of Bellingham came to \nWashington, DC, to testify before the Commerce Committee.\n  Senator Murray, other Senators, and I made a commitment to the people \nof that community who were directly impacted by the tragic deaths of \nthese children and to the people of this Nation that we would do \neverything we could to enact legislation--to act as is our \nresponsibility--to see that there wouldn't be a recurrence of the \ntragedy and that no other family in America would undergo the agony and \npain of the families of Bellingham, WA.\n  We passed that bill on February 8, 2001. Yet the other body has not \nacted. I think that is very unfortunate. That is why I feel compelled \nto come today with this amendment on the energy bill in hopes that it \nwill now either be part of this bill or the other body will act on this \nvery important legislation which not only has to do with spillage of \ntoxic waste, or hazardous materials, or fires, such as just happened \nyesterday, but which in some cases tragically endangers the lives of \nour citizens. I know of no greater responsibility than to try to do \neverything in our power to prevent a recurrence.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for their consideration of this \nlegislation. I again applaud Senator Murray for her tremendous efforts \nand dedication on this issue--not only the issue but for her sympathy \nand the concern she showed to the families and the people in that \ncommunity who were deeply impacted by the accident.\n  I hope we can do this to fulfill our responsibilities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I compliment Senator McCain and members \nof the Commerce Committee for bringing this matter up.\n  I would like to be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  As all are aware, Senator McCain's amendment is similar to the one \nsubmitted last February. It passed this body by a vote of 98 to 0. I \nfeel quite confident that we can dispose of it favorably. Certainly, \nSenator McCain and others have been diligent in making sure Congress \naddresses the issue. Safety is an extremely important component of \nenergy policy.\n  Senator McCain has indicated the highlights of the legislation. I \nwill not be repetitive.\n  The pipeline, as we know, provides this country with supplies of oil \nand natural gas in a very efficient manner. I believe we will hear from \nthe Senator from Washington relative to the tragedy that occurred in \nBellingham and New Mexico as well.\n  But clearly these incidents highlight that some pipelines are aging, \nand the increased demand for energy is putting more and more pressure \non these pipelines. It is appropriate that there be oversight adequate \nto ensure that wear and tear does not result in tragedies such as we \nhave already seen. The public must have confidence in safety. This \nlegislation will facilitate that.\n  We are fortunate in this country to have a network of pipelines, as \nthe Senator from Arizona has shown on the map, because it is much more \nefficient than moving by rail or by truck. I think it enables us to \nhave relatively abundant and inexpensive energy in the manner in which \nwe move it. No other country has a network as efficient as the United \nStates as far as pipeline transfer of energy is concerned. But we \ncannot become complacent. We must improve the safety of these \npipelines.\n  I certainly welcome the changes to existing law made by the \nlegislation that will improve the overall safety of the pipelines. When \nthis legislation is enacted, it will be the strongest and most \ncomprehensive safety measure ever approved by Congress. At the same \ntime, it will avoid responses that would lead to a lack of investment \nin pipelines without any measure to improve safety.\n  I think we can all agree, given our a reliance on energy in our \neveryday lives, that we recognize the significance of this legislation \nand the contribution it is going to make of ensuring the confidence of \nthe American people that indeed the pipeline network is safe. \nAccordingly, I urge the Senate to agree to this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I am going to offer a second degree amendment, which I \nunderstand has been circulated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2988 to Amendment No. 2979\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me outline the necessity of the second-degree \namendment.\n  We have a unique situation in Alaska with the 800-mile Trans-Alaska \nPipeline which moves about 20 percent of the total crude oil produced \nin this country but is not protected in the sense of the pipeline \nsafety act because our pipeline is completely within the State's \nborders. I am not going to argue with those who have analyzed this. But \nclearly our rivers are in interstate commerce. The fish in the rivers \nare in interstate commerce. But even though our pipeline goes basically \nfrom the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean it apparently may not be \nprotected under the criminal penalties of the pipeline safety act.\n  As a consequence, the amendment I am about to offer includes \nintrastate pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce within \nthe criminal penalty section of the pipeline safety act that currently \nonly protects interstate pipelines.\n  An incident occurred in my State of Alaska last fall where an \nindividual fired a weapon and hit the 800-mile Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n  The evidence indicates that perhaps the individual fired \napproximately 5 or 6 shots. Ordinarily, we are told, the steel in a \npipeline is such that it is\n\n[[Page S1646]]\n\nvery unlikely there could be a penetration by a bullet more than the \ncircumference of the bullet, and very doubtful if that.\n  It is interesting to note the history of that pipeline. It has been \nbombed. It has had dynamite wrapped around it. And it has been shot at, \nand finally an individual did penetrate the surface of the pipeline \nwith a bullet.\n  Now, the defendant was allegedly intoxicated at the time, so we \nreally do not know how many times he shot at it or whether he kept \nmoving up closer until he hit it. But despite the importance of the \ncontribution of the pipeline to the Nation's flow of oil--as I have \nindicated, once contributing 25 percent, and now it is at about 20 \npercent; it has a capacity unused of a million barrels a day--we were \nunable to prosecute due to the loopholes in Federal law. Instead, the \nState prosecuted the individual for the wrongdoing.\n  We believe there is no reason the Federal Government should not have \nbeen able to prosecute this crime since it involved infrastructure that \nis so important to our Nation's energy. This amendment closes that \nloophole in the Pipeline Safety Act and ensures that the Federal \nGovernment will be able to prosecute such cases in the future. It \nassures that both natural gas pipeline facilities and hazardous liquid \npipeline facilities that are intrastate are protected as well.\n  It will protect those facilities even if the facility is within the \nconfines of one individual State's borders, as long as the pipeline is \nused in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity affecting \ninterstate or foreign commerce. I think this is important because even \nthough some pipelines may be confined to one State, such as ours, the \nTrans-Alaska Pipeline, they certainly affect interstate commerce.\n  The amendment will enable the Federal Government to prosecute \nindividuals who threaten infrastructure which is integral to the \ntransportation of important energy resources throughout our country. \nAnd I think from the standpoint of our State of Alaska, it relieves \nsome of the responsibility on our State troopers in recognizing, \nindeed, this would be considered a Federal responsibility as well.\n  So, Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to \nthe McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2988 to amendment No. 2979.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR DAMAGING OR DESTROYING A \n                   FACILITY.\n\n       Section 60123(b) of title 49, United States code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``or'' after ``gas pipeline facility'' and \n     inserting a comma; and\n       (2) by inserting after ``liquid pipeline facility'' the \n     following: ``, or either an intrastate gas pipeline facility \n     or an intrastate hazardous liquid pipeline facility that is \n     used in interstate or foreign commerce or in any activity \n     affecting interstate or foreign commerce''.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, my understanding is that the floor \nmanager has indicated we would have a vote on this at some point. I do \nnot need a rollcall vote on my second degree. I would leave it up to \nthe Senator from Arizona to determine his intent for a vote on his \nunderlying amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the Senator will yield, I am told it is the preference \nof the majority leader that a vote would be set for sometime tomorrow \nmorning.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if my friend will yield, I have spoken to \nthe Senator from Arizona. He has agreed to accept a vote on this in the \nmorning. We believe that even though this vote will, I think, be \noverwhelmingly in support for the McCain amendment, we need to send a \nstrong message to the House, so we want a rollcall vote on this. So the \nplan is to work on this as long as anyone else wants to speak on it.\n  It is my understanding the Senator from New Mexico will accept the \nsecond-degree amendment of the Senator from Alaska and that we will \nthen have other people speak on the McCain amendment. When that is \ncompleted, the Senator from California will offer an amendment. We will \nnot complete the amendment of the Senator from California because the \nSenator from Texas and others wish to speak on that. However, there is \nanother amendment that the Senator from New Mexico is going to offer \nlater today.\n  We would vote first on the McCain amendment in the morning, probably \nat about a quarter to 10, and then we would vote, subsequent to that, \non the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico. But we have to work \nthis out. The majority leader knows about this, but not the details. We \nwill confirm that with him and the minority leader at a subsequent \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I think this is a good second-degree \namendment. I suggest we go ahead and adopt it at this point, and then, \nas the Senator from Nevada indicated, have the scheduled vote on the \nMcCain amendment tomorrow.\n  I know Senator Murray from Washington is waiting to speak on the \nMcCain amendment, as is Senator Breaux from Louisiana.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with my \ncolleagues an issue that relates to pipeline safety. I am concerned \nabout an incident that occurred in Alaska last fall. The Senator may \nrecall hearing in the news about an individual who fired a weapon and \nhit the Trans-Alaska Pipeline.\n  Mr. McCAINE. I do recall hearing about that incident.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I remember reading about the incident as well.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Well, the individual was allegedly intoxicated when \nthe Trans-Alaska Pipeline was damaged. Unfortunately, the U.S. \nAttorney's Office was unable to prosecute the individual for damaging \nthe line due to some loopholes in the Federal law. One of those \nloopholes will be closed by my amendment to pipeline safety that \nincludes intrastate pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce \nwithin the criminal laws that currently only protect interstate \npipelines. However, there was another problem with the case. The \ndefendant was allegedly intoxicated at the time, and the statute \nrequires proof that he ``knowingly and willfully'' damaged the pipeline \npursuant to Section 60123(b) of title 49, United States Code. \nTherefore, due to this higher standard of intent, known as specific \nintent, it appears that he had a diminished capacity defense. It does \nnot seem that this type of vandalism crime should be held to such a \nstandard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand the Senator's concern but also know that if \nwe lower the intent standard in Section 60123(b) of title 49, we want \nto ensure that a person cannot be held criminally liable for \nnegligence.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I understand that concern as well and certainly do not \nwant someone criminally prosecuted unless there was intent. I was \nwondering if the Senator would agree to work with me to see if we can \nfind a compromise that would address the intent issue.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be happy to work with the Senator on the issue.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would be interested in working on it as well.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I understand the concerns of the issue also and would \nagree to work with all Senators to see if we can address this intent \nissue prior to the end of consideration of energy legislation.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor an amendment \nto modernize our nation's pipeline safety programs. As you know, the \nSenate passed this legislation on February 8th of last year, by a vote \nof 98-0. Because it has not yet been acted on in the House, I am \npleased to see that we are working to get this important legislation \nenacted in another way.\n  As we all remember, the issue of our country's pipeline safety came \nto the forefront after tragic explosions in Bellingham, Washington, and \nlater, in my own state of New Mexico.\n  On August 19, 2000, twelve members of an extended family were on a \ncamping and fishing trip along the Pecos River near Carlsbad, New \nMexico. Just after midnight, a natural gas pipeline exploded, sending a \n350 foot high ball of flame into the air. Six of the campers died \ninstantly. The six remaining family members later died from their \nhorrific injuries.\n\n[[Page S1647]]\n\n  We have to make sure that tragedies like this do not occur again. \nWhat I am here to do today, is to work so that we don't have to think \ntwice before camping with our families and friends.\n  Pipelines carry almost all of the natural gas and 65 percent of the \ncrude oil and refined oil products. Three primary types of pipelines \nform a network of nearly 2.2 million miles, 7,000 of which lie in my \nown state of New Mexico.\n  Pipelines stretch across our country. They allow us to obtain energy \nresources quickly and economically.\n  In light of the energy crisis in California, and in the west in \ngeneral, the value of our nation's pipeline system is obvious. We must \nhave access to energy.\n  Therefore, pipelines and the potential hazards they pose affect us \nall. It is time that we do something to ensure our safety while \nprotecting our access to energy.\n  This amendment:\n  Significantly increases States' role in oversight, inspection, and \ninvestigation of pipelines.\n  Improves and expands the public's right to know about pipeline \nhazards.\n  Dramatically increases civil penalties for safety and reporting \nviolations.\n  Increases reporting requirements of releases of hazardous liquids \nfrom 50 barrels to five gallons.\n  Provides important whistle blower protections prohibiting \ndiscrimination by pipeline operators, contractors or subcontractors.\n  Furthermore, the legislation would provide much needed funding for \nresearch and development in pipeline safety technologies.\n  In fact, technology currently exists that might have detected \nweaknesses in pipelines around Carlsbad. Unfortunately, due to \ninsufficient funding those products have yet to reach the market.\n  La Sen Corporation in my own state of New Mexico has developed \ntechnology that can detect faulty pipelines where current pipeline \ninspection technology is not usable. La Sen's Electronic Mapping System \ncan be very effective even in pipelines where conventional pig devices \ncannot be used.\n  Pipeline inspection is costly and slow. Innovative new technologies \ncould allow us to inspect all 2.2 million miles of pipeline each year \nin a cost effective manner. Today, pipeline inspection technology only \ncovers 5-10 miles per day at a cost of $50 per mile. Again, La Sen's \ntechnology can survey 500 miles per day at a cost of $32 per mile.\n  The bottom line is that today, we can take action that will hopefully \nmake pipelines safer.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the potential dangers that \npipelines pose and to minimize those dangers by agreeing to this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment No. 2988?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If not, the question is one agreeing to the \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2988) was agreed to.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the chairman and the Presiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2979\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of this \namendment. I take this opportunity to thank the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain, for his leadership, his perseverance, and his tremendous \nwork on the issue of pipeline safety.\n  As he said, many of us became aware of this issue on June 10, 1999, \nwhen a gasoline pipeline ruptured in my home State of Washington, \nkilling three young people and really shattering our sense of security.\n  The Senator from Arizona was tremendous in his work with us as we \nbrought that family here to Washington, DC. As he stated, the \ncommunity, the mayor, so many people came here. His commitment to \nfollow through with hearings and legislation, and to pass it out of the \nSenate, has just been really noted and respected in the State of \nWashington. And like he, I have difficulty standing here and speaking \nto those families today and telling them the House has still not acted, \nwhich is why we are on the floor of the Senate during the energy \ndebate, once again, passing this legislation.\n  As I said, when that tragedy happened, I discovered that there were \ninadequate laws, insufficient oversight and inspection, and a real lack \nof public awareness about the dangers of these pipelines. So I began to \nwork on a national effort to raise pipeline safety standards. I \ntestified before Congress, and I introduced the first pipeline safety \nbill in the 106th Congress.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said, we passed legislation in the Senate \nin September of 2000, and again in February of 2001; and those bills \npassed without dissent, on a bipartisan basis, with leadership from \nboth sides.\n\n  I am proud to have worked with several Senators, including Senators \nHollings, Inouye, Breaux, Wyden, Brownback, Bingaman, Domenici, \nCorzine, Torricelli, and my colleague, Senator Cantwell, in this \nCongress, and my colleague in the previous Congress, Senator Gorton.\n  But, again, I especially thank Senator McCain for his work on \npipeline safety. I have to say that without his attention to this issue \nover the last several years, I really doubt we would have accomplished \nwhat we have so far. I know that all of the advocates and I appreciate \nSenator McCain's leadership on this issue, and I am looking forward to \ncontinuing to work with him on this and many other critical safety \nissues before us.\n  The bill that the Senate passed was the strongest pipeline safety \nbill ever passed by either body of Congress. It improves the \nqualification and training of pipeline personnel. It improves pipeline \ninspections and prevention practices. It expands the public's right to \nknow. It raises the penalties for safety violators. It increases the \nStates' ability to expand their safety activities. It invests in new \ntechnology to improve pipeline safety. It provides whistle-blower \nprotection. It increases funding to improve pipeline safety. And it \nrecognizes State citizen advisory committees.\n  Despite the Senate's quick, measured, and deliberate work on this \nissue, as I stated, and as the Senator from Arizona said, the House of \nRepresentatives has blocked progress on this initiative. A couple of \nweeks ago, the House finally held a hearing on pipeline safety; and \nthat was the first one that was held in 2 years on this issue. I \nunderstand they intend to move to a markup very soon, and that is \nencouraging. I am also encouraged that House Members from the \nWashington delegation, especially Representative Rick Larsen, are \nworking really hard to make progress on this issue.\n  I have to say, unfortunately, that the bill they intend to mark up \nexcludes many of the important safety measures we put into the Senate \nbill, including strong inspection and testing requirements and adequate \noperator qualification standards. So overall I remain skeptical that \nthe House will eventually pass a comprehensive bill, and that is why I \nam especially pleased that Senator McCain has introduced this \namendment. I am here to support that effort.\n  The amendment before us is nearly identical to the bill that has \npassed the Senate unanimously 2 years in a row. We did, however, make a \nneeded change for national security purposes. September 11 has shown us \nthat our transportation infrastructure is vulnerable to attack by \nterrorists, so we included a provision that would give the Secretary of \nTransportation the discretion to withhold public information about \npipelines if the Secretary believed it would compromise national \nsecurity. The standard would be the same as the current one used under \nthe Freedom of Information Act.\n  I am very proud to cosponsor this amendment. We all know if we want \nmeaningful legislation to move on to the President, it will have to be \nattached to a piece of legislation such as the energy bill. The history \nof this legislation in the House requires that we proceed in this \nmanner.\n  In addition to working on this bill, I am also using my position as \nchair of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee to keep \nthe pressure up and to secure the funding we need to hire inspectors, \nto enforce safety regulations, and to support the States with their \nefforts. I have held several hearings in Washington, DC, and I have \nquestioned the Transportation Secretary and others about our progress \non pipeline safety. I have met\n\n[[Page S1648]]\n\nwith the new head of the office that oversees pipeline safety at the \nDepartment of Transportation, and I told her exactly what I expect the \ndepartment to do to improve pipeline safety. I have not hesitated to \npush the department to issue new pipeline safety rules and regulations.\n  In my position as chair of the Senate Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I worked to pass a bill that provides record funding for \nthe Office of Pipeline Safety. Overall it provides more than $58 \nmillion for that office. That is $11 million more than the fiscal year \n2001 funding level. That budget included funding for 26 new staff \npositions, from safety inspectors to researchers. OPS requested those \npositions, and my bill fully funds those new hires.\n  Finally, it provides needed resources within OPS for critical \ntesting, safety programs, and R I plan to continue to work in the \nAppropriations Committee to make sure the funding is there to do the \nadequate testing and oversight of our pipeline infrastructure.\n  When it comes to pipeline safety, we have taken a major step forward, \nespecially in funding, but we still have to raise the standards \nnationally with legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to move this critical \nlegislation forward to the President for his signature. From Carlsbad, \nNM, to Bellingham, WA, communities across this country are counting on \nus to protect them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment and \nwould like to take a few minutes to describe why this is so important.\n  I have stood on this floor before and described an incident that \noccurred in my State just 3 years ago. In a park near Bellingham, WA, \nan aging pipeline burst, sending a blast of flames that engulfed two \n10-year-old boys. Both of those boys died in that blast and one young \nman drowned after being overcome by fumes. But that incident wasn't the \nfirst, nor the last. This was only one of numerous pipeline accidents \nin the State of Washington, which has suffered 47 reported incidents \nand more than $10 million in property damage in just the 15 years from \n1984 to 1999.\n  I would like to think that many of those accidents could have been \nprevented if the agency responsible for regulating that industry had \nbeen more diligent. This week we begin a substantial debate about \nincreasing the domestic supply of affordable energy, but a significant \npart of that debate hinges on the integrity and reliability of our \nNation's energy infrastructure. And that debate must not overlook the \ncritical importance of our citizens' safety as we work to secure and \ntransport increasingly larger amounts of these resources. For many of \nus in this body, the issue of safety has hit close to home. We have \nseen the loss of human life; the devastation to families and \ncommunities; and the significant property damage associated with \nmismanagement of our pipeline infrastructure. But this is not simply \nabout the personal tragedies in our states.\n  The tremendous efforts to finally pass this legislation--by the \nsponsor of the pipeline safety bill, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, \nmy colleague Senator Murray, and so many others--are based on a \ncontinuing pattern of oversight failures by the Office of Pipeline \nSafety. Many of my colleagues have already referenced the June 2000 \nreport by the GAO, which found persistent failures by OPS to implement \ncongressional mandates. That report indicated that in 22 of 49 cases, \nOPS ignored congressional direction and failed to follow statutory \nrequirements. And since 1990, our Nation has suffered literally \nhundreds of pipeline-related deaths. Now, we have more than 2.2 million \nmiles of pipelines traversing this nation, carrying almost all of the \nnatural gas and 65 percent of the crude oil and refined oil products. \nObviously, we don't want to hinder the effective transportation of \nthese products that are so critical to our national economy. But we can \nand must do a better job of ensuring the public safety.\n  My colleague Senator Murray has been instrumental in the ongoing \nefforts to improve the public disclosure of pipeline information. \nObviously we need to employ common sense in restricting access to \ninformation that poses a real national security threat to our \ncommunities and our nation--but I believe that we must apply the \nhighest standards in assessing those security risks and providing the \nmost complete information possible to our public safety officials and \nto the public at large, so that they can take steps to protect their \nown communities from potential disasters.\n  This amendment seeks to balance these equally important objectives--\nsecurity and public disclosure--that are both intended to enhance the \npublic safety. I am also pleased that this amendment maintains a \ncritical provision that I had worked to pass along with my colleagues, \nSenator Corzine, Senator Torricelli, and Senator Murray, which would \nensure the assessments of nearly all pipeline systems at least once \nevery 5 years. This is an issue of tremendous importance if we are \ngoing to make real strides in prevention of accidents. If we do not \nknow the fundamental state of integrity of these systems and \nfacilities, we cannot identify real threats to our communities. We \npassed this legislation by a wide margin last year and the other body \nhas failed to finish the job. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this amendment and finally getting the job done to better \nprotect our constituents, and better protect our fuel supply.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in supporting the \nlegislation and amendment pending before the Senate. This will be the \nthird time the Senate has passed this legislation. You would think that \neventually it is going to get done. It has failed to pass the House, \nalthough the House at one point had an identical provision and it \npassed. It passed with a majority, but they took it up under suspension \nof the rules, and they needed two-thirds majority, so it did not pass.\n  This legislation will now pass the Senate for a third time and is \nstill waiting on the House to take action on it, which will send it \nultimately to the President for his signature.\n  There are literally millions and millions of gas and hazardous liquid \npipelines that cover the United States. Every State has natural gas \npipelines and oil pipelines that traverse through various parts of \nindividual States and carry literally billions and billions of cubic \nfeet of natural gas every day, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days \nout of the year.\n  Gas comes from my State of Louisiana, from the Gulf of Mexico. It \ngoes to California. It goes to Florida, to Maine, to New Jersey. It \ngoes all the way up to the Midwest and throughout the United States. We \nhave gas coming from the north that serves markets in the southern \nlower 48. This is an intricate pattern, a complicated transportation \nsystem that is absolutely needed and necessary. Without the extent of \nthe natural gas pipeline system, this country would simply not be able \nto operate.\n  It provides energy for plants. It provides energy for factories. It \nprovides heat and also cooling elements to family homes, to businesses, \nto offices throughout the United States. This, indeed, is one of the \nmost sophisticated, complicated systems that man has ever devised in \norder to transport energy.\n  Is there potential and likely sometimes accidents that happen? The \nanswer is yes. There were two tragic accidents--one in the State of \nSenator Murray, Washington, one in the State of Senator Bingaman, New \nMexico--that were tragic and unfortunate. They should never have \nhappened. But if you look at it from the perspective of the millions \nand millions of miles of the transportation system, with the good that \nit provides, it is absolutely clear that these systems must be \nprotected.\n  We need to do a better job of ensuring their safety and security, \ntheir protection from normal accidents, as well as insulate them to the \nmaximum extent possible from terrorist activities and even from \nderanged activities such as of the drunk shooting out the Alaskan \npipeline in the State of Senators Stevens and Murkowski. We can do \nthat.\n  There is not a form of transportation in this country that does not \nhave accidents that happen: Airplanes crash; trains run off tracks; \ntrucks run off highways; accidents happen; people are injured; people \nare killed.\n\n[[Page S1649]]\n\n  The answer is not to eliminate the system but to better ensure the \nsecurity of the systems, to build better trucks, to better investigate \nthe drivers, to better inspect their licenses, to build better \nairplanes, to correct deficiencies in airplanes, to require better \ntraining for pilots.\n  As we do those things for those other means of transportation, it is \nalso incumbent that we provide better and adequate inspections and \nguarantee that pipelines are built to the highest standards possible \nfrom an engineering and technical capability, and also that people are \ninvolved in the decisions as to where pipelines are actually built and \nwhere they are laid in order to let the public know what is near them \nin order for them to be aware.\n\n  It is interesting to note that pipelines are things you never see. \nEvery day, every hour, every minute they are providing efficiency in \nterms of transportation of energy. Pipelines are buried under the sea, \nunder the ground. People don't see them. They don't know they are \nthere. But they are there to do a very effective job to provide for the \nsecurity of this country.\n  This legislation will also provide for better security and better \nsafety for the general public to make sure that while we are \ntransporting billions and billions of cubic feet of natural gas, we are \nalso doing it as safely as we possibly can.\n  Previous speakers have talked about the structure of the legislation. \nI support it. It is good legislation. It has brought both the pipeline \ncompanies, as well as citizens, to the same table to negotiate with \ngovernment officials to get a system in place that we can be proud of \nand will assure the system continues to work as it has in the past with \nthe maximum degree of safety that is humanly possible. This legislation \ngoes a long way toward doing that.\n  This is the third time the Senate will pass this legislation. We urge \nour colleagues in the other body to do it just once.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I know the Senator from California is here to offer her \namendment. Before we set this amendment aside, let me speak briefly \nabout it.\n  It is very important that we pass the McCain amendment once again to \nmake the point to the House of Representatives that this is a priority \nfor our Nation and this is vitally needed legislation.\n  In my State, we lost 12 people as a result of a tragic breach or \nbreak in a high-pressure gas pipeline south of Carlsbad, NM. I visited \nthe site. I saw the tremendous damage that was done when that pipeline \nbroke without any warning and essentially killed a great many people \nwho were there camping beside the Pecos River. This is a tragedy that \nshould have been enough to galvanize action in Washington. When you add \nit to the other tragedy, which has been talked about here several \ntimes, in Washington State, it is clear to me this is legislation that \nshould be passed quickly and moved to the President for signature.\n\n  I very much hope, when we vote tomorrow on the McCain amendment, \nthere will be a resounding vote, as there has been in the past, and \nthat we will finally get the House of Representatives to give attention \nto this issue and to pass it quickly.\n  As I understand it, at this point it is the desire of the Senator \nfrom California to offer an amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside so that she may offer her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2989 to Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment on \nbehalf of Senators Cantwell, Wyden, Boxer, Leahy, and Durbin to provide \nprice transparency when energy derivatives are traded and to give the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission oversight authority for such \ntransactions. Let me set the framework for this amendment.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n     Durbin, proposes an amendment numbered 2989 to amendment No. \n     2917.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendment, Submitted.'')\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will quote from a March 5 letter of \nthe American Public Gas Association by its president, out of Fairfax, \nVA:\n\n       As you know, Enron operated in what was essentially an \n     unregulated environment. While there will be much more to \n     come in the wake of Enron, one thing is perfectly clear \n     today--our Federal Government has an obligation to make sure \n     that no important trading activities fall between the cracks, \n     leaving some energy markets without a Federal agency with \n     oversight authority. Your amendment remedies this glaring \n     deficiency.\n       The American Public Gas Association is fully committed to \n     support our effort to reverse the action Congress took just \n     15 months ago in the Commodities Futures Modernization Act. \n     The Commodities Futures Modernization Act amended the \n     Commodity Exchange Act by allowing some energy contracts to \n     be traded with no Government oversight. We firmly believe \n     that the CFTC must have at its disposal the necessary \n     jurisdiction and authority to protect the operational \n     integrity of energy markets so that (1) transactions are \n     executed fairly, (2) proper disclosures are made to \n     customers, and (3) fraudulent and manipulative practices are \n     not tolerated.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full letter be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me also quote from the Texas Independent \nProducers and Royalty Owners Association:\n\n       [This association] believes that this measure will tend to \n     improve price transparency in natural gas markets, leading to \n     a more efficient and stable marketplace. The relatively \n     modest requirements outlined above should not unduly reduce \n     liquidity for gas traders. Accordingly, TIPRO endorses your \n     amendment.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record following \nmy statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. This letter is from the MidAmerican Energy Holdings \nCompany out of Omaha, NE:\n\n       I am writing in support of your effort to ensure that there \n     is transparency and appropriate Federal oversight of energies \n     futures trading markets.\n       As I testified before the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee last month--\n\n  This is the chairman and CEO--\n\n       I have long been concerned that the type of exchange run by \n     Enron before its collapse offered opportunities for \n     manipulation. Enron was the largest buyer, the largest seller \n     and operator of an unregulated exchange. In view of the \n     revelations of the last several months regarding Enron, the \n     unregulated nature of these markets has raised serious \n     concerns regarding the ability of the Federal Government to \n     ensure that energy trading and futures markets are operating \n     in the interest of the public and market participants.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter, and also a similar letter \nfrom PG, be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 3.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, this amendment would provide the same \ntransparency and oversight that is provided for every other traded \ntangible commodity. All this amendment says is that electronic \nexchanges which change energy derivatives are subject to the same \nrequirements as other exchanges, such as the Chicago Mercantile \nExchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Incidentally, these two \norganizations support this legislation.\n  Additionally, it says that if you are trading energy derivatives off \nan exchange, you simply need to keep a record of that transaction; and \nif it turns out that there is a complaint, the CFTC will have a record \nto review.\n  The problem, and why we need the legislation: Presently, energy \ntransactions are regulated by the FERC, Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission, when there is an actual delivery of an energy commodity. \nLet me give you an example. If I buy gas from you and you deliver that \nnatural gas to me, FERC has the authority to ensure that\n\n[[Page S1650]]\n\nthis transaction is both transparent and reasonably priced. That is a \ndirect delivery. However, energy transactions have gotten so complex \nover just the past decade, most energy transactions no longer result in \ndelivery; thus, with these nondelivery trades and transactions, a giant \nloophole has opened, where there is no oversight and no transparency.\n  Let me explain. Mr. President, I can purchase from you a promise that \nyou will deliver natural gas to me at some point in the future. This is \nreferred to as a derivatives contract. I may never really need to \nphysically own that gas, so I can sell that gas to someone at a small \nprofit, who can then turn around and sell it to yet someone else, and \nso on and so forth. This promise of a gas delivery can literally change \nhands dozens of times before the commodity is ever delivered. Even \nthen, it may never get delivered if the spot market price is lower than \nthe future price that comes due on that day.\n  In fact, 90 percent of energy trades represent purely financial \ntransactions, not regulated either by FERC or the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. As long as there is no delivery, there is no price \ntransparency. So we don't know the price or the terms for 90 percent of \nthe energy transactions taking place.\n  Again, this lack of transparency and oversight only applies to \nenergy. It does not apply if you are selling wheat, or pork bellies, or \nany other tangible commodity. So, as I said, there is a very big \nloophole here.\n  Why is this type of trading so important? Many of these transactions \nprovide needed insurance so a company can lock in set prices in the \nfuture without necessarily ever having to receive delivery. For \nexample, knowing the price of natural gas in the future allows an \nenergy company to, in turn, contract out its electricity, since it will \nknow the price of natural gas, the main cost of production.\n  These transactions are here to stay. What this amendment simply does \nis shed light on them. Futures transactions do affect market prices for \nconsumers, and that is why we need this transparency. That is precisely \nwhy other commodities, except for excluded financial commodities, are \nalready regulated by the CFTC.\n  One simple example of how energy derivatives can affect delivered \nenergy prices is the long-term energy electricity contracts that \nCalifornia and other Western States entered into last year, which were \npriced according to the long-term future costs for natural gas. As soon \nas the future price of natural gas plummeted after the contracts had \nbeen signed, electricity prices fell substantially. All of a sudden, \nthese States looked foolish for signing these contracts.\n\n  How did this happen? How did it come up all of a sudden? The simple \nanswer is that the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, signed into law \nin 2000, exempted energy and minerals trading from regulatory oversight \nand also exempted electronic trading platforms from oversight.\n  In a sense, what that legislation did was set up two different \nsystems treating electronic trading platforms differently from all \nother platforms and treating energy commodities differently from other \ncommodities.\n  Up until 2000, energy derivative transactions were regulated just \nlike other transactions, and electronic trading platforms were treated \nlike other platforms. I repeat, these were the standards that were in \nplace all the way up to 2000.\n  Up until that time, if a gas or electricity commodity was delivered, \nFERC had oversight. If there was not delivery, the CFTC had the \nauthority. So the loophole arose just 2 years ago.\n  At the time of the 2000 legislation, nobody knew how the exemptions \nwould affect the energy market. We have a much better idea today \nbecause of what we have learned since then.\n  It did not take long for Enron Online and others in the energy sector \nto take advantage of this new freedom by trading energy derivatives \nabsent any regulatory oversight or transparency. Thus, after the 2000 \nlegislation was enacted, Enron Online began to trade energy \nderivatives--not deliveries, but derivatives--bilaterally over the \ncounter in a one-to-one transaction without being subject to any \nregulatory oversight whatsoever. If the trade has delivery, again, it \nis regulated by FERC. If it does not, it falls into the abyss. Enron \nOnline was able to trade back and forth without records and in secret. \nThe result, of course, was higher prices.\n  Let me give an example of how that secret trading has affected \nCalifornia and the western energy markets.\n  On December 12, 2000, the price of natural gas in southern California \non the spot market was $50 a decatherm, while it was $10 a decatherm \nclose by in San Juan, NM. A decatherm is 1,000 cubic feet or enough gas \nto power about 100 kilowatt hours of electricity for a typical \npowerplant. It is enough gas to provide electricity for about 900 homes \nfor 1 hour.\n  This problem lasted from November of 2000 to the end of April 2001--a \nfull 6 months--while energy price spikes affected the entire western \nenergy market. And all this time, hardly anyone understood what was \nhappening in nondelivered energy transactions.\n  In 1999, California's total electricity price for the entire State \nwas $7 billion. In 2000, it was $27 billion, and in 2001, it was $26.7 \nbillion. You can see there are serious ramifications when markets are \nsecret without any Federal oversight or investigation of dramatic price \nspikes. You cannot investigate it because there is no evidence because \nall this trading was done in secret with no records.\n  The Senate Energy Committee, of which I am a member, examined this \nissue last year, but we were not able to piece together the pieces at \nthat time. In the wake of Enron's bankruptcy, we are beginning to learn \na lot more. By controlling a significant number of energy \ntransactions affecting California, and by trading in secret, Enron had \nthe unique opportunity to drive up prices. Only time will tell whether \nthat can be proved because of the absence of records and transparency.\n\n  Let me explain how this amendment works. First, the bill repeals the \nprovisions of the 2000 Commodity Futures Modernization Act which \nexempted energy derivatives from regulatory oversight. As I said \nbefore, these transactions were regulated by the CFTC until 2000, so \nthis is not an entirely new authority for the CFTC.\n  As a result of this provision, all electronic trading exchanges will \nonce again be subjected to the same oversight as other exchanges when \nit comes to energy transactions.\n  Companies trading energy commodities off the exchange will simply \nhave to keep a record of that transaction, just as they do for other \ntraded commodities. That is certainly not too much to ask.\n  The amendment also requires FERC and the CFTC to work together to \nensure that energy trading markets are, one, transparent, not in \nsecret; two, regulated, which they should be; and three, working.\n  This will close the regulatory loopholes that allowed entities, such \nas Enron Online, to operate unregulated trading markets in secret.\n  I have received a letter from Pat Wood, the Chairman of FERC. \nChairman Wood writes that neither FERC nor CFTC has adequate authority \nto determine price transparency and ensure that the energy market is \nfunctioning as it should. He supports this amendment. FERC \nCommissioners Brownell and Massey do as well.\n  This amendment does one more important thing. It ensures that \nentities running online trading forums must maintain sufficient capital \nto carry out their operations and maintain open books and records for \ninvestigation and enforcement purposes.\n  This last point is very important. Enron saw its future as a \n``virtual'' company. As such, it sold off many of its physical assets \nover the past few years. So when investors and customers lost \nconfidence and stopped trading out of fear that bankruptcy was in the \noffing, they learned that Enron had no collateral to back up these \ntrades, and this was a major factor in Enron's final spiral into \nbankruptcy.\n  Who is supporting this bill? The New York Mercantile Exchange, the \nChicago Mercantile Exchange, Cambridge Energy Research Associates who \nasked for just this, the American Public Gas Association, the American \nPublic Power Association, Pacific Gas & Electric, Calpine, Mid-America \nEnergy Holding Company, Texas Independent Producers and Royalty \nAssociation,\n\n[[Page S1651]]\n\nthe Consumers Union, and the Consumer Federation of America, all \nbecause they believe the time has come to see there are no trading \nmarkets in secret that do not keep records, and to shine the light of \nday on these trades.\n  Now, who is opposed to the amendment? Some energy companies oppose \nthis bill. One lesson some of these companies seem to have learned from \nthe recent energy crisis was they make more money when they can operate \nwithout any transparency, in secret, without any reporting requirements \nor oversight of any kind, and that cannot continue to exist.\n  I am very much encouraged that not all energy companies want to \noperate this way. As I mentioned, PG, Calpine, Apache, Mid-America \nEnergy, and others support this bill, and many other energy companies \nare sitting on the sidelines waiting to see what may happen.\n  There are still some who fail to recognize the glory days of \noperating in secret are over. Regardless of what happens with this \namendment, I want to go on record saying I will do everything in my \npower to see the energy sector is exposed to the same price \ntransparency and oversight as every other sector of our economy. Make \nno mistake, this debate boils down to the issue of whether energy \ncompanies should be able to operate in continued secrecy.\n  Some of these companies have argued this amendment creates unfair \nreporting and oversight over energy companies. So let us again look at \nwhat this provision would do. It would treat electronic trading \nexchanges like any other exchange since, as I said before, there is \nneither price transparency nor regulatory authority over those \nexchanges where there is not a direct delivery. So with this provision, \nthe same reporting requirements that CFTC requires of the New York \nMercantile Exchange and the Chicago Exchange would now be required of \nelectronic exchanges. This means simply that CFTC would be able to \nassert the same oversight and require the same transparency of \nelectronic exchanges that are already required of nonelectronic \nexchanges.\n  I have a very hard time understanding why this is so burdensome and \nunfair. Additionally, some of these companies have also asserted this \namendment would create unfair burdens on companies engaged in bilateral \ntransactions. Here is what they are complaining about: With our \namendment, any entity engaging in bilateral transactions in energy \ncommodities would have to keep a record of those transactions, and the \nCFTC would have the authority to look for fraud and manipulation.\n  Again, let me repeat, a company engaged in bilateral trading has to \nkeep a record of that transaction, and the CFTC has the authority to \ninvestigate fraud. That is it. It is the same authority that was there \nbefore 2000 and the same standard that traders of all other commodities \nare required to meet.\n  So with all we now know about the energy sector and Enron, I \nchallenge anyone to explain to me why energy companies should continue \nto have a loophole so they can trade in secret, not keep any records, \nand therefore there is no evidence that can be proven as to \nmanipulation of price. The day has come to close that loophole.\n  I note one of the main original cosponsors is in the Chamber and \nwishes to speak to this amendment. I have had the pleasure of working \nwith the Senator from Oregon on the Energy Committee, as I have with \nthe Presiding Officer. The Senator from Oregon has been a leader and \nvery focused on this issue. I want to thank him for his help, and I ask \nthe Chair recognize him.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              American Public Gas Association,\n\n                                       Fairfax, VA, March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Public Gas Association \n     (APGA) is very pleased that you have taken the lead to amend \n     the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA). Your revisions to S. 517, \n     which amends the CEA, brings the trading of energy products, \n     including natural gas spot and forward prices, under the \n     appropriate jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC). As a result, your amendment will reduce \n     the various risks imposed on consumers by a partially \n     unregulated energy trading market.\n       As you know, Enron operated in what was essentially an \n     unregulated environment. While there will be much more to \n     come in the wake of Enron, one thing is perfectly clear \n     today--our federal government has an obligation to make sure \n     that no important trading activities fall between the cracks \n     leaving some energy markets without a federal agency with \n     oversight authority. Your amendment remedies this glaring \n     deficiency.\n       APGA is fully committed to support your effort to reverse \n     the action Congress took just 15 months ago in the \n     Commodities Futures Modernization Act (CFMA). The CFMA \n     amended the CEA by allowing some energy contracts to be \n     traded with no government oversight. We firmly believe that \n     the CFTC must have at its disposal the necessary jurisdiction \n     and authority to protect the operational integrity of energy \n     markets so that (1) transactions are executed fairly, (2) \n     proper disclosures are made to customers, and (3) fraudulent \n     and manipulative practices are not tolerated.\n       In December of 2000, when the CFMA was under consideration \n     in the Senate, APGA submitted a Statement for the Record to \n     the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \n     during a hearing on the ``Status of Natural Gas Markets.'' In \n     the statement, we expressed a concern that the proposed \n     legislation would codify an exemption for energy commodity \n     transactions that would shield those energy transactions from \n     the oversight and review of the CFTC. Enron took advantage of \n     this gap in regulatory oversight. Your amendment will close \n     that gap. Consumers across the country will benefit from your \n     efforts because they are less likely to be victimized by \n     activities that occur in a market where the CFTC exercises \n     oversight.\n       Again, public gas utilities and the hundreds of communities \n     that we serve commend you for your thoughtful and deliberate \n     leadership on this very important issue. While there may be \n     some who will oppose this amendment, one need not look far to \n     see whether the opposition is looking out for the best \n     interests of Wall Street or Main Street. We pledge to work \n     with you in any way we can to pass this much-needed \n     amendment. Please let me know how I can assist you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Cave,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                     Texas Independent Producers &\n\n\n                                   Royalty Owners Association,\n\n                                       Austin, TX., March 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We understand that later today, you \n     will introduce an important measure designed to bring greater \n     transparency to natural gas markets. We believe that improved \n     transparency will reduce price-markups charged in \n     transactions that take place after natural gas leaves the \n     wellhead and before it reaches the burner tip. Thus your \n     measure will benefit both consumers and producers. We support \n     the modified version of S. 1951 that you intend to offer as \n     an amendment to the Senate Energy Bill.\n       We understand that the amendment:\n       (1) will not grant any price control authority under the \n     Federal Power Act or Natural Gas Act;\n       (2) will continue to allow energy commodities (actually all \n     commodities other than agricultural commodities) to be traded \n     on electronic trading facilities that currently qualify as \n     exempt commercial markets, provided that the trading \n     facilities register, meet net capital requirements, file \n     reports, and maintain books and records;\n       (3) will require participants in such markets to maintain \n     books and records; and\n       (4) will apply these requirements to electronic trading \n     facilities which permit execution with multiple parties and \n     non-binding bids and offers, and will require books and \n     records to be kept by participants in facilities that permit \n     bilateral negotiations.\n       TIPRO believes that this measure will tend to improve price \n     transparency in natural gas markets, leading to a more \n     efficient and stable marketplace. The relatively modest \n     requirements outlined above should not unduly reduce \n     liquidity for gas traders. Accordingly, TIPRO endorses your \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Gregory Moredock,\n\n                                             Natural Energy Policy\n     Committee Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                              MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co.,\n\n                                        Omaha, NE., March 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing in support of your \n     effort to ensure that there is transparency and appropriate \n     federal oversight of energy futures trading markets.\n       As I testified before the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee last month, I have long been concerned \n     that the type of exchange run by Enron before its collapse \n     offered opportunities for manipulation. Enron was the largest \n     buyer, the largest seller and the operator of an unregulated \n     exchange. In view of the revelations of the last several \n     months regarding Enron, the unregulated nature of these \n     markets has raised serious concerns regarding the ability of \n     the federal government to ensure that energy trading and \n     futures markets are operating in the interest of the public \n     and market participants.\n       As the Senate addresses this issue, it is important to \n     remember that electric and gas\n\n[[Page S1652]]\n\n     markets as a whole responded to the Enron collapse without \n     disruption, so legislation should not compromise the \n     liquidity of these markets. I applaud your determination to \n     keep your amendment focused on oversight and transparency and \n     am encouraged that you, along with Senators Cantwell and \n     Wyden, have pledged to work with market participants to \n     continue to perfect this proposal as debate on the \n     comprehensive energy bill continues.\n       Ensuring public confidence in the integrity of energy \n     futures markets is a critical component of establishing a \n     modernized regulatory framework for the electric and natural \n     gas industries. I am pleased to support your effort and \n     commend you on your work on this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   David L. Sokol,\n     Chairman and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             PG Corporation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing today in reference \n     to the amendment you will be offering to the Senate Energy \n     bill, containing the substance of legislation you and several \n     of your colleagues introduced earlier to provide regulatory \n     oversight over energy trading markets, as amended.\n       At the outset, we applaud your efforts to ensure public and \n     consumer confidence in the operation and orderly functioning \n     of the energy marketplace. As you know, the industry relies \n     heavily on these markets and products to manage risk for the \n     benefit of consumers of electricity. We thus appreciate your \n     willingness to work with us and other market participants to \n     address areas of interest and concern as the provisions of \n     your amendment have been debated and refined. As presently \n     drafted, we view your amendment as providing an increased \n     level of oversight, while ensuring the continued ability of \n     market participants to utilize these instruments as part of \n     overall risk management strategies. We therefore support your \n     amendment.\n       Thank you for your hard work in this area, and we look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and others on matters \n     of national energy policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Steven L. Kline.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I want to commend Senator Feinstein for \nleading all of us in this critically important effort. It has been a \npleasure to team up with her. She has been the catalyst in this whole \neffort and it is a pleasure to stand with her.\n  I also want to note that Senator Cantwell has been a tremendous voice \nfor consumers in the Pacific Northwest and our country, and I have \nenjoyed teaming up with her as well as Senator Feinstein. I am going to \nbe very brief because I think our colleague from California has laid it \nout very well.\n  Today, as the Senate turns to a number of important amendments that \nare going to relate to the consumer protection issue, I think it is \nimportant to note this is an opportunity to end the Enron exemption. \nFor years, Enron and other energy traders have operated back room \ntrading floors where energy has been bought and sold as a commodity \nwhile the public has been kept in the dark. I think the question that \ncolleagues may be asking is: Had this amendment been law during the \ntime when all of the damage associated with Enron was being \nperpetrated, what would have been the difference? What would have been \ndifferent had the Feinstein-Cantwell-Wyden effort been law at the time?\n  It seems to me there would have been two very significant benefits \nhad this legislation been law. First, I think it would have been less \nlikely that there would have been market manipulation. Certainly, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission is investigating that question. \nThat has not yet been determined. Certainly, conceptually it is much \ntougher to manipulate a market if in fact the transparency and the \nopenness is there that this legislation calls for.\n  Second, had this legislation been law, if in fact there was market \nmanipulation it would be possible to find that out very quickly. As all \nof our colleagues know, as a result of the request from west coast \nSenators, virtually all of us have joined into it. The Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission has written to the west coast Senators saying \nthey are going to investigate whether Enron manipulated our markets, \nbut it will take them several months to conduct this investigation.\n  Had Enron's energy trading been regulated, as called for in this \namendment, we would not have had to wait months to determine if Enron \nmanipulated the market. Information about energy trading operations \nwould have been immediately available to regulators and the public \ninstead of shrouded in secrecy.\n  I think it is important for colleagues to note, first, this amendment \nmakes it less likely that anybody can manipulate a market; and, second, \nif there is that kind of conduct taking place, it would not take months \nto ascertain what went on. One could find it out much more readily \nbecause information would be made available more quickly.\n  Before it collapsed, Enron was the biggest energy trader in the \ncountry, controlling one-quarter of all wholesale energy trades. \nDespite the great impact on energy markets, they were able to hide the \nfacts about the trading operations from public scrutiny by securing \nexemptions from regulation for their energy and derivatives trading.\n  Evidence is emerging that Enron may have secretly used its market \npower to manipulate prices in energy markets. A witness testified \nbefore the Senate Energy Committee that the price of forward contracts \nfor electricity dropped as much as 30 percent after Enron filed for \nbankruptcy, suggesting, according to this witness, Enron was \nartificially inflating prices in western markets.\n  There is a well-regulated system in place for trading pork bellies \nand other commodities to protect the public from market manipulation, \nbut energy, a commodity that we all regard as essential, has been \ncompletely exempt. It seems to me if energy is going to be bought and \nsold as a commodity, the public should at least have the same \nprotections that exist for trading any other commodity. There must be \ntransparency for the markets to work.\n  Let me conclude with one last point, and then I know we are going to \nhear from our colleague from Washington. There has been considerable \ndiscussion as to whether this is somehow granting vast new powers to \nGovernment, and that Government is in some way reacting to what \nhappened in the Enron situation.\n  First of all, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had this \nauthority before. This is not a brand new idea. They had this authority \nand essentially they gave it up. What this bill does is restore \nauthority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to regulate \nenergy the same way it regulates every other commodity.\n  I hope when my colleagues vote on this amendment, they recognize this \nis something that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission used to \nhave. It is authority that was on the books before the agency granted a \nblanket exemption from regulating energy as a commodity. As my \ncolleague from California noted, Congress later went along as part of \nan appropriations rider. But this bill does not give the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission vast new powers nobody has ever heard about, \nand constitute in some way a rush to judgment in reaction to the Enron \nsituation. This is restoring a power the agency should not have given \nup.\n  I compliment my colleague from California. She has been the leader in \nthis effort, as has the Senator from the State of Washington.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, before Senator Cantwell is \nrecognized, I ask unanimous consent Senator Fitzgerald of Illinois be \nadded as an original cosponsor, and that he be called on to speak \ndirectly following Senator Cantwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I, too, rise in support of this very \nimportant legislation, the Feinstein-Cantwell-Wyden energy derivatives \nlegislation. I thank my colleagues for articulating the importance \npassing this amendment.\n  It is no secret that the States of California, Oregon, and Washington \nhave been greatly impacted by the high prices of energy that our \nconsumers are still paying and that have had a very negative impact on \nour economies. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  I applaud Senator Feinstein for her hard work in driving this \nlegislation. Basically, this amendment closes a very dangerous \nloophole, which was actually created by Congress and which\n\n[[Page S1653]]\n\nEnron may have used--I say ``may'' have used--to turn political \ninfluence into profit at the expense of consumers. That is why we must \nact today.\n  The Enron loophole created by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act \nactually allowed Enron Online and other companies like it to sell \nfutures behind closed doors, without the regulatory oversight or the \nsafeguards that this nation's ratepayers deserve.\n  At its core, our amendment allows the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission to treat energy futures like all other regulated commodity \nfutures. It does not give the CFTC any new powers that it does not \nalready have when it is regulating other futures markets. This is a \nvery important point. Our amendment places currently unregulated energy \nfutures trading exchanges, such as Enron Online, under the CFTC's \nregulatory authority.\n  Closing this loophole, as Senator Feinstein said, has the support of \nmany organizations, such as NYMEX, Calpine, and Cambridge Energy \nResearch Associates. But more importantly, consumers are counting on \nus. The Consumers Union, the Consumers Federation, and Public Interest \nResearch Group all support this amendment. They support it for one very \nbasic reason: They support it because it requires open books and \ntransparency for markets that currently operate in secret. It is \nimportant because if there have been patterns of irregular energy \ntrading, we want those patterns to be found and made abundantly clear.\n  What we are saying is that there should not be special rules for \nEnron. If agricultural products, minerals, and even certain other types \nof energy futures transactions are regulated by there CFTC, there is no \ngood reason we should allow online energy trading exchanges to operate \nin the dark.\n  After all we have learned about Enron, shouldn't it be clear to all \nthat exposing its trading activities to the light of day is essential? \nClosing the loopholes will open books and require transparency. It will \ngive us the ability to do important things like compare Enron Online \nprices to competitors, compare forward markets with physical market \npricing, and investigate the books of online traders to search for what \nthose potential irregularities might be.\n  Being able to answer these questions will be incredibly valuable in \nreinforcing the strength and integrity of our energy markets. Why is \nthis so important to the State of Washington? Many people may not \nrealize that Enron continues to hold gigantic long-term contracts with \nutilities throughout the country, at least $900 million worth in my \nhome State. We are now learning that these contracts may have been the \nresult of market manipulation by Enron.\n  In one case alone, the Bonneville Power Administration has long-term \ncontracts with Enron of over $700 million. At today's market price, \nthose contracts would only cost $350 million. That means BPA--and that \nmeans, ultimately, Washington state ratepayers, who have to pay for \nthose energy costs are paying Enron about $350 million more than the \ncurrent market value.\n\n  Contracts like these have translated into unacceptably high utility \nbills for ratepayers throughout the West who deserve relief as soon as \npossible. That is why I have joined my colleagues in urging FERC to \ninvestigate and determine whether Enron manipulated these energy prices \nin the West, and if so, make sure that if these contracts are unjust \nand unreasonable, our consumers are let out of having to pay these high \nprices for the next 3 to 5 years.\n  Until we change this and require open books and transparency from \nEnron Online and businesses similar to it, the public will not be \nprotected in the future for having the same kind of market \nmanipulations, perhaps, happen to them. That is why passing this \nlegislation is so important. We have to close the Enron loophole and \nrestore the faith that the public needs to have in our energy markets--\nthe faith that consumers deserve. They deserve to know that these \nentities are being regulated and are operating in the light of day.\n  I again thank my colleague from California who has worked so \ndiligently on this important legislation, which is a key part of our \nenergy strategy. We need to make sure and consumers need to believe \nthat we are on the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If the Senator from Illinois who is next under the \nunanimous consent agreement will yield for just a second, I thank \nSenator Cantwell. She also is on the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee. She also has been very concerned, very diligent, working \nvery hard at what has been a very difficult onion to peel. I am very \ngrateful for her leadership.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Corzine as an original \ncosponsor. I believe he wants to speak to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I am pleased to rise in support of \nthis amendment by my colleague from California. I support it and \ncongratulate her for introducing it. Illinois, specifically Chicago, is \nhome to some of the largest futures exchanges in the world. Certainly, \nI was very involved in the Commodity Exchange Act Reauthorization a \ncouple of years ago. Since that time, in the wake of the Enron \nbankruptcy, the Enron exemption that allowed Enron Online to operate \nwithout any regulatory oversight has come to light, and it has drawn \nsome criticism.\n  I say at the outset, I think probably Enron Online may not have had \nall that much to do with Enron's bankruptcy. I have also been very \ninvolved in the Enron investigations in the Senate, and as far as I can \ntell, Enron was running what amounts to a gigantic shell game or \npyramid scheme, essentially borrowing money and booking borrowed money \nas income by filtering the borrowings through partnerships. They had \nthe debt parked on the books of the off-the-balance-sheet partnerships \nrather than on their direct books.\n  At the end of the day, when Enron filed bankruptcy, it was because it \nhad several billion dollars in indebtedness coming due that it, Enron, \ncould not pay.\n  I don't know that Enron Online and their energy trading, per se, was \nresponsible for it. I have seen many transactions that Enron engaged in \nthat were simply borrowing money and reporting it as income. We will \nhave to wait for a full autopsy. Nonetheless, I think it is appropriate \nto close the Enron exemption in the Commodities Exchange Act. That is \nwhat this bill does.\n  Right now, in an electronic exchange in which energy contracts are \ntraded, that exchange is exempt from regulation under the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission or by the FERC. FERC only comes in if energy \nis actually delivered, and in most cases energy is not actually \ndelivered. You have contracts traded back and forth and many times an \nactual delivery of the commodity is put off.\n  I have been troubled to some extent by the wholesale exemption that \nis given to online futures exchanges. The exchanges at the Board of \nTrade and the Mercantile Exchange face a great deal of overhead to \ncomply with their regulatory burden. I think that is appropriate. I \nthink sometimes it is unfair to set up an offline exchange and say this \nis an offline exchange because online does not have any regulation. I \nlike to see industries competing on a level playing field. I think that \nis what America is all about. I do not think there should be regulatory \nadvantages given to one side or the other.\n  I do think this would be a protection for consumers, even \nsophisticated principals who may be trading energy contracts on \nelectronic exchanges. I think there would be benefits by having some \nCFTC oversight. There would be greater transparency. It would be easier \nfor prices to be discovered.\n  I think Senator Feinstein's amendment accomplishes a great deal. It \nrepeals the exemptions and exclusions for bilateral derivatives in \nmultilateral markets in energy commodities. All would be again subject \nto direct CFTC oversight. That was the case prior to our \nreauthorization of the Commodities Exchange Act. We would correct that. \nAlso, it ensures that energy dealers in derivatives markets cannot \navoid full price transparency and escape regulatory oversight.\n  Third, the amendment subjects all multilateral markets and bilateral\n\n[[Page S1654]]\n\ndealer markets in energy commodities to registration, transparency, \ndisclosure, and reporting obligations and requires entities running \nonline trading forums to maintain sufficient capital to carry out their \noperations. It seems very reasonable to me.\n  Fourth, parties engaging in bilateral energy transactions must keep \nbooks and records. That does not seem so onerous to me.\n  Fifth, all energy transactions not regulated by FERC would be \nregulated by the CFTC.\n  And sixth, the amendment requires FERC and the CFTC to meet quarterly \nand discuss how energy derivatives markets are functioning and \naffecting energy deliveries. I do think that is reasonable in light of \nthe great runup we saw in energy prices last year, particularly in \nSenators Feinstein and Boxer's great State of California.\n  It is unclear why the price rose so quickly and why then ultimately \nit plummeted again back to reasonable levels. Whether this amendment, \nhad it been law at the time, would have prevented that I do not know. \nBut I think it will promote greater price transparency. I think that \ncan't hurt. I think there is a minimal burden here, and I think it is \nworthy public policy. I compliment my friend from California, and I am \nproud to stand in support of her amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I thank the Chair.\n  I, too, rise to strongly support the amendment the Senator from \nCalifornia is offering to roll back this Enron exemption in the \nderivatives market. Being an old bond trader who operated in the \nderivatives markets for many years, the idea that we do not need basic \nregistration of dealers, we do not need capital adequacy or capital \nrules, that there is no price transparency, whether in over-the-counter \nmarkets or on electronic exchanges, or there are not audit trails that \nare fundamental to any kind of regulation of financial transactions \nanywhere in the world, seems strange to me and offers an opportunity \nfor those who want to take advantage of the lack of transparency and \ncreate patterns of manipulation to easily operate in these markets. It \nseems very strange that we pick a very narrow slice, the energy \nmarkets, to have such a gaping lack of transparency.\n  I have heard people say there is no creativity in markets, that they \nwill not develop, there will not be the liquidity in overseeings. That \nis just flatout not the fact. If you look at the derivatives markets in \nfinancial securities, or financial instruments, you will see some of \nthe deepest, broadest, most liquid markets in the world. As a matter of \nfact, confidence comes when the participants who enter into markets \nwill know where prices are taking place, the price discovery mechanism \nis quite obvious, where there are audit trails, so that if there are \ndifferences of views about whether transactions were actually executed, \nyou can go back and find out where those prices actually took place. \nAnd you know your counterparts have enough capital to be able to stand \nbehind the transactions. And then you have some simple qualifications \nto be a participant in those markets.\n  I think all these are simple, straightforward fundamentals in finance \n101 for anyone who deals with financial transactions, whether it is \nderivative transactions that relate to hog bellies, Treasury bills, or \nstocks, and no different for energy in my mind, and I find it \nincredibly lacking in consistency with our oversight regime which has \nproduced maybe the broadest, deepest markets we have anywhere in the \nworld, in the history of the world, frankly, and I see no reason why we \nshould not have that applying to energy markets just as we do any other \nmarket.\n  On that basis, I strongly support the amendment. I think Senator \nFeinstein is definitely on the right trail to produce markets that will \nprovide consumer protection, protection against price manipulation, and \na greater quality of activity in the underlying energy markets. I think \nthey will be broader and deeper because of it.\n  So I am proud to stand in support of the amendment of the Senator \nfrom California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey for his support. In view of his background, his \nknowledge, and his expertise, I am particularly grateful for that \nsupport. It is one thing to stand here and feel in your gut what is \nright for the consumer, but it is another in the mystical world of \nfinance. His wisdom and his knowledge hopefully will gain additional \nvotes for this amendment. I am very grateful to the Senator. I thank \nhim very much.\n  Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so that I can send an amendment to the desk for \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2990 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 2990 to \n     amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To promote collaboration between the United States and Mexico \n              on research related to energy technologies)\n\n       After section 1413 insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1414. UNITED STATES-MEXICO ENERGY TECHNOLOGY \n                   COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the economic and energy \n     security of the United States and Mexico is furthered through \n     collaboration between the United States and Mexico on \n     research related to energy technologies.\n       (b) Program.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management, shall \n     establish a collaborative research, development, and \n     deployment program to promote energy efficient, \n     environmentally sound economic development along the United \n     States-Mexico border to--\n       (A) mitigate hazardous waste;\n       (B) promote energy efficient materials processing \n     technologies that minimize environmental damage; and\n       (C) protect the public health.\n       (2) Consultation.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management, shall \n     consult with the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable \n     Energy in carrying out paragraph (1)(B).\n       (c) Program Management.--The program under subsection (b) \n     shall be managed by the Department of Energy Carlsbad \n     Environmental Management Field Office.\n       (d) Cost Sharing.--The cost of any project or activity \n     carried out using funds provided under this section shall be \n     shared as provided in section 1403.\n       (e) Technology Transfer.--In carrying out projects and \n     activities under this section to mitigate hazardous waste, \n     the Secretary shall emphasize the transfer of technology \n     developed under the Environmental Management Science Program \n     of the Department of Energy.\n       (f) Intellectual Property.--In carrying out this section, \n     the Secretary shall comply with the requirements of any \n     agreement entered between the United States and Mexico \n     regarding intellectual property protection.\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this section $5,000,000 for \n     fiscal year 2003 and $6,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2004 \n     through 2006, to remain available until expended.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this is an amendment which tries to \naddress some very serious health and energy production issues, \nenvironmental issues, along the 2,000-mile common border that we have \nwith Mexico.\n  There are tire dumps in that region that routinely catch fire and \nwhich have been determined to breed airborne dengue fever, which is a \nmajor health risk that we will face in the next decade.\n  There are brick kilns that use wood and plastic and cause serious \nhealth-related problems in the metropolitan area of Juarez/El Paso. \nThere are serious water contamination issues with regard to ground \nwater along the United States-Mexico border.\n\n[[Page S1655]]\n\n  This amendment, which I am offering on behalf of myself and Senator \nDomenici, is one which directs the transfer of Department of Energy \nenvironmental management technologies to help clean up many of these \nserious and pressing health-related problems along the border.\n  The amendment will develop joint research programs between U.S. and \nMexican universities on technologies to help develop clean materials \nprocessing technologies such as leadless solders for microelectronics \nplants, techniques to control air pollution from border region heavy \nmanufacturing plants, and energy-efficient methods to recover \nnonpotable water for irrigation.\n  This is an amendment that was passed unanimously as S. 397 in the \nlast Congress, the 106th Congress. That was after we had a full markup \nof the legislation in the Energy Committee.\n  It is consistent with the current administration's views on \ndeveloping close ties with Mexico in both the fields of environmental \nsciences and energy production.\n  It is a very good amendment, which I understand I will be given the \nopportunity to explain again tomorrow morning before a vote occurs. It \nis one of the amendments the majority leader has indicated he would \nlike to have a vote on tomorrow morning.\n  So I will not, at this point, belabor the issue but indicate to my \ncolleagues that it has been supported unanimously, on a bipartisan \nbasis, in the prior Congress. It is a good piece of legislation and one \nthat I would very much like to see added to this pending energy bill. I \nhope we will do that tomorrow morning when the issue comes up for a \nvote.\n  Madam President, with that, I once again yield the floor and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2991 To Amendment No. 2917\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Senator Akaka and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment will \nbe set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for Mr. Akaka, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2991 to amendment No. 2917.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To modify the provision requiring an assessment of the \n               dependence of the State of Hawaii on oil)\n\n       Strike section 1702 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1702. ASSESSMENT OF DEPENDENCE OF STATE OF HAWAII ON \n                   OIL.\n\n       (a) Assessment.--The Secretary of Energy shall assess the \n     economic implications of the dependence of the State of \n     Hawaii on oil as the principal source of energy for the \n     State, including--\n       (1) the short- and long-term prospects for crude oil supply \n     disruption and price volatility and potential impacts on the \n     economy of Hawaii;\n       (2) the economic relationship between oil-fired generation \n     of electricity from residual fuel and refined petroleum \n     products consumed for ground, marine, and air transportation;\n       (3) the technical and economic feasibility of increasing \n     the contribution of renewable energy resources for generation \n     of electricity, on an island-by-island basis, including--\n       (A) siting and facility configuration;\n       (B) environmental, operational, and safety considerations;\n       (C) the availability of technology;\n       (D) effects on the utility system, including reliability;\n       (E) infrastructure and transport requirements;\n       (F) community support; and\n       (G) other factors affecting the economic impact of such an \n     increase and any effect on the economic relationship \n     described in paragraph (2);\n       (4) the technical and economic feasibility of using \n     liquefied natural gas to displace residual fuel oil for \n     electric generation, including neighbor island opportunities, \n     and the effect of such displacement on the economic \n     relationship described in paragraph (2), including--\n       (A) the availability of supply;\n       (B) siting and facility configuration for onshore and \n     offshore liquefied natural gas receiving terminals;\n       (C) the factors described in subparagraphs (B) through (F) \n     of paragraph (3); and\n       (D) other economic factors;\n       (5) the technical and economic feasibility of using \n     renewable energy sources (including hydrogen) for ground, \n     marine, and air transportation energy applications to \n     displace the use of refined petroleum products, on an island-\n     by-island basis, and the economic impact of such displacement \n     on the relationship described in paragraph (2); and\n       (6) an island-by-island approach to--\n       (A) the development of hydrogen from renewable resources; \n     and\n       (B) the application of hydrogen to the energy needs of \n     Hawaii.\n       (b) Contracting Authority.--The Secretary may carry out the \n     assessment under subsection (a) directly or, in whole or in \n     part, through 1 or more contracts with qualified public or \n     private entities.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 300 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall prepare, in \n     consultation with agencies of the State of Hawaii and other \n     stakeholders, as appropriate, and submit to Congress, a \n     report detailing the findings, conclusions, and \n     recommendations resulting from the assessment.\n       (d) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment makes technical \ncorrections in section 1702 of the substitute bill that is before us, \nwhich requires the Secretary of Energy to study the economic risk posed \nby the dependence of Hawaii on oil as the State's principal source of \nenergy.\n  The changes in the original text were proposed by the minority. They \nare acceptable to Senator Akaka, who was the original proponent of \nsection 1702. They have been cleared on both sides. So I urge that they \nbe agreed to at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2991) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know there are amendments that have \nbeen laid down and are open for discussion, but I want to take this \nopportunity to give a statement for the record in regard to the energy \ndebate.\n  I will begin by thanking the chairman and our excellent leader, \nSenator Bingaman, for laying down a bill that is a real building block, \na real stepping stone toward the kind of energy policy with which our \nNation could grow and prosper. I thank him for including many of the \nissues I raised with him on behalf of the State of Louisiana and other \npetroleum- and gas-producing States, as well as provisions that Senator \nDomenici, Senator Voinovich, and I have worked on relating to \nelectricity generation, expansion of nuclear energy, and others. He has \nbeen very open to many of the ideas we have suggested. The bill, \nhowever, is only a starting point.\n  I believe we have to build some additional provisions into this \nunderlying bill.\n  To begin with, I am reminded of the words of Thomas Edison. He once \nsaid:\n\n       Opportunity is missed by most people because it comes \n     dressed up in overalls, and it looks like work.\n\n  I think, as we begin this energy debate, that is an appropriate quote \nof which to be mindful. The situation that presents itself here--energy \npolicy--rarely captures the attention of Congress, but at this very \nmoment it really is a wonderful opportunity for us. We have a real \nopportunity--an opportunity to impact our economy and our environmental \nand foreign policy, all through the adoption of an effective and \ncoherent national energy policy. But getting there is going to require \nsome real work and some real compromise.\n  I am concerned that this is an opportunity dressed up like hard work. \nI am\n\n[[Page S1656]]\n\nhoping that the Senate is appropriately dressed. I am not quite sure. I \nknow many of us have worked diligently, and, hopefully, with leadership \non both sides and with strong leadership from the President, we can \nactually get a bill that makes sense for where our Nation is today--\nbut, more importantly, where we need to be in the future.\n  The American people are ready for a different kind of energy policy. \nA recent poll found that three-fourths of the public believes that if \nwe don't address our energy needs now, in 20 years Americans will not \nbe able to live their lives in the way they choose. I think the \nAmerican people, even prior to September 11, were very mindful of this \nfragile situation in which we find ourselves. But now, post-September \n11, I know the people in my State are very concerned about our \noverdependence on foreign oil and energy sources. Of course, the \nAmerican people are right. They recognize our vulnerability. This is \nthe moment, and we must seize it.\n  I thank the chair of our committee again for his excellent work, and \nI thank Senator Daschle for bringing this bill to the floor for our \nconsideration.\n  Many, including myself, have stated really inaccurately before that \nwe don't have a national energy policy. Unfortunately, we do have one. \nThe policy, whether expressed or implied, though, is perfectly clear. \nThat policy, unfortunately, is that this Nation is to try to import as \nmuch cheap oil as possible. It doesn't seem to us that the sources of \nthis imported oil matter much. All other national policies, such as \nhuman rights, conservation, and geopolitics, have seemingly taken a \nback seat to this overriding policy.\n\n  Let's look at the nations we are willing to deal with in order to \nsecure cheap oil. The United States imports nearly 600,000 barrels of \noil a day from Iraq. This is a country that we have been bombing an \naverage of once a week. Can you imagine what the public would say if we \nwere buying steel from Germany while undertaking the D-Day invasion? \nYet that is the same kind of corrupting power that this shortsighted \npolicy has on other interests.\n  I believe it is time--and I know many of my colleagues join me in \nsaying this--for our country to forge a new ``declaration of \nindependence.'' About 226 years ago, we decided the people of our \nNation needed to control their own destiny politically and \neconomically. We need to do so again today. In order to have that \ncontrol, we must have energy independence. While we will never achieve \nthat 100 percent, we have to get much closer to that goal than we are \ntoday. Getting there is going to be tough, but that is what this debate \nis about. It is what it should be about; it is what the American people \nwant this debate to be about.\n  While we are achieving that end, it may require efforts equal to the \nManhattan project, or the Apollo project, but I believe it is within \nour grasp. Again, with strong Presidential leadership, with a \nbipartisan group of leaders on this floor and in the House, and with \nthe support of the American people, I believe we are up to the \nchallenge.\n  Our new declaration must center around three principles. I will start \nwith the principle that I truly believe is the most important, and that \nis that this country must produce more energy. We must produce cleaner \nfossil fuels; more nuclear power generation; and, yes, more oil and gas \nby small and independent companies; and, as Senator Bingaman has \nadvocated, significant new investments for alternative and renewable \nfuels. The occupant of the chair has advocated using biomass and other \nagriculturally-based projects.\n  There are tremendous incentives in this bill for us to expand our \nsupply of energy so that we are not held hostage or captive by only one \nfuel supply. We have an ample and a varied supply, but that supply has \nto be increased, not decreased and diminished.\n  Secondly, we will conserve energy wherever possible, particularly in \ntransportation and the industrial sector, and do it in a way that \nenhances our chances of creating jobs in America, not driving them away \nto other nations. We have to be more committed to a balance, of \nconserving our natural resources, conserving our clean environment, and \nmaking our environment even cleaner. But I strongly believe we have to \nfocus as intently on conserving and expanding jobs here--in my State of \nLouisiana, in your State, Mr. President, and in all of our States--\nbecause if we are not careful, changes that we make can drive good, \nhigh-paying jobs away from our Nation to other nations. It is not fair \nto our workers, and it is not fair to our communities when there are \ngood alternatives.\n  The principle of increased energy production really hearkens back to \na principle deeply ingrained in our American culture; namely--and I \nremember studying this in my earliest grades--the dictum of Captain \nJohn Smith: ``He who works eats; he who doesn't work doesn't eat.'' The \nJamestown colony would not have survived without following that simple, \nclear and, in some ways, profound statement. We cannot allow mindless \nenergy consumption on one hand while allowing a ``not in my backyard,'' \nattitude toward energy production. We must restore balance to the \nequation. Louisiana makes more than its fair share of a contribution \nthrough oil and natural gas production.\n  We also house the Nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. However, \nwhile every State should be free to determine how to make its \ncontribution--solar energy perhaps from New Mexico, hydroelectric power \nfrom Washington, clean coal plants from West Virginia--every State \nshould be free to make its choices, but every State must make a \ncontribution.\n  If we are consuming 26 percent of the world's oil supply but \nproducing only a fraction, we clearly are eating without working. \nSixty-five percent of this Nation's energy supply comes from oil and \ngas. Yet States continue to express a reluctance to contribute their \nnatural resources to our common needs. These natural resources belong \nto all the people of our Nation. Yet we see a policy permitting repeal \nof laws that were strict about using natural resources for our common \nneed, which is real and I would say urgent.\n  It is important to contrast this with our allies in Europe who have a \nreputation for being more environmentally sensitive. While we have \nmoratoria on drilling for oil and gas all over this Nation, from the \nwest coast to the east coast, and in parts of the Gulf of Mexico, \nFrance has high-sulfur petroleum production in Paris--in Paris; not in \nthe countryside but in Paris. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and \nNorway all permit offshore oil and gas drilling in their fishing \ngrounds, some of the finest fishing grounds in the world. Yet there is \na tremendous amount of environmentally sensitive, very strictly \nregulated production operating off those shores.\n  Such actions would set our environmental community in this Nation in \na frenzy. In Europe, however, they have managed to accept a fundamental \nreality: If you need oil and gas, you must produce it. What is more, \nevery possibility needs to be on the table. If you need more power from \nnuclear, you have to build the nuclear powerplants to produce it. You \ncannot just wish it so and turn on the lights.\n  Our allies have recognized this, but in this country we have not \nquite grasped this reality. We are seeing a trend toward creating \nsomething like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, but on a statewide scale, with \nsome States getting to live in the clouds with an unspoiled \nenvironment, consuming to their heart's desire, while other States must \nlive on Earth and bear the brunt of this carefree lifestyle.\n  This growing dichotomy must stop. We must have more domestic \nproduction to balance out our consumption. It is just as simple as \nthat.\n  The second principle of our declaration, of course, is conservation. \nWe must consume less. Everyone knows the American economy is the \nlargest consumer of energy in the world.\n  Everyone also understands that we have the largest gross domestic \nproduct in the world. While we produce more goods than any other people \non Earth and in the history of the world, the ratio between how much we \nproduce to how much energy we use to produce it is the worst in the \nworld. In other words, we are hugely inefficient when it comes to the \nuse of energy. This is not only an environmental dilemma, but it is an \neconomic dilemma as well.\n  We have squeezed efficiency out of our American workers through \ngreater productivity gains, longer work hours, a more flexible and \nskilled workforce,\n\n[[Page S1657]]\n\nand particularly new technologies. However, we have not squeezed enough \nefficiency out of our power distribution networks to make U.S. \nmanufacturing cheaper and, as a result, more competitive.\n  I congratulate Senator Bingaman, again, for making this a focus of \nthis legislation. It is truly one of the best pieces of this \nlegislation, and, if we can build on this piece, it will be a real step \nin the right direction. I look forward to working with him in this \ndebate. Already we have accepted several amendments toward this end \nthat have strengthened this position so that we can make it even \nstronger.\n\n  We must, as I said in the first principle, we must be committed to \nrobust domestic production. Then we also have to be committed to real \nefficiencies in our electric market, on which Senator Voinovich and \nothers have worked so diligently.\n  Finally, we must institute the third principle, and that is, if you \nare taking on the burden of production, whether it is in Louisiana, \nwhich produces oil and gas and other energies for this Nation, or other \nStates, our Nation should compensate those regions fairly.\n  Louisiana is the second-highest energy-producing State in the \ncountry. We have 16 percent of the total refining capacity, and we \nsupply about 25 percent of all domestic petroleum, half of the imported \nliquefied natural gas, and about 13 percent of the crude oil shipped \ninto the United States comes through Louisiana. Yet this contribution, \nwhile my State is proud of it, has not come without cost to our coast, \nto our environment, and our infrastructure.\n  In the past 50 years, Louisiana has lost over 1,000 square miles of \nits coast. Let me be clear, this loss is not 100 percent directly \nrelated to this activity. This activity has been a portion of this \nloss. There have been many other factors. But still the facts remain \nthat because of the drainage and the shipping we provide for the Nation \nthrough the Mississippi River and the Delta so that all the Great \nPlains States and our great interior can ship products out and receive \nproducts, as well as the production taking place in this fragile \nenvironment, it has had some environmental consequences.\n  This loss represents 80 percent of all wetlands loss within the \nUnited States. While my State suffers these losses, we contribute to \nthe Federal Treasury anywhere from $2 billion to $4 billion a year, \njust through oil and gas production. This figure does not take into \naccount the taxes and wealth and prosperity generated for the whole \nNation because of the shipping and the commerce allowed by our rivers.\n  In fact, since the year I was born, 1955, our State and other coastal \nStates have contributed $120 billion to the Federal Treasury, and \nLouisiana has received nothing of this $120 billion directly. We have \nreceived less than 1 percent of the money that has come into the \nTreasury from offshore oil and gas drilling and yet bear most of the \ncost of the infrastructure required.\n  Louisiana's coastal wetlands contribute 28 percent to the total \nvolume of U.S. fisheries. Our coastal wetlands are being lost at a rate \nof one football field every 15 minutes. Let me restate that: One \nfootball field every 15 minutes.\n  In short, we should sometimes ask ourselves: Why are we doing this? \nWhy don't others do it? We have developed a system of retrieving our \nnatural resources. In the old days, we did not do a very good job of \nit, but in these days of new horizontal drilling, directional drilling, \nwith new technologies, new rules and regulations, some local and some \nnational, we have learned to pool our natural resources for the benefit \nof our State and our Nation and minimize that environmental footprint.\n  We want to continue to do that, but we cannot continue under the \npresent regime or set of circumstances unless we are more fairly \ncompensated.\n  Interior States that produce their natural resources, whether it is \nto contribute to the energy sector or other sectors, receive 50 percent \nof their royalties in revenues. Two years ago the State of Wyoming, \nthrough severance taxes that levied from their mining operations, kept \n$200 million and spent it as they would to reinvest in their State and \nthe local communities that supported that mining operation.\n  Yet Louisiana and the Gulf Coast States that bear a tremendous \nresponsibility for the production now of oil and gas do not share a \npenny of those offshore revenues, and yet serve as a platform for that \nproduction.\n  The helicopters cannot get into the central gulf unless they take off \nfrom somewhere. The pipes, the equipment, the computers, the people, \nthe technology are launched from the coast of Texas or Louisiana or \nMississippi or Alabama.\n  I am going to be laying down amendments--there is already a provision \nin this bill, thanks to Senator Bingaman--that would authorize for the \nvery first time a coastal impact assistance provision that will give \nLouisiana and the Gulf Coast States a share of these revenues. It is an \nauthorization. I believe we need a direct appropriation, and I will be \nworking to strengthen that provision. But for the first time, the \nSenate, I hope, will accept this responsibility and fashion part of our \noverriding energy principle or declaration of independence that if you \nare going to produce, you should be rewarded for that production. \nAgain, produce what you will, produce what you can, produce what you \nchoose, but whatever you do, you should be rewarded or compensated for \nthat production.\n  Frankly, for those States that refuse to produce and only want to \nconsume, then I think we should think very strongly about that \nsituation and what we might do to encourage those States to do more to \nmeet their obligation. It did not work 226 years ago, and that kind of \nattitude is not going to work today. So for producing States, I believe \nthis is a very strong policy.\n  I look forward to this debate. It is a rare moment in our history. I \nhope there is enough pressure that can be brought to bear to move us to \nmake the kind of compromises necessary. It is time for us to declare \nour independence. We will not get there 100 percent, but we need to get \nmuch closer to independence than we are today because not only is our \neconomy at stake, our environment is as well. The security of our \nNation rests on how successful we will be in getting more independent.\n  If another tragedy strikes or, shall I say, when another tragedy \nstrikes, with the new and emerging threats confronting our Nation, we \ncan make wise decisions based on our principles, based on America's \neconomic interests, based on what is right in terms of leading the \nNation, and not be held hostage because we have simply not learned how \nto either live within our means so we can have the kind of independence \nnecessary to make wise decisions for ourselves as we help to lead this \nworld.\n  This is a very important debate. I have really appreciated working \nagain with Senator Domenici. He has almost singlehandedly reengaged us \nin understanding the importance of nuclear energy for our Nation--it is \n20 percent of the source today--and rallied many different entities to \nrealize we have safer nuclear reactors. The new technologies are quite \npromising, with the production of hydrogen as well as the traditional \nfuels and what that might mean to help us reach that independence.\n  Senator Voinovich and I will continue to work on building an electric \ngrid for this Nation much like our transportation grid, our interstate \nsystem. No one would argue that without the interstate system our \neconomy could not grow. We could not move our products. We could not \nbuild our businesses. We could not have the international trade that is \nnow the lifeblood of our Nation. That is the kind of electricity system \nthat we need to create.\n  It was not created that way initially. It was all State developed, \nregionally developed, and we have to now open that up so our \nelectricity and power can get on onramps, off offramps, with limited \nspeed bumps, and move throughout this Nation to create the kind of \nconservation and efficiency our businesses need to compete in the \nworld.\n  As I said, there are many goals and objectives. I have laid out some \nof these principles, and I look forward to advocating for the people of \nmy State and for many States that are producing oil and gas to make \nsure we are justly compensated so we can take those just compensations \nand reinvest for our children and for our grandchildren.\n  One day these oil and gas wells are going dry up. We wanted to make \nsure we were good stewards of the taxes\n\n[[Page S1658]]\n\nthat were levied on those oil and gas wells. Therefore, we have laid \ndown new investments for cleaner technologies, for new opportunities \nfor Louisiana and for our Nation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am glad to have the opportunity today \nto speak on the critical issue of energy security. In order to secure \nour country's economic and national security, we need to have a \nbalanced energy plan that protects the environment, supports the needs \nof our growing economy, and reduces our dependence on foreign sources \nof energy.\n  Every man, woman, and child in the United States is a stakeholder \nwhen it comes to developing a responsible, balanced, stable, long-term \nenergy policy.\n  When natural gas prices soared last winter, low-income families and \nthe elderly were the hardest hit. Not too long ago, $2-per-gallon gas \ntook a great toll on our economy. Trucking companies went bankrupt, \nsmall businesses and factories were forced to lay off workers, and \nfarmers suffered a devastating blow of spiked input costs.\n  We found ourselves, after 8 years of inaction by the Clinton \nadministration, without a comprehensive energy policy. I questioned \nofficials from the Clinton administration and encouraged them to \nprovide to Congress a plan to deal with the rising cost of energy. I \neven authored an amendment to require them to compile a report \ndetailing their plan to address the energy shortage. I never received \nsuch a plan.\n  I was pleased that President Bush, soon after taking office, pledged \nto make the energy security of our country one of his highest \npriorities.\n  It is unfortunate that since the release of the President's National \nEnergy Policy report last year, it took over 10 months for the Senate \nto begin this debate. Even more troubling is the process by which this \nbill was put together. In October, the majority leader and the chairman \nof the Energy Committees chose to remove this bill from further \nconsideration by the committee, and instead put together this bill \nwithout the input of the minority members of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, and that is also unfortunate.\n  The events of September 11 have made very clear to Americans how \nimportant it is to enhance our energy independence. We can longer \nafford to allow our dangerous reliance on foreign sources of oil to \ncontinue.\n  It is time to get serious about implementing energy efficiency and \nconservation efforts, investing in alternative, renewable fuels and \nimproving domestic production of traditional resources.\n  I support a comprehensive energy policy consisting of conservation \nefforts, development of renewable and alternative energy resources, and \ndomestic production of traditional sources of energy.\n  As my colleagues well know, I have long been a supporter of \nalternative and renewable sources of energy as a way of protecting our \nenvironment and increasing our energy independence.\n  In 1992, I authored legislation to provide the first-ever tax \nincentive for wind energy production. In 1997, I led the successful \neffort to extend for 10 years the tax credit for corn-based ethanol.\n  The energy bill we are currently debating includes a number of \nprovisions regarding conservation and renewable energy development. For \nexample, included in this legislation is a renewable fuels provision \nwhich requires a small percentage of our Nation's fuel supply to be \nprovided by renewable fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel.\n  I strongly support the production of renewable domestic fuels, \nparticularly ethanol and biodiesel. As domestic, renewable sources of \nenergy, ethanol and biodiesel can increase fuel supplies, reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil, and increase our national and economic \nsecurity.\n  I thank the majority leader and Chairman Bingaman for including this \nrenewable fuels standard, which is very similar to the standard that \nthe Senate Energy Committee Republicans supported early last fall.\n  The renewable fuels standard, supported by a broad coalition, is good \nfor America's farmers, good for the environment, good for consumers, \nand good for national security.\n  However, while this bill addresses conservation efforts and \nalternative energy, it falls well short on domestic energy development \nof traditional sources. Critical provisions to support new development \nof nuclear energy and domestic oil and gas exploration and production \nwere unfortunately left out of the package.\n  At a time when the United States is dependent on foreign countries \nfor over 58 percent of our oil needs, this legislation does little to \nsupport development of resources on our own land. We currently import \nmore than 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Yet \nthis bill remains silent on the development of just 2,000 acres of land \nin Alaska that could supply the equivalent of the oil we import from \nSaudi Arabia for 30 years.\n  We must do more to develop, in an environmentally sensitive way, the \nresources that God gave us. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure that the bill before the Senate does more to \nprotect our national security, and reduce our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  I also look forward to debate on an amendment that I plan to offer \nwith Senator Baucus. As ranking member of the Finance Committee, I have \nhad the opportunity to work with Chairman Baucus to develop an energy-\nrelated tax amendment.\n  Unlike the underlying bill, this amendment strikes a good balance \nbetween conventional energy sources, alternative and renewable energy, \nand conservation.\n  Among other things, it includes provisions for the development of \nrenewable sources of energy like wind and biomass, incentives for \nenergy efficient appliances and homes, and incentives for the \nproduction of non-conventional sources of traditional oil and gas.\n  I believe the Finance Committee did a good job to address our \nnation's energy security in a balanced and comprehensive way, and I \nlook forward to the Senate's consideration of the energy-related tax \npackage.\n  In conclusion, I am please that the Senate has finally begun to \naddress an issue with such a direct impact on our national and economic \nsecurity.\n  For the sake of our children and our grandchildren, we must implement \nconservation efforts, invest in alternative and renewable energy, and \nimprove development and production of domestic oil and natural gas \nresources. I hope that during this process we can develop a bill that \nis truly comprehensive.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act, which passed the House \nearlier today by an overwhelming vote. I am so pleased that it appears \nwe are on the verge of finally passing a very balanced, reasonable, and \nbipartisan bill to keep our economy on the road to recovery.\n  It has been a long struggle, back and forth, between the House and \nthe Senate and between the two parties, and now it is great to see us \nall coming together on a consensus bill.\n\n[[Page S1659]]\n\n  I thank the House leadership, and in particular Chairman Bill Thomas \nfor all the work he has done in putting together this excellent \nlegislation.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill includes two provisions about \nwhich I care a great deal.\n  The first is the extension of unemployment compensation for displaced \nworkers for an additional 13 weeks. Last October, I introduced the \nfirst bipartisan bill to extend unemployment benefits for workers who \nhad exhausted their regular State benefits and yet still have been \nunable to find new work or to be rehired because of the weak economy. \nThese workers need our help.\n  We know that in January alone some 370,000 unemployed workers \nexhausted their benefits, up 63 percent from the year before. The \nsituation is similar in Maine. We experienced a large increase in the \nnumber of unemployed workers who have been unable to find new work and \nhave exhausted their normal 26 weeks of State unemployment benefits.\n\n  This extension could help some 3 million unemployed workers, many of \nwhom lost their jobs either as a direct or indirect result of September \n11 or have been affected by the recession that our country just now \nseems to be on the verge of pulling out of.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been very concerned about the large \nnumber of unemployed Americans living in her State which has \nexperienced one of the higher jumps in unemployment insurance. I know \nthis is a provision she has been a strong advocate for as well.\n  The second provision on which I want to comment tonight is one that \nis very near and dear to me. It is a provision I have worked on for the \npast 3 years, originally with Senators Coverdell and Kyl, and more \nrecently with Senators Warner and Landrieu.\n  Just Tuesday, President Bush spoke about the need to support our \nelementary and secondary education teachers, to help them bring out the \nbest in their students, our children. Now we are close to passing \nanother milestone in our journey toward the goal of supporting our \nteachers.\n  The provision to which I am referring is known as the teacher tax \nprovision. It is a provision that has been included in the economic \nrecovery package that would establish an above-the-line deduction of up \nto $250 to compensate teachers for a small part of what they invest in \nour children.\n  This tax deduction would be available to teachers who dip deep into \ntheir own pocket in order to buy supplies, materials, or books for \ntheir classrooms. This above-the-line deduction would be available for \nteachers, teacher's aides, principals, and counselors to help reimburse \nthem in just a small way for the books, supplies, and equipment they \npurchase for their students.\n  I notice the Senator from Iowa is in the Chamber. He has been very \nhelpful with this provision as well. I thank him, too.\n  Just last year, we passed landmark legislation reauthorizing the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. A principal goal of this bill \nis to promote teacher excellence. We know that other than involved \nparents, the most important predictor of a student's success is a \nquality teacher.\n  I have visited close to 100 schools in the State of Maine, and I have \nseen firsthand how dedicated our teachers are. They deserve our \nsupport. This is a way we can recognize the selfless efforts of our \nteachers and the financial sacrifices they make in entering the field \nof teaching and also in making purchases to improve the classrooms \nwhere they teach.\n  According to a study by the National Education Association, the \naverage classroom teacher spends more than $400 a year out of his or \nher own pocket in order to buy supplies or materials or books for the \nclassroom. This sacrifice is typical of the dedication of America's \nteachers to their students.\n\n  So often teachers in Maine and throughout the country spend their own \nmoney to better the classroom experiences of their students. Let me \ncite an example. I have spoken to dozens of teachers who have told me \nabout their efforts to improve the quality of their teaching by giving \ntheir students access to supplies and other materials they would not \notherwise have.\n  One example is Idella Harter. She is president of the Maine Education \nAssociation. One year, Idella saved all of her receipts from the \npurchases of classroom materials. She started adding up the receipts \nand was startled to discover she had spent over $1,000 of her own money \nto enrich the educational experience of her students. She told me she \ndecided after she got to $1,000, she had better stop counting.\n  The relief our Tax Code now provides to our teachers is simply not \nsufficient because most teachers do not itemize so they do not get the \nbenefit of the tax deduction for the supplies for their classroom. By \nchanging the system so that we now have an above-the-line tax \ndeduction, we will help many more teachers. By allowing them to take an \nabove-the-line deduction for classroom expenses, this provision takes a \nfair, progressive approach that will provide just a bit of thanks and a \nlittle bit of incentive and financial relief to our schoolteachers. It \nwill also encourage additional spending on classroom supplies.\n  The teacher tax provision of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance \nAct helps teachers to go that extra mile for their students. We have \nall seen them. We know how dedicated they are. We know the difference \nthey have made in our own lives. As President Bush has eloquently \nnoted, teachers sometimes lead with their hearts and pay with their \nwallets. This provision would reimburse educators for a small part of \nwhat they invest in our children's future.\n  I hope we will clear this bill very shortly and pass it either \ntonight or first thing tomorrow morning. I hope all of my colleagues \nwill join in a strong vote for this important legislation.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for allowing me to comment on these two \nimportant provisions. I am delighted to see two of my top legislative \npriorities on the verge of being signed into law.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1659-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1659-S1671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             JOB CREATION AND WORKER ASSISTANCE ACT OF 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this unanimous consent is required in \norder for us to finish our work on the economic stimulus package that \nwas just sent to us this afternoon from the House. Senator Lott and I \nhave discussed this matter throughout the day. As I said, I had an \nearlier conversation with the distinguished ranking member of the \nFinance Committee, as well as the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand we are now in a position to proceed to a vote on the stimulus \npackage tomorrow morning.\n  We haven't set a time, but I expect the votes will be taken at \napproximately 9:30. So there will be two votes at 9:30--one on the \nunanimous consent that we have just now agreed to, the so-called \neconomic stimulus unemployment insurance extension legislation, and one \non the McCain amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues for their participation and cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I have worked closely with Senator \nCollins for some time now on legislation to provide much needed tax \nrelief for our educators. Tonight, I am pleased to report that the \nSenate should soon pass H.R. 3090, the Job Creation and Worker \nAssistance Act of 2002, as previously passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. With passage of this legislation, Senator Collins and \nI will have finally achieved our shared goal of providing much needed \ntax relief for our Nation's teachers.\n  The Collins/Warner provision that is in this legislation, was crafted \nby Senator Collins and myself after months of consultations with \nSenator Grassley, Senator Baucus, Senator Allen, and House Ways and \nMeans Chairman Thomas.\n  Simply put, the provision provides a $250 above the line deduction \nfor educators who incur out of pocket expenses for supplies they bring \ninto the classroom to better the education of their students. The \nNational Education Association played a key role and its many members \nshould look with pride and satisfaction on their constructive advice to \nthe Congress. The President of the Virginia Education Association, Jean \nBankos also helped lead this superb effort. Our teachers in this \ncountry are overworked, underpaid, and all too often, under-\nappreciated. In addition to these factors, our teachers expend \nsignificant money out of their own pocket to better the education of \nour children. Most typically, our teachers are spending significant \namounts of money out of their own pocket on classroom expenses--such as \nbooks, supplies, pens, paper, and computer equipment. These out of \npocket costs place lasting financial burdens on our teachers. This is \none reason our teachers are leaving the profession. Little wonder that \nour country is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  Estimates are that 2.4 million new teachers will be needed by 2009 \nbecause of teacher attrition, teacher retirement and increased student \nenrollment. While the primary responsibility rests with the states, I \nbelieve the Federal Government can and should play a\n\n[[Page S1671]]\n\nrole in helping to alleviate the Nation's teaching shortage. On a \nfederal level, we can encourage individuals to enter the teaching \nprofession and remain in the profession by providing tax relief to \nteachers for the costs that they incur as part of the profession.\n  Madam President, our teachers have made a personal commitment to \neducate the next generation and to strengthen America. While many \npeople spend their lives building careers, our teachers spend their \ncareers building lives. The Teacher Tax Relief provisions in this bill \ngo a long way towards providing our teachers with the recognition they \ndeserve by providing teachers with important and much needed tax \nrelief.\n  I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with Senator Collins \nand so many others to eventually make our goal a reality.\n  I commend the leadership of the majority and the minority for their \nefforts. I have long supported the concept of having the stimulus \npackage. While it may not be what each of us wanted, it is essential, \nparticularly the unemployment provisions and the provisions about \nteachers, with which I have long been associated. I thank the \nleadership.\n  Madam President, I commend the President of the United States for his \ncommitment, along with his several Cabinet officers who have fought so \nstrongly for passage of a stimulus package. The American economy is, I \nbelieve, showing some signs of recovery, but I believe that this is an \nadditional step to shore up the confidence of the people of this \ncountry in the economy.\n  Within the stimulus package we will vote on tomorrow are provisions \nthat I worked on with Senator Collins and others for some time that \nrelate to teachers. In my visits to educational institutions throughout \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia, I have often learned--inadvertently, not \nbecause teachers come up to me and tell me about it, because they are \nrather modest--but, in fact, so many of our teachers, particularly \nthose in the lower grades and those in schools which, for whatever \nreason, might not be as well financed as other institutions in our \nState, have taken from their own pockets, funds to buy school supplies \nwhich are needed to help their particular students in their classroom \nperform their educational responsibilities. Sometimes it is paper. \nSometimes it is crayons, occasionally books. I find this extraordinary. \nAs I say, they have not come to me and asked: Oh, we want this, we want \nthat. They are very humble about it.\n\n  Senator Collins and I, and my colleague, Senator Allen, who has been \nvery active in the entire area of education with me--I happen to serve \non the committee for education in the Senate--but we have as a team, \ntogether with other Senators, have been working on this concept for \nsome time.\n  The National Education Association took a pivotal role in seeing that \nthis legislation was incorporated in the House bill. Now at long last, \nwe do have a measure of success, and it is owed to the teachers and the \nNational Education Association and other colleagues here who have \nworked on it with me.\n  I am delighted over the whole prospect of this being passed. It is \nonly a $250 above the line deduction. But at long last teachers can \npoint to something--``this is our's; we helped make it happen, and we \nare proud of it.''\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1671-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE VIRGINIA GARCIA MEMORIAL HEALTH CENTER\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, today I rise today to give \ntribute to some of the health care heroes in my home State of Oregon. \nThey are the hard-working people who staff the Virginia Garcia Memorial \nHealth Center in Cornelius, OR.\n  Virginia Garcia was a 6-year-old girl who died from a treatable \ninfection in the 1970s. She died, not because she lacked health care, \nbut because no one spoke to her family in the only language they knew--\nSpanish.\n  Access to health care involves more than insurance. Barriers to \naccess continue to exist even when financial problems to health care \nare removed. Disparities in health care and health outcomes reflect \nthese barriers.\n  For example, Latinos are twice as likely as White Americans to have \ndiabetes, and twice as likely to have cervical cancer. They also trail \nother ethnic groups in childhood immunizations and health insurance \ncoverage.\n  The Virginia Garcia Clinic does a wonderful job at bridging the large \ngap between access to coverage and access to care. The clinic serves \nnearly 8,000 patients a year, 80 percent of whom are Spanish speaking, \nand 90 percent of whom are below the poverty level. Patients in the \nclinic pay for their services on a sliding scale, sometimes as low as \n$5 per visit.\n  Access to high quality, affordable, and culturally accessible care \nhas saved many lives, and improved the quality of lives of many others. \nI have two true stories to relate to you today, though I really don't \nneed to use their names, because they represent thousands of people \nacross my home State. I will refer to them just as people in need of \nhealth care.\n  One woman who has benefitted from the good works of the Virginia \nGarcia Clinic came to the clinic after moving to the U.S. from Mexico. \nShe had suffered from breast cancer, and underwent a mastectomy and a \nlong, expensive treatment of chemotherapy that had bankrupted her \nfamily. To pay for this treatment, they lost their home.\n  She turned to the Virginia Garcia Health Center for help. She needed \nvery expensive medication, and the clinic managed to provide it to her. \nTo make matters worse, she also had diabetes and other complicated \nhealth problems. Yet the Virginia Garcia Clinic manages her care and \narranges for the specialty care that she requires. Without a safety net \nclinic such as the Virginia Garcia Clinic, she would very likely not \nget the care she needs to stay healthy for her children and family.\n  The staff at the clinic have also told me about a farm worker who \ncame to the Virginia Garcia Clinic for an urgent care visit about a \nrash on his arm. During the exam, the nurse practitioner asked about a \nlump she noticed on his neck. He hadn't been concerned about it, but \nthe staff at the Virginia Garcia Clinic persisted until he agreed to \nhave a biopsy. The lump turned out to be lymphoma, so the Virginia \nGarcia Clinic arranged for his chemotherapy at the Oregon Health and \nSciences University, where he was treated successfully.\n  Without a migrant community health center such as Virginia Garcia to \nprovide outreach, the outcome of this story would likely not have been \nso positive.\n  Spending time at the Virginia Garcia Clinic, I have met with people \nwith stories such as these and whose lives would have changed for the \nworse without the efforts of the hard-working and dedicated staff.\n  Truly, these people, these staff workers are health care heroes, and \nwe desperately need them in our quest to ensure that every person in \nthis country has access to health care.\n  So today, I salute the work and the workers of the Virginia Garcia \nClinic, true heroes in the State of Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1671-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1671-S1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF SERGEANT PHILIP SVITAK\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

These soldiers died valiantly protecting the rights, \nideals, values, and way of life that Americans enjoy.\n  Sgt. Philip Svitak, a member of the Second Battalion, 160th Special \nOperations Aviation Regiment, was born in Lincoln and raised in \nFremont. He graduated from Fremont High School in 1989 and entered the \nArmy where he served in the Gulf War.\n  Sgt. Svitak's parents have said that growing up, he dreamed of a \ncareer with the military service. His favorite gifts would be colored \nthe familiar green olive drab. But he also enjoyed\n\n[[Page S1672]]\n\nfixing things, hunting, and skateboarding. He loved his wife, Laura, \nand their two young sons, Nolan and Ethan. Before departing for \nAfghanistan, he told his family that ``the terrorists have to be \nstopped.'' Philip has made the ultimate contribution.\n  Those who knew Sgt. Svitak will remember him as a levelheaded and \ncaring friend and father. Those of us who did not, will remember him as \nwell, as a brave and dedicated soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor a forever grateful nation.\n  We thank Sgt. Svitak for his service and his sacrifices. Our thoughts \nand prayers are with his family and the families of other servicemen \nand women as they endure their loss of their loved ones who have been \nkilled defending our freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1672-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new \ncategories to current hate crimes legislation sending a signal that \nviolence of any kind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in September \n1997 in Tulsa, OK. Two gay men were severely beaten after leaving a \nbar. After being arrested, the assailants told police they were ``only \nrolling a couple of fags.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1672-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF JOE SCHMITZ\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I believe that the \nDepartment of Defense Inspector General position is among the most \nimportant in the Department, because the IG office is responsible for \nensuring accountability and efficiency, and therefore is the heart of \nintegrity in the Pentagon.\n  There have been numerous scandals in the IG office in the recent \npast, which has been rudderless, without a confirmed nominee for 3 \nyears. With the IG office in disarray, there is the impression left \nthat the Department is without proper and necessary oversight. I am \nalso told that the IG office has been headless for some 10 years over \nthe past couple of decades--which is a disgrace. Without strong \nleadership, direction and motivation, no office can function \nefficiently and effectively.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld needs an Inspector General. We are, after all, at \nwar. Joe Schmitz was the choice of the Secretary of Defense and the \nchoice of President Bush for this important post. Mr. Schmitz is an \nindividual with a strong background for the job, and with impeccable \npersonal and professional credentials. I hope that we can move forward \nexpeditiously with his nomination, now that it has been cleared both by \nthe Armed Services committee--by voice vote--and by the Government \nAffairs Committee.\n  Individuals who undergo the nomination process put their names and \nreputations on the line, opening themselves up to intense scrutiny of \ntheir past employment, their finances, their conduct and their \nassociations. They fill out hundreds of documents. Mr. Schmitz has been \nheld up for long enough--there are no ethical issues impacting his \nnomination, and he has received strong recommendations from those who \nknow him and have worked with him, regardless of party affiliation.\n  I believe that Joe Schmitz was a superlative choice by Secretary \nRumsfeld and president Bush, and that he will make an outstanding IG. \nThe Senate needs to act now, to fill this important position at the \nDepartment of Defense and to give Secretary Rumsfeld the team he needs \nto do his job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1672-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                            WALTER JOHANNSEN\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nextraordinary service of Walter ``Bud'' Johannsen and the extraordinary \ndedication he has shown to the Lake George, MN community. It is \nextraordinary in its duration. It is extraordinary in its selflessness. \nAnd it is a wonderful example of community service at its best.\n  Week after week for the past forty years Bud Johannsen has been on \ncall twenty four hours a day, seven days a week as a volunteer \nfirefighter for the Lake George Volunteer Fire Department, the only \nfire department that services this peaceful north central community and \nits surrounding area. And week after week he has accepted the risks \ninherent in a job of this nature. Week after week. For forty years. \nVoluntarily. Without pay.\n  He has done this while maintaining a full-time job, raising a family \nand participating in community affairs. He has done this while \ndemonstrating a positive attitude, a wonderful sense of humor and a \nwillingness to lend a helping hand wherever and whenever needed.\n  That is dedication. That is the American spirit at its best.\n  Now I know that Bud Johannsen is not the first individual to ever \nvolunteer his time. Nor will he be the last. But when I hear of such a \nmilestone, 40 years as a volunteer firefighter, I feel the need to \nrecognize and publicly thank that individual for his service, \nespecially in light of the events of September 11 when we saw all too \nclearly the sometimes tragic consequences of such courage and \ncommitment.\n  So today I thank Walter ``Bud'' Johannsen. I thank his wife Kay and \nhis daughter Tracy for sharing him with the Lake George community for \nso many years. And I thank all the members of the Lake George Volunteer \nFire Department for the great work that they do.

Some have lost loved ones. Some have sacrificed their \nlives to save others. And some have simply wept. We all have different \nmethods of dealing with such tragic circumstances, and I personally \nhave found a certain degree of solace in Diane Rumer's poem entitled \nAmerican Angel.

I see a \nsoldier fighting at home and abroad to rid the world of terrorism and \noppression. I see a fireman racing into a burning building to save the \nlife of a complete stranger. I see a blood donor. I see an aid worker. \nI see a family raising a flag in their front yard. After reading this, \nI realize there are angels surrounding us in every aspect of life, \ntrying desperately to show us the way.\n  I would like to thank Diane for this inspirational piece.

We must be ready to rescue the \nvictims, care for the sick, and aid the injured. This will take \ncooperation from every level of government--local, State, and Federal \nagencies.\n  Dr. Jeffery Lowell is the St. Louis Mayor's Chief of a special team \ncalled the Medical Critical Incident Response Group. He is responsible \nfor determining how the region's 30-plus hospitals will provide medical \naid to the 2\\1/2\\ million residents of the St. Louis metropolitan area.\n  Dr. Lowell reports only that 70 to 80 critical care beds are \navailable at any one time. But we need to prepare for the possibility \nthat an attack could generate hundreds, perhaps thousands, of injuries.\n  Additionally, the entire St. Louis metropolitan area does not have \nenough emergency responders to care for so many victims. Help would \nneed to come from other cities, other States. This would take time, \nmany hours, even days. In situations like this, lost time means lost \nlives.\n  There is an answer to this problem, and it involves the same Guard \nmen and women I mentioned earlier.\n  The answer is the Expeditionary Medical System, or EMEDS. EMEDS is a \nnew rapid response medical system. It was created by the Air Force to \nrush its medics with blazing speed anywhere in the world they are \nneeded, at a moment's notice.\n  Our military relies on this life-saving capability during wartime, \nbut it could prove just as valuable to the civilian community here, in \nAmerica.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would establish an EMEDS \nprogram in the Air Guard. This bill gives the Air Guard an EMEDS \nprogram so that we are prepared for any disaster or attack on the home \nfront, as our troops have been on the war front.\n  Our Guard soldiers and airmen pride themselves on being light, lean, \nand lethal. EMEDS will make our Guard medics light, lean, and life-\nsaving, able to react within minutes to an attack.\n  The new equipment and training that EMEDS would provide the Guard \nwill allow it to respond to attacks or disasters within minutes. And \nonce on site, Guard EMEDS will be able to remain there for days without \nre-supply, they are self-sustaining. They would assist local \nresponders.\n  EMEDS will care for sick, provide emergency medicine to wounded, even \nperform life-saving surgery. Additionally, Guard EMEDS would be able to \nperform in a biological, chemical, or radiological warfare environment.\n  If the pilot program is successful, I would hope each State's Guard \nwill acquire EMEDS capability. America needs this capability as its \ncitizens grapple with the emerging threats facing them within the \nUnited States.\n  The National Guard is the perfect organization to provide Americans \nthis valuable homeland defense initiative.\n  This bill is supported by the U.S. Air Force Surgeon General as well \nas several other national military organizations such as the Air Force \nSergeants Association, National Guard Association and the Air Force \nAssociation.\n  I am proud to offer this bill. Guard EMEDS is a ground-breaking \ninitiative. This first step toward ensuring that each State, through \nits Guard units, can medically respond to disasters and terrorist \nattacks with live-saving immediacy.\n  I believe this measure is of vital importance to our national \nsecurity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill's passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW\n  S. 2000. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a special depreciation allowance for certain property acquired \nafter December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2004; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, recently we passed legislation to \nprotect families hurt in this recession by extending unemployment \nprotection for an additional 13 weeks.\n  It was the right thing to do. Now let's finish the job by helping \nthem get back to work. Let's pass a stimulus bill that will jump start \nthe economy and create more employment.\n  I am introducing a bill that will encourage business investment in \nnew equipment and technology by offering a 30-percent depreciation \nbonus on capital goods with a depreciation life of 20 years for less as \ndefined by IRS.\n  The bonus would apply to purchases made by the end of 2003 to \nencourage spending now, not years from now.\n  This depreciation bonus is a broad-based incentive that would help \nbusinesses both large and small in almost every sector of our economy.\n  The IRS list of qualifying industries and equipment runs nine pages \nin very small type and there's not much that isn't covered.\n  It would help industries from autos to agriculture, from construction \nto computers, from energy to electronics, and more.\n  And not only would this bill help the manufacturing industries that \nmake these products, spurring employment, but it would also help the \nbusinesses that buy these products by making their workers more \nproductive.\n  I count this as a win/win situation. Let me give you an example of \nhow this depreciation bonus would work. To keep the math simple, let's \ntalk about a business that buys a computer for $1,000. Under IRS \nregulations, computers have a 5-year deduction life.\n  With the depreciation bonus, the business would immediately take a \n30-percent deduction on the $1,000 computer, a deduction of $300, \nmaking the computer now worth $700.\n  Now the business would take all the standard depreciation deductions \nallowed over the 5-years, but at the $700 value. For a computer that \nwould mean another 20-percent deduction in the first year. That's \nanother $140.\n  That means a total deduction of $440, or 44 percent, in just the \nfirst year.\n  I support this bill because it is not targeted to specific industries \nor companies or individuals. Almost every business in America, large, \nsmall and in between, can benefit from this depreciation bonus.\n  I support this bill because it would be a needed short-term shot in \nthe arm for the economy, without shooting holes in our long-term goal \nof fiscal responsibility.\n  I support this bill because it would create jobs, and support \nexisting jobs, bolstering the consumer economy, which is two thirds of \nour Gross Domestic Product and vital to getting us out of this \nrecession.\n  This bill has the support of a broad range of business and industrial \ngroups. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation as well. Let's \nrev up the economy without running up debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S1678]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Defense to report to \nCongress regarding the requirements applicable to the inscription of \nveterans' names on the memorial wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial; \nto the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Fairness to All \nFallen Vietnam War Service Members Act of 2002. Almost forty years ago, \nour country started sending a generation of young men off to fight in \nVietnam. Over 58,000 American soldiers gave their lives to their \ncountry in and around the lands, skies, and seas of Vietnam.\n  The ultimate sacrifices many of these men have made are honored on \nthe Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall here in Washington, D.C. There are, \nhowever, names that are missing from the wall, names that rightfully \nshould be there with their fallen fellow Americans. It is now time to \ncorrect that omission.\n  On the morning of June 3, 1969, the United States destroyer, U.S.S. \nFrank E. Evans, was cut in half during a training exercise by the \nAustralian aircraft carrier, Melbourne. The front half of the destroyer \nsank in three minutes claiming the lives of seventy-four men.\n  While these men were not lost due to enemy fire, they were involved \nin serious combat only days before this tragedy. At the time of the \naccident, the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans was taking part in Operation Sea \nSpirit in the South China Sea which involved over 40 ships from \nSoutheast Asia Treaty Organization Nations. These brave men were \ninstrumental in forwarding American objectives in Vietnam.\n  The fact is these men died while serving their country and are due \nthe\n\n[[Page S1679]]\n\nrights and honors they deserve, including being listed on the Vietnam \nMemorial Wall.\n  Two of my fellow Coloradans, Brian Crowson and Del A. Francis were on \nboard on that fateful morning and survived this horrible accident. \nSadly, 74 of their fellow sailors were not as fortunate.\n  There are many cases of men and women who were killed serving their \ncountry in Southeast Asia, yet they are not eligible to have their \nnames placed on the Wall.\n  At a time when we rightly honor heroes across our country, should we \nnot also take the necessary step to ensure that our past heroes are \nalso honored?\n  This legislation directs the Secretary of Defense to determine an \nappropriate manner to recognize and honor Vietnam Veterans who died in \nservice to our Nation but whose names were excluded from the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Wall. It further asks for input from government \nagencies and organizations that originally constructed the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial Wall regarding the feasibility of adding additional \nnames. Finally, the bill asks for appropriate alternative options for \nrecognizing these veterans should it be deemed that there is no \nlogistical way to add these names.\n  As a veterann of the Korean War, I personally understand the ultimate \nsacrifice many of our brave men and women have made for the price of \nfreedom. This recognition should not be taken lightly.\n  I am honored to introduce this companion bill to H.R. 3443, which was \nintroduced by my good friend and colleague in the House of \nRepresentatives, Congressman Steve Horn.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate as \nwell as Representative Horn and the U.S.S. Frank E. Evans Association \nso that we can pass this long overdue legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 2001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fairness to All Fallen \n     Vietnam War Service Members Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Public Law 96-297 (94 Stat. 827) authorized the Vietnam \n     Veterans Memorial Fund, Inc., (the ``Memorial Fund'') to \n     construct a memorial ``in honor and recognition of the men \n     and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who served \n     in the Vietnam war''.\n       (2) The Memorial Fund determined that the most fitting \n     tribute to those who served in the Vietnam war would be to \n     permanently inscribe the names of the members of the Armed \n     Forces who died during the Vietnam war, or who remained \n     missing at the conclusion of the war, on a memorial wall.\n       (3) The Memorial Fund relied on the Department of Defense \n     to compile the list of individuals whose names would be \n     inscribed on the memorial wall and the criteria for inclusion \n     on such list.\n       (4) The Memorial Fund established procedures under which \n     mistakes and omissions in the inscription of names on the \n     memorial wall could be corrected.\n       (5) Under such procedures, the Department of Defense \n     established eligibility requirements that must be met before \n     the Memorial Fund will make arrangements for the name of a \n     veteran to be inscribed on the memorial wall.\n       (6) The Department of Defense determines the eligibility \n     requirements and has periodically modified such requirements.\n       (7) As of February 1981, in order for the name of a veteran \n     to be eligible for inscription on the memorial wall, the \n     veteran must have--\n       (A) died in Vietnam between November 1, 1955, and December \n     31, 1960;\n       (B) died in a specified geographic combat zone on or after \n     January 1, 1961;\n       (C) died as a result of physical wounds sustained in such \n     combat zone; or\n       (D) died while participating in, or providing direct \n     support to, a combat mission immediately en route to or \n     returning from such combat zone.\n       (8) Public Law 106-214 (114 Stat. 335) authorizes the \n     American Battle Monuments Commission to provide for the \n     placement of a plaque within the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \n     ``to honor those Vietnam veterans who died after their \n     service in the Vietnam war, but as a direct result of that \n     service, and whose names are not otherwise eligible for \n     placement on the memorial wall''.\n       (9) The names of a number of veterans who died during the \n     Vietnam war are not eligible for inscription on the memorial \n     wall or the plaque.\n       (10) Examples of such names include the names of the 74 \n     servicemembers who died aboard the USS Frank E. Evans (DD-\n     174) on June 3, 1969, while the ship was briefly outside the \n     combat zone participating in a training exercise.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY AND REPORT.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Defense shall conduct a study \n     that--\n       (1) identifies the veterans (as defined in section 101(2) \n     of title 38, United States Code) who died on or after \n     November 1, 1955, as a direct or indirect result of military \n     operations in southeast Asia and whose names are not eligible \n     for inscription on the memorial wall of the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial;\n       (2) evaluates the feasibility and equitability of revising \n     the eligibility requirements applicable to the inscription of \n     names on the memorial wall to be more inclusive of such \n     veterans; and\n       (3) evaluates the feasibility and equitability of creating \n     an appropriate alternative means of recognition for such \n     veterans.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit \n     to Congress a report based on the study conducted under \n     subsection (a).

Res. 218\n\n       Whereas today's youth are vital to the preservation of our \n     country and will be the future bearers of the bright torch of \n     democracy;\n       Whereas youth need a safe haven from various negative \n     influences such as child abuse, substance abuse and crime, \n     and they need to have resources readily available to assist \n     them when faced with circumstances that compromise their \n     safety;\n       Whereas the United States needs increased numbers of \n     community volunteers acting as positive influences on the \n     Nation's youth;\n       Whereas the Safe Place program is committed to protecting \n     our Nation's most valuable asset, our youth, by offering \n     short term ``safe places'' at neighborhood locations where \n     trained volunteers are available to counsel and advise youth \n     seeking assistance and guidance;\n       Whereas Safe Place combines the efforts of the private \n     sector and non-profit organizations uniting to reach youth in \n     the early stages of crisis;\n       Whereas Safe Place provides a direct means to assist \n     programs in meeting performance standards relative to \n     outreach/community relations, as set forth in the Federal \n     Runaway and Homeless Youth Act guidelines;\n       Whereas the Safe Place placard displayed at businesses \n     within communities stands as a beacon of safety and refuge to \n     at-risk youth;\n       Whereas over 641 communities in 39 states and more than \n     11,000 locations have established Safe Place programs;\n\n[[Page S1680]]\n\n       Whereas over 53,000 young people have gone to Safe Place \n     locations to get help when faced with crisis situations;\n       Whereas through the efforts of Safe Place coordinators \n     across the country each year more than one-half million \n     students learn that Safe Place is a resource if abusive or \n     neglectful situations exist;\n       Whereas increased awareness of the program's existence will \n     encourage communities to establish Safe Places for the \n     Nation's youth throughout the country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) proclaims the week of March 17 through March 23, 2002 \n     as ``National Safe Place Week'' and\n       (2) request that the President issue a proclamation calling \n     upon the people of the United States and interested groups to \n     promote awareness of and volunteer involvement in the Safe \n     Place programs, and to observe the week with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1680-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1680]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 219--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE DEMOCRATICALLY \nELECTED GOVERNMENT OF COLOMBIA AND ITS EFFORTS TO COUNTER THREATS FROM \n        UNITED STATES-DESIGNATED FOREIGN TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Torricelli) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 219\n\n       Whereas the democratically elected Government of Colombia, \n     led by President Andres Pastrana, is the legitimate authority \n     in the oldest representative democracy in South America;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State, in consultation with the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of the Treasury, is \n     required to designate as foreign terrorist organizations \n     those groups whose activities threaten the security of United \n     States nationals or the national security interests of the \n     United States pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act;\n       Whereas the Secretary of State has designated 3 Colombian \n     terrorist groups as foreign terrorist organizations, \n     including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), \n     the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), and the \n     National Liberation Army (ELN);\n       Whereas all 3 United States-designated foreign terrorist \n     organizations regularly engage in criminal acts, including \n     murder, kidnapping, and extortion perpetrated against \n     Colombian civilians, government officials, security forces, \n     and against foreign nationals, including United States \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the FARC is holding 5 Colombian legislators, a \n     presidential candidate, and Colombian police and army \n     officers and soldiers as hostages and has recently escalated \n     bombings against civilian targets, including a foiled attempt \n     to destroy the city of Bogota's principal water reservoir;\n       Whereas, according to the Colombian government, the FARC \n     has received training in terrorist techniques and technology \n     from foreign nationals;\n       Whereas, since 1992, United States-designated foreign \n     terrorist organizations in Colombia have committed serious \n     crimes against United States citizens, kidnapping more than \n     50 Americans and murdering at least 10 Americans;\n       Whereas the Drug Enforcement Administration believes that \n     members of the FARC and the AUC directly engage in narcotics \n     trafficking;\n       Whereas individual members of Colombia's security forces \n     have collaborated with illegal paramilitary organizations by, \n     inter alia, in some instances allowing such organizations to \n     pass through roadblocks, sharing tactical information with \n     such organizations, and providing such organizations with \n     supplies and ammunition;\n       Whereas while the Colombian government has made progress in \n     its efforts to combat and capture members of illegal \n     paramilitary organizations and taken positive steps to break \n     links between individual members of the security forces and \n     such organizations, further steps by the Colombian government \n     are warranted;\n       Whereas in 1998, Colombian President Andres Pastrana began \n     exhaustive efforts to negotiate a peace agreement with the \n     FARC and implemented extraordinary confidence-building \n     measures to advance these negotiations, including \n     establishing a 16,000-square-mile safe haven for the FARC;\n       Whereas the Government of Colombia has also undertaken \n     substantial efforts to negotiate a peace agreement with the \n     ELN;\n       Whereas the United States has consistently supported the \n     Government of Colombia's protracted efforts to negotiate a \n     peace agreement with the FARC and supports the Government of \n     Colombia in its continuing efforts to reach a negotiated \n     agreement with the ELN;\n       Whereas the United States would welcome a negotiated, \n     political solution to end the violence in Colombia;\n       Whereas, after the FARC hijacked a commercial airplane and \n     took Colombian Senator Jorge Eduardo Gechem Turbay as a \n     hostage into the government-created safe haven, President \n     Pastrana ended his government's sponsorship of the peace \n     negotiations with the FARC and ordered Colombia's security \n     forces to reestablish legitimate governmental control in the \n     safe haven;\n       Whereas President Pastrana has received strong expressions \n     of support from foreign governments and international \n     organizations for his decision to end the peace talks and \n     dissolve the FARC's safe haven; and\n       Whereas the Government of Colombia's negotiations with the \n     ELN are continuing despite the end of the negotiations with \n     the FARC: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate--\n       (A) expresses its support for the democratically elected \n     Government of Colombia and the Colombian people as they \n     strive to protect their democracy from terrorism and the \n     scourge of illicit narcotics;

which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 220\n\n       Whereas Colombia is home to the oldest democracy in Latin \n     America and has consistently been a friend of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas Colombia has been affected by the violence \n     generated by the terrorist acts of illegal armed groups;\n       Whereas the largest of these groups, the Revolutionary \n     Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), has used kidnapping, \n     extortion, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking to raise \n     money for its activities;\n       Whereas those most affected by the targets of these \n     activities have been the people of Colombia;\n       Whereas in October 1997, almost 10,000,000 Colombians voted \n     for a mandate for peace that asked all presidential \n     candidates to find peace in Colombia through political \n     negotiation;\n       Whereas in June 1998, 6,500,000 Colombians voted for \n     President Andres Pastrana and his project for peace in \n     Colombia;\n       Whereas, since his election, President Pastrana has worked \n     consistently and persistently to find a peaceful solution to \n     the ongoing conflict between the Government of Colombia and \n     the insurgency groups operating within the borders of \n     Colombia;\n       Whereas the Government of Colombia put forth several \n     proposals for peace and made sacrifices in sovereign \n     territory and commitments in funding in hopes of achieving \n     peace in Colombia only to have these overtures repeatedly \n     rejected;\n       Whereas, on January 20, 2002, the Government of Colombia \n     and the FARC were able to agree on a schedule to be followed \n     in order to define the future of the peace process;\n       Whereas, since this accord was signed by the FARC, the FARC \n     has consistently and repeatedly taken violent actions against \n     the people and the Government of Colombia in the form of \n     terrorist attacks, including--\n       (1) car bombs;\n       (2) attacking government installations;\n       (3) mining new fields;\n       (4) homicides, including women and children;\n       (5) destroying electric pylons;\n       (6) bombing oil pipelines;\n       (7) destroying bridges;

and\n       (5) Senator Jorge Eduardo Gechem Turbay, a member of the \n     Liberal Party from the Province of Huila, elected by the \n     people of Colombia, and President of the Colombian Senate's \n     Peace Commission, who was kidnapped on February 20, 2002, \n     when four members of the FARC hijacked a commercial AIRES \n     aircraft traveling from Neiva to Bogota with 30 passengers on \n     board and who was removed from the aircraft after it was \n     forced to land on a rural road in the municipality of Hobo, \n     Province of Huila; and\n       Whereas Saturday, February 23, Presidential Candidate \n     Ingrid Betancourt and her campaign manager Clara Rojas were \n     kidnapped by the FARC as she traveled to San Vicente del \n     Caguan: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses its strong support for the democratically \n     elected Government of Colombia and the Colombian people in \n     their struggle to protect their democracy from terrorism and \n     the scourge of illicit narcotics;\n       (2) deplores the continuing criminal terrorist acts of \n     murder, abduction, and extortion carried out by all illegal \n     armed groups in Colombia against the civilian population of \n     Colombia and Colombian authorities;\n       (3) condemns the kidnapping of elected representatives of \n     the people of Colombia by the FARC and extends its sympathy \n     to the families and friends of the kidnapped members of the \n     Colombian Congress; and\n       (4) urges the President to develop a comprehensive \n     strategic policy proposal, consistent with United States law \n     regarding human rights and the environment, to assist the \n     Government of Colombia in defending its democracy and rule of \n     law from illegal armed groups and the scourge of illicit \n     narcotics.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sending to the desk a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution on the current situation in Colombia.\n  The resolution expresses outrage over the current attacks on \ndemocracy and democratic institutions in Colombia by a gang of vicious \nthugs. The most recent outrage, in a long history of outrages, was the \nhijacking of a commercial airliner filled with innocent people that was \nforced to land, and then the kidnapping at gun point of a distinguished \nColombian Senator. That Senator remains a prisoner, his fate unknown \nand uncertain. Four other members of the Colombian Congress are also \nprisoners, and now so is one of the candidates for president in \nColombia's upcoming elections. Other members have been murdered, their \nfamilies threatened, their children terrorized. These are only the most \npublicly visible victims of Colombia's guerrilla thugs.\n  There can be no clearer testimony, if further evidence was called \nfor, of the vicious nature of the actions of Colombia's insurgent \nmovement, the FARC. They have branded themselves, if it was not clear \nbefore, as outright terrorists. Their actions are an assault on the \nrule of law and on democracy.\n  My resolution expresses the concern over the fate of those in a \ncompanion institution. Our sympathies must go to their families, our \nconcern to their countryman in their time of threat an menace. I hope \nthat other members will join me in expressing our unanimous concern for \nthe fate of democracy and the rule of law in Colombia. The other body \nhas passed a resolution expressing its concern. I hope we will as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/07/senate-section/article/S1681-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1681-S1682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 221--TO COMMEMORATE AND ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEDICATION \nAND SACRIFICE MADE BY THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE LOST THEIR LIVES WHILE \n                  SERVING AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Allard, Ms. \nCantwell, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBunning, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Allen, Mr. Thomas, and Mr. Hutchinson) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 221\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas 70 peace officers died at the World Trade Center in \n     New York City on September 11, 2001, the most peace officers \n     ever killed in a single incident in the history of the \n     Nation;\n       Whereas more than 220 peace officers across the Nation were \n     killed in the line of duty during 2001, 57 percent more \n     police fatalities than the previous year, and the deadliest \n     year for the law enforcement community since 1974;\n       Whereas every year, 1 out of every 9 peace officers is \n     assaulted, 1 out of every 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 \n     out of every 4,400 peace officers is killed in the line of \n     duty; and\n       Whereas on May 15, 2002, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in Washington, D.C. to join with the \n     families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2002 as Peace Officers Memorial Day, \n     in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am joined by the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senators Leahy and \nHatch, along with several other Senators in submitting this resolution \nto keep alive in the memory of all Americans the sacrifice and \ncommitment of those law enforcement officers who lost their lives \nserving their communities. Specifically, this resolution would \ndesignate May 15, 2002, as National Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face everyday on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 700,000 men and women who serve this \nNation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every \nyear, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, \nand 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. There are few \ncommunities in this country that have not been impacted by the words: \n``officer down.''\n  On September 11, 2001, 70 peace officers died at the World Trade \nCenter in New York City as a result of a cowardly act of terrorism. \nThis single act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace \nofficers ever killed in a single incident in the history of this \ncountry. Thirty-seven of those fallen heroes served with the Port \nAuthority of New York and New Jersey Police Department: twenty-three \nwere New York City police officers; three worked for the New York \nOffice of Court Administration; five were with the New York Office of \nTax Enforcement; one was a FBI special agent; and one was a master \nspecial officer with the U.S. Secret Service. Before this event, the \ngreatest loss of law enforcement like in a single incident occurred in \n1917, when nine Milwaukee police officers were killed in a bomb blast \nat their police station.\n  In 2001, more than 200 Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers give their lives in the line of duty. This represents more \nthan a 57 percent increase in police fatalities over the previous year. \nAnd, in total, nearly 15,0000 men and women have made the supreme \nsacrifice.\n  The chairman of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, \nCraig W. Floyd, reminds us:\n\n       The level of public support and appreciation for our law \n     enforcement officers has increased dramatically since \n     September 11. But the incredible bravery and selfless \n     sacrifice our officers displayed that day was no different \n     than every other day of the year in communities across \n     America. We owe all of our police officers a huge debt of \n     gratitude for the invaluable work they do.\n\n  On May 15, 2002, more than 15,000 peace officers are expected to \ngather in our Nation's Capitol to join with the families of their \nfallen comrades who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their \nresponsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their \ncommunities.
