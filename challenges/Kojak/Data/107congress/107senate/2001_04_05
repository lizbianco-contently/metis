Campbell Gillon, offered the following \nprayer:\n  Let us pray.\n  Almighty God, on this National Tartan Day we remember pointers of the \npast. Near 700 years ago William Wallace died crusading for freedom and \non this very date 681 years ago, our Scots forebears declared \nindependence from English overlords in the Declaration of Arbroath, \nmade by a parliament gathered there. So we gather at the center of this \ngreat Nation of all nations, itself born in a comparable Declaration of \nIndependence, recognizing the influence of distant words and the \nintricate weaving of faith, kin, and clan.\n  We bless Thee for a multifaceted heritage left by fellow Scots on \nthis continent. From John Paul Jones, founder of the Navy; Gilbert \nStuart, painter of George Washington; Andrew Carnegie, money-maker and \ngiver; John Muir, environmentalist, creator of Yosemite National Park; \nRev. James Blair, founder of William and Mary College, to Rev. John \nWitherspoon, signer of the Declaration of Independence. For such and \nmore, we give thanks.\n  And yet, O God, we know that in Thy sight, human success is but a \npassing shadow and that righteousness alone exalts a nation. For \ngoodness is not a kilt we put on, nor a legacy we inherit. It must be \nsought by each one from the heart--Thy kingdom, Thy righteousness \nfirst, and all else will then be added.\n  Lord, remind us of the far-reaching influence of a tiny country where \nliteracy, that would enable all children to read Thy Word, was stressed \nfrom the time of John Knox. And from its pages, see that freedom can \neasily deteriorate into license; for where there is no spiritual \nvision, people perish. Grant to us all, O Lord, grace to realize daily \nthat goodness and truth make us free to be our best and can help us to \nbe living pointers for others to a nobler future. God bless the Senate \nin its deliberations. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3461-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE\n\n  The Honorable Mike Crapo led the Pledge of Allegiance, as follows:\n\n       I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of \n     America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation \n     under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3461-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              APPOINTMENT OF ACTING PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today is the beginning of the Tartan Day \nweekend, a time to be celebrated nationwide in honor of the millions of \nScottish-Americans and their contribution to our Nation. In 1998, the \nSenate passed Resolution 155 recognizing April 6 as National Tartan \nDay, the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath, signed on April 6, \n1320. On that day, a group of Scots declared their independence and \nstated, ``We fight not for glory, nor riches, nor honours, but only and \nalone we fight for freedom, which no good man surrenders, but with his \nlife.'' Our own Declaration of Independence was impacted by the wording \nand spirit of this Declaration of Arbroath.\n  Today, we begin the Tartan Day celebrations with a special ceremony \nat 11 a.m. on the West Steps of the Capitol. The William Wallace award \nwill be presented to the distinguished actor, film star, and \nbenefactor, Sir Sean Connery.\n\n[[Page S3462]]\n\n  In celebration of Tartan Day, it was a pleasure to have The Rev. \nCampbell Gillon as the guest Chaplain and give our opening prayer this \nmorning. Mr. Gillon is a native Scot who has served as the pastor of \nthe Georgetown Presbyterian Church for 20 years. Our own Chaplain, Dr. \nLloyd Ogilvie, who also serves as president of the St. Andrews Society \nof Washington, is the organizer of the Tartan Day Celebration here at \nthe Capitol today. It's good to see both our Chaplain and the guest \nChaplain in their tartan kilts. They are ready for a great day and \nweekend for the Scots. I'm proud of my own Scots heritage through the \nWatson clan and look forward to the ceremony this morning.\n  I will join our Chaplain and the guest Chaplain soon, as will my son \nand I am sure many other Senators of Scottish ancestry. This will be a \ngreat day, a great weekend for all Scots, both in America and in \nScotland.\n  I want to make the Senate aware of the special occasion. Amongst all \nthese amendments and this great debate of the budget resolution, I am \nsure the spirit of the Declaration of Arbroath will be felt throughout \nthe day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3462-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senate will now resume \nconcurrent debate on the Collins amendment No. 190 and the Stabenow \namendment No. 191 with the time to be equally divided. There will now \nbe 10 minutes for explanation prior to votes on or in relation to the \nCollins amendment No. 190 and the Stabenow amendment No. 191.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment that we will \nsoon vote on that is intended to eliminate a further cut in Medicare \nreimbursements for home health agencies. The statistics tell the story. \nThe combinations of cutbacks in Medicare payments and the onerous \nregulations imposed by the Clinton administration have cost some \n900,000 Medicare patients--often our most frail and vulnerable senior \ncitizens, as well as those citizens with considerable disabilities--to \nlose access to their home health care.\n  In Maine, more than 11,000 seniors and disabled citizens have lost \ntheir home health care services. Nationwide, 3,300 home health agencies \nhave closed their doors or have stopped serving Medicare patients. And \nlooming on the horizon is yet another 15-percent cutback in Medicare \npayments to home health agencies.\n  It is scheduled to go into effect on October 1 of next year. If it \ndoes go into effect, it will have a devastating impact that will \nfurther jeopardize access to home health services for our senior \ncitizens.\n  The cutbacks have already caused tragedies. I discussed last night an \nelderly woman with advanced Alzheimer's disease in the State of Maine \nwho had a number of other problems, who lost access to her home health \ncare services, and as a result died from an untreated infection in her \nfoot.\n  Surely, one of the dedicated home health nurses would have been able \nto treat that infection before it got out of control. That is just \ntypical of the problems being created by the cutbacks in home health \ncare.\n  My amendment establishes a $13.7 billion reserve fund that can be \nused only to restore Medicare payments to home health agencies. And it \nprotects every dime of the Medicare HI trust fund.\n  By contrast, my colleague from Michigan has also offered an amendment \nthat would take the money set aside for tax relief and place it in the \nMedicare budget account. Once there, the funds could be used for any \npurpose under the Medicare program. Under the amendment of my \ncolleague, there is absolutely no guarantee whatsoever that the funds \nwould be used for home health care. Indeed, there is no mention at all \nof home health care in the text of the amendment of my friend from \nMichigan.\n  In contrast, my amendment would bring us significantly closer to \nrestoring Medicare home health payments. It sets aside $13.7 billion \nfor home health--and home health alone. It also provides a mechanism to \nmove subsequent legislation to eliminate the scheduled 15-percent \nreduction without being subject to a budget point of order.\n  I want to make a point clear. Under either approach, subsequent \nlegislation will be needed to repeal the 15-percent reduction. That is \nprecisely the situation that the reserve fund is designed to address.\n  We have used this approach before. We set aside funds in a reserve \naccount just last year for the cervical and breast cancer program, and \nsubsequently passed authorizing legislation that, because of the \nreserve account, was passed last year.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague from Missouri, who has been a \ntremendous leader on this issue, is on the floor as well. I want to \nmake sure I leave some time for him. Could the Presiding Officer inform \nme how much time I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. With that, let me yield my 1 minute. But let me make one \npoint.\n  My amendment is endorsed by the National Association for Home Care \nand the Visiting Nurses Association of America. Those are the two \norganizations representing home health care providers.\n\n[[Page S3463]]\n\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized for 40 seconds.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, a very brief comment, necessarily, on the \ntwo amendments.\n  The Democrats claim the difference is that their amendment will \nguarantee that the money will go to home health care. Unfortunately, \nthat is not the way the amendment is drawn. That is not what will \nhappen. Basically, the Democratic amendment simply says: You may spend \nmore on Medicare, not necessarily on home health. The only thing it \ntruly does is cut the money available for tax cuts. That leaves more \nmoney for spending in any area.\n  The Collins-Bond amendment sets aside a reserve fund specifically for \nhome health. It cannot be used for anything else.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Collins amendment and to oppose \nthe Democratic amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Ms. STABENOW addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President. Good morning.\n  We have in front of us two approaches to addressing home health care \nneeds and stopping the 15-percent cut that is scheduled to go into \neffect in October of 2002. I applaud my colleague from Maine for her \ncommitment to this issue. I share that commitment, having worked very \nclosely for 4 years in the House of Representatives with the agencies \nand associations involved in home health care.\n  I know we share a deep concern about the fact that there has been a \n24-percent cut in patient care in home health care settings as a result \nof the Balanced Budget Act. I consider that an unintended consequence. \nI do not believe that it was intended that we see a 30-percent \nreduction in the number of agencies that serve Medicare patients. And \nas a result of that, we have seen this 15-percent cut delayed on three \ndifferent occasions.\n  Today is the opportunity for us to send a strong message to the \npatients and families who rely on home health care, and the home health \ncare agencies that do such a wonderful job, and say that, in fact, this \ncut will not take effect and they can proceed in providing quality care \nfor our families.\n  The difference in the approach is that my colleague provides for a \nproposal that says ``if.'' And I will read this: ``subject to the \ncondition that such legislation will not, when taken together with all \nother previously-enacted legislation, reduce the on-budget surplus \nbelow the level of the Medicare . . . Trust Fund:'' Then, and only \nthen, would we have $13.7 billion available for home health care. Then, \nand only then, would we stop this incredibly devastating 15-percent cut \nthat is scheduled to take effect.\n  I offer a different approach. It is very simple. We will protect home \nhealth care, period. We take the $13.7 billion off the top, as they \nsay. We take a very minute amount of money away from what is, in \neffect, a $2.5 trillion tax cut that has been proposed by the \nPresident, to say that we are going to make sure the families of \nAmerica have access to home health care; that seniors can live in \ndignity in their homes; that families who care for moms and dads and \ngrandmas and grandpas can make sure that home health care services are \navailable so they are not forced to choose a nursing home or another \ninstitution when it is not appropriate.\n  It is very clear; we have two approaches and the same amount of \ndollars. One says: Maybe, if all other things happen, we will stop the \n15-percent cut in home health care.\n  My amendment very simply says: We take it off the top. We guarantee \nthat we place home health care as a priority.\n  It certainly is a priority for our families. It needs to be a \npriority for this Congress. My amendment will simply make sure that \nthat is the case.\n  I urge colleagues on both sides of the aisle who care deeply about \nhome health care to join with me in guaranteeing that home health care \nis a priority of this Congress and to make sure this devastating 15-\npercent cut will not, in fact, take place.\n  I urge support for the amendment and yield to my colleague and friend \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the difference between these two \namendments is very clear. The Senator from Michigan has an amendment \nthat is paid for. The Senator from Maine has an amendment for which \nthere will be no money if Medicare is being raided for other purposes, \nwhich we have seen time after time after time on the floor of the \nSenate over the last 2 days. The choice is very clear. If Senators want \nto support home health care, they had better support the Senator from \nMichigan. It is the only proposal that is paid for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such leader time as I might \nneed, although I will be brief.\n  On the issue before us, the amendment by the Senator from Michigan, \nonce again, this is a continuation of what I referred to yesterday: \nFiddling while Rome is burning. Once again we are going to increase \nspending, albeit in a good cause, and we are going to take it away from \ntax relief for working Americans.\n  The Senator from Maine has a better alternative. I say again to all \nwho are watching, the pattern is clear--spend more and tax more. That \nis what the Congress has been committed to for so many years, and we \nare trying to change that culture.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will take time off the leader time.\n  We always welcome the majority leader to the floor, even when he \nmakes statements that don't quite fit the facts. I say to my colleague \nthis morning, I think he knows, as we all know, that the choice is not \nthe choice between spending and a tax cut. It is really more \ncomplicated than that. It is the question of what is the appropriate \nmix of tax cut, debt paydown, and reserving resources for these high-\npriority domestic needs such as improving education and a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  The most stark differences are that we have reserved much more of the \nprojected surplus for the paydown of national debt. They have a tax cut \nthat is about twice as big as ours. We have about twice as much \nreserved for the paydown of our national debt, both short-term and \nlong-term. We think that is a better set of priorities. We have also \nreserved additional resources for improving education and for a \nprescription drug benefit and for strengthening our national defense. \nWe think those are the priorities of the American people.\n  The President has said very often this is the people's money. We \nagree with that. Absolutely, this is the people's money. Some of it \nshould be returned to them in a tax cut. Some of it should be used to \npay down our collective national debt. After all, that is the people's \ndebt. We also ought to strengthen Social Security because that is the \npeople's Social Security program. We ought to improve education for our \nkids because, after all, they are our kids. We also ought to do \nsomething about a priority that is as important as home health care. \nThe Senator from Michigan has an amendment that is paid for, that would \nprovide an assurance that the resources would be available to improve \nhome health care. It deserves our support.\n  I reserve the remainder of leader time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen).

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand we have an order entered as to how we \nproceed. I want to take 5 minutes off the resolution just to talk with \nthe Senate a little bit about where we are. I understand my friend \nwants to do the same. He is not limited, of course, to 5 minutes. But I \nwant to start that.\n  Mr. President, I want Senators to know that both of us, as managers \nof this bill, find ourselves in a position where there are some very \nbig conflicting desires. One desire is that we finish by noon tomorrow. \nIt seems to be a rather pervasive one going around. Whenever you say: \nWould you like to finish at 12 tomorrow, the roof goes down with shouts \nof, ``Alleluia. Let's do it.''\n  We are trying to figure out how we can do that. The problem, fellow \nSenators--I speak to all Senators; and then my friend can speak to all, \nand he can include ours in his comments--it is not possible to do that. \nSome Senators have five, some have six, some requested three \namendments. I don't know if there is anybody with any higher than six \nthat we are aware of, but we have all these requests for amendments, \nand we want everybody to know we are aware of that. But we also want \neverybody to know that we are going to have to soon find a way to limit \nour time. When that happens, it is not going to be possible that all of \nthese amendments are going to be considered. We have a time agreement \nnow that says Senators who have amendments and want them considered \nhave to get them turned in by 2 o'clock today. That is in just a few \nhours.\n  I hope my recalling that to Senators does not bring another rash of \namendments. If you have them ready, I am hoping you will get them down \nhere. I hope I did not remind you to come up with more because \nessentially there is not going to be time for more.\n  We are going to have to get our heads together--that is, the two \nleaders and the two managers--to talk about how we are going to attempt \nto assure Senators that we will be finished tomorrow at 12 o'clock. In \nthat process, we have no way of setting a list of 40, 50 amendments \nthat are all going to be considered. I think you understand that would \nnot be the case. If we used all the time we have, many Senators would \nnot get their amendments up other than a vote-athon. We are trying very \nhard to limit the vote-athon so it is credible, rational, and so people \nhave a couple minutes and we don't just start voting.\n  With that, I urge anybody on our side who has amendments that they \nabsolutely feel must be considered to talk with us. If they can get by \nwith one amendment, if they have three pending and will put two of them \nin the vote-athon, and then get them one after another, and very \nquickly, we will very much appreciate that.\n  We are trying our best. All Senators should know we are trying to get \na consent agreement so that we will be out of here by 12 tomorrow. That \nmeans people will get pushed back in terms of the number that can be \nconsidered and the time that can be used on amendments. We are going to \ndo our very best on our side. We think we know the Senators who have \ninsisted and worked very hard to make sure they get an opportunity. We \nare going to try to protect that.\n  Beyond that, I don't think we can guarantee very much. If indeed \nSenators want us to lead them to the promised land, the promised land, \nwe thought, was to have a unanimous consent agreement sooner rather \nthan later, saying we will be finished at 12 tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 3 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I repeat the theme of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee on this question of what we have before us. We have \nhad Members come to us and say: We very much want to conclude our work \nby noon tomorrow.\n  We want to be faithful to that charge. It is absolutely not possible \nto do that and to consider all of the amendments that have been \nreported to us. We have over 110 amendments. If we go into a vote-athon \nwith 110 amendments, that will take 40 hours to complete with 3 votes \nan hour being conducted.\n  It is very important that the message go out to our colleagues: It is \nnow time for us to exercise self-discipline. Every Senator has the \nright to offer their amendment and get it considered under the rules of \nthe Budget Act. Unfortunately, that means if individual Members insist \non their right to offer each and every one of the amendments that has \nbeen prepared, we are going to be here through Monday. That is just the \nhard reality of calculating the number of amendments, the amount of \ntime, and how long it takes to vote. If people want to be here through \nMonday, voting every 20 minutes on an amendment, we can do that. Or we \ncan exercise self-restraint and self-discipline and work with the \nmanagers and work with the leadership and winnow down the number of \namendments and enter into time agreements so we can dispose of \namendments as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n  One other thing: It is very important that we not have to hold the \nvote open for 30 minutes so colleagues who are late have a chance to \nvote. We want every colleague to have a chance to vote. We hope they \nwill consider their other colleagues. We are going to wind up being \nvery late here night after night if we don't exercise that restraint.\n\n[[Page S3465]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if I could have the attention of my \ncolleagues from North Dakota as well as New Mexico, I have an amendment \nI will offer with Senators Biden, Nelson, and Daschle. I ask unanimous \nconsent that our 30 minutes on this amendment be divided so that \nSenator Biden of Delaware will be first to speak for 10 minutes, \nSenator Nelson of Florida for 5 minutes, and that I will speak for the \nlast 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may just say, the Senator from North \nDakota has asked to use all the time on the resolution. It is my \nunderstanding that the Senator from North Dakota would like to save \nsome time on the amendment. I am sure the Senator from North Dakota \nwould yield time on the resolution as the Senator indicated and reserve \nthe time on the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. If it is permissible at this point \nto go ahead with this arrangement.\n  Mr. REID. The arrangement would be fine, but the time would be off \nthe resolution, not off the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent then that the next 30 minutes of \ndebate on the amendment I am sending to the desk be allocated as I have \nsuggested.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I must \napologize to the Senator--would he please repeat the request.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am asking that 30 minutes of the debate that will \nfollow on the amendment be allocated 10 minutes to my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Biden, and 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida, Mr. \nNelson, and that I have the last 15 minutes of that 30 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. The time will be yielded off the resolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that the time would not come off the \namendment but off the resolution.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Biden, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 202.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To call for immediate action by the United States Senate on \n  passage of an Economic Stimulus Package in FY01 and to provide for \n    further tax cuts in Fiscal Years 2002-11 as part of a fiscally \n    responsible budget that ensures maximum feasible debt reduction)\n\n       On page 2, line 17, decrease the amount by $31,140,000,000.\n       On page 2, line 18, decrease the amount by $10,606,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 1, increase the amount by $12,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 2, increase the amount by $33,077,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 3, increase the amount by $57,444,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 4, increase the amount by $67,821,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 5, increase the amount by $73,414,000,000.\n       On page 3 line 6, increase the amount by $71,119,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 7, increase the amount by $80,281,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 8, increase the amount by $64,625,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $31,140,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $10,606,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $12,100,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 16, decrease the amount by $33,077,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 17, decrease the amount by $57,444,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 18, decrease the amount by $67,821,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $73,414,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $71,119,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $80,281,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $64,625,000,000, \n     and add the following\n       (a). Findings.--The Senate finds:\n       (1) That the economy of the United States has consistently \n     grown since 1993, providing increasing prosperity for \n     millions of hardworking Americans;\n       (2) That the pace of growth of the economy of the United \n     States was measured at only one percent in the fourth quarter \n     of 2000;\n       (3) That debt reduction is effective in stimulating capital \n     investment that promotes long-term growth;\n       (4) That the President and Vice President of the United \n     States have noted that the economy of the United States is in \n     need of a stimulus;\n       (5) That the Democratic Leader of the United States Senate \n     and other Members of the Democratic Caucus have called for \n     immediate passage of a $60 billion Economic Stimulus Package;\n       (6) That the Chairman of the Senate Committee on the Budget \n     has included in his FY02 budget substitute a $60 billion \n     Economic Stimulus Package;\n       (7) That the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on the \n     Budget has also called for a $60 billion Economic Stimulus \n     Package;\n       (b). Sense of Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that the Senate should \n     discharge H.R. 3 from the Senate Committee on Finance, begin \n     floor consideration of H.R. 3 immediately after passage of H. \n     Con. Res. 83, strike all after the enacting clause and insert \n     the text of the agreed upon $60 billion Bipartisan Economic \n     Stimulus Package, including an immediate economic stimulus \n     check for all payroll and income taxpayers and a permanent \n     reduction of the fifteen percent income tax bracket to a ten \n     percent tax bracket, and proceed to a vote on final passage \n     prior to April recess.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois.\n  This is a simple amendment. It is an amendment that everyone here, on \nboth sides of the aisle, should be able to support.\n  When President Bush was campaigning during the Republican primaries, \nhe announced a 10-year across-the-board income tax cut plan. He said \nthat increasing the budget surplus meant the Government was taking much \ntoo much money.\n  Steve Forbes had his flat tax, and Mr. Bush had his tax cut plan. He \noffered that plan at a time--to repeat what has been said on the floor \nbefore--when our economy was booming, when the stock market was still \nclimbing. In late 1999, when the campaign was beginning and this plan \nwas offered, the economy was growing at 8.5 percent. That is a very \ndifferent circumstance than we have today. We just found out that the \neconomy was still growing in the first quarter of this year, but not at \n8.5 percent, at 1 percent.\n  The President has told us the plan he came up with in the campaign \nwhen the economy was expanding was exactly the right size for the \neconomy at that time. Now he is trying to tell us it is exactly the \nsize for the economy at this time.\n  President Bush has admitted that his plan fails to get enough money \nout to people at the start of his plan, right now, while the economy is \nat a low point, while consumer confidence is bumbling around down \nthere, and while people are slowing up on their purchases, slowing up \non buying durable goods, and beginning to wonder whether or not the \neconomy is going to take a further tailspin or recover, although \nconsumer confidence bumped up slightly.\n  The vast majority of the President's tax cut actually happens many \nyears from now. It can't have any effect on the economic problems we \nface today, on the sluggishness of our economy, and our concerns for \nrecession. In fact, 95 percent of the President's tax cut takes effect \nafter the year 2003. His plan, whatever else we may make of it, is not \ndesigned in any way, shape, or form, to stimulate the economy in the \nshort run.\n  One thing everyone seems in agreement on is what we should be doing. \nAt least what we should be doing is stimulating the economy in the \nshort run. The President himself acknowledges this. In fact, so does \nthe Republican budget resolution before us today. My friend, the \nchairman of the Budget Committee, has included $60 billion for a \nstimulus proposal in this resolution. Senator Durbin, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida, Senator Lieberman, and I suggest that we act on that. We are \noffering an amendment, with the same $60\n\n[[Page S3466]]\n\nbillion cost this year as in the Republican plan, that will put money \nin the pockets of everyone who works for a living and pays payroll \ntaxes.\n  If this were to become law, as soon as 2 or 3 months from now, we \nwill be able to send a $600 check to eligible couples, $300 to single \ntaxpayers. We also permanently drop--and the President proposes as \nwell--the income tax rate from 15 to 10 percent. This is a permanent \ncut that affects everyone who pays income tax at the highest and lowest \nbrackets.\n  The President has a similar proposal, but ours would go into effect \nimmediately. That would mean an additional $300, on average, per person \nper year on top of the payroll tax rebate check for a married couple \nthrough lowering withholding from their paychecks, having lowered the \nlowest rate from 15 to 10, as the President proposes. That extra 900 \nbucks per family this year is real money. It is real money for working \nfamilies, and it has real consequences.\n  As strange as it may sound, it means a couple that is withholding the \npurchase of a new toaster or refrigerator or microwave or a durable \nproduct that folks like us don't withhold buying now--we are not the \nreason the economy is slowing down. Everybody always talks about how \nthe Senate is made up of millionaires. I wish I were one of them. But \nthere is no millionaire in this place who is not spending their money. \nThey are not the reason the economy is slowing down.\n  Average folks, the folks I grew up with, they are the ones who are \ncausing the economy to slow because they are not spending their money. \nThey have lost confidence in the economy. So if we are going to have \nany hope of an impact beyond what I believe is needed--the monetary \nstimulus that Mr. Greenspan, hopefully, will continue to provide, this \nis the only fiscal stimulus that is available to us.\n  That extra $900 per family, as I said, is real money. It exceeds what \nthey would get under the whole plan, in some cases, of the President. \nThis will mean a lot of people and businesses that depend on them will \nbe able to purchase and sell, keep people employed, keep the economy \ngoing. This money would get out this year, and to give a $60 billion \njump start to the economy is something, if I read the budget resolution \ncorrectly, if I listened to the rhetoric I have heard from Democrats as \nwell as Republicans, as we all acknowledge is needed--maybe the \nargument will be it is not enough of a stimulus. Some argue it is too \nmuch. I don't know anybody arguing that we don't need a stimulus.\n  This is something I think we can all agree on: the need for a tax cut \nthat actually does something to lift the sagging economy here and now. \nBy the way, as our friend from Arkansas stood up, Senator Blanche \nLincoln, a couple weeks ago, I was surprised when she listed how many \npeople in her State would not benefit from any aspect of the \nPresident's tax cut because all they do is pay payroll taxes. Nothing. \nThis will see to it that everybody--those folks, real live folks we all \nsay we care about, will get a tax cut, and they will get it now. So the \ntwo benefits it has for that cadre of people is, one, they get it now \nand, two, they get it.\n  Under the existing proposal of the President, they don't get it, \nperiod. I hope we get it and figure it out.\n  The amendment I am speaking to today, along with my friend from \nIllinois and my friend from Florida, who will speak next, simply says \nwe should put our money where our mouth is. Both parties in the Senate \nagree on a $60 billion stimulus plan, and we should act as soon as \npossible. This amendment calls on us to take the first tax bill that \ncomes over from the House, substitute our $60 billion economic stimulus \nplan with this bipartisan support, pass it right away, and within weeks \nget money into people's hands.\n  I say to my friends on both sides of the aisle, if you believe in \ndoing something right now to pump some life into the economy, this is \nyour chance. Whatever you make of this $2 trillion-plus tax cut cost by \nthe President, whatever you make of its size or its distribution, this \namendment does what tax cuts alone do not do--it puts money now, real \nmoney, into the hands of every taxpayer in the country in time to \nrespond to the real needs of the economic stimulus. It is not based \nupon some pie-in-the-sky expectation of what is going to happen over 10 \nyears based upon the growth of the economy and us limiting spending.\n  I thank my colleague for listening. Whatever time I have left, I \nyield to my friend from the State of Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized. The \nremaining time is 1 minute 2 seconds.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent that the remaining time be yielded \nto my friend from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I had requested 5 minutes, so \nwould you prefer that I go ahead and take it, or let the Senator from \nOregon go ahead, and I will be happy to speak after him? What is the \npleasure of the Senator from Oregon?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I say to my friend, I am awaiting the arrival of \nthe senior Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden, who will be here \nmomentarily. If the Senator won't be long, why doesn't he go ahead and \nwe will wait.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank Senator Biden for his \ncomments on the introduction of this particular amendment. He has \nspoken to the stimulus of the tax package and why we need in a \ndeclining economy, which, of course, we hope rebounds, but because \nthere is an indication that the economy is on the decline, we don't \nneed a tax cut to take effect mainly in the last 5 years of the next \ndecade; we need it to take effect now, to inject some financial, some \nfiscal stimulus into the economy so we can come out of the slump. That \nis what Senator Biden has addressed.\n  I wish to address another part of this particular amendment, and that \nis the part of debt reduction, because this amendment takes a portion \nfrom the President's proposed tax cut, lowers that tax cut, changes the \nnature of that tax cut to an immediate fiscal stimulus, and has further \na reduction of the national debt down to a level of approximately $500 \nbillion after the decade, after the 10-year period for which we are \nplanning.\n  Now, why is this important? First of all, it is very important \nbecause that is what the people of America want. For decades we have \nbeen living in an economy that has been driven by annual deficits; that \nis, when the Federal Government is paying more out than it has coming \nin in tax revenues. And the difference--since we spend more than we \nhave in tax revenues--is what we have to borrow each year, called the \nannual deficit. That deficit then, is added each year, and cumulatively \nthe national debt becomes greater and greater. That figure today on the \npublicly held national debt is about $3.4 trillion.\n  Well, not until a year ago did we ever seriously think that we could \nconfront the fact of paying down the national debt, until suddenly we \nrealized that we were in this surplus condition. Now we don't know what \nthe surplus is. We say, in the last estimate, that it is $5.6 trillion \nover the next 10 years. New estimates are saying it is much lower than \nthat, and that it is really about $4.2 trillion. But if we keep going \ninto a declining economy, the surplus could dwindle to significantly \nless than we are projecting. But we do know there is a surplus there, \nat least for the foreseeable future.\n  So all of this is to say that is why the people out there in \nAmerica--and I can tell you in my State of Florida--clearly are giving \nus the message that in this time of beneficence, as a result of the \nprosperity that we have experienced in the last decade, they want us to \nuse that prosperity to start paying down the national debt, as well as \ngiving a substantial tax cut. That is just good economic common sense. \nThat is what we all do in our individual budgets. We want to pay down \ndebt, get ourselves debt free so we have a much more stable financial \ncondition. So, too, with our country.\n  In our country there is a little bit of difference. In the $3.4 \ntrillion of publicly held debt, there is some of that debt, as Mr. \nGreenspan testified in front of our Budget Committee, which you would \nnot necessarily be able to pay off right away because it is long-term \nbonds and the Federal Government would have to pay a premium to pay \nthose off. That overall publicly\n\n[[Page S3467]]\n\nheld debt is estimated to be about half a trillion dollars, $500 \nbillion, which would be difficult to pay off without paying a premium.\n  This amendment brings down, over a 10-year projection, that publicly \nheld debt to a level at which we would not have to pay a penalty or a \npremium to pay off, and that is estimated at $500 billion at the end of \nthe decade.\n  That is common sense. That is good fiscal discipline. That is good \nfiscal and economic policy, and it is what the people of our country \nwant.\n  If we have an opportunity to pay down our national debt, we ought to \ndo it. That is being good stewards of our national economy.\n  That is the message I wanted to bring as this amendment being offered \nby Senator Durbin is considered by the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes off the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Florida, who is \na very distinguished member of the Budget Committee, for his remarks \nand for the contribution he has made to the work of the committee in \nthis his first year in the Senate. Of course, he is a veteran of \nCongress because he served with distinction in the House of \nRepresentatives. He has been through the 1980s and saw firsthand what \nhappened when very serious fiscal mistakes were made.\n  The Senator from Florida has been one of the strongest voices in the \nSenate Budget Committee saying: Let's not repeat those mistakes; let's \nbe serious and sober; let's take a look at the fact that these \nsurpluses are projected, they are forecasted; they are not in the bank; \nand let's dedicate most of that projected surplus to debt reduction.\n  Yes, we can spend some money. Yes, we can have a significant tax cut. \nYes, we can provide additional resources for improving education, as we \ndid yesterday, and provide a prescription drug benefit, as we did the \nday before yesterday. Yes, we can strengthen our national defense, as \nwe did last night, over what is in the President's budget. Those are \ninvestments. That is prudent spending.\n  The primary emphasis ought to be: Keep our eye on the ball; keep \npaying down this national debt. That is what is going to be a time bomb \nfor this country if we fail to keep the pressure on paying down this \nnational debt. That is what this Durbin amendment is about.\n  The Durbin amendment does two things. It says: Reduce the size of the \nPresident's tax cut and with that money pay down more of this debt. \nSecond, it says we have money in this year's budget that will permit an \nimmediate fiscal stimulus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield myself an additional minute. We have money in \nthis year's budget for an immediate fiscal stimulus of $60 billion. On \nboth sides, we have agreed that is necessary, that is important. Let us \ndo it, and let us do it before we leave on the April work break. Let us \ndo it now. Let us inject these funds into the economy to give some lift \nso that America can regain some sense of confidence that the fiscal \naffairs of the country are being managed in a way that affects this \neconomic downturn in a positive manner.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Florida who has been such a valued \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan. Who yields time to \nthe Senator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator from Michigan like?\n  Ms. STABENOW. I request 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes off the resolution to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank my esteemed leader from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my colleagues, my friends \nfrom Florida and Delaware and the Senator from Illinois, the author of \nthe amendment, on this approach of putting dollars directly into \npeople's pockets as a part of this budget process.\n  We do that in three ways: First, through an immediate tax cut. The \nPresident has proposed a tax cut, most of which would not take effect \nfor at least 6 years. We know that is not what is needed in this \neconomy. We need to be putting dollars directly into people's pockets \nimmediately as a stimulus. This would do that.\n  Secondly, we put money into people's pockets by lower interest rates. \nWe must keep the economy going. One of the reasons the economy has done \nas well as it has in the last 8 years is because we began to \nsystematically pay down the debt so our mortgage payments could go \ndown, our car payments could go down, college loan payments could go \ndown. That is a second way we put money back in people's pockets.\n  The third way is to guarantee we keep this economy going so people \nhave a job. This package does all three of those things. It stimulates \nthe economy so we can continue to focus on creating good-paying jobs \nfor people so they can care for their families and have the resources \nthey need.\n  It puts tax dollars, this year, directly into people's pockets, and \nit puts dollars in their pockets by allowing them to refinance their \nmortgage, as we continue to pay down the debt so interest rates come \ndown.\n  It is incredibly important we act immediately. We heard over and over \nin the Budget Committee that if we were going to have any impact \nthrough a tax cut, it needs to be immediate. We can do that immediately \nand at the same time address debt reduction and critical investments \nthat we know will help keep the economy going for the future.\n  I support these efforts. It is very important we act immediately. We \ncan do that right now. We can make a difference for families right now \nand stimulate this economy immediately so we can continue to make sure \nthat families benefit from the economy we have had of the last 8 years.\n  My distinguished colleague from Illinois, who is the chief sponsor \nand leader in this effort, is in the Chamber. I yield back my time and \ngive the Senator from Illinois an opportunity to address his amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Domenici, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Durbin amendment be laid aside and that \nSenator Bennett be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  I further ask consent that the debate run concurrently on both first-\ndegree amendments and be limited to 60 minutes equally divided, and \nfollowing that time, the amendments be laid aside.\n  I further ask consent that no amendments to these amendments be in \norder prior to the votes just described and the votes occur in a \nstacked sequence, first, in relation to the Durbin amendment, and then \nin relation to the amendment offered on behalf of Senator Domenici, \nbeginning at 6 p.m., with 10 minutes for closing remarks equally \ndivided prior to the 6 p.m. stacked votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, the only reservation I \nhave is I hope I have an opportunity at this time to speak for about 15 \nor 20 minutes on my amendments as we had agreed to under a previous \nunanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, so long as it comes off the time of the \namendment, there is no objection on this side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, the previous agreement \nwith respect to the Senator from Illinois was that the 20 minutes he \nhad reserved would come off the resolution, not off the amendment. We \nwill now be changing a previous agreement if we do that.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3468]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEE TO MEET\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent the Committee on the Judiciary \nbe authorized to meet to conduct a hearing on Thursday, April 5, at \n10:00 a.m. in Senate Dirksen 226.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank everyone for helping on this agreement. I think \nwe have reached an agreement with which everybody agrees.\n  I ask consent the Durbin amendment be laid aside and Senator Bennett \nbe recognized to offer an amendment.\n  I further ask consent the debate run concurrently on both first-\ndegree amendments--both of them--and be limited to 60 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form and, following that time, the amendments be \nlaid aside.\n  I further ask consent that no amendments to those amendments be in \norder prior to votes just described and the votes occur in a stacked \nsequence, first in relation to the Durbin amendment and then in \nrelation to the Bennett amendment, beginning at a time determined by \nthe two leaders. Further, I ask consent that following that debate, \nSenator Smith of Oregon be recognized to offer an amendment and there \nbe 15 minutes of debate equally divided between Senator Smith and \nSenator Wyden and, following that debate, the amendment be temporarily \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the only \npoint I would like to add is that after Senator Bennett's second-degree \nor substitute amendment is laid down, I would like to have right of \nrecognition first.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me be clear. What the Senator from Illinois is \nasking, as I understand it, is after Senator Bennett's amendment has \nbeen laid down, that he receive the first right of recognition.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would like \nto see this written agreement. I may not have objection, but I would \nlike to see what we are doing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 216\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 216.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To call for a quick stimulus for the American economy, linked \n    to a long-term stimulus to guarantee economic expansion and job \n creation, and oppose a $439 billion tax increase that would threaten \n                            economic growth)\n\n       On page 2, line 17, decrease the amount by $31,140,000,000.\n       On page 2, line 18, decrease the amount by $10,606,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 1, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 2, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 3, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 4, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 5, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 6, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 7, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 8, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $31,140,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 16, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 17, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 18, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $0.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this may be one of the most important \ndebates we will have about this budget resolution because at issue in \nthis debate, with the Durbin amendment and the Bennett amendment, is a \nvery simple proposition. It is this: America's economy needs a shot in \nthe arm. It needs help immediately--not a year from now, not 5 years \nfrom now, not 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 years from now, but immediately.\n  What I am proposing with the Durbin amendment is to take from the \nsurplus of some $97 billion, which we know we will have this year on \nthe budget we are debating, $60 billion of that surplus and return it \nto the American people as quickly as we can prudently return it so we \nwill give that spending power back to families in America immediately. \nThat is what I am proposing.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Utah proposes to stay with \nPresident Bush's approach. They believe in it on their side of the \naisle. I understand that. But they will have to concede this point. If \nthey prevail, there will be no immediate relief for taxpayers--none, \nzero, no help. I can tell you for families across Illinois and across \nthe Nation there is an immediate need for a helping hand.\n\n  Let me tell you about this amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a second?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I inform my colleagues that the Bennett amendment takes \nthe two tax accelerations that the Senator from Illinois has in his \nfirst 2 years. If I am correct, the Senator has an additional tax \nincrease of $31 billion in 2002 and $11 billion in 2003. We put that in \nour amendment. The difference is that we reduce or eliminate the tax \ncut, and in subsequent years we drop that. But we took the first 2 \nyears of accelerated tax cuts that the Senator has, and that is going \nto be in the Bennett amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I see there has been a modification to the amendment \nsince it was given to us earlier. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \nclarifying that point.\n  If there are any additional modifications, I hope you will bring them \nto our attention as well.\n  Let me tell you what we are proposing with this tax stimulus package: \na one-time tax refund check for all people who pay income or payroll \ntaxes of $600 per couple and $300 per individual. A new 10-percent tax \nbracket applies to the first $12,000 of income for every married couple \nin America, whatever their gross income may be, and $6,000 for single \nfilers. The total 2001 tax cut will be $900 per couple and $450 per \nindividual.\n  This is the first step in the Democratic tax cut agenda. The reason \nwhy people believe this is an important first step is that it deals \nwith reality, and not with speculation. It deals with the reality of an \neconomy that has slowed down and the reality of families who need a \nhelping hand.\n  It provides a rebate to families, and within a matter of weeks they \nwill be receiving it. This kind of timely tax assistance is going to be \nimportant across the Nation. Whether you are paying electric bills in \nCalifornia, or heating bills in Illinois, you have had a tough winter.\n  I can tell you from my family experience and the people I have spoken \nto in\n\n[[Page S3469]]\n\nmy State that their heating costs have gone up. People are saying: We \nwould like a helping hand, Senator. If you are going to talk about tax \nrelief, don't talk about a theory in the future. Help us now. Show us \nthat this is something beyond political chin music and that you are \nactually dealing with reality.\n  The Durbin tax cut applies immediately. Let me tell you why it is \nimportant. The Democratic stimulus plan would provide immediate tax \ncuts for all taxpayers.\n  President Bush's tax cut of $1.6 trillion, which was his first \nproposal, leaves behind 23 million taxpayers in America. The \nRepublicans supporting this proposal say they aren't really taxpayers; \nthat all they pay are payroll taxes; and they do not pay real taxes. \nTell the 23 million Americans who pay payroll taxes but not income \ntaxes that they aren't facing a tax burden. They are. Quite honestly, \nthey are the people who are facing a tougher burden than most because \nthey are in lower income categories.\n  The President right now is holding the economy hostage. He is holding \nit hostage to his $1.6 trillion proposal. What Senator Bennett and \nothers have said is, if you want to talk about an immediate stimulus, \nyou can only have it if you buy the whole program. You have to buy the \nwhole package. You have to accept $1.6 trillion over 10 years or we are \nnot going to be signing up for any kind of stimulus right now.\n\n  I think that is very shortsighted. I don't think it is fair to \nfamilies across America. I don't think it is responsible to the real \nserious economic problem that we face. Our plan is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma makes an important point. We believe the \noverall tax cut, the long-term tax cut, should be a responsible, \nprudent, manageable figure, and something that won't drive us back into \ndeficits.\n  The Republicans think that the President's projections of what will \nhappen to America 5 or 10 years from now are as reliable as they can \nbe.\n  We know that 6 months ago when Chairman Greenspan, our economic guru \nin America, was looking at the economy he got it all wrong. Six months \nago he said we had to raise interest rates; that the economy was \nheating up too fast. He was wrong. This man with all the information \nand all of the wisdom didn't get it right. But the White House is \ntelling us that the President can get it right--not just 6 months from \nnow but 6 years from now; he can tell you what the American economy is \ngoing to produce. If you were a stockbroker or an adviser, you could \nget rich if you had that kind of confidence in the end results. \nOrdinary people don't. Economists are often wrong.\n  Let me tell you about this tax cut and what it means.\n  The American income tax system is a system built on stair steps. \nEverybody pays the bottom rate of 15 percent. Then, of course, as your \nincome increases, the incremental dollars are taxed at different \nlevels--28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent, and beyond.\n  We are proposing a permanent tax cut for all Americans across the \nboard who pay income taxes from 15 percent to 20 percent so that the \nrichest in America as well as those in the lowest income categories \npaying income taxes will benefit.\n  The President's proposal, on the other hand, says, let's provide the \nlion's share of the benefits to those right here at the highest income \ncategories. The President's tax cut gives 43 percent of all the tax \nbenefits to people making over $319,000 a year--43 percent. That is not \nfair.\n  The Democratic approach says everyone benefits across the board. The \nrichest down to the lowest in income pay an income tax. The Durbin \namendment provides that tax relief.\n  Let me give you an idea why that is important. Eighty-one percent of \nall the taxpayers' benefits will go to those who pay the 15-percent \nrate on income tax. When we reduce this rate, it means that 81 percent \nof the taxpayers in America are going to benefit from this rate cut.\n  If you just provide the rate cuts for the higher income categories, \nyou can find that, frankly, smaller and smaller percentages of \nAmericans will benefit.\n  We want the benefit to go to everyone in America. I can tell you that \nthe home heating bills in Illinois went to people of all income \ngroups--not just to the poor or to the rich but everybody. The folks \nwho got hit the hardest were those in the lower income categories.\n  When you take a look at the source of individual tax collection in \nAmerica, here is an interesting statistic: 57 percent of the individual \ntax collection comes from income taxes and 37 percent from payroll \ntaxes.\n  Do not forget that President Bush in his tax cut and Senator Bennett \nin his amendment leave these people behind. They do not provide the \nassistance that is needed so that people paying payroll taxes also get \nsome benefit from the tax cut.\n\n  If you look at the total Government revenues by source, you can see \nthat 50 percent comes from the income tax but 32 percent comes from \npayroll taxes.\n  President Bush ignores this reality. President Bush's tax cut does \nnot provide that kind of tax benefit.\n  Let's talk for a moment about a stimulus and whether it is needed. I \nam going to quote some sources of which I think Senator Bennett will be \nproud. This is our new President, George Bush, from the Washington Post \nof January 15 this year:\n\n       I am open to any suggestions people have, particularly as \n     it relates to making sure that the economy gets the kick-\n     start it needs.\n\n  I think that is a pretty good endorsement of the Durbin amendment.\n  Let me see. This is another one from President Bush that is better, \non February 7, when the President said:\n\n       The economy is slowing down, and we need to act, and act as \n     quickly as we possibly can. The goal is to get money into the \n     pockets of the working people as quickly as we can.\n\n  Part of the Durbin amendment says the Senate will not go home until \nwe vote this tax cut. That is right. We may have to put off Passover \nobservance. We may have to put off a bit of our observance of our \nEaster holiday. But we ought to observe the obvious; that is, the \nAmerican people do not need our speeches. They need our help. If they \nare going to get our help, we shouldn't leave town saying that we got \nthe budget resolution passed, and in a couple of weeks we will come \nback and think of something new. This is something new. This is tax \nrelief that is real, tangible, and immediate. It says in this amendment \nwhich I have introduced that we will immediately take the House tax \nbill that has come over here, put this tax into it, pass it in the \nSenate, and send it back to them when they come back to town in a \ncouple of weeks and move on it.\n  We will be able to say to the American people, almost to the tax day \nof April 15, that you are going to be assured that a tax rebate is \ngoing to come your way and help your family.\n  There are quotes from a very learned and esteemed colleague of \nMinnesota, a spokesman for Senator Pete Domenici, chairman of the \nBudget Committee, who said:\n\n       Senator Domenici is willing to put off consideration of the \n     marriage penalty relief, estate tax repeal, and other \n     elements of the Bush tax plan. But he said the stimulus tax \n     cut and the reductions in the personal income tax rates must \n     be in the same bill. Sixty billion dollars without the \n     marginal rate cuts doesn't tell taxpayers that help is on the \n     way. It puts them in the boat without any oars.\n  That is a quote from a staff person of Senator Domenici in the \nWashington Post on March 24 of this year.\n  We have good news for the Senator from New Mexico. We not only have a \nboat; we have the oars. We are providing a rebate directly to the \nfamilies, and we are cutting the tax rate permanently, so families know \ntheir tax burden is going to be reduced.\n  We have more comments from President Bush. And they just keep getting \nbetter about the Durbin amendment. Here is one from the Detroit News on \nMarch 27. The President said:\n\n       I'm listening to what different members have to say. The \n     key thing is, we have to have meaningful, real tax relief . . \n     . to get money in people's pockets to serve as a stimulus for \n     the economy.\n\n  I want to thank the President for those kind words of encouragement.\n  Then on March 28, in the Orlando Sentinel, the President said, again:\n\n       We must put more money in the hands of consumers in the \n     short term and restore confidence and optimism for the long \n     term.\n\n  He goes on to make that point.\n  My friends, the sad reality is, unless and until we pass a tax rebate \nthat has teeth in it--that means that a check will be coming to \nfamilies across\n\n[[Page S3470]]\n\nAmerica, not in a matter of a year or two or beyond but right now--that \nwe are not going to see this economy turn around as quickly as it \nmight. The benefits, of course, to an economy turnaround are pretty \nobvious.\n  You pick up the Washington Post this morning, and you go to the \nBusiness section and look at the Dow Jones or go to the New York \nTimes--the same story; it is an up-and-down roller coaster but mainly \ndown. People across this country who have 401(k)s and IRAs understand \nthat that little nest egg they put aside for security and safety in \ntheir retirement has been battered pretty badly over the last 6 months \nor a year. We believe we can get this economy back on track.\n  During the Clinton-Gore administration, we had unparalleled \nprosperity in this country. We can return to those days, but we have to \nreturn to them with the vision of what makes the economy move forward. \nWhat helps it move forward is when consumers have some confidence, \nconfidence that they can pay their bills, confidence that this economy \nis going to be there, so they can turn around and buy a car, a washer \nand dryer, maybe remodel the kitchen--whatever is important to their \nfamily--pay off some tuition bills for their kids.\n  We want to put money in their pocket to make it happen. The Durbin \namendment really addresses that directly.\n  I say to those on the other side who believe you cannot really offer \na stimulus and this kind of tax cut to families unless you talk about \nwhat is going to happen in America over the next 10 years, that is an \nimportant debate. Let's stick with that debate. Let's have it, but \nlet's not let that debate hold hostage the idea of a stimulus right \nnow, a stimulus that can help the American economy turn around.\n  I do not believe the support for this idea comes exclusively from \nSenator Domenici or President Bush. I think it comes from the people I \nrepresent in Illinois, and I will bet most of the other States that are \nrepresented in this Senate.\n  I ask my colleagues, let's pass this budget and immediately take up \nH.R. 3 and substitute this bipartisan stimulus package and get checks \nout to every taxpaying American. Let's do this before we leave for any \nkind of a break. Then, when we come back, let's debate the marriage tax \npenalty, let's debate the estate tax, the IRA/pension bill, the \ncharitable giving bill, the ESEA bill, the minimum wage, and so many \nother important issues.\n\n  This does not have to be the end of tax cuts. This does not have to \nbe the end of debating bills such as the Senate of old. Over the last 2 \nweeks I have been heartened that this Senate has really reverted to \nwhat it was for so many decades, a gathering of men and women who \nstudied an important issue and then came to the floor to offer \namendments and debate them. We did that on campaign finance reform. We \ncan do it on our tax policy.\n  The vote yesterday suggested there is a bipartisan sentiment to move \naway from President Bush's $1.6 trillion figure to one that is more \nmanageable. We believe we can justify a $745 billion or $750 billion \ntax cut and also dedicate resources in our surplus to important other \npriorities.\n  Now the Republicans say: Oh, there they go again; if we don't give it \nall away in tax cuts, these Democrats will spend it. Well, we want to \nput money into a stimulus package, have a tax cut right now. We also \nbelieve we can pay down more of the national debt. If that is what they \ncall tax and spend, I don't buy it, but I certainly think paying down \nour national debt is one of the best investments for our future and for \nour Nation. We collect $1 billion in taxes a day to pay interest on our \nold debt of $5.7 trillion. I think we ought to try to reduce that debt \nas much as possible. The Democrats reduce more of the national debt \nthan the Republicans do with President Bush's approach.\n  We also believe it is naive to ignore the reality that we will need \nto invest more money in Medicare and Social Security. In 10 years, 53 \nmillion Americans will be drawing Social Security as a retirement. In \n10 years, 43 million Americans will rely on Medicare.\n  Should we spend money on those two programs to reform them and make \nthem stronger? Absolutely. We know that balloon payment is coming. The \nDemocrats set money aside so we can make that investment when the baby \nboomers arrive. We do not want to face any sticker shock when it comes \nto the expenses of those two invaluable social programs in America.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the floor now. I see my \ncolleague, Senator Lieberman, a cosponsor of this amendment, is here to \njoin me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, may I inquire as to what the time \nsituation is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 28 minutes 48 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. And on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The other side has 13 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, may I be notified when there are only 13 \nminutes left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 216, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nbe modified. I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 2, line 17, decrease the amount by $31,140,000,000.\n       On page 2, line 18, decrease the amount by $10,606,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 1, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 2, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 3, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 4, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 5, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 6, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 7, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 8, increase the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 13, increase the amount by $31,140,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 14, increase the amount by $10,606,000,000.\n       On page 3, line 15, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 16, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 17, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 18, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 19, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 20, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 21, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 3, line 22, decrease the amount by $0.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the \nstatements of the Senator from Illinois, who says we need to kick-start \nthe economy. He went on at great length quoting Senator Domenici and \nPresident Bush about how we absolutely need to do this, perhaps \nignoring the statement by the Senator from Oklahoma that my amendment \nincludes the amounts he says will kick-start the economy.\n  The issue is not, Do we both agree that there must be something to \nkick-start the economy? The issue is whether or not, having kick-\nstarted it, we then try to kill it at the back end.\n  Let's make no mistake about what this amendment is about. This \namendment is not about stimulating the economy in the short run, \nbecause Republicans and Democrats agree, and my amendment has exactly \nthe same numbers in it as the amendment on the other side. The \ndisagreement is on what happens on the back end.\n  In the name of stimulating the economy in the short term, they want \nto kill the tax cut in the long term. That is what this is about. It \nmay be couched in other kinds of rhetoric, but basically this is a \nfurther attempt on\n\n[[Page S3471]]\n\nthe part of the Democrats in the Senate to see to it that President \nBush will not get his tax cut, so that the headline in the Washington \nPost will be ``Bush Suffers A Defeat.'' That is what they are after. \nThis is not about the economy. This is not about paying heating bills \nfor poor people in Illinois. This is about the political victory of the \nSenate Democrats to get the headline that says ``Bush Suffers A \nDefeat.''\n  Look at the numbers. The total effect of the underlying amendment, to \nwhich my amendment is a second degree, would be to cut, over a 10-year \nperiod, the total size of the tax cut by $418 billion. Right now, if \nthe Harkin amendment is not overturned on reconsideration, the tax cut \nhas been scaled down from the $1.6 trillion President Bush asked for to \n$1.1 trillion. If this amendment passes, that will be scaled down \nfurther to $746 billion, which is below the number the Democratic \nleader offered in the first place as the logical size of the tax cut.\n  This is a stealth attempt to make sure, in the name of stimulating \nthe economy, that the tax cut gets cut, and cut, and cut.\n  I suggest that there are other amendments lying in the weeds which, \nadded to this one, will bring it down even lower than the 746. That is \na prophecy; prophecies can be wrong. One thing is not wrong is the 746 \nnumber. If the underlying amendment passes, the total size of the tax \ncut is cut to 746. That is what this is all about.\n  We talk about stimulating the economy, and we need to do it now. Once \nagain, my amendment has exactly the same numbers the underlying \namendment has. Make no mistake: We are not debating stimulating the \neconomy. We are debating eviscerating the Bush tax cut.\n  I wish I had this better than secondhand. It was reported to a group \nof us yesterday. The source given was Alan Blinder. I am prepared to be \ncorrected if it is wrong. It makes sense. It is right, and I will share \nit with the Senate with those caveats around it.\n  Alan Blinder said, if you want to stimulate the economy and you pass \na long-term rate structure reduction, the net benefit is 1, whatever 1 \nis. We are on a scale now. If you do a quick fix kind of stimulus, the \nnet benefit to the economy is, compared to 1, .5. If you do a complete \nrebate of sending out checks, the net effect on the economy is .3.\n  We are willing to talk about something that, on the scale I have just \ndescribed, would be a .5, but we are not willing to sacrifice the 1 in \norder to do it. We are not willing to kill the most fundamental and \nbeneficial stimulus for the economy, long term as well as short term, \nin the name of a short-term stimulus that makes for good speeches but \nbad economics.\n  We hear a lot of class warfare rhetoric. We heard it again from the \nSenator from Illinois: We must take care of the little people; we must \ndo something, not for the rich, we must do something for the people at \nthe bottom.\n  Every time we have had testimony before the Banking Committee, on \nwhich I sit, or the Joint Economic Committee, on which I am now vice \nchairman, from Chairman Greenspan or other distinguished economists, \nthe question comes up: Who benefits the most when the economy is sound \nand doing well? The answer is always: The people at the bottom.\n  The best thing we can do for the people at the bottom is see to it \nthat the economy is structurally sound and growing. The best stimulus \nis to see that the people who control capital have confidence in the \nfuture. They will start making the capital investments that create the \njobs. They will start putting in place the structural pattern that they \nhave interrupted because they have lost confidence. And that can come \nby the passage of the Bush tax cut, which may or may not have any \nimmediate stimulation in terms of the people in Illinois the Senator \nrefers to, but will have the kind of impact that will produce both \nshort-term stimulus and long-term stability.\n  That is what this debate is all about. Are we going to get excited \nabout the short-term stimulus being the only thing to do and kill the \nlong-term stability on the basis that we don't know what the numbers \nare going to be? Or are we going to do both in a prudent fashion?\n  I hear a lot of talk about the heating bills. I suggest to the \nSenator from Illinois and other Senators that if they want to deal with \nheating bills, they ought to deal with the energy crisis and not try to \nfiddle round with taxes. But that is another debate for another time.\n  Let me address one other point that keeps coming up. We must pay down \nthe national debt. Both sides want to pay down the national debt. Let \nus not pretend that is an exclusively Democratic position or an \nexclusively Republican position. Let's not go through the motions of \nsaying we are the ones who want to pay down the national debt. Let's \nask the question: How much national debt can we prudently pay down?\n\n  Once again, the numbers make it clear that the Bush tax proposal is a \nprudent and intelligent attack on the national debt that will bring us \nto the place where we want to be in an intelligent fashion.\n  I spent some time with officials from the Treasury Department. I \ndon't have time in this debate to go into it in detail; I will at some \nfuture point. These officials, quite frankly, if we want to put a \npolitical cast on it, are holdovers from the Clinton administration. I \ngot the numbers directly from the Treasury. I didn't get them from a \ncolumnist. I didn't get them filtered through staff. I got them \ndirectly from Clinton-appointed officials at the Treasury Department. I \nam absolutely satisfied that the level of debt being paid down by the \nBush tax cut is prudent and fits perfectly with the numbers they have \ngiven us.\n  These numbers are reality. These numbers are not projections. These \nnumbers are very clear. We don't have time now, in the restricted \nagreement we have, for me to go into these numbers in any great length.\n  Fundamentally, we must understand this. If we pay down the debt too \nrapidly, we will have to go to holders of the debt that are not yet \nmaturing and say: Will you give us the opportunity to pay you in \nadvance? For that, we need to pay them a premium.\n  Right now, 42 percent of the debt is held by foreign sources. The \nlargest chunk of that is held in Japan. This has been going up \ndramatically. People say: Does that mean foreigners are buying more of \nour debt? No. It means the debt is being paid down among American \nholders, and foreign holders are hanging onto it. That is why the \npercentage of foreign holders of the debt is going up. The total debt \nis going down, but their total numbers are staying about the same.\n  I don't want to be in the position of going to foreign holders of the \ndebt and saying to them we want to pay them a premium to buy their debt \nback early, just to satisfy some political rhetoric and political \npoints.\n  I conclude as I began. This is not a debate about whether we will \nhave a short-term stimulus because the numbers in my amendment are \nidentical to the numbers in the Democratic amendment. This is a debate \nabout whether or not we kill the Bush tax cut long term. As long as we \nunderstand that, as long as we understand that the effect of the \nunderlying amendment would be to bring the size of the tax cut down \nbelow the level the Democratic leader has endorsed, we will understand \nwhat we are talking about. Otherwise, we will waste our time in \nrhetoric about short-term stimulus, when there is, in fact, no \ndifference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, will the Chair inform us of the time \nremaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has 13 minutes \n15 seconds. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has 17 minutes 35 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from Oklahoma desire going now? The \nSenator from Connecticut has requested 5 minutes, 6 minutes. I would be \nprepared to yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized for 6 minutes and 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend and colleague \nfrom North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S3472]]\n\n  It seems to me as we deal with this budget resolution and we think \nabout the condition of our economy and of the Federal Government books, \nwe have a short-term need and a long-term opportunity. The long-term \nopportunity is to constructively use the surplus that the American \npeople have built up over the 1990s, to continue our prosperity, to \ncontinue to act with fiscal responsibility, and to invest in the seeds \nof growth in our economy so that the private sector, which is where \njobs and growth are created, can in fact continue the growth in this \ndecade that we had in the last decade.\n  We also clearly have a short-term need. It has affected our longer-\nterm discussions because the obvious fact is that the economy, after a \nperiod of unprecedented growth, has now slowed. My friend from Utah \nused the word ``prophecy.'' We all would like to achieve some degree of \nit. I think it is fair to say that none of us has clear prophecy when \nit comes to our economy.\n  Now a $9 trillion economy is affected every day by the decision of \nnow 280 million people. We can't predict what they are going to do next \nweek, let alone 10 years from now.\n  The economy is slowing. We don't know how long this slowdown will \nlast or how deep it will go. That is why people on both sides of the \naisle and folks in the administration are now talking about trying to \nuse part of the surplus that we know will be there on October 1 of this \nyear, when the books close for the Federal Government on September 30, \nto use that to get some money out into the economy--not with any \nconfidence that it is going to make everything better in our economy \nbut with the confidence that it will help.\n  I spoke to a number of economists before I worked on the proposal \nthat underlies the amendment that my friend and colleague from Illinois \nand the Democratic leader offered, of which I am proud to be a \ncosponsor. I said to these business leaders and economists: What is a \nreasonable amount of money for us to try to get into people's pockets \nright away, in the next couple of months, to have an effect on the \neconomy? Interestingly, the consensus was $60 billion. That is a number \nthat has come up on both sides of the aisle in the Senate and from the \nadministration.\n  One business leader said economists told him we could expect a \nmultiplier effect of 1\\1/2\\ times so that we might--actually, by \nputting $60 billion back into the public's pockets right away--have a \n1\\1/2\\ times multiplier, or a $90 billion effect on the economy. That \nis 1 percent of the gross domestic product. That would be a tremendous \nresult and a great lift out of the slowdown.\n  Other experts told us they have done studies that, interestingly, \nhave focused on what taxpayers do with a refund check. I am sure the \nChair will not be surprised to hear that 70 percent of those checks are \nspent within 3 months. It is different than having a reduction in your \nwithholding. It is a check in hand. You may buy something you have \nneeded. Maybe you pay down a bill. Maybe, if you are a young worker, \nyou buy a CD or a new suit.\n  That is our short-term stimulus package, and the most important part \nof the amendment that is before the Senate now is the last paragraph \nsent to the Senate that ``the levels in this resolution assume that the \nSenate should discharge H.R. 3 from the Committee on Finance''--that is \nthe tax bill they sent over--``strike all after the enacting clause and \ninsert the text of the agreed upon $60 billion bipartisan economic \nstimulus package,'' including an immediate economic stimulus check for \neveryone in America who pays payroll taxes or income taxes.\n  That means everybody. If you don't make enough to pay an income tax, \nbut you are working and you have a lot of money taken out of your \npaycheck every week, every couple of weeks, you get $300. How did we \ncome to $300? Take 200 million taxpayers and put that into the $60 \nbillion we want to get into the economy. It comes out to $300 per \ntaxpayer.\n  If you are older and you pay income tax, but you don't have payroll \nwithdrawals or deductions, you still get the $300.\n  So the point of this amendment is let's do it now and help the \neconomy now. Let's not have it said a year from now that the Senate and \nthe Congress and the Government of the United States fiddled while the \nAmerican economy was slowing down. One positive step we can take is to \nadopt this amendment, substitute for the House tax bill sent over here, \nget a $300 check from the Federal Government into the hands and wallets \nand pocketbooks of the 200 million Americans who pay payroll or income \ntax, and let them go out and move this economy out of the dip it is in \nnow.\n  That is the vote we are casting. Don't hold short-term economic \nrelief hostage to the much more complicated, long-term, controversial \npartisan debate going on about how to spend the surplus for the next 10 \nyears. America needs help now. Let's do it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, on my time, may I ask the Senator from \nConnecticut a quick question? I ask unanimous consent that that be \nallowed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I ask the Senator from Connecticut why he did not \naddress at all the impact of his amendment on the President's tax cut \nlong term. As I said in my remarks, the amount in my amendment and the \namount in the Democratic amendment for a short-term stimulus is exactly \nthe same. But the effect of the Democratic amendment would be to cut \nthe total amount of the Bush tax cut down to $746 billion. I ask the \nSenator from Connecticut why he did not comment on that effect, and if \nhe has a comment now.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Senator from Utah. I did not comment \nbecause, for me, the distinguishing factor in this amendment is the \nshort-term economic stimulus and the particular method to achieve it, \nwhich is spelled out here, which is the substitute for the House tax \nbill. Those who framed the amendment consistently linked it with the \nlong-term tax cut that, as you know, most Democrats propose because we \nthink it is more fiscally responsible.\n  Mr. President, if I may return the question, is the Senator from Utah \nprepared to separate the short-term fiscal stimulus? Again, I think \nacross the aisle we agree that $60 billion is the number. We may \ndisagree about how to distribute it--to separate that from the longer \nterm, 10-year discussion about how to divide the surplus.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would be happy to discuss that with the \nSenator, but the Senator from Oklahoma is asking for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the regular order, the Senator from \nOklahoma controls the time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to reject the Durbin amendment. The Durbin amendment \nreduces the overall size of the tax bill. It stands at $1.6 trillion. \nAn amendment they offered last night reduced it by $448 billion. This \namendment reduces it by another $418 billion. In other words, \neliminating over half of President Bush's tax cut. If you want to make \nnews, go ahead. You got a nice headline: ``Senate Democrats Cut Bush \nTax Bill By a Third.'' My compliments. Now they want to go further and \nreduce the tax bill even below what the leaders recommend and adopt the \nDurbin amendment. If we adopt the Durbin amendment we will have a \nstimulus--I love my friend and colleague from Connecticut who says we \nwant a stimulus. There is a little stimulus in the front, but there are \na whole lot of tax increases in the back.\n  There is tax cut, in the Durbin amendment, in the first 2 years. My \nfriend and colleague from Utah , wants to match those figures and give \nat least that much of a tax cut in the first 2 years. What you don't \nread in the rest of the amendment is that Democrats increase taxes all \nthe way through for every other year. The net impact of it is to \nincrease taxes from the underlying resolution by $418 billion.\n  Senate Democrats, and one or two of our colleagues voted yesterday to \ncut the President's tax bill by $448 billion. This amendment cuts it by \nanother $418 billion. That is a net tax reduction that is less than \nwhat many people on the Democrat side said they would support. But they \nwant to do it under the guise of moving it up a little bit more\n\n[[Page S3473]]\n\nin a few years without hardly any tax cuts later. Maybe that is the \nsize of the tax reduction some people want.\n  They act as if they are writing a tax bill, which you cannot do on \nthe floor of the Senate in the budget resolution. And their argument is \nthat this is going to stimulate the economy. Why don't you just fly \nover a stadium and drop money out of an airplane? That will stimulate \nthe economy as well. They want to turn a tax bill into a spending \nprogram, without regard to who paid the taxes, or a tax cut for \ntaxpayers. We want to gut the President's tax bill. That is what this \nis really all about.\n\n  The tax bill they are proposing is fatally flawed and should not \npass, but that will be discussed and dealt with in a bipartisan manner \nin the Finance Committee. I am absolutely certain the proposal they \nhave made would never, should never, and will never pass Congress. \nGiving everybody $300--and now that has been raised to $450--is not \ngoing to happen.\n  The real purpose of the amendment is to reduce President Bush's tax \ncut. It was already reduced yesterday to $1.15 trillion over 10 years. \nNow they want to take another $418 billion out.\n  The net result would be a tax reduction over 10 years of $746 billion \nat a time when we have surpluses estimated to be $5.6 trillion. In \nother words, let us give President Bush less than half of what he asked \nfor. That is what this amendment does.\n  The net impact of this amendment is to have a net tax cut over the 10 \nyears of President Bush's proposal of $746 billion. That is basically \n45 percent of what President Bush originally requested. We cannot and \nwill not let this happen.\n  In the last couple of days, my friends on the Democratic side have \noffered five amendments to have higher taxes and higher spending. They \nwon on one of them yesterday. I consider that a setback, and I hope to \nrepair that damage before we are done by tomorrow night.\n  This amendment doubly complicates it. Yesterday we adopted the Harkin \namendment and we increased taxes from the underlying budget resolution \nof $448 billion. This increases taxes an additional $418 billion on top \nof the Harkin amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues not to go down this road. This would be a \nserious mistake. The tax proposal that was outlined would be a very \nserious mistake. Let us work together and see if we cannot have a tax \ncut and do some positive things to stimulate the economy.\n  My friend from Utah, Senator Bennett, has articulately stated that we \nwill come up with more money in the upfront years. We want to do it. We \nhave been trying to do it. Our budget resolution has $60 billion in \n2001.\n  We only have a few months left in 2001. We can increase year 2002 by \n$31 billion. That is what the amendment of my colleague from Utah says. \nWe will match that and also increase the level in 2003 by $11 billion. \nWe will have that amount of additional tax relief in the upfront years.\n  What I disagree with in the Conrad amendment is, other than the first \ntwo lines which cut taxes, there are dozens of lines that increase \ntaxes. Two lines cut taxes up front, but all the rest of the lines \nincrease taxes to a net total of $418 billion.\n  They adopted an amendment yesterday to reduce the tax cut by $448 \nbillion. If we adopt the Durbin amendment, we will also reduce the tax \ncut by another $418 billion. That is a total reduction of President \nBush's underlying budget of $866 billion, and total tax increases they \nhave adopted in the last 2 days. That would be a serious mistake, and I \nurge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to say that is not \nenough. Taxpayers are paying enormous surpluses, and President Bush \ngives one-fourth of that back to taxpayers. The taxpayers are paying in \nthe entire surplus, and we are saying taxpayers: We are going to let \nyou keep a fourth of it. The Democrats are saying: No, no, maybe one-\neighth; not quite an eighth; maybe the taxpayers get to keep one-\neighth. Then they want to give it to people who filed a return, whether \nthey paid taxes or not. I disagree with that totally and completely and \nurge my colleagues to vote no on the Durbin amendment and vote yes on \nSenator Bennett's amendment. They will be voted on at some point later \ntoday.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes off the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I will speak first about the broader \nperspective of what we have been doing on this resolution. The \nPresident of the United States put forth a budget and tax cut that \nbasically said if you take Medicare and Social Security surpluses off \nthe table, every penny of available on-budget surplus is used for a tax \ncut geared to the wealthiest Americans, hopefully trickling down.\n  We argue instead of doing that, we definitely need to protect \nMedicare and Social Security. Because the President uses all non-\nMedicare and Social Security money for his tax cut, he then spends \nMedicare; he moves all of the Medicare trust fund into spending.\n  We say, no, protect Medicare and Social Security and then let us do a \nbalanced approach. Let us use a third of what is projected--hopefully \nit will happen--for a tax cut, and that is what this amendment does. It \nreserves a third for a tax cut, putting a stimulus on the front end so \nwe can help the economy with money in people's pockets right now. Let \nus use a third for debt reduction, looking at long-term debt--and \npossibly if the surpluses do not materialize, that is our hedge so we \ndo not go into further debt--and let us use a third for critical \ninvestments in our people--education, lowering the cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  My concern with the comments of my friend from Utah, as a member of \nthe Budget Committee and talking about paying down the debt, is I have \nheard over and over, as the President has said, we cannot put more than \n$2 trillion into paying down the debt. We have to leave $1.2 trillion. \nIt cannot be any lower than that.\n  In the Budget Committee, we heard from more than one speaker that \n$2.6 trillion will naturally, between now and 2011, become available. \nWe will be able to redeem $2.6 trillion just by allowing it to come to \nmaturity over the next 11 years.\n\n  That is very different than what we are hearing today. Chairman \nGreenspan came to the Budget Committee and indicated a difference of \nopinion with the President saying that we could, in fact, pay down more \ndebt than what is in the President's budget. We support what Chairman \nGreenspan is talking about, with those who managed the money directly \nfor the past administration. We support the position of allowing the \n$2.6 trillion to mature over the next 11 years. We can do a better job \nof paying down the debt.\n  We put money in people's pockets in three ways: We give them a tax \ncut, which I strongly support--not only an immediate stimulus, but a \nlong-term tax cut--we pay down the debt, which puts money in people's \npockets by lowering their mortgage payment, car payment, and college \nloan, and other costs people have, and finally, we stimulate the \neconomy so people have a job, which is the most important way we put \nmoney in people's pockets.\n  I urge we support the Durbin amendment and oppose the amendment of my \ngood friend from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator from \nMichigan has expired.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. How much time is available on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 7 minutes 56 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I yield myself 3\\1/2\\ minutes and reserve the remainder \nof the time for the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Texas has a great line. He \nsays: Don't argue about facts; look them up. You can argue about \nopinions, but do not argue about facts.\n  The former senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, used to say: \nEverybody is entitled to his own opinions but not to his own \nfacts. That is why I went to the Treasury Department to try to get the \nfacts on the debt. I have heard people quote this, quote that. I\n\n[[Page S3474]]\n\nwent to the people who manage the debt. They said to me, as they began \nthe conversation: We have been managing debt for over 200 years. We \nknow how to do it.\n\n  I have the numbers. I will be glad to discuss them with any Senator. \nFundamentally, this is what it comes down to: The amount in the next 10 \nyears of national debt that cannot be paid off without paying a \npremium, factually, is roughly $800 billion. Alan Greenspan, before the \nBudget Committee, talked about 70-something. I round up to $800 \nbillion. The Treasury agrees with that number. However, they say we \ncannot go to that absolute number because we have to have some debt to \nhelp cash management.\n  If I can put it in the context of a family, you may have paid off all \nyour mortgages and paid off all your debt, but the paycheck and the \nbills don't always correspond exactly in time, so you pay the bills \nwith a credit card, which is debt. You may pay the credit card \ncompletely off every 30 days, but you have some debt to manage your \ncash situation, and the Treasury does. I said: How much money are we \ntalking about? And these Treasury officials who have no political ax to \ngrind said: We have to have about another $300 billion for cash \nmanagement purposes on top of the amount of debt Alan Greenspan was \ntalking about. If you add 800 to 300 you get $1.1 trillion, which is \nthe number President Bush has been talking about.\n  Those are the facts. We can look them up. We can have differences of \nopinion on everything else, but let's not keep fudging those facts.\n  The President's proposal with respect to debt paydown is the \nresponsible, proper proposal. It should not be factually challenged.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think this has been an excellent \ndiscussion and debate this afternoon. I will summarize it my way.\n  If this amendment is adopted, the so-called stimulus package from the \nother side, then the tax cut proposed by our President would be reduced \nto $746 billion. Understand, just doing the arithmetic, we would have \ntaken $854 billion of the President's tax cut and wiped it out. \nImagine, in the name of an economic stimulus package, we reduce that \nwhich stimulates the economy by $854 billion.\n  I say to Senators on both sides, if you have been worrying about \ntaking more and more away from the President's tax cut, you have a real \nhumdinger on your platter. This, combined with others, will make the \nPresident's tax package $746 billion, which is $854 billion less than \nhe asked for--and he thinks he is giving us a stimulus package. We are \nsaying $60 billion up front and $1.6 trillion over time, with marginal \nrate deductions, marriage tax penalty, child care credits, and the \nother things. We say that is exactly what the American economy needs as \na stimulus, short and long term. In the name of an economic stimulus \npackage, the tax cuts to the American people are reduced by more than \none-half, more than 50 percent.\n  Once again, Americans, if you have been sitting around thinking maybe \nCongress will do something right, maybe they will give us back some of \nour money, over half of it disappears. Between this amendment and a \nprevious Democrat amendment they have taken more than half of what you \nmight have expected. It is out the window. It is gone, gone at the \naltar of an alleged stimulus package. This is just following suit of \nalmost every amendment offered: Baucus Medicare, higher taxes, $156 \nbillion; Johnson agriculture, higher taxes, $88 billion; Harkin \neducation, $448 billion, higher taxes; Landrieu, $93 billion more; \nStabenow, $14 billion more. Adding them up, $798 billion is how much \nthey tried thus far to reduce the tax cuts for the American people.\n\n  Only one passed, Harkin, but it is still under consideration, so I \ndon't count it yet. Maybe it won't pass.\n  Having said that, if I have any remaining time, I yield it to Senator \nNickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and leader.\n  I say to the American public, Senator Domenici has done outstanding \nwork on a very difficult job. This is a tough process. He was right. I \nmentioned on the floor that the amendment that passed last night is \nbeing reconsidered. I don't want to be so presumptive as to say the \n$448 billion tax increase passed. It made a step towards passing, but \nit has not been finally passed. I appreciate your correcting me on that \nbecause the Senator is right.\n  The amendment Senator Durbin offered would also increase taxes from \nthe existing resolution, $418 billion. If you add the two together, it \nis $866 billion, well over half of the President's proposed tax \nreduction. I thank my friend and colleague. The Harkin amendment has \nnot yet been adopted, but if it is, and a lot of people are working on \nthe assumption that it is because it got an affirmative vote yesterday, \nthe combined impact would be $866 billion, and 55 percent of President \nBush's tax proposal just went out the door.\n  That is not the way to stimulate the economy. That is the point my \ncolleague and friend from New Mexico and Utah were making. I thank them \nfor that. I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Durbin amendment and \nvote in favor of Senator Bennett's amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. On behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield myself the \nremaining time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 3 minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, no one is talking about raising taxes. No one on \neither side is talking about raising taxes. We are talking about a \nbudget for next year and conceivably for 10 years. What are the values \nand the priorities of the American people? That is what we are talking \nabout in this discussion.\n  I suggest when we look at the President's proposal, if we lock up \nSocial Security and Medicare, we have $2.5 trillion to make decisions \nabout values and priorities of the American people. The President's tax \ncut, when added up, takes every penny. There is zero for education \nincreases, zero for prescription drug coverage, and we all have heard \nwhy we need to be doing this.\n  Unfortunately, in the President's budget, in order to pay for \nspending, Medicare is used because there is nothing left after his tax \ncut. He takes Medicare out of the lockbox and spends it.\n  We are suggesting and addressing the need for long-term stimulus. It \naddresses the need to protect Social Security and Medicare, provide a \ntax cut, short-term stimulus. We all support a long-term tax cut. Pay \ndown the debt to the maximum amount and make sure we have critical \ninvestments to allow the economy to proceed. That is the debate.\n  Yes, we have a fundamental difference. We are not willing to touch \nMedicare and Social Security. We say hands off Medicare, hands off \nSocial Security completely. Let's make sure we are paying down the \ndebt. Let's make sure we give tax cuts. Let's make sure we invest in \nthe priorities of the American people.\n  We can do all of it if we do it the right way. As I said before, \nthere is more than one way to put money in people's pockets. We can put \nit in their pockets through a tax cut, and the stimulus Senator Durbin \nis talking about is exactly what is needed in order to stimulate this \neconomy. Then we can focus on longer term tax cuts. It allows us to pay \ndown maximum debt. That puts money in people's pockets because they can \nrefinance that mortgage and that car payment. And it allows us to \ninvest in critical needs without touching the Medicare trust fund.\n  That is what we are arguing. I strongly encourage my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to support the short-term economic stimulus \nthat will allow us to protect the Medicare trust fund and that will \nallow us to pay down the maximum amount of debt. Then we will work \ntogether, no question about it, to continue to provide tax relief that \nis focused particularly on middle-class taxpayers, small businesses, \nfamily farmers. We want to work together to be able to do that and make \nsure we\n\n[[Page S3475]]\n\nare reflecting the true values and priorities of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a table that shows the tax reduction Senator Durbin \noffers in the first 2 years and the tax increases he has in the years \n2004 through 2011, which net a total tax increase, compared to the \nunderlying resolution, of $418 billion for a net tax of $746, assuming \nthe budget resolution was amended by Senator Harkin. I want this to be \nin the Record so everyone can see the total evisceration of the Bush \ntax cut should this amendment be agreed to.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Conrad, I yield to \nSenator Stabenow 1 minute off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I reiterate, we are in the process of \ndetermining the priorities for the country. No one is talking about a \ntax cut. This amendment would provide an immediate stimulus this year. \nPresident Bush's tax cut for the most part does not take effect for 6 \nyears. We then want to take the next step and work together on a long-\nterm tax package.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 3 minutes off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I understand once again today there has \nbeen talk that somebody here is for a tax increase. Nobody is for a tax \nincrease. All the proposals on both sides of the aisle are for \nsignificant tax cuts. The fundamental difference here is on the \nquestion of how much debt reduction we do.\n  On our side we think there ought to be more debt reduction than is \nbeing proposed on the other side. We have a total of $3.65 trillion of \nthe $5.6 trillion projected surplus set aside for short-term and long-\nterm debt reduction. President Bush is setting aside $2 trillion. So we \nhave nearly twice as much set aside for debt reduction as does the \nPresident. He has a tax cut that is about twice as big as ours. That is \nthe fundamental difference between the two sides.\n  I understand Senator Bennett said you can't do more debt reduction \nthan the President proposes. That is just not so. We had detailed \ntestimony before the Senate Budget Committee by the man who ran the \ndebt reduction program in the U.S. Treasury Department under the \nprevious administration. He says you can reduce far more of the \nnational debt than the Bush administration is calling for. In fact, \nPresident Bush says you can only reduce the publicly held debt by $2 \ntrillion. Mr. Gensler, who was in charge of the debt reduction program \nin the previous administration, pointed out that $2.6 trillion of the \ndebt actually comes due during this 10-year period. You can eliminate \nall of that. That is $2.6 trillion instead of the $2 trillion the \nPresident says is available for debt reduction. But even more than \nthat, we did a detailed cashflow analysis.\n\n  I yield myself an additional minute off the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We did a detailed cashflow analysis of debt reduction. \nWhat we found is--this is the President's line, the green line. That \nsaves $2 trillion--reduces the publicly held debt by $2 trillion.\n  The red line is our publicly held debt reduction line. It would \nreduce publicly held debt--publicly held debt is currently $3.4 \ntrillion. It would reduce that debt by $2.9 trillion--$900 billion more \nthan the President's plan.\n  This line shows the unredeemable debt line. What this chart reveals \nis there is absolutely no problem of cash buildup, even if you use $2.9 \ntrillion to reduce publicly held debt.\n  I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Somebody watching me may be very quick with figures and \nsay: Gee, Senator Conrad is saying the Democrats believe you can reduce \n$2.9 trillion of the $3.4 trillion publicly held debt. But on his \nprevious chart he showed the Democrats have reserved $3.65 trillion for \ndebt reduction. How can both those things be true?\n  Simply, they are both accurate, they are both true, because we are \ndealing with short-term debt and long-term debt. The short-term debt is \nthe publicly held debt, which is $3.4 trillion. We would pay that down \nby $2.9 trillion. But, in addition to that, we reserve $750 billion \nmore for long-term debt reduction. The long term-debt that is building, \nthat our Federal accounting system does not take account of because of \nthe long-term unfunded liability for Social Security and Medicare, we \nset aside $750 billion for that purpose. The other side does not set \naside a single penny--not a dime--for the long-term debt that is \nbuilding for this country.\n  That is the fundamental difference between our two sides. We believe \nwe ought to pay down more of the short-term and long-term debt and have \nless of a tax cut. It is still a substantial tax cut, one that would \npermit rate reductions, reform of the estate tax, and also address the \nmarriage penalty.\n  That is the fundamental difference. I do not want to lose sight of it \nin the bric-a-brac and the back and forth. That is the best summary I \ncan provide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Parliamentary inquiry: It is part of the \nunanimous consent agreement that Senator Wyden and I have 15 minutes \nequally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 240\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I have an amendment I send to the \ndesk.

Mr. President, when I go home to Oregon I am \noften asked what is the biggest surprise I have had as a Senator. I \noften and without any hesitation answer that my biggest surprise is \nthat one of my closest friendships in the Senate, and one of the most \nconstructive relationships I have in the Senate, is with my former \nopponent, the senior Senator from Oregon, Ron Wyden. After I was \nelected to replace Mark Hatfield, he and I became more than colleagues; \nwe became friends, confidants, and worked every year to try to \nestablish an agenda that helps and serves the interests of our State as \nwell as our country.\n  This year we have followed that tradition, announced a bipartisan \nagenda, toured our State with seven joint townhalls, and tried to \nlisten to the people as to what they wanted. We heard many things. We \nheard, ``Tax cuts.'' I am for President Bush's tax cut. I make no \napology for that.\n  I believe our economy needs that. I believe our country needs help. I \nbelieve we need to be reminded that we are a democratic free enterprise \nsociety and not a democratic socialist society.\n  But having said that, I believe, using the surpluses we are \nbountifully blessed with, there are things we can and should do.\n  In Oregon, we have a proud tradition of caring for the \nunderprivileged and the uninsured. I was a State senator when we set \nabout funding the Oregon Health Plan. We accomplished that, but the job \nis not done in helping the uninsured.\n  It seems to me appropriate that in a time when we are looking to cut \nsubstantial taxes from the paychecks of the American people that we \nshould take time to help those who also work but who do not enjoy some \nof the basics of American living, which is health care.\n  There are 170 million Americans who enjoy the best health care in the \nworld. They are Americans. But of our American citizens, there are 43 \nmillion who have no health insurance. Many of those folks are working \nAmericans as well.\n  But Senator Wyden and I propose, along with the bipartisan coalition, \nto provide in this budget $28 billion over 3 years to further narrow \nthat gap of the uninsured.\n  Our plan will build on past actions to give 15 million to 20 million \nof these uninsured Americans access to affordable quality health \ninsurance without creating huge new Government programs.\n  First, our plan will give businesses incentives to make quality \nhealth insurance more affordable to their low-income workers. Our plan \nwill give businesses a tax credit if they chip in more to offer quality \nhealth care to their low-income employees. Many low-wage employees are \nworking hard, but we are having trouble paying the full amount for \nhealth insurance.\n  Second, our plan will extend Medicaid coverage to more low-income \nAmericans. Many low-income adults who cannot afford or are not offered \nprivate health insurance would now be eligible under this proposal for \nMedicaid coverage.\n  Finally, we will give the State the option to extend the highly \nsuccessful CHIP program, or the SCHIP program, the State Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. We will work to extend these benefits to the \nparents of these children.\n  We are trying to say in this great society that we can narrow this \nuninsured gap. I believe if we can't do it now, we will never be able \nto do it.\n  Senator Wyden and I are bringing together an extraordinary coalition \nbetween liberals and conservatives. I am referring to the Families \nU.S.A., which is a group of folks who are trying to advance the cause \nof the uninsured.\n  Also, the Health Insurance Association of America, a very \nconservative group, has come together behind what Senator Wyden and I \nare trying to give voice to.\n  I appreciate the chance to offer this amendment. I urge its adoption \nand, if not by unanimous consent, that it be overwhelmingly approved.\n  I believe it will be a very nice component of President Bush's effort \nto extend some passion and conservatism to the American people.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to my colleague, Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I commend my colleague and thank him for the opportunity to \nwork with him on this bipartisan agenda. I commend him for a very fine \nstatement this afternoon as well.\n  Each night more than 43 million Americans go to bed without basic \nhealth coverage knowing that a serious illness could wipe their family \nout. These are Americans who aren't old enough for Medicare. They \naren't poor enough for Medicaid. Very often they work as small \nbusinesses. And yet in a country as strong and good as ours we have not \nmade sure that they have access to basic health coverage.\n  In my view, for the Congress not to respond now at a time when there \nare layoffs, at a time when there is great fragility in our economy, \nfor this Congress not to respond to the needs of the uninsured is, in \nmy view, nothing short of government malpractice.\n  This amendment ensures, with the $28 billion that would be provided \nfor mandatory spending, that the Senate Finance Committee could develop \na program that would allow for public and private options. There are \nmany in the business community who argue--and I think correctly so--\nthat there are a variety of approaches with employer-based health care \ncoverage that makes sense. This amendment would allow for that. There \nare advocates for the low income who argue--and I think correctly so--\nthat we ought to be spending for important programs like my colleague \nmentioned, the CHIP program. Senator Kennedy, for example, has done \nyeoman and exceptional work in trying to extend coverage for adults \nwhose children are on Medicaid. And yet those adults, for example, who \nmight work at a small business lack coverage. This proposal would make \nthat possible. We would have a chance to cover those individuals who \nare part of what Senator Kennedy has correctly termed ``family care.''\n  In my view, this proposal represents an opportunity for a major \nbreakthrough on the health care issue which unfortunately to a great \nextent has been deadlocked since the downfall of the discussion over \nthe Clinton health care plan.\n  In my view, with this amendment it will be possible to provide \nimmediate relief to millions of our citizens through public and private \noptions and\n\n[[Page S3477]]\n\nat the same time build a foundation for a longer term approach that, \nagain, looks to both the private and the public sector to fill in these \ngaps in American health care.\n  I particularly want to thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Baucus. They \nhave been leaders in our party in the development of advocacy for these \nindividuals.\n  Senator Conrad and his staff have been exceptionally helpful as well \nin ensuring that this amendment was crafted so that it would not in any \nway allow for a raid of the health insurance trust fund.\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, since my days when I was codirector \nof the Gray Panthers, I dreamed that I could one day be part of a \nbipartisan effort to really fill in the gaps in the American health \ncare system.\n  I thank my colleague, Senator Smith, for the opportunity to work with \nhim. These important breakthroughs for the uninsured can, in fact, only \nbe accomplished if they are bipartisan. I thank him for the chance to \nwork with him.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon has 2 minutes 43 \nseconds; the other distinguished Senator from Oregon has 3 minutes 16 \nseconds.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for a minute.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am happy to yield time to my friend from \nMichigan, who has already shown that she is going to be a tremendous \nadvocate for working families and seniors on health. I am happy to \nyield to her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to commend my colleagues for \ntheir hard work. There is nothing more urgent in a family's life than \nthe issue of health care. I often think that if we address this issue \nin as urgent a manner as a family does when someone has a health care \nproblem, we would have acted much more quickly. When there is a health \nconcern in a family, it seems that the world stops until you fix it or \ntry to figure out how to help your child or your parent or yourself. We \nneed to have that same sense of urgency about health care in this \nChamber.\n  I commend my colleagues for their work.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in support of \nMr. Smith's amendment to increase funding in the Resolution by $28 \nbillion over fiscal year 2002 through 2004 for the purpose of expanding \nhealth insurance coverage to the uninsured. Yesterday's New York Times \nreported that the President's proposed budget, details of which we will \nnot see until next week, will suggest cuts of nearly 90 percent to \nprograms that increase access to health care for the uninsured. That \nobviously is moving in exactly the wrong direction.\n  I oppose the administration's reported plan to ``phase out'' the \nCommunity Access Program. The program seeks to reduce the number of \nuninsured through integrated, comprehensive health care delivery \nsystems. I also am troubled that the Administration seems to undervalue \none of the most important components of any health care safety net--\nquality care. We need to continue to train health professionals to \nensure that every patient receives the quality care he or she deserves. \nMoreover, we need to make sure we have enough health professionals in \nevery part of this country so that no one is denied access to care \nbecause of where they live. According to New York Times, however, the \nWhite House position is that there is ``an oversupply of doctors.'' The \ntruth is there are great disparities in the distribution of health \nprofessionals in this country. The majority of the country's counties \nexperience shortages in health professionals and are medically \nunderserved areas.\n  I support the Smith amendment. This funding will help. But we need to \ngo further. We need quality care for all, which means universal health \ncare coverage. I intend to introduce the Health Security for All \nAmericans Act following this Easter recess. Every American should have \nquality health care coverage. Meanwhile, the Administration's proposals \nto cut the Community Access Program, flat-line funding for the care of \npeople living with AIDS and HIV, and cut into funding for the training \nof our health professionals take us in the wrong direction. This \namendment improves the Resolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment that \nhas a very simple purpose: to increase mandatory health spending by $28 \nbillion to increase health insurance coverage.\n  This is a matter of great national urgency. Today, nearly 33 million \nadults and 10 million children go without health care coverage. That's \n18 percent of all Americans. And despite record employment and a \nbooming economy over the past decade, over eighty percent of the \nuninsured are in working families.\n  Quite simply, we cannot afford to be complacent. Both the nation and \nindividuals pay a penalty for the lack of health insurance. Indeed, one \nof the most deeply disturbing is that health care costs more for the \nuninsured!\n  According to a recent New York Times article, because ``health \ninsurance companies insist on hefty discounts'' for their patients, \nthere can be ``extreme price disparities'' between what the uninsured \nare charged for medical care and what people with insurance are \ncharged.\n  For example, one internal medicine specialist reported that the cost \nof his bills for ``routine exam[s]'' can vary by 45 percent, with ``the \nuninsured pay[ing] the most'' and those with insurance ``pay[ing] much \nless than their share.'' As a result of such arrangements, ``some \nuninsured people struggle for years to pay medical bills and others put \noff seeing a doctor until minor problems become major ones.''\n  How might these funds be spent to improve health insurance coverage? \nOne very promising approach is legislation that will be introduced \nshortly to expand the SCHIP program to provide health insurance \ncoverage of parents of children eligible for the program.\n  As I am sure many Members know, in 1997, under the leadership of \nSenators Kennedy and Rockefeller, Senators Hatch and the late John \nChafee, Congress created the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nor ``S-CHIP.'' Since SCHIP was launched just 3 short years ago, this \nFederal-State partnership has provided health insurance coverage to 3.3 \nmillion low-income children. My home State of Maine is justifiably \nproud of its Cub Care program, covering 9,500 low-income children.\n  What could be a greater priority of our Nation than the health and \nwell-being of our children? What greater responsibility do we have as \nleaders and adults? The fact of the matter is, if we are to be stewards \nof the future, we must be protectors of our children. America's \nchildren cannot grow up strong if they do not grow up healthy.\n  But just as the early results are encouraging, we can and must do \nmore. Despite a team effort to enroll all eligible children, one-third \nof the remaining 18,000 uninsured children in Maine are currently \neligible for coverage under Medicaid or Cub Care, but aren't receiving \nthe benefits. Nationwide, an estimated 6.3 million additional children \nwho could be served by the program remain unenrolled. Like a letter \nmailed without an address, benefits that aren't delivered are benefits \nthat might as well not exist.\n  We must reach our goal of covering all those who are eligible. The \nsolution, or the ``key prescription'' as one Maine pediatrician said is \nhealth insurance coverage for their parents.\n  Here is some evidence. Three of the first States that provided \ncoverage to parents under Medicaid saw their coverage of eligible \nchildren increase by 16 percent from 1990 to 1998, compared to 3 \npercent for States that didn't cover parents.\n  The bottom line is that parental coverage means that children are \nmore likely to be enrolled in SCHIP; and that means better access to \nmedical care.\n  Of course, there are many other possible avenues to improve health \ncare coverage. Indeed, no one solution is the answer for all 43 million \nuninsured Americans. But none of the options is possible without \nfunding.\n  I urge all Senators who believe as I do that we must improve health \ninsurance coverage to vote for this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n[[Page S3478]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this \nmay be agreed to unanimously. But in the event it is not, I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I withhold.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is all time expired on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has not yet expired. The Senator from \nOregon has 2 minutes 20 seconds; the Senator from Oregon has 2 minutes \n34 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senators would be prepared to yield \nback their time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would be willing to yield back \nmy time. I was just asking, if necessary, for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not think it is necessary. I think we are prepared \nnow to have a voice vote and accept the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. That would be fine.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I was always under the impression you ought \nto quit while you are ahead. I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n240.\n  The amendment (No. 240) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask unanimous consent it be charged equally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a unanimous consent agreement \nthat has been worked on by a wide variety of Senators representing \nleadership on both sides. I will propound it now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that time from 3:30 p.m. today until 6:30 \np.m. be equally divided for the consideration of Senator Domenici's \nreconciliation instructions amendment; that all the time on the budget \nresolution expire at 6:30 p.m. this evening; that when the Senate votes \nin relation to the reconciliation amendment, all remaining amendments \nbe limited to 30 minutes each.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered on remaining \namendments to the budget resolution be stacked to occur following the \nvote on or in relation to Senator Domenici's reconciliation amendment \nat 6:30 p.m., with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the first-degree amendments to \nbe offered by the minority and majority leaders be the last two \namendments in order prior to the vote on the substitute and the vote on \nadoption of the concurrent resolution, that they be offered in the \norder listed above and they not be subject to any second-degree \namendments.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of the amendments by the \ntwo leaders, the Senate proceed to vote on adoption of the substitute, \nto be followed immediately by a vote on adoption of the concurrent \nresolution, all without any intervening action, motion, or debate, if \nall amendments have been offered and disposed of.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that disposition of the last two \namendments by the two leaders and the final vote on the concurrent \nbudget resolution occur no earlier than 2:30 p.m. on Friday, April 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Reserving the right to object, I think, as it was read, \nthere may be some confusion in the first few lines. It might be helpful \nto restate it, I say to my colleague; because of changes that have \noccurred as we have negotiated this, I think it would be useful to \nrestate the first few lines.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be glad to. I think the Senator is correct.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time from 3:30 p.m. until 6:30 p.m. \nbe equally divided for consideration of Senator Domenici's \nreconciliation instructions amendment; that all time on the budget \nresolution expire at 6:30 p.m.; that when the Senate votes in relation \nto the reconciliation amendment, all remaining amendments be limited to \n30 minutes each.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that any votes ordered on remaining \namendments to the budget resolution be stacked to occur following the \nvote on or in relation to Senator Domenici's reconciliation amendment \nat 6:30 p.m. with 2 minutes prior to each vote for explanation. I think \nthe rest of it was clearly audible. I propose the rest of it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to be clear: All remaining \namendments be limited to 30 minutes each is intended to apply to what \noccurs between now and 3:30 p.m.?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And from 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. will be on \nreconciliation? That what occurs after that, the 30-minute limitation \ndoes not apply. The 30-minute limitation applies to what occurs between \nnow and 3:30 p.m.; is that the understanding of the Senator?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. That is what it says, but if it needs \nto be further clarified, I accept that clarification.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, this does not preclude any \npoints of order anyone might have during the course of the day?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, it does not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, two things: First, is it \nclear that the vote on the Domenici reconciliation amendment will occur \nat the expiration of the 3 hours allotted to that amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Second, will the distinguished Senator from New Mexico read \nthe final proviso which deals with the final vote at 2:30 p.m. tomorrow \nor circa 2:30 p.m.?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, I will. I ask unanimous consent that disposition \nof the last two amendments by the two leaders and final vote on the \nconcurrent resolution occur no earlier than 2:30 p.m., Friday, April 6, \n2001--tomorrow.\n  Mr. BYRD. That will mean then the vote-arama, which I do not like and \nI do not believe the distinguished Senator likes either, would occur. \nWhatever amendments there are, if Senators chose to call them up, they \nwould have votes on them.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, it is. We hope to make some impression on our \nfriends that we do not have to do them all. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Fine. Is it clear that the majority leader will have an \namendment and the minority leader? Is it clear, absolutely clear that \nthey will have one amendment each?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, both the minority and majority have an opportunity \nat the end, in the order stated, in the order of minority, majority \nleader--in that sequence--but they both have that right.\n  Mr. BYRD. They both have that right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Wraparound right.\n  Mr. BYRD. They may choose not to offer such amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the Senator from West Virginia to \nunderstand all amendments will be in order in the vote-arama if filed \nby 2 o'clock today, as under a previous agreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for reminding us of that. Senators \nshould know that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico?\n\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware wants to speak for 5 minutes with the time coming off the \nresolution. That is all right with me.\n\n[[Page S3479]]\n\n  Can we propose the following, not as a UC, but as a planning tool? We \nhave done it before.\n  Senator Frist on HIV and Senator Corzine on energy; Senator Bond, \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Dodd on child care; Senator Voinovich on \nprocess; Senator Hollings on stimulus; Senator Allen and Senator \nBrownback on process. That is what we are trying to accomplish.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Can we see the list?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this is the week baseball season begins \nanew. I am in a little bit of a baseball mood this week, even this \nafternoon under bright, sunny skies in our Nation's Capital. We have \nbeen working on the budget resolution in the Senate Chamber for the \nbetter part of this week, and under the unanimous consent agreement we \nwill wrap it up hopefully tomorrow afternoon.\n  Using a baseball analogy, this is like the seventh inning stretch. I \nwant to take the opportunity to reflect on what we have agreed to, not \nagreed to, and maybe some thoughts we can keep in mind over the next 24 \nhours or so.\n  As we attempt to adopt, fashion, and agree on a blueprint for \nspending for our Nation, the thought that creeps into almost every \naspect of our discussions is the economy, the shaky nature of the \neconomy, the fragile nature of the economy, and to what extent tax cuts \nshould play as we adopt this budget framework.\n  There are a number of ways to stimulate the economy, as we all know. \nOne of the ways that is going forward right now is the aggressive \nmonetary policy launched by the Federal Reserve over the last couple of \nmonths which will add to the gross domestic product of our country, I \nam told, somewhere close to half a percentage point this year by virtue \nof lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve is expected to come back \nand consider by May 15 whether more interest rate relief is called for. \nMy hope is they will do so, and maybe even before that time.\n  Those interest rate reductions are already being felt in our economy \nas people refinance their homes, lower their mortgage rates, and take \nthe moneys they are saving and spend it for other purposes.\n\n  Another obvious way to stimulate the economy is through tax policy. I \nremind my colleagues as we consider a stimulus policy, trying to put \nsome kind of rebates in place now, rate reductions, child credits, or \nmarriage penalty relief, the actual impact we will have through tax \npolicy is de minimis.\n  Take $3 trillion out of the stock market, as we have seen over the \nlast several months, and pump in $40 billion, $50 billion, $60 billion \nin tax policy and in reality it is not going to amount to too much.\n  I hope we will continue our efforts over the next 24 hours--frankly, \nover the weeks to come--to adopt the best stimulus of all. The best \nstimulus we could send, not just to the markets but the American \npeople, would be for us to actually agree on a tax policy, not just 51 \nRepublicans with the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote but \nfor a number of Democrats and Republicans to agree on an incremental \napproach where we would be able to lower marginal rates, broadly but \nnot as deeply as the President wants, or double the child credit and \nmake it retroactive to the beginning of this year, or we might \neliminate the marriage penalty effective the beginning of this year, \nand do it in a way to provide stimulus to our economy but also some \nassurance that the taxpayers are going to see long-term rate reduction, \nlong-term relief.\n  The President was in Delaware a couple days ago, and I talked with \nhim about this. He said: My concern is, Tom, if we do not take a lot of \nmoney off the table now, we will spend the money. I reminded the \nPresident he plays an activist role in the appropriations process--\nsigning and vetoing appropriations bills, signing and vetoing \nenhancements to entitlement programs.\n  In the end, while we are in the seventh inning stretch, the ball game \nis likely to go into extra innings, and the very best victory the \nAmerican people can hope for is a bipartisan agreement for an \nincremental approach to tax cuts that includes restraint on spending \nand includes a consensus that one of the best things we can do is \ncontinue the good work we have begun on reducing our Nation's debt. I \nyield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the ranking member, we read off seven names, you \nadded an eighth; can we say the eighth is Senator Wellstone?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Senators Wellstone and Johnson, if I could add that \nadditional name.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. We will try to accommodate all the Senators, \nsaying no more than 15 minutes on each of the amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 215\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 215, \non behalf of myself, Senators Smith of Oregon, Leahy, Durbin, Kerry, \nand Feingold, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for himself, Mr. \n     Smith of Oregon, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kerry and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes amendment numbered 215.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 16, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 17, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 20, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 12, line 21, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 8, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 9, increase the amount by $200,000,000.\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, it \n     is the sense of the Senate that:\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) HIV/AIDS, having already infected over 58 million \n     people worldwide, is devastating the health, economies, and \n     social structures in dozens of countries in Africa, and \n     increasingly in Asia, the Caribbean and Eastern Europe.\n       (2) AIDS has wiped out decades of progress in improving the \n     lives of families in the developing world. As the leading \n     cause of death in Africa, AIDS has killed 17 million and will \n     claim the lives of one quarter of the population, mostly \n     productive adults, in the next decade. In addition, 13 \n     million children have been orphaned by AIDS--a number that \n     will rise to 40 million by 2010.\n       (3) The Agency for International Development, along with \n     the Centers for Disease Control, Department of Labor, and \n     Department of Defense have been at the forefront of the \n     international battle to control HIV/AIDS, with global \n     assistance totaling $330,000,000 from USAID and $136,000,000 \n     from other agencies in fiscal year 2001, primarily focused on \n     targeted prevention programs.\n       (4) While prevention is key, treatment and care for those \n     affected by HIV/AIDS is an increasingly critical component of \n     the global response. Improving health systems, providing \n     home-based care, treating AIDS-associated diseases like \n     tuberculosis, providing for family support and orphan care, \n     and making anti-retroviral drugs against HIV available will \n     reduce social and economic damage to families and \n     communities.\n       (5) Pharmaceutical companies recently dramatically reduced \n     the prices of anti-retroviral drugs to the poorest countries. \n     With sufficient resources, it is now possible to improve \n     treatment options in countries where health systems are able \n     to deliver and monitor the medications.\n       (6) The UN AIDS program estimates it will cost at least \n     $3,000,000,000 for basic AIDS prevention and care services in \n     Sub-Saharan Africa alone, and at least $2,000,000,000 more if \n     anti-retroviral drugs are provided widely. In Africa, only \n     $500,000,000 is currently available from all donors, lending \n     agencies and African governments themselves.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the spending levels in this budget resolution shall be \n     increased by $200,000,000 in fiscal year 2002 and by \n     $500,000,000 in 2003 and for each year thereafter for the \n     purpose of helping the neediest countries cope with the \n     burgeoning costs of prevention, care and treatment of those \n     affected by HIV/AIDS and associated infectious diseases.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the time is at hand for the United States \nto take\n\n[[Page S3480]]\n\nanother act of leadership in confronting one of the most important \nmoral, humanitarian, and foreign policy decisions of the new century: \nHow to stop the ravages of HIV/AIDS in Africa and other developing \ncountries.\n  History will indelibly record how the United States, along with other \ngovernments, other institutions, other foundations, and other civil \nsocieties, responds to the call. Inaction will be measured in millions \nof lives--lives lost, families destroyed, and economies ruined.\n  The statistics tell the story. They are chilling. Twenty-two million \npeople have died of AIDS worldwide, more than 3 million last year \nalone. That is over 8,000 per day or nearly 6 deaths every minute. That \nnumber is growing. Thirty-six million people are currently infected \nwith HIV, a staggering number that is increasing by 15,000 new \ninfections every day, mostly in the world's poorest countries. By 2010, \n80 million persons could be dead of AIDS. That is more deaths than we \nsaw in military and civilian forces suffered during all of World War \nII.\n  In Africa, life expectancy has been reduced by nearly half in many \ncountries. In the next decade, 40 million children will be orphaned by \nAIDS. That is a number equal to all children in this country living \neast of the Mississippi. The economic impact is devastating. An entire \ngeneration of workforce is being lost. Trained personnel in key sectors \nneeded for economic growth and stability--teachers, health care \npersonnel, law enforcement--are being decimated by the epidemic. In \nSouth Africa alone, a once growing economy is being devastated by HIV/\nAIDS. The projected GDP over the next 10 years will be reduced by 17 \npercent, or the equivalent of about $22 billion, because of this single \nvirus.\n  Africa is not alone. The Caribbean region has the second highest rate \nof HIV infections. Russia has the largest increase of any in the world. \nThe National Intelligence Council has said that Asia, especially India, \nis on the verge of a catastrophic epidemic. This is especially \ntroubling for those concerned about regional security in the most \npopulous part of the globe.\n  All Americans, indeed, can be proud of the international leadership \nin responding by the United States to this epidemic. We have pushed the \nG-8 to embrace debt relief in exchange for health programs. We have \ntripled our global commitment to AIDS programs over the last 2 years. \nBut we are not doing enough. We are not alone. In all of sub-Saharan \nAfrica, the combined national, UN, and donor contributions in the fight \nagainst AIDS total $500 million. Yet the United Nations estimates the \nbasic prevention and care in Africa alone will cost $3 billion a year, \nincreasing to $5 billion a year if treatment, including access to \nspecific anti-AIDS drugs, is added.\n  The fundamental question we must ask today is this: If the United \nStates is already doing more than anyone else, why should we do more \nright now? There are three reasons.\n  No. 1, the disease is not waiting. It is not waiting for the \ninternational community to mount a coordinated response. Just since I \nhave been talking, 18 people have died and there have been 35 new \ninfections. The problem is growing by the minute.\n  No. 2, a major new initiative by several pharmaceutical companies \nthat has been rolled out over the last several weeks means AIDS \ntreatment drugs for Africa are more affordable today than they have \never been.\n\n  No. 3, access to treatment enhances prevention efforts. Access to \ntreatment enhances prevention, a basic underlying premise of public \nhealth.\n  For the first time in history, the drugs that have revolutionized \nAIDS care and treatment in the United States can become for the first \ntime part of that comprehensive prevention, care, and treatment \nstrategy even in the poorest countries of the world.\n  But how we supply these drugs where they are needed, given the fact \nthat purchasing them at cost still puts them way beyond the means of \ninfected individuals in poor countries, is a question we must address.\n  The answer is in the sort of public-private partnerships which we \nknow have worked in the past and can increasingly work in the future. \nOn the private side, U.S. companies took the lead in making drugs \navailable, and now it is appropriate for the U.S. Government in this \nprivate partnership approach to take the lead in making these drugs \npart of a comprehensive plan, strategy, of prevention, care, and \ntreatment in these poorest countries.\n  Currently, the United States is contributing close to $500 million to \nfight the scourge of HIV/AIDS in poor countries. The amendment my \ncolleagues and I are putting forth today increases that amount by $200 \nmillion next year and by $500 million the following year, effectively \ndoubling our current commitment over 2 years.\n  These funding resources from the United States will provide the \nleadership impetus for a powerful coalition of Government, of \nfoundations, of the United Nations, of the pharmaceutical companies, of \nacademic institutions, of the scientific institutions to help fill the \ngap between the available resources and the need for care and \ntreatment.\n  Working with authorizing and appropriation committees, working with \nSecretaries Powell and Thompson, with USAID and other parties, we will \nbe crafting legislation to ensure this new budget authority enhances \nand complements our bilateral aid programs and also, fundamentally \nimportant, creating a mechanism that both encourages participation by \nother donors and gives the program the appropriate accountability and \noversight we all must require.\n  One possible model would be the strictly monitored fund similar to \nthe successful global alliance on vaccines and immunization. That \nparticular program has combined substantial contributions by the Gates \nFoundation, as well as that by governments, putting them together. It \nis managed by those who know how to deliver those programs, to hold \nthem accountable and to make sure the services are delivered to those \nin greatest need.\n  In addition, work by community-based organizations, both religious \nand secular, will be the linchpin of success on the ground. It has to \nbe made clear to the American people and to the world at large that the \ndrugs alone are not enough. Delivery systems and health infrastructures \nare absolutely mandatory if programs are to be more than just talk or \nto make us feel good--programs that actually reach the people who are \nin so much desperate need for them.\n  Let's be clear about one thing: The new moneys will not be used to \nadd to the coffers of those leaders who have not made AIDS a national \npriority and who have not yet committed to science-based national plans \nto address this challenge. There is no point in assisting governments \nthat choose to avoid the hard realities. Let's also remember that until \nscience and the tremendous resources we can provide in this country in \nterms of science and discovery produce a vaccine, prevention through \nsustained change in behavior is the first and most important means of \nAIDS control, and prevention must remain a primary focus of our \ndevelopment assistance.\n  However, we cannot spend our assistance dollars only on prevention \nactivities. The major new initiative we have seen by the pharmaceutical \ncompanies recently gives us some hope for those already suffering from \nAIDS and their families. After all, how can families and communities \nand democracies survive when over a third of young adults are becoming \ninfected and are expected to die by the age of 45, leaving millions of \nchildren with little support and even less hope. In extending the \nproductive lives of those people affected, treatment can prolong the \ntime that families are together, can provide that support and pass on \ntheir cultural tradition and values.\n\n  Beyond these humanitarian concerns, treatment makes prevention work. \nWithout some expectation of hope or of care, people have no reason to \nbe tested for AIDS, to go in and seek help. They become outcasts in \ntheir communities.\n  Make no mistake about the fact that much more needs to be done than \nwe are proposing. Other nations absolutely must step up with their \ninvolvement as well. We will look to the administration to use expanded \nU.S. commitments to urge our trading partners to increase their \nparticipation.\n  By using such leverage, an increase of $200 million in U.S. aide \nshould increase aide by others by several times that much. Americans \nhave always been among the first to tackle the\n\n[[Page S3481]]\n\nmost difficult challenges of the times. We must do no less when \nconfronted with perhaps the worst international health crisis since the \nbubonic plague ravaged Europe over 600 years ago.\n  When our children and grandchildren asked what we did to help slow \ndown this human tragedy, let us be proud of our answer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Who yields time? The Senator from \nOregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator \nFrist to increase funding for International HIV/AIDS efforts. This \namendment will increase by $200 million in fiscal year 2002 to help the \nneediest countries cope with the burgeoning costs of prevention, care \nand treatment of those affected by HIV/AIDS and associated diseases.\n  AIDS is one of the most recent and most devastating infectious \ndiseases facing the world today. Since the virus was first identified \nabout 20 years ago, more than 50 million people have been infected--and \nat the current rate of infection that number will top 100 million \nwithin 6 years.\n  Of those being infected with HIV, half are between the ages of 10 and \n24. Five young people will contract HIV/AIDS as each minute passes as I \nstand here speaking to you on the Senate floor.\n  These numbers are beyond belief--these youth are the future of the \nworld and yet that future is being endangered as surely as those lives \nare being endangered.\n  Last year many of us on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee joined \nforces to authorize a real boost in funding to fight HIV/AIDS abroad. \nSenator Boxer, Frist, Kerry and I--and many others including Chairman \nHelms--succeeded in authorizing increased funding to meet the \nchallenges of HIV/AIDS infection.\n  We did this without care about party politics, ideology or \nconviction, working together to somehow find solutions to a horrible \nhealth problem. I note that last year our focus was basically on \nAfrica.\n  This year our attention has unfortunately been turned to new \ncontinents and new countries that are being impacted by HIV/AIDS.\n  In the Far East--in Thailand for instance, in the Near East--\nthreatening India and in some countries of Eastern Europe and in \nRussia, HIV/AIDS is spreading quickly. Asia will soon have more new HIV \ninfections than any other region. In Russia more Russians are projected \nto be diagnosed with HIV/AIDS by the end of the year than all cases \nfrom previous years combined.\n  I could go on--HIV/AIDS will be responsible for the deaths of more \nmen, women and children than all the soldiers killed in the major wars \nand conflicts of the 20th Century.\n  All these facts, again, cause the mind to numb and the imagination to \nstagger. Vocabulary fails to describe this. I simply ask my colleagues \nto join Senator Frist and me in helping to fight HIV/AIDS abroad. Time \nand lives are wasting, even as we speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senators Frist and Feingold. It is a timely amendment that addresses \nnot only a humanitarian crisis, but a key threat to U.S. national \nsecurity. I commend the sponsors for drafting an amendment that will \nkeep the United States in a leadership role on this critical issue.\n  HIV/AIDS is a public health crisis throughout Africa, Asia, and the \nCaribbean. There are more than 50 million people infected with HIV \nworldwide; more than 25 million of them are in Africa, where some \ncountries experience infection rates between 10 and 20 percent of the \npopulation. In India, there are 3500 new cases of HIV daily, and the \nWorld Bank projects that India will have 35 million people with HIV by \n2005. Although prevention is key to halting the spread of HIV, because \nof the high costs of drugs and the woeful medical infrastructure, many \nof those infected are shut out of any treatment or care.\n  This devastating impact on a large and growing segment of the world \npopulation threatens to produce an economic development crisis. It is \nstriking down productive adults, impacting agricultural and economic \noutput in many countries, and creating an estimated 13 million orphans, \nwho face increased risk of malnutrition and reduced prospects for \neducation. Some estimates suggest that the number of orphans will grow \nto 40 million in the next decade.\n  This amendment provides the United States with the resources it will \nneed to confront this threat. The President's budget allowed for a 10 \npercent increase over last year's spending, but this challenge demands \na more robust American response, and the Senate is responding here \ntonight.\n  This amendment is the first step, a very good first step, in that \nresponse. I am encouraged by a study released yesterday by Harvard \nUniversity that this problem is, in fact, surmountable. It will, \nhowever, demand that we follow through on the next steps in this fight \nmaking drugs available at affordable prices and providing the medical \ninfrastructure these countries need to meet this threat. It is a threat \nwe can address, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \naddress it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator from New Jersey seeking time?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 257 at the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is still time remaining on \nthe Frist amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if we had time on this amendment, we \nyield it back.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, there was 30 seconds. I yield that time \nback.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time remains on the other side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we yield back all time on this amendment \nand we yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey. Is the Senator \nfrom New Jersey seeking 7 minutes?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, 10 minutes total, and I will yield time \nto other Senators.\n  Mr. CONRAD. At this time, I yield 7 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will withhold for one \nmoment. The time is all yielded back on the Frist amendment. The \nSenator from New Jersey is recognized to call up an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 257\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 257, which is \ncurrently at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment \nby number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Corzine] offers an \n     amendment numbered 257.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. I ask unanimous consent further reading be dispensed \nwith.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, this amendment would restore $50 billion \nof cuts built into the Republican resolution to environment, natural \nresources, and energy conservation programs. This means that \nenvironmental programs would be increased 4 percent in 2002. But keep \nin mind, this is the total. We are merely maintaining funding at the \nincrease the President has requested for overall growth in \ndiscretionary spending this year.\n  To offset these adjustments, the amendment would reduce \nadministrative costs for fiscal year 2002 and reduce the size of the \ntax cuts in subsequent years.\n  Further, the amendment would set aside an additional $50 billion for \ndebt reduction.\n  I believe protecting our environment deserves top priority. Yet in \nthe past few months, we have seen the administration wage nothing less \nthan an all-out attack on our environment.\n  Three weeks ago, the administration pulled a complete 180-degree turn \non a clear campaign pledge to address global warming through the \nregulation of\n\n[[Page S3482]]\n\ncarbon dioxide. They pushed back regulation designed to protect the \npublic from arsenic in drinking water. They proposed drilling in the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge. And they refused to defend regulations \ndesigned to protect our national forests.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush budget and this budget resolution continue \nthis attack on our environment. The President's ``Budget Blueprint'' \nproposed a 15-percent cut in environmental and natural resource \nprograms--15 percent. These cuts are a dramatic step backwards and \nwould reverse much of the progress we have made on cleaning our air and \nwater and protecting our Nation's natural resources. These cuts would \ncontribute to the Nation's growing concern about sprawl and would \nweaken efforts to hold polluters accountable.\n  These cuts have been especially serious in my State of New Jersey. I \nknow I was sent here to fight to represent New Jersey's interests. Air \nquality in New Jersey is one of the worst--in six of our counties--in \nthe Nation. We have 115 Superfund sites, 80 percent of our rivers and \nlakes and streams are unfishable and unswimmable.\n  Unfortunately, while the President has not revealed all the specific \ncuts that will be included in his budget, we know that they are coming. \nWe know they will be severe. Just today there is a report in the Wall \nStreet Journal outlining leaked information about these prospective \ncuts.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Bush's Budget Plan To Face Critics' Ire Over Environment\n\n                 (By John D. McKinnon and Sarah Lueck)\n\n       Washington.--President Bush is likely to ignite more \n     controversy over his environmental policies with the release \n     next week of detailed budget plans including big cuts in \n     conservation and energy-efficiency programs.\n       Democratic strategists say that environmental issues are \n     fast becoming Mr. Bush's biggest political weak spot because \n     of their popularity with middle-class voters. Democrats and \n     their allies among environmental groups are planning to \n     highlight the cuts next week and again on April 22, Earth \n     Day.\n       ``We expect the president's budget is going to be the next \n     big attack on the environment,'' said Alyssondra Campaigne of \n     the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n       Based on Mr. Bush's previously released budget outline, \n     environmentalists now estimate that he will propose cutting \n     environmental spending by 10%, including reductions at the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the Energy and Interior \n     departments and the Army Corps of Engineers.\n       The Energy Department would endure the biggest cuts, \n     expected to total as much as $120 million, from research \n     programs that promote energy efficiency in manufacturing \n     processes, appliances and building design. The budget plan \n     also would cut as much as $150 million from the department's \n     programs for creating fossil-fuel-production technologies, \n     including some aimed at making oil wells and pipelines safer \n     for the environment.\n       Much of the savings would be used to beef up other programs \n     within the department, such as weatherization, home-heating \n     aid for the poor and clean-coal research.\n       Still, activities call the administration's cuts in energy \n     conservation perplexing, given that Mr. Bush has been \n     proclaiming an energy crisis. ``The programs that will \n     actually solve the problems, save consumers money and reduce \n     pollution are getting slashed by this administration,'' said \n     Anna Aurilio of U.S. PIRG, a consumer group.\n       An administration spokesman declined to provide details of \n     the cuts but said the targeted programs aren't necessarily \n     saving money. A White House official said the president's \n     budget ``reflects his support for energy conservation, \n     renewable energy and encouraging entrepreneurs to develop \n     alternative sources,'' and noted that it proposes significant \n     new tax incentives for energy production.\n       At the EPA, spending is being reduced by $500 million. Some \n     congressional aides also expect reductions in core funds that \n     pay for EPA enforcement activities, possibly as part of an \n     increase in grants to help states pay for enforcement.\n       The environment isn't the only area in which Mr. Bush is \n     taking some political heat. In health care, he is expected to \n     propose cutting some programs favored by the Clinton \n     administration, including a $125 million program that helps \n     uninsured people get treatment and one aimed at preventing \n     child abuse. But overall, programs designed to help abused \n     children and the uninsured will receive more funding, \n     officials at the Department of Health and Human Services \n     said.\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. This uncertainty aside, we do know this undercuts a \ncommitment the Congress made last year to support the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. This blueprint cuts conservation initiatives by $2.7 \nbillion. That is in the blueprint.\n  Potentially most damaging, the Bush budget would undermine \nenforcement of our environmental laws. It would require deep cuts in \nthe operating functions of our environmental agencies: the EPA, \nInterior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n  We just can't afford these cuts. If anything, we should be putting \nmore resources into enforcement not less. Consider EPA's own data from \njust last month. They found that:\n  Twenty-six percent of industrial facilities were in significant \nnoncompliance with their clean air permits; Nearly 10 percent of \nindustrial facilities were in significant noncompliance with their \nclear water permits; And 7 percent of industrial facilities were in \nsignificant noncompliance with their hazardous waste permits.\n  When government lets polluters off the hook, all of us pay a price--\nparticularly those least able to protect themselves--our kids and \nseniors.\n  The Bush administration has not been in office very long. But it has \ndone a lot of damage and a lot of damage to our environmental laws. And \nit's time for them to reverse their course.\n  I hope my colleagues will support the amendment I am offering today. \nIt is really a very limited amendment. It simply would allow us to \nbarely maintain funding for environmental programs at today's levels. \nFrankly, I think we should do substantially more. But I hope my \ncolleagues can support at least this, because it is protection of where \nwe are today.\n  The message of this amendment is simple. It says that it's more \nimportant to keep our air and water clean than to give huge tax breaks \nto the very wealthiest Americans. And it's more important to address \nglobal warming than to give the top one percent of Americans a tax cut \nworth $55,000 a year.\n  I think environmental priorities reflect the values of the American \npeople. I think they're the right priorities for our nation and world. \nAnd I hope my colleagues will support the amendment and those values.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, does the Senator from Nevada or the \nSenator from California seek time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield to my colleague, the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am the ranking member of the environment \ncommittee, and I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from \nNew Jersey and the Senator from California who will soon speak on this \namendment.\n  In our committee, every Member on the Democratic side has been \nextremely concerned about what has happened so far during the Bush \nadministration and what they have done to violate what we have worked \non for so long to take care of the environment, whether it is global \nwarming, whether it is arsenic, whether it is lead, or whether it is \ndrilling in ANWR. We need to understand that in our country--no matter \nif you are from New Jersey or California and all the States in \nbetween--people care about the environment. George Bush is a good man. \nHe is simply not getting the word that he is making tremendous mistakes \nin how he is treating the environment.\n  The Senator from New Jersey has done an excellent job with this \namendment in restoring financing in the budget so we can do something \nabout the environment and to maintain the progress we have made.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much. I thank my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Corzine, and my ranking member, Senator Reid.\n  I stand in strong support of Senator Corzine's amendment. It isn't \nrocket science to know a few things about our life. If we can't breathe \nclean air, if we can't drink safe water, and if we can't count on the \nGovernment to protect us from events that we cannot protect\n\n[[Page S3483]]\n\nourselves against, then what use are we as a Senate?\n  If you take a look at the Republican budget that is before us, it is \na sad commentary on the value that they place on a clean and healthy \nenvironment for our people. They can say whatever they want, but they \nare at $52.5 billion, and they are going below the current level of \nservices.\n  Again, this President likes arsenic in the water. I don't know. He \nwill have to explain that to the American people. He took a move where \nhe was going to say we are not even going to check for salmonella in \nthe meat that goes to school lunches. Senator Durbin caught him on that \nand now he backed off. He has also backed off on the right to know if \nthere is lead in a product, or in the air we breathe. I have to say \nthat is not a family value. That is not a value of a great nation.\n  Whether it is arsenic in our water or contaminants in our soil or \nair, this amendment should be supported. It doesn't do us any good to \nhave a thousand dollars in our pocket if we are dying of cancer.\n\n\n                          FOREST FIRE FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague, Senator \nCorzine, for this amendment and indicate that I am very glad to be a \ncosponsor of it. It is an important amendment. Second, I would like to \nengage Senator Corzine in a brief colloquy at this time.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Of course.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. The spring and summer of 2000 will not soon be \nforgotten in my home state. A series of fires burned more than 65,000 \nacres in New Mexico, including the Cerro Grande fire that destroyed \nmore than 400 homes. As a result of these fires and others that raged \nthroughout the country, Congress took a step in the right direction \nlast year by providing substantial funding for fire prevention efforts. \nIn addition, Congress appropriated additional funds to implement the \nNational Fire Plan. This plan, issued by the Secretary of Agriculture \nand the Secretary of the Interior, contains recommendations to reduce \nthe impacts of wildland fires on rural communities and ensure \nsufficient firefighting resources in the future. I would like to \nclarify that it is the Senator's intent that this amendment maintains, \nat a minimum, current levels of funding for the National Fire Plan and \nbase fire programs.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes, that is my intent.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. It is important to ensure sufficient levels of funding \nfor all programs related to the National Fire Plan. For example, \nCongress specifically instructed the agencies to target hazardous fuel \nreduction funds near communities that are at high risk from wildfire. \nIn addition, the Rural Fire Assistance program strengthens the wildland \nfire protection capabilities of rural fire departments by providing \ntechnical assistance, training, and supplies. Moreover, economic action \nprograms assist rural communities in developing and marketing products \ncreated from the little trees removed as part of fuels reduction \nefforts. Other cooperative fire protection programs, that provide \nassistance for complementary hazardous fuels reduction projects on non-\nFederal lands in the wildland/urban interface and educate homeowners \nabout the proper way to fire proof their homes, are also essential \nelements of our cohesive efforts to diminish fire risks.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I agree with the Senator that a multi-faceted approach \nis necessary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. We need to sustain a commitment to all components of \nthe National Fire Plan over a long enough period of time to make a \ndifference, at least 15 years based on recommendations from the Forest \nService and the Department of the Interior. Your amendment ensures that \nCongress is doing its part with respect to fire prevention without \nadversely affecting other important programs funded under Function 300. \nI thank the Senator for the clarification.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I know Senators Bond and Mikulski are \nready to proceed under our previous arrangement. I say to Senator Bond \nthat he is going to have 10 minutes on his amendment. I would like to \ntake a couple of minutes now to explain something about the process, \nbut I don't want to take away from anybody else's time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if I could, I think Senator Mikulski and I \neach wanted 5, and I think Senator Bingaman wanted 2, if we could \nexpand that to 12 minutes. Are there others?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will go 12. That is fine.\n  Mr. President, I want to make sure there is no misunderstanding. Just \nbecause we are not offering a second-degree amendment, we are not \nprecluded from offering a second-degree amendment before we vote, from \neverything I understand. If anybody on the other side has a contrary \nreading, I wish they would raise that issue now.\n  Let me ask one simple question of the distinguished Senator from New \nJersey. Does this amendment take $100 billion out of the tax cut and \nput $50 billion of it against the debt and $50 billion of it for \nincreased spending in various environmental areas?\n  Mr. CORZINE. It is $93.75 billion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't want anybody to think we round out those big \nnumbers. But sometimes we refer to $93.75 billion as a hundred.\n  Mr. CORZINE. We will check those numbers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We plan to have a second degree. We will have to work \non it in due course. But we will have a second-degree amendment to \nthat.\n  We don't have any formal agreement, excepting that a series of \nSenators are going to be recognized--bipartisan or otherwise--to send \nan amendment to the desk and talk about it and be limited to 15 minutes \nso we can have enough time to get them all in. We are going to yield 12 \nminutes for your team.\n  Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 211\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Allen, and Mr. Frist, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 211.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 14, line 11, increase the amount by $1,441,000,000.\n       On page 14, line 12, increase the amount by $530,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $1,441,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $530,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 8, increase the amount by $1,441,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 9, increase the amount by $530,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering with my \ncolleagues, Senators Mikulski, Allen, Lieberman, and Bingaman proposes \nto add $1.44 billion over the President's budget to the Function 250 \ngeneral science account to boost spending in fiscal year 2002 for the \nNational Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and National \nAeronautics and Space Administration. Compared to the fiscal year 2001 \nenacted levels, this amendment would add $469 million to DOE's science \naccounts, $674 million to NSF, and $518 million to NASA. This amendment \ncontinues the Federal Government's strong commitment to the Nation's \nbasic science research programs. Let us make no mistake, basic science \nmeans applied science, which is the foundation of this economy and will \nbe the booster rocket for the future success of our economy and allow \nthis Nation to lead the world in this century.\n\n  Of particular interest to me, this amendment maintains the momentum \nto double the budget of NSF over 5 years. Under this amendment, NSF \nwould receive a 15.3 percent increase over last year's enacted level. \nAs chairman of the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I began the doubling effort last year with my good friend \nand colleague on the appropriations subcommittee, Senator Mikulski. We \nare not alone and we have broad support for this funding. Last year, a \nbipartisan group of 41 Senators also supported this effort and I expect \neven\n\n[[Page S3484]]\n\nmore direct and enthusiastic support this year. NSF plays an important \nand unique role in stimulating core disciplines of science, \nmathematics, and engineering and doubling the NSF budget will help \nensure that the economic growth we have enjoyed over the past several \nyears will continue.\n  I think we can all agree that research and development is a positive \nand critical investment for the economic and intellectual growth and \nwell-being of our Nation. According to many economists, over the past \nhalf century, advances in science and engineering have stimulated at \nleast half of the Nation's economic growth. Further, investment in \nscientific research has led to innovative developments in the high-tech \nindustry--most notably the Internet and lasers. The investments have \nalso spawned not only new products, but also entire industries, such as \nbiotechnology, Internet providers, E-commerce, and geographic \ninformation systems.\n  Besides the economic benefits we have enjoyed from our investment in \nNSF's research programs, NSF has also played a crucial role in the \nbiomedical area. Over the past half century, NSF-supported research has \nhad monumental impact in the field of medical technologies and \nresearch. Let me make it clear that I am very supportive of the funding \nsupport we have provided to the National Institutes of Health. However, \nI am very concerned that the work that NIH is doing currently may be \njeopardized if the underlying work from NSF research is not adequately \nsupported. Medical technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, \nultrasound, digital mammography and genomic mapping could not have \noccurred, and cannot now improve to the next level of proficiency, \nwithout underlying knowledge from NSF-supported work in biology, \nphysics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and computer sciences. \nThus, the success of NIH to cure deadly diseases such as cancer depend \nupon the underpinning research supported by NSF. The connection between \nNSF and NIH has been recognized by leading medical experts such as \nformer NIH Directors, Bernadine Healy and Harold Varmus. As Dr. Varmus \nwrote in a letter to me last June 26:\n\n       Essential contributions to both genome sequencing and \n     determination of protein structures have come from work \n     supported by the NSF, and efforts to take advantage of this \n     new information will require expanded activity in disciplines \n     traditionally dependent on the NSF--including computer \n     science, chemistry, physics, and engineering. Indeed, from \n     the perspective of a medical scientist, there could be no \n     more opportune time to guarantee the vitality of American \n     science funded by the NSF.\n\n  Let me add on more voice, Dr. Kenneth Shine of the Institute of \nMedicine. Dr. Shine wrote:\n\n       . . . it is important to note that advances in medicine are \n     very dependent upon other fields of science that are mostly \n     supported by the National Science Foundation . . . . doubling \n     of the NSF budget will pay for itself many times over in \n     terms of saving costs, and, more importantly, improving human \n     health.\n  To be blunt, supporting NSF supports NIH.\n  Beyond just the biomedical field, the Senate should also be concerned \nabout our Nation's supply of engineers and scientists. For the past \nseveral years, the number of graduates in the science and engineering \nfields has been declining. This decline has put our Nation's innovation \ncapabilities at risk and at risk of falling behind other industrial \nnations. In the past decade, growth in the number of Asian and European \nstudents earning degrees in the natural sciences and engineering has \ngone up on average by four percent per year. During the same time, the \nrate for U.S. students declined on average by nearly one percent each \nyear.\n  NSF plays a key role in funding the training of the nation's young \nresearchers in university laboratories. Twenty thousand graduate \nstudents and nearly 30,000 undergraduates are directly involved in NSF \nprograms and activities every year.\n  However, as many of my colleagues know, the Congress has had to raise \nthe cap on H1-B visas for immigrant workers due to the shortage of \ntechnically-trained workers in this country. The high-tech industry has \nhad to turn to foreign workers because our country is not producing \nenough scientists and engineers to meet demand. According to NSF, the \ndemand for engineers and computer scientists is expected to grow by \nmore than 50 percent by 2008. While NSF has been active in addressing \nthis problem, it is obvious that it is not enough and we need to \nprovide more support to our Nation's students. I hope my colleagues \nunderstand why this amendment is so critical. If we do not support NSF, \nthis problem will continue and our Nation's long-term economic growth \nand research innovation will be significantly hampered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important amendment and our \nefforts to strengthen the country's research and development base. It \nis important to recognize that if we are to sustain our economic base \nand support the important work of NIH, we must support NSF.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I am going to use the last bit of my time to tell my colleagues that \nI have another amendment at the desk, No. 210, which we will be calling \nup in the vote-arama. It is cosponsored by Senators Hollings and \nDeWine.\n  Yesterday, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to add to the President's \ngenerous proposal for NIH research spending. I hope we get an \noverwhelming vote for this one, too. It does two things.\n  First, it adds to the President's proposal on community health \ncenters. Like NIH, the Senate is on record supporting double funding \nover 5 years for health centers, and like the NIH amendment yesterday, \nmy amendment would put us on track to double the funding for health \ncenters.\n  Second, the amendment would make room in the budget to finally \nprovide equitable treatment for children's hospitals when it comes to \nour support of physician training programs. They have not received \nenough money to train the pediatricians they need. This year, our goal \nis to end this inequity finally.\n  The amendment we will be calling up later will provide enough room in \nthe budget to make these things happen. When that amendment comes up, I \nask my colleagues to support that one as well.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Before yielding to Senator Mikulski, may I ask the \nSenator a question?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I would be happy to respond to the \ndistinguished manager.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I ask the Senator: The other part of the Government \nthat has basic science research is the Department of Energy. I \nunderstand that you included that in the triad. We have done NSF and \nthe National Institutes of Health. You have added for the National \nScience Foundation and added $469 million for DOE basic research. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the total amount of funding goes into \nsection 250. I say to the Senator, $1.44 billion goes into section 250. \nAs I understand it, how that gets sliced up is probably beyond the \nability of this particular budget debate to determine. It will \nultimately come down, I believe, to a 302(b) allocation. But my \nrecommendation is that the vitally important work of DOE be funded with \nan additional $469 million out of this function.\n  There is another function--I believe it is 270--that also funds \nscience.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Chair inform us how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 5 minutes. \nSenator Bingaman has 2 minutes.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an original cosponsor of this \namendment with my dear colleague, Senator Bond, to increase the \nfunction 250 for general science.\n  Our amendment seeks to increase funding for science by $1.4 billion \nby\n\n[[Page S3485]]\n\ndoubling the funding for the National Science Foundation, increasing \nthe NASA budget by $500 million, as well as the Department of Energy \nfunds.\n  This has strong bipartisan support. We are joined by Senators \nLieberman and Rockefeller on my side of the aisle.\n  Why is it this issue enjoys such strong bipartisan support?\n  Both sides of the aisle--Senator Kit Bond and Senator Barbara \nMikulski--want to make sure that America not only continues to win the \nNobel Prizes but that we win the global markets. In order to do so, we \nneed to invest in our Federal labs to create the new ideas that lead to \nthe new products that lead to us winning those prizes and their \nmarkets. We are so proud of the fact we are on target to double the \nfunding at NIH. But NIH is not the only place where we need to increase \nour funding for science and technology.\n  Our amendment pays for this increase through a $1.4 billion reduction \nin the proposed contingency fund. This offset does not cut any existing \nprogram or agency. Unfortunately, the President's budget cuts NSF \nresearch below last year's appropriated level. The President's budget \nalso proposes similar cuts in real terms to NASA and the Department of \nEnergy research programs. This is unacceptable. While we are on target \nto increase biomedical research at NIH, we must also increase funding \nin the core areas of science and engineering--the same disciplines that \nfuel the very biomedical enterprise we seek to strengthen. CAT Scans \nand MRI's were created by NSF research--not NIH research.\n  As the former head of NIH, Dr. Harold Varmus, said:\n\n       Scientists can wage an effective war on disease only if we \n     as a nation and as a scientific community harness the \n     energies of many disciplines, not just biology and medicine. \n     The allies must include mathematicians, physicists, engineers \n     and computer and behavioral scientists.\n\n  Because it is at NSF, NASA, and also DOE that we are supporting basic \nscience that saves lives and generates jobs today and jobs tomorrow. \nNASA and NSF made the major innovations in the Internet, satellites, \nand microelectronics. If it were not for federally funded research, \nnone of this would exist today.\n  But supporting basic scientific research is not just about saving \nlives, it is also about creating the jobs of tomorrow. Federal funding \nfor basic scientific research is absolutely necessary for economic \ngrowth and job creation. I couldn't even begin to list the technologies \nand inventions that were created through Federal research, but I will \nname just a few: the Internet, satellites, and microelectronics. If it \nweren't for federally funded research, none of this would exist today. \nThe private sector will always be focused on near-term product \ndevelopment--that is what they have to do. But that allows the \nGovernment to focus on long-term basic research to provide industry \nwith the foundation for future product development and future job \ncreation for our country. Mr. President, we are on the verge of \nhistoric breakthroughs in science and technology that will \nrevolutionize our economy. Nanotechnology is just one area that could \ntransform our economy. Nanotechnology is the science of creating new \nmaterials and devices at the atomic and molecular levels, through the \nmanipulation of individual atoms and molecules.\n  What does this mean? It means inventing new materials that are 10 \ntimes stronger than steel--at a fraction of the weight. It means \nsupercomputers the size of a teardrop. It means new sensors that can \ndetect cancer cells at the earliest stages of development. \nUnfortunately, we may not see the pay-off for 10 or 20 years. Industry \non its own cannot support such high risk, long term research. That is \nwhy the Federal Government must support long term basic scientific \nresearch. For evidence, just look at recent history. The United States \nhad led the world in patenting considered a critical measure of \ninnovation. Entrepreneurial investment in new technologies and services \ncreated an estimated one-third of the 10 million new jobs between 1990 \nand 1997. Since 1995, growth in gross domestic product per capita \nreached its highest levels in 40 years.\n  We cannot afford to stop now. That is why this amendment is \nnecessary. Not only do we need to increase funding for research, we \nneed to rebuild our research infrastructure.\n  According to NSF, there is an $11 billion backlog in modernizing \nuniversity research labs and research facilities. How can we push the \nfrontiers of new technology if our laboratories aren't ready? We are \nseeing a decrease in the numbers of graduates in key science and \nengineering fields. This puts our future innovation capabilities at \nrisk. We must work to expand the pool of U.S. scientists and engineers \nby increasing support for K-12 math and science education. We must \nincrease support for the education and training at our 2 year colleges, \nundergraduate institutions and research universities. Our international \ncompetitors won't stand still, and neither can we. With all that is \nconfronting us, now is precisely the wrong time to cut funding for \nscientific research.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join us by supporting this amendment as a \nnecessary and critical investment in the future well being of the \nNation.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I had a great talk with Dr. Sally Ride, the \nfirst woman to go into space. When she went into space, she took the \nhopes and dreams of so many of us. Dr. Ride holds degrees in both \nEnglish literature as well as astrophysics. If Dr. Ride were here today \nto consult with the Senators, she would say she could do what she did \nbecause of the funding of the National Science Foundation that helped \nher get the background to be able to go on to be an astronaut. And look \nat what it has meant.\n  Our own National Science Foundation today is leading a breakthrough \neffort in a new field called nanotechnology. It could transform our \neconomy. It is the science of creating new materials at the atomic and \nsubatomic level.\n  But what does that mean to those of us who are scientifically \nliterate but not scientists? It means a supercomputer the size of a \nteardrop, new materials that are 10 times stronger than steel at a \nfraction of the weight. Think what it means for new materials for our \nairplanes and our automobiles.\n  Unfortunately, we will not see this payoff for 10 or 20 years. \nIndustry cannot be the venture capitalists in this area. Government \nneeds to get into it. By getting involved in nanotechnology and \ninfotech technology, we are really taking America to the future. We \nlead the world in patenting and innovation.\n  Since 1995, our gross domestic product has increased more. Why? \nBecause of innovation that has led to new products and new \nproductivity. So we really need to focus our research on what will \ngenerate this type of activity.\n  At the same time, while we are looking at the funding of research, \nthere is an $11 billion backlog in modernizing university research labs \nand research facilities. How can we push these frontiers of new \ntechnology if our laboratories are not ready? This program will help \nwith those laboratories.\n  I think all here know of my passion for bringing often left out \nconstituencies into science and technology--women, people of color.\n  It is the National Science Foundation that reaches out to bring them \ninto the field of science, mathematics, and engineering. The NSF has \ndone a fantastic job reaching out to historically black colleges and to \nwomen. At the same time we see, particularly with some of the NIH money \nthat doesn't necessarily come to States with large rural populations, \nEPSCoR, an excellent program at NSF that brings high-tech research \nopportunities to our smaller rural States, that enables them to come up \nwith the new ideas and maybe even jump start efforts of the stodgy \nuniversities. This is the competition we love. It is the competition of \nideas, the competition for new products.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico has 2 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the sponsors of the amendment \nfor the opportunity to speak on its behalf. I am a cosponsor of the \namendment. I believe very strongly that it is the right thing to do. Of \ncourse, it does not actually get the money appropriated for these very \nimportant purposes, but it does make it possible for us to do that \nlater in this session of the Congress.\n  We have seen a commitment over several years now by the Congress to\n\n[[Page S3486]]\n\nadequately fund the National Institutes of Health. I have strongly \nsupported that. But we have not seen the same level of commitment, the \nsame level of appreciation for the importance of maintaining high \nlevels of funding for research and development in the physical sciences \narea. That is what this amendment would do. It would try to bring \nfunding for research and development in the physical sciences on a par \nwith the funding for the research and development that is pursued in \nthe life sciences through the National Institutes of Health.\n  This is an extremely important effort, particularly as it relates to \nthe Department of Energy's Office of Science, their commitment to \ndeveloping the necessary user facilities across the Nation in two \ncritical areas. One is the nanosciences that have been mentioned by the \nSenator from Maryland. The second is in advanced scientific computers. \nIn both of these areas, we need to be the world leader. There is no \nreason we cannot be. In both of these areas we need to commit funds in \norder to maintain that leadership position.\n  I strongly support the amendment. I commend the sponsors of the \namendment for proposing it and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico for his kind comments as well as the strong comments of the \nSenator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent that the distinguished chairman of \nthe Budget Committee be identified as an original cosponsor. It was my \nmistake not to include him on that list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am pleased to withhold for the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. While we are waiting, I yield myself 1 minute off the \nconglomeration of amendments. We won't exceed our time on those.\n  I take a minute to respond to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia who talked about our President and his environmental record. \nI want to make sure everybody out there in the hinterlands knows that \nthe Senate had an opportunity to vote on whether it would ever enforce \nthe so-called Kyoto accord. Not one single Senator voted that we would, \nindeed, enforce that accord. The vote was either 99-0 or 98-0, \nindicating forthrightly that the treaty would never see the light of \nday because the Senate said it wouldn't.\n  I believe we ought to be square with this President and be honest \nwith the people. How can he be blamed for doing damage to the \nenvironment when the Senate clearly said, with not a single dissenting \nvote, that we would not enforce it? If we wouldn't enforce it, it would \nnever be effective. It would have no efficacy on the environment of the \nworld or America.\n  When our President announced that, somebody should have put a little \nscorecard up there that said: The President agrees with the Senate, \nwhich voted 98-0 that it would not enforce that accord.\n  On arsenic, which the Senator from California addressed, there are \nDemocratic mayors across this land who have written to the Senator from \nNew Mexico. I don't know very many who supported the old arsenic \nregulation because it was nonscientific and was not based on any real \nscience. It wasn't only this President. Democratic mayors and \ncouncilmen joined by Republicans across the land said: Don't make us \nspend all this money when there is no benefit to the public health.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member, \nSenator Conrad, for his skill in managing our presentation from this \nside on the budget.\n  I rise to make some comments in general terms but directing my \ncomments to the amendment I introduced today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Nelson, Landrieu, Carnahan, Chafee, Lincoln, Bayh, Torricelli, \nand Jeffords. The amendment provides for a $1.25 trillion tax cut over \nthe next 10 years for the enactment of marginal rate reductions and \nestate, marriage penalty, and alternative minimum tax relief, and \nreserves additional resources for other domestic priorities such as \ndebt reduction, education, agriculture, defense, and prescription \ndrugs. That is the essence of the amendment.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues and, indeed, to the American public, \nthat during the Presidential elections of last year, the most important \nthing President Bush was able to enunciate for the American people who \ncontributed to his victory was not a number but a concept. The number \nhe talked about in the campaign was a $1.3 trillion tax cut for all \nAmericans. But more important than the number was the concept in which \nhe told the American people that if he were to come to Washington, he \nwanted to change the culture of the way Washington worked or, rather, \nthe way Washington did not work.\n  He said--I think correctly--that the American people were tired of \nclass warfare. The American people were tired of the blame game. The \nAmerican people were tired of seeing Democrats blame Republicans for \nfailure. The American people were tired of Republicans blaming \nDemocrats for failure. The American people were tired of the blame game \nand the essence in which we argued about failure and whose fault it was \nthat nothing was getting done.\n  He said: If I get the chance to come to Washington, I will change \nthat culture.\n  The election was not about a number. It was about changing \nfundamentally the way we do business in this city.\n  On this budget, we have the opportunity to show the American people \nthat perhaps there is a glimmer of hope, that perhaps with a new \nPresident in Washington, if he truly believes, as I think he does, that \nhe wants to change the culture, this is the first test of whether that \nwill be done.\n  If you took to the American people a tax cut of over a trillion \ndollars for all Americans and you were able to put together a \nbipartisan coalition of 55, 60, 65 or more votes together in a package \nand say, we have worked together to accomplish this in a bipartisan \nfashion, we have fundamentally changed the way Washington works, that \nwould be a victory for this President. It would be a victory for the \nSenate and, far more importantly, it would be a victory for the \nAmerican public.\n  Let me assure my colleagues of one thing: This body is not the Super \nBowl. This body is not the Final Four. In both of those endeavors there \nhas to be a winner and there has to be a loser. I suggest that in the \nCongress of the United States that is not true. In the Congress of the \nUnited States it is far more important that we keep in mind that we \nshould be trying to make the American people the real winners. It is \nnot as important which party wins, but that both parties can work \ntogether in order to make a victory available to the people of this \ncountry.\n  I suggest we have an opportunity to do that, and unlike with the \nSuper Bowl and the Final Four, everyone can be a winner and there can \nbe no losers. It is time that we stop thinking that any number under \n$1.6 trillion is a loss for the President and a victory for the \nDemocrats. That is simply not true. A number in between what Democrats \nhave offered and what the Republicans have offered that is available to \nall Americans, that receives a substantial degree of support from both \nsides, is an incredible victory. It is an incredible victory not \nbecause it is a number but because we will have changed fundamentally \nthe culture of this city.\n  It does not behoove any of us to try to pick one Republican off to \njoin this side and for them to try to pick one Democrat off to join \nthem on that side. If the American people see that that is the way \nWashington works in the year 2001, they will say the last Presidential \nelection meant very little because of all the talk about change in the \nculture, and we ultimately get back to the\n\n[[Page S3487]]\n\nsame old way of doing things. We pick up one, they pick up two; we pick \nup one, we get a 50-50 tie; and then we bring down the Vice President \nto break the tie and one side declares victory.\n  In essence, I think that is a short-term, shallow victory. In \nessence, I think it would be a serious defeat for all Americans who \nthink we should change the culture of the way this institution works. \nWe have offered something that I think could be a victory for everyone. \nWe have offered a plan that should bring about serious negotiations, \nwhere we all sit together and not try to pick each other off, but we \ntry to create a system that works for the benefit of all Americans.\n  What is not a victory is trying to pick each other off one at a time, \nwith one more promise than the last group made, to try to say: Be with \nme for a short while so I can go to the winner's circle and be declared \nthe victor.\n  We have an opportunity in this divided Congress--a President who won \nthe electoral college but not the popular vote, a House of \nRepresentatives that is closer than it has been in decades, and a U.S. \nSenate that, for only the second time in our country's history, is \nabsolutely deadlocked--that should not be a problem. That should be an \nopportunity. It should be the opportunity that this President talked \nabout when he was running: ``If I am elected and I go to Washington, I \nwill fundamentally change the culture of that city.''\n  This is the first test of whether we are going to change it. This is \nthe first opportunity to show the American people that things will be \ndone differently.\n  For all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have joined \nwith us in offering this, I think this is the answer to the deadlock in \nwhich we are involved. I thank them for their participation. I \nencourage all of my colleagues to work with us to ensure not just one \nparty's victory but a victory for the American public.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor \nof the Breaux-Nelson-Jeffords, et al., bipartisan tax cut plan. This \ncompromise is the result of careful consideration of the two \nphilosophies dominating the tax cut debate today. The first was the \nbelief that the $750 billion tax cut was not sufficient, considering \nthe size of our projected surplus. Yet the second was that the $1.6 \ntrillion tax cut could negatively impact programs in agriculture and \ndefense, which are so important to the people of America and the people \nof Nebraska.\n  To put it another way, this legislation was written with one specific \ngoal in mind: to cut taxes without cutting hope, and to do so in a \nbipartisan manner. We have worked deliberately toward that end, and I \nam pleased to stand here today and help introduce a tax cut package \nthat will, in fact, achieve that goal.\n  In this plan we have included a $1.25 trillion tax cut proposal, and \nwe put $350 billion back into the surplus so it can be used for \nincreased debt reduction and the programs that are vital to the future \nof our industry, such as agriculture, defense, education, and a \nprescription drug benefit.\n  Acknowledging the discrepancy between the two plans offered today for \nconsideration gives us the chance to negotiate our partisan differences \non the tax cut. I believe quite strongly that the Breaux-Nelson-\nJeffords, et al., plan is an excellent starting point for this \ndiscussion.\n  I have had the privilege of working with the President back in the \ndays when I was Governor Nelson and he was Governor Bush. So I am \nfamiliar with the bipartisan efforts he undertook in the State of \nTexas. We both campaigned on the premise that we would reach across \nparty lines to find sensible solutions to the Nation's most pressing \nissues. With this bipartisan proposal on the table, the President and \nthe White House have the opportunity to demonstrate their negotiating \nskills and their desire to work together to achieve an ideological \nconclusion that is based not on partisanship, but is based on \npartnership.\n  Persuading one or two Democrats to vote with 48 or 49 Republicans \ndoesn't, in my opinion, constitute bipartisanship. However, sitting \ndown and working out our differences to establish a constructive \nalternative does, in fact, constitute bipartisanship.\n  On the surface, this legislation is about the tax cut, but it is also \nabout much more than a tax cut. This bill is about changing the \npartisan tenor in Washington. And when we can successfully negotiate \nwith the people at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, as well as with \ncolleagues on either side of the table, we will be taking a step in the \nright direction. I am confident that if we work together, we will in \nfact reduce our differences, and we will also in fact reduce taxes; but \nwe will not reduce our hopes and our dreams or those of others.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Nebraska. He \nhas been an exceptional addition to the Senate. He comes to us as a \nvery distinguished former Governor, and he has made a great \ncontribution to this debate in the Senate. I want to say that we \nwelcome him, and we are so pleased that he has played this constructive \nrole.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, at some point, the division of this \nSenate on the issue of a tax reduction proposal must end. We must find \nsome moment where there is a bipartisan approach that both protects our \nresources to deal with education and health care initiatives, but also \nhas meaningful tax reduction. This can be that moment.\n  I join with Senator Breaux because I believe we have found a \nreasonable compromise that is bipartisan--a $1.25 trillion tax \nreduction that lowers rates, offers real relief to middle-income \nfamilies, but also protects enough resources to deal with our \neducation, prescription drugs, and other family needs.\n  We have been told in recent months that there is a false choice. We \ncan either deal with these problems or we can provide tax relief, but \nmost assuredly we cannot do both. With this proposal, we achieve both \nby doing each modestly.\n\n  I have in the past indicated my belief that I could support a $1.6 \ntrillion tax reduction as proposed by President Bush. Indeed, if \nrequired to do so, at some point I might vote for it, but surely this \nis the better path--not a tax reduction of 51 votes, no Vice President \nbreaking a tie to decide upon a major national initiative that will \ndecide the basic fiscal parameters of this Government for the next \ndecade. This, a bipartisan plan that is affordable, protects the \nsurplus and allows for a variety of other initiatives.\n  This is the most important part of the plan because while these are \ngood times in America, they are not perfect times; and while the \neconomy has been strong, it is now troubled.\n  In the last few years, we began an effort to hire 100,000 teachers; \n50,000 remain to be hired to complete the program to reduce class size \nin America to 18 because we know it is the one variable that does the \nmost to improve the quality of education.\n  Under the plan I offer with Senator Breaux, this initiative can \nproceed. I am not certain it can with a larger tax cut program.\n  The Nation is living through a virtual revolution of technology with \nprescription medications prolonging life and helping the quality of \nlife. Yet 15 million Americans have no access to prescription drugs. \nThey are a vital part of their quality of life.\n  This plan leaves enough resources to write a realistic prescription \ndrug program. Were it larger, I am not certain that would be possible.\n  I hope Members of the Senate will look carefully at what Senator \nBreaux has offered today, our first chance at a bipartisan product to \nmove toward meaningful tax reduction and a balanced program. I am \nsympathetic with the need to reduce taxes and reduce them substantially \nand immediately. I do not think a nation at peace, in relatively good \neconomic times, should be taking 28 or 30 percent of the incomes of \nmiddle-income families. Indeed, 39 percent of the income of any \nAmerican family should not be expected in peacetime and in relatively \ngood times.\n  That is exactly what we are asking of the American people. The \naverage per capita tax in America is $6,300. In my State of New Jersey, \nit is an astounding $9,400 per person. For a middle-income family, that \nis money the Federal Government should not expect because the Federal \nGovernment does not need\n\n[[Page S3488]]\n\nit. That is money that should be going to educate children, feed them, \nhouse them, to deal with family security and emergencies and savings. \nThat is the better use of these resources.\n  I believe that meaningful tax reduction in an economy of this size, \nwith these emerging surpluses, can allow for dramatic tax reduction on \nthis scale.\n  Senator Breaux has offered a meaningful beginning to writing that tax \nreduction and providing that relief. I am proud to join with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey once \nagain for a powerful and persuasive presentation.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senator from Connecticut if he seeks time.\n  Mr. DODD. I do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my amendment is currently being crafted, and \nI have been in discussion with the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I will explain what the amendment is and then I will offer \nit shortly.\n  I will be offering this amendment on behalf of myself and several of \nmy colleagues: Senators Wellstone, Clinton, Bingaman, Corzine, Murray, \nLandrieu, Lincoln, Rockefeller, Dayton, and Durbin.\n  This amendment ensures that critical children's programs will be \nprotected from harmful cuts. President Bush, as we all know, campaigned \non the promise to leave no child behind. If we heard it once, we heard \nit a thousand times during the campaign. Those of us who took this \nPresident at his word were dismayed, to put it mildly, by the news 2 \nweeks ago that he intends to pay for the tax cut by cutting programs \naffecting children's health, children's hospitals, child care, and \nchild abuse prevention treatment programs.\n  His actions certainly beg the question: When he pledged to leave no \nchild behind, which children did he mean? Not abused and neglected \nchildren apparently because he would cut funding for child abuse by 18 \npercent.\n  Yesterday I attended a wonderful program sponsored by Child Help USA, \na national group supporting programs to eliminate child abuse in this \ncountry. I was pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the \nprogram. The luncheon was co-hosted by the distinguished wife of our \nmajority leader and my wife. We had speakers from the House and the \nSenate, as well as many experts from across the country who are \ninvolved in child abuse prevention. Groups like Child Help USA, serving \nthe needs of abused and neglected children throughout the nation, \ndeserve our utmost support. The amendment that I offer today is a step \nin the direction of providing that support.\n  What we are doing with this amendment is seeing to it that the level \nof funding for child abuse at the very least remains the same and we do \nnot have an 18-percent cut in that program, as called for in President \nBush's budget.\n  More than 800,000 children are the victims of child abuse each year. \nCertainly an 18-percent cut in that program can be devastating for \nthese very worthwhile efforts.\n  Children's hospitals is a second issue addressed by this amendment. \nThese hospitals train more than 25 percent of our Nation's \npediatricians and more than 50 percent of the country's pediatric \nspecialists. A $35 million cut in that program which trains \npediatricians and pediatric specialists is surely a move in the wrong \ndirection. The most critically ill children in our country are at these \nchildren's hospitals, and seeing to it they get the proper assistance \nand support is critically important.\n  The third issue addressed by my amendment is the restoration of the \n$20 million cut in the early learning programs contained in President \nBush's budget. These early learning programs were sponsored by our \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and our colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy. I believe the early learning program is \ncertainly worthwhile, and it has to be restored. My amendment will \nrestore this cut.\n  Lastly, as many of my colleagues know, child care is a very important \nprogram to our nation's children and families. Last year, this body, \nalong with the other body, increased funding for child care. Under the \nPresident's proposal, child care would be cut by $200 million which is \na major step in the wrong direction. Given the needs of children who \nare on waiting lists for child care and of working families who need \nhelp in paying for the cost of child care, child care funding is \nvitally important. Mr. President, in Texas, 41,000 children are on the \nwaiting list for child care assistance, in Florida, 44,000; \nMississippi, 15,000; 16,000 in Massachusetts; 14,000 in North Carolina. \nYet if the proposed cuts went into place, 60,000 more families with \nyoung children and toddlers would be denied child care assistance under \nthe child care development block grant that was authored by my \ncolleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and myself. We think the \nrestoration to present levels of funding is the very least we can do as \nwe enter the 21st century with the established need for well-trained \npediatricians, good early learning programs, adequately dealing with \nchild abuse, and providing at least the same level of funding for child \ncare assistance in this country.\n\n  We are told all the reasons we need to have a tax cut of this size, \nbut to do that, it seems to me, the cost of cutting into programs for \nthe most needy people in our society--children in children's hospitals, \nchildren who are abused, children who need early learning programs--is \ntoo high a price to pay for tax relief. To say we cannot provide some \nreduction in that tax cut, where the bulk of it is still going to those \nwho can afford these programs the most, to provide some assistance to \nthese children and these families is something for which this body I \nbelieve does not want to be on record.\n  This is not an increase. I stress to my colleagues, I am not asking \nfor that. I will, however, at some point. Today all I am asking for is \nthe restoration of last year's funding levels. That is all--child \nabuse, child care, and pediatric care, along with early learning \nprograms that Senator Stevens and Senator Kennedy have championed, do \nnot deserve these cuts. All I am asking for with this amendment is that \nwe--at the very minimum--provide the same level of funding we provided \njust last year. While I surely support adding to these levels, and will \nwork toward boosting funding as we move into the appropriation's \nprocess, the amendment I offer today simply restores cuts to these \nvital programs contained in President Bush's budget. Don't make cuts in \nthese programs at the same time we are offering a substantial tax break \nfor those I know who like it, but many of them would agree that their \nmoney could be better invested in programs that serve vulnerable \nchildren and families.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor his amendment. I thank him for his passion for children. I am very \nproud to be an original cosponsor of this amendment. I thank my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, if indeed they support this \namendment. To cut funding for a program that would help with prevention \nof child abuse, to cut funding for child care, little children, to cut \nfunding for training for doctors at some of our children's hospitals \nwhere you have some of the sickest children is no way to realize the \ngoal of leaving no child behind.\n  This amendment restores funding. There will be a number of Senators \nfighting for more funding for investment in children, especially \nprekindergarten, little children. This is a good amendment. I thank my \ncolleague from Connecticut. I am proud to be a supporter.\n  Mr. DODD. We are talking about a very modest amount of money. We \nMembers have been talking about billions of dollars yesterday and \ntoday. This amendment does not even get near the $1 billion figure. \nWhile we regularly talk of billions and trillion of dollars around here \nas if they don't count much, they surely count if you have a child in a \nchildren's hospital needing help, if you are a parent trying to afford \nchild care and you are working, if you have seen what happens to \nchildren that are abused. The millions of dollars that this \namendment will restore, while not the billions we usually\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\ntalk about, can make a huge difference to a family with a sick child or \nin need of child care. Sixty thousand children could be positively \naffected by keeping the funding level for child care, not to mention \nthe thousands of kids who need the help in our children's hospitals for \npediatric care, and not to mention the abused and neglected children \nthat would benefit from this amendment.\n\n  I hope that the request that I am making to my colleagues on the \nBudget Committee with this amendment will find some room in their \nhearts to at least keep the playing field level for children and \nfamilies that need our help. If we reduce the tax cut by this tiny \namount, it will not cause any great damage to other people. These \nprograms are deserving. The American public believes that children who \nare sick and need care, abused kids, deserve to get help.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator will modify the amendment so the money \nis taken out of the contingency fund instead of the tax cut it will be \npassed. Otherwise, we will have to wait and see what we can do.\n  I will take a minute in response to the Senators who spoke for a tax \nnumber considerably lower than the President's. I heard the number was \n$1.25 trillion. I heard both of the Senators on the other side, led by \nSenator Breaux, say we ought to have a bipartisan approach. The \nPresident came to town and they are quite sure this is what he would \nlike because it is bipartisan.\n  I remind everybody what I am willing to do as chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, to make sure the Senate understands--each and every Senator \nand those who report for them--we are asking for the President's \nproposal. I have heard him now more than 10 times clarify this. They \nask him: What about $1.25 trillion, Mr. President? What about $1.4 \ntrillion, Mr. President? Of course he is good-natured; he listens and \nhe says: I think that is too low. I think that is too low. They ask for \na higher amount because some want more than 1.6, and he says that is \ntoo high and 1.6 is just about right.\n  Those who are suggesting they are doing what the President is seeking \nwhen they are asking for $1.25 trillion instead of $1.6 trillion, that \nis their proposal. That is not the President's proposal. It may be they \nwill prevail and we won't get the President's proposal.\n  I want everybody to know that is my brief response to the two or \nthree speeches made on the other side of the aisle, led by the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Louisiana, the junior Senator from \nNebraska, and the senior Senator from New Jersey.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nadvocating passage of the Bond and Mikulski amendment on science and \ntechnology research funding. This amendment recognizes the critical \nimportance of Federal science and technology funding in expanding the \nfrontiers of science and laying the groundwork for economic success.\n  The Bond-Mikulski amendment will increase the funding for the \nNational Science Foundation, the Department of Energy's R activities, \nand NASA. Importantly, the increase to NSF would return us to a path to \ndouble that agency's funding over the next five years. I have worked \nfor many years with Senators Frist, Lieberman and others on the Federal \nResearch Investment Act, which would double federal funding government-\nwide for science and technology research. That bill has passed the \nSenate twice, but has yet to become law. This year I hope that it will \npass both Houses and become law. This amendment contributes to that \nlarger overall effort by maintaining our funding trajectory for several \nagencies for the current budget. The Federal Research Investment Act is \nstill necessary to reach our goal on the larger group of agencies that \ntogether represent our nation's overall commitment to federal science \nsupport, and to ensure that funding will be adequate over a longer time \nperiod.\n  Senators Bond, Mikulski, Frist, Lieberman, and I are not alone in our \ncall for more substantial funding for science and technology research. \nThe House Science Committee, CEOs of our high technology companies, \nPresidents of our leading universities, our top scientists and \neconomists, and representatives of labor organizations have all made it \nclear that Congress must make significantly higher long-term \ninvestments in science and technology research. Congressional failure \nto appropriate more funding for science and technology research will \nthreaten America's competitive advantage in information technology, \nbiotechnology, health science, new materials, and other critical \ntechnology-intensive fields. As we all know, many of our best economic \nthinkers, including Alan Greenspan, MIT economist Lester Thurow, and \nHarvard Business School professor Michael Porter, have asserted that \nour country's leadership in these areas is a critical ingredient for \nfuture economic success.\n  This amendment gives us a chance to make an important investment in \nour country's future and to lay the groundwork for continued American \nhigh-tech leadership. I urge my colleagues to heed our high-tech, \nacademic, and labor leaders' call to action on federal R support and \nwork together to pass this important amendment.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment offered by Senators Bond and Mikulski to increase funding \nauthorization for Function 250. Studies have shown that roughly half of \nthe economic growth in the past 50 years is a direct result of \ntechnological innovation; science, engineering, and technology play a \ncentral role in the creation of new goods and services, new jobs and \nnew capital. Three of the greatest generators of innovative ideas, The \nNational Science Foundation, NASA, and the Department of Energy, \nreceive significant budget increases in this amendment, reaffirming our \nnation's commitment to achieving advances in science and technology.\n  This commitment to research and development is also imperative for \ntraining the next generation of scientists and engineers. Reductions in \nR translate to reductions in the number of students trained in \ntechnical disciplines. In short, strong support for federally-funded \nR is crucial to continued economic and technological success for our \nNation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to indicate my strong support for \nthe amendment offered by Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski that would \nincrease the amount of funding available for scientific research at the \nNational Science Foundation, NASA and the Department of Energy by $1.4 \nbillion.\n  Our nation's capacity for groundbreaking scientific research is one \nof its greatest assets. Scientific research strengthens our economy, \nimproves our international competitiveness and raises the quality of \nlife for all of our citizens. President Bush's 2002 budget, however, \nwill retard our nation's investment into such research. For example, it \nvirtually freezes funding for the National Science Foundation, NSF, \ncutting facility project funding by $13 million, and providing no \nfunding for new projects. Such cuts threaten to throw our country's \nresearch portfolio out of balance by not providing for needed advances \nin the physical sciences and engineering.\n  Science is a bipartisan issue. A recent Wall Street Journal article \nreported that to pay for his tax cut, ``President Bush is having to \nchop another Republican priority: increased government spending for \nscience.'' D. Allen Bromley, a professor of nuclear physics at Yale and \nscience and technology advisor to former President George H. W. Bush, \nrecently wrote, ``the proposed cuts by the Bush Administration to \nscientific research are a self-defeating policy. Congress must increase \nthe federal investment in science. No science, no surplus. It's that \nsimple.'' Even Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has been reported as \ncalling the President's NSF budget ``a tragic mistake,'' stating it \n``should be $11 billion'' instead of $4.5 billion.\n  Earlier this year, a blue-ribbon panel of physicists recommended a \nsite in my state of South Dakota, the Homestake Gold Mine, as its \npreferred location for a world class underground physics lab. Last \nyear, the Homestake Mining Company announced it will close its doors \nthis December after more than 125 years of operation. The mine has been \nthe economic mainstay of the Black Hills of South Dakota, and its \nclosure\n\n[[Page S3490]]\n\nwould have a devastating effect on the surrounding communities. \nConverting the mine into a world-class research facility holds great \npromise for the scientific community at large and would minimize the \ndisruption the mine's closure will have on the region. With an \nunderground laboratory, hundreds of new jobs would be created, business \nwould expand, and new opportunities for growth and learning would \nabound.\n  If Homestake is selected as the site for a national underground \nscience laboratory, it is imperative for the project to be funded this \nyear. Unless construction begins this year, Homestake Mining Company \nwill allow the mine shafts to flood when the mine closes, permanently \nforeclosing any chance of building the lab at Homestake. Moreover, the \nlonger we delay, the more likely it is that the mine's workforce will \nleave, crippling our ability to construct the lab.\n  The Bond/Mikulski amendment will greatly enhance the prospects that \nvaluable scientific ventures like the national underground physics \nlaboratory will secure the government support needed to make them \nviable. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 322\n\n  Mr. DODD. I call up amendment No. 322.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, when I came to the Senate in 1999, one \nof my goals was to bring fiscal responsibility to Congress and to our \nNation.\n  In this regard, I have pursued my fiscal priorities, which are: pay \ndown the debt, control spending, and, if possible, return to the \ntaxpayers any of their money that is not needed to meet our most \npressing obligations.\n  Over the last 2 years we have had the proverbial ``good news/bad \nnews'' with respect to putting our fiscal house in order.\n  The good news is, we are not using the Social Security surplus or the \nMedicare Part A surplus to cover our spending, allowing them instead to \nbe used as they were intended. In effect, we have managed to ``lock \nbox'' Social Security since 1999, and Medicare since 2000. I think we \nneed legislation to make sure we continue to do that.\n  In addition, because we haven't dipped into Social Security or \nMedicare surpluses, we have been able to allocate a total of $363 \nbillion towards debt reduction in the last 2 years.\n  The bad news is, we have spent far too much money over the last 2 \nyears. For fiscal year 2001, we increased non-defense discretionary \nspending 14.3 percent last year and we had an 8.6 percent increase the \nyear before.\n  In the last half of last year, the 106th Congress increased spending \nover 10 years by $598 billion. Nearly $600 billion of the taxpayers' \nmoney gone--used up. That is disgraceful.\n  Therefore, to help avoid a repetition of this sad episode, I am \nproposing this amendment with my two colleagues, Senator Feingold and \nSenator Gregg.\n  The amendment we are offering helps to refine the procedures in the \nbudget\n\n[[Page S3491]]\n\nprocess that are designed to control spending. It is clear from the \negregious levels of spending in the past couple of years that the \nexisting process needs reinforcement.\n  Our amendment is designed to tighten the enforcement of existing \nspending controls. To do this, we create an explicit point of order \nagainst emergency spending that does not meet the definition for \nemergency spending as laid out by OMB.\n  Under our amendment, Senators may raise a point of order against \nlegislation designated as emergency spending that fails to meet certain \ncriteria.\n  This provision would apply equally to both discretionary and military \nspending and would also establish a 60-vote waiver threshold.\n  I realize we will not completely stop the problem of Congress' over-\nspending here today, but it is a reasonable first step.\n  So what we are doing here with this amendment is closing budget \nloopholes by: Creating a point of order against actions that raise the \ndiscretionary spending caps; creating a point of order against efforts \nto waive sequesters, which is a budget enforcement mechanism; and \ncreating a point of order against directed scoring in essence, telling \nOMB and CBO how to treat spending that others use in order to dodge \nspending limits.\n  Any waiver of these measures will require 60 votes.\n  I want to reassure my colleagues that our amendment will not preclude \nthe use of emergency spending to meet our true defense needs.\n  I have no doubt whatsoever that should this Nation face a crisis, \nthere will be well over 60 Senators willing to vote to waive any \npossible use of this point of order.\n  I believe that it is important that we have this tool to eliminate \nthe irrelevant spending that so often gets ``tacked on'' to our defense \nemergency supplemental appropriations bills.\n  For instance, in past defense supplementals, we have spent: $1 \nbillion on ballistic missile defense enhancements; $200 million on \ndefense health programs; and $42 million on defense counter-drug and \ndrug interdiction activities.\n  I would question whether these defense ``emergencies'' could not have \nbeen handled in the normal appropriations process.\n  Total emergency supplemental defense spending in fiscal year 2000 \namounted to $17.5 billion, and in fiscal year 1999, it totaled $16.8 \nbillion.\n  Even for Washington, these are large sums of money.\n  I am sure that the vast majority of this spending is for legitimate \nemergencies.\n  However, I believe we need an added safeguard to help stop abuses of \nthe emergency spending designation in an effort to circumvent our \nspending caps.\n  I believe this amendment is a sensible approach to achieving our goal \nof fiscal responsibility and it represents a good step toward improving \nthe transparency of our budget process.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 322, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a modification of my earlier \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase discretionary funding for Early Learning, Child \nCare Development Block Grant, Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment, and \n                        Pediatric GME programs)\n\n       On page 2, line 17, increase the amount by $270,700,000.\n       On page 3, line 13, decrease the amount by $270,700,000.\n       On page 27, line 3 increase the amount by $270,700,000.\n       On page 27, line 4 increase the amount by $243,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 22 increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 24 increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 15 increase the amount by $870,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 16 increase the amount by $870,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 2 increase the amount by $270,700,000.\n       On page 4, line 16 increase the amount by $270,700,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Voinovich and Gregg, to offer this amendment to improve fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  Our amendment would strengthen enforcement tools. The amendment would \nrestate the procedure on emergency spending from last year's budget \nresolution, with one change. It would put emergency defense spending on \nexactly the same footing as emergency domestic spending. All emergency \ndesignations would thus be subject to a 60-vote point of order.\n  As under current practice, if sustained, the point of order would \nstrike the emergency designation, but leave the associated funding. If \nthe funding, without the emergency designation attached, would push the \ntotal funding for the bill over its allocation, or over the total \ndiscretionary spending cap, another point of order could be raised.\n  Our amendment would also close several budget loopholes. It would \nmake out of order three separate devices used to evade budget \ndiscipline: changing the discretionary spending caps, waiving a \nsequester, and directing scorekeeping. Under current law, doing any of \nthese three things is out of order on any bill not reported by the \nBudget Committee. Our amendment would extend that prohibition to all \nbills.\n  This amendment will strengthen budget enforcement. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I want to remind my colleagues of one thing. The \ndirect scoring was used in the last two omnibus appropriation bills to, \nfrankly, avoid busting the budget caps. That is why it is so important \nwe have this point of order.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. \nTherefore, I am constrained to raise a point of order. The amendment \nviolates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask the point of order be waived and \nask for the yeas and nays on the waiver of the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Had the Senator used all his time? How much time did he \nuse?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They used 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator like to speak a little longer on this \namendment in case somebody is interested?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Not necessarily, unless somebody wants to speak \nagainst it. Then I will answer.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Does the Senator from South Carolina seek time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for 10 minutes from my \ndistinguished chairman?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 225\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 225 on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Biden, Senator Daschle, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Hollings], for \n     himself, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Daschle, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 225.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for a $85 billion tax rebate, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       On page 43, strike lines 10 through 12, and insert the \n     following:\n       (A) New budget authority, $85,000,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, $85,000,000,000.\n       (C) The Senate finds that\n       (i) given the apparent economic slowdown, the Congress \n     should stimulate the economy by passing a 1-year true tax cut \n     stimulus package that provides income tax and payroll tax \n     relief;\n       (ii) for real economic stimulus the 1-year tax cut should \n     equal approximately 1 percent of the gross domestic product, \n     or $95,000,000,000;\n\n[[Page S3492]]\n\n       (iii) a meaningful economic stimulus must reach as many \n     taxpayers as possible, or at least 120 million people;\n       (iv) the broadest range of taxpayers can be reached by \n     offering a direct rebate based on income tax liability or \n     payroll tax liability; and\n       (v) the tax stimulus bill should be immediate and take \n     effect on or before July 1, 2001.\n       (D) It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that the Senate should as soon as practical \n     consider and pass a stimulus tax package pursuant to this \n     budget resolution that will result in a rebate of\n       (i) up to $500 per individual or $1,000 per couple for 95 \n     million taxpayers who pay income tax; and\n       (ii) up to $500 for the 25 million taxpayers who pay \n     payroll taxes but do not have income tax liability.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, my appeal now is to all Democratic \nSenators, all Republican Senators--to the Senate as a body--to heed the \ndistinguished majority leader's admonition to us last evening when he \nexclaimed: We are fiddling while Rome burns. What we should be doing is \ntaking up a stimulus measure to get the economy moving, not, if you \nplease, worrying about what is going to happen over the 10-year \nperiod--not for the elections next year, or education, or housing, or \nPatients' Bill of Rights, or health care, or any of these other things.\n  Distinguished members of the Concord Coalition, including the former \nSecretary of the Treasury, Secretary Rubin, and former Senators Warren \nRudman and Sam Nunn, recently wrote an editorial to The Washington \nPost, ``On Taxes, One Step At A Time,'' saying what we really need:\n\n       We believe an immediate fiscal stimulus can be provided \n     independently of the proposed 10-year tax cut.\n\n  That is exactly what my amendment is cut out to do. The previous \namendment, the Durbin amendment, involves the tax cut. This has nothing \nto do with the tax cut. It responds to what Rubin and others have been \nsaying, that is, to at least try to get 1 percent of a $10 trillion \neconomy, around $85 billion or $95 billion, to extend to the greatest \nnumber of Americans--namely, the 95 million taxpayers and the 25 \nmillion payroll workers, some 120 million Americans--a $500 rebate, \nSenator Domenici, or $1,000.\n  You ask me where the money is? This is the most money we can utilize \nfor stimulus without touching the Medicare and Social Security trust \nfunds. I would have put in even more, if it was available. The $60 \nbillion the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has in his bill was \ncalled, by Steve Forbes, ``an hors d'oeuvre.'' I call it half a \nhaircut. I do not know whether the $85 billion in this particular \nmeasure is going to do the trick. I hope so. But we have the best \nauthorities from all walks of economic life, and from the market \nitself, in agreement.\n  MIT professor Lester Thurow:\n\n       If President Bush were really interested in using taxes to \n     stop the plunge in the economy, he would drop his 10-year tax \n     cut and first go for a large 1-year temporary tax cut, a \n     stimulus package that could be extended for another year if \n     needed.\n\n  That is exactly what I have done. I am not involved in the budget \narguments so as to divorce it from the politics of tax cuts; rather, \nget a true stimulus package.\n  Robert Kuttner, whose column appears in the Boston Globe: First, the \ntax cut should be smaller, quicker, and directed to people who need it.\n  The best idea proposed by Harvard's Richard Freeman and the Economic \nPolicy Institute is a one-time dividend of $500 for every woman, man, \nand child. That would inject a lot of stimulus into the economy right \nnow. The Treasury could send out the checks within a month.\n  We are all complaining about Alan Greenspan, but we have to do our \npart here. If you want to accept responsibility for the recession, just \nvote against this amendment, because this is not involved in the \npolitics, tax, or the budget debate. This is involved in what everyone \nsays--Republicans and Democrats, economists and market experts--that we \nneed right now.\n  David Broder:\n\n       If they can, this country can reap the benefits of an \n     immediate tax cut that will cushion the effects of the \n     slowdown of the economy.\n\n  That is just last week. And this week's Business Week headline reads: \nAmerica Needs That Tax Cut Right Now.\n  We made it a rebate because I am confident that our friends on the \nother side of the aisle will not support the Durbin amendment. Of \ncourse, the Durbin amendment is not an amendment with respect to the \n$60 billion amount, it is an endorsement of the same amount. I think it \nis inadequate on the one hand, but otherwise it gives that 10-year \nlower bracket of 15 percent down to 10 percent, which costs them $500 \nbillion and goes right in the face of the Bush tax cut.\n  I do not want to get involved in that political argument. I want a \ntrue tax cut for which everybody can vote. That is it.\n  What we have been doing here has gotten all wound up with the rich, \nthe poor, the high, the low; what are we going to do for medicine, what \nare we going to do for defense and everything in the next 10 years. But \nas the distinguished majority leader yesterday afternoon said: Rome is \nburning.\n  If you want it to continue to burn, vote the amendment down. If you \nwant to revive the economy and the market so that there will be some \nsurpluses here, then please help us with this particular amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the Senator?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I read the amendment. Let me see if I am correct. You \ndon't do anything to the rest of the budget and the proposed tax cut.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No. I leave that alone.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You just increase the 60 that we have.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Eighty-five, because I understand Senator Grassley has \nused some emergency agricultural funds in his amendment. That is the \nonly one that is touched for 2001. The Budget Committee staff has been \nkeeping score. I had to cut it back to 85.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am certainly going to explore this with the Senator.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Please do. My goodness, with the smile on your face and \nwith some help, we can really help the economy. That is the whole \nidea--not to be partisan, or, I am for Bush, or against Bush, or I am \nfor the rich and you are for the poor, and all of that kind of stuff. \nLet's really get what the economy needs now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am in fact smiling. My face is in such a big smile \nthat I can't hardly talk. So just give me a moment. I don't want you to \nanswer this. But if I consider your amendment, would you consider my \nbudget?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Oh, yes. I consider your budget. In fact, if we had all \nof those surpluses, I promise to vote for Bush's budget. As Senator \nByrd carries around the Constitution, I carry around the economy. The \ndebt to the penny by the U.S. Treasury, from the Secretary of the \nTreasury, shows that the debt has gone up this fiscal year already by \n$102 billion, with a $42 billion increase in the debt owed by the \npublic and $60 billion in debt owed by the Government itself.\n  We are not paying down the debt. But if you get those surpluses, you \nwill have my help.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I close by saying I don't want to ask \nanother question, obviously, because your answer was one that I didn't \nexpect. But I want to remind you that you made a deal with me once. You \nsaid as soon as we balance the budget--you and I--wouldn't you jump off \nof some building?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Off the dome. That is right. You had me looking for a \nparachute last fall. But now look at what we have going. We are \nspending money we don't have now on this particular measure.\n  I go back to Roosevelt's ``prime the pump,'' because I remember for \nabout a 2- to 3-year period back in my hometown they were paying \neverybody in script. We didn't have the money.\n  That assumes we don't have the money. But if you want to get this \neconomy moving again, let's vote for this particular amendment so we \ncan do that and not be accused of bogging down in the political \nargument of tax cuts and budgets.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would have modified my suggestion, and would have \nsaid, Will the Senator try a bungee jump? You wouldn't have to jump for \nreal.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S3493]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and the ranking member, Senator Conrad. I yield the remainder \nof my time. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 201\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment with Senator \nBrownback and others, No. 201.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself and Mr. \n     Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 201.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n            (Purpose: To provide for a tax cut accelerator)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. TAX CUT ACCELERATOR.\n\n       (a) Reporting Additional Surpluses.--If any report provided \n     pursuant to section 202(e)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act \n     of 1974, estimates an on-budget surplus that exceeds the on-\n     budget surplus set forth in such a report for the preceding \n     year, the chairmen of the Committee on the Budget of the \n     House of Representatives and of the Senate shall make \n     adjustments in the resolution for the next fiscal year as \n     provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Adjustments.--The chairmen of the Committee on the \n     Budget of the House of Representatives and of the Senate \n     shall make the following adjustments in an amount not to \n     exceed the difference between the on-budget surpluses in the \n     reports referred to in subsection (a):\n       (1) Reduce the on-budget revenue aggregate by that amount \n     for the fiscal years included in such reports.\n       (2) Adjust the instruction to the Committee on Ways and \n     Means and the Committee on Finance to increase the reduction \n     in revenues by the sum of the amounts for the period of such \n     fiscal years in such manner as to not produce an on-budget \n     deficit in the next fiscal year, over the next 5 fiscal \n     years, or over the next 10 fiscal years and to require a \n     report of reconciliation legislation by the Committee on Ways \n     and Means and the Committee on Finance not later than March \n     15.\n       (3) Adjust such other levels in such resolution, as \n     appropriate, and the House of Representatives and the Senate \n     pay-as-you-go scorecards.\n       (c) Legislation.--It shall not be in order in the Senate to \n     consider any bill that is reported by the Committee on \n     Finance pursuant to the adjusted instructions described in \n     subsection (b), unless the bill provides for expedited \n     procedures for the consideration of the bill by the Senate no \n     later than 60 days after the bill is reported by the \n     Committee.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I bring forth this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Brownback, Senator Craig, and Senator Hutchison of \nTexas. This measure is the tax cut accelerator amendment which will \nhelp provide the assurance that we live up to our obligation to \nAmerican families and make sure they receive the tax relief they \ndeserve.\n  The way this works is if the Congressional Budget Office's January \nreport projects higher than expected on-budget surpluses over the \nprevious year, then this amendment would require the Budget Committee \nto make the appropriate budgetary adjustments by reducing the on-budget \nrevenue aggregate by the same amount as previously unaccounted for--the \nunaccounted for on-budget surplus.\n  It instructs the Finance Committee to increase the amount of tax \nrelief by the same amount, and the bottom line is it sends money back \nto the people and not to fund increased Government spending.\n  We hear many issues and ideas about triggers and brakes and circuit \nbreakers designed to slow down tax relief and not enough about a tax \ncut accelerator in the case that on-budget surpluses are higher than \nexpected.\n  If you look at the Congressional Budget Office projections over the \nyears, they are generally very pessimistic about what revenues will be \ncoming in and, therefore, surpluses will not be there. But, in fact, \nthey are right about the deficits. They err on the side of caution. I \nunderstand that. That is probably a good way of looking at things.\n  However, if the economy is doing better, if the budget surpluses \nappear on a year-to-year basis, who ought to have the first claim on \nthose surpluses? In my view, it ought to be the taxpayers.\n  The Finance Committee and Budget Committee may not want to use the \nentire surplus for tax cuts being accelerated. They may want to say \nthey want to take care of priorities--let's say expenditures in health, \nor scientific research, or national defense. They will say: Well, we \nwill use half this for these priorities and half for accelerated \nreductions in taxes.\n  The point is, that identified surplus is not spent--not rolled over--\nbut it is determined as a definite, identifiable amount of money that \nthe Budget Committee will act upon, that the Senate Finance Committee \nwill act upon, and then this whole body will act upon and have that \nscrutiny.\n  I think it will, of course, in my view, help speed up tax relief to \nthe people.\n  Because any view is more optimistic than the pessimistic views of the \nCongressional Budget Office. There is plenty of evidence, and other \nprojections have been too low over the years because they use static \nestimates--not dynamic estimates.\n  It is understandable why in 1-year budgets you would use static \nanalysis because you do not have the full impact of tax reductions or \nany measures until a few years or maybe more than a few years down the \nroad. If you want to look at what the impact of static analysis has on \nunderestimates in the revenue impact because of tax cuts, the Kennedy \ntax cut under President John F. Kennedy was 12.6 percent of Federal \nrevenues. They reduced rates from 90 to 70 percent. The rate reduction \nresulted in a return of all expected revenue losses plus an additional \n4 percent. The Reagan tax cut, at 18.7 percent of Federal revenues, \nreduced rates, tax rates from 70 to 50 percent. The static models \npredicted a revenue impact of a negative $330 billion. The actual \nfiscal impact on the Treasury was about $78 million--less than one-\nfourth of the expected impact.\n  These numbers, coupled with CBO's past inaccuracies, make it \nreasonable to believe that the on-budget surpluses will come in higher \nthan projected.\n  I am convinced more than ever that we need a tax cut accelerator. \nOver the past few days, the Senate has chipped away on the on-budget \nsurplus.\n  The Senate has reduced drastically the available money for tax \nrelief. Hiding behind the arguments over process about how many \nreconciliation instructions per budget resolution is really to get in \nthe way of real tax relief for American families.\n  Real people do not care about reconciliation. They think it is a \ndomestic matter, if you ever bring up reconciliation. It means, at \nbest, some sort of family squabble being resolved. They care about \nproviding for their families. People in the real world care about their \nfuture.\n  This tax relief accelerator will hold Congress accountable to the \nAmerican people, which I think is very good. This budget represents a \npromise to the people of America. It protects Social Security and \nMedicare. Tax cut accelerator does not affect Medicare or Social \nSecurity; it is only the on-budget surplus.\n  This budget helps pay off all available debt. It funds current \nGovernment obligations and programs. It provides a $26 billion \nincrease, or 4 percent raise, over last year's budget for Government \nspending. It ensures for future contingencies. And this budget promises \nto provide the people of America with the tax relief they deserve.\n  I generally support this budgetary framework, and I strongly believe \nwe should honor all of its promises. The tax cut accelerator provides \nthe assurance that Washington will fulfill its promise to return excess \non-budget surpluses to the people, to the taxpayers, instead of \npermitting their hard-earned dollars to be spent away by Government \nbureaucracies.\n  The accelerator does not--does not--touch Social Security or Medicare \nfunds. It does not threaten funding for current programs. It allows for \nincreases in funding for new and existing priorities, such as defense, \neducation, science, and medical research. And it does not bring back \ndeficit spending.\n  Today we have a choice. Our choice is, Do we keep our promises? Do we \ntrust the American people and adopt this amendment which provides the \nnecessary mechanism to ensure the return of unexpected on-budget \nsurpluses back to our families and businesses or do we allow Government \nto keep this money from them?\n  I say we ought to let the people decide how to best spend their hard-\n\n[[Page S3494]]\n\nearned dollars. Families must be better able to save and spend for \ntheir children's education, to make a downpayment on a new home, to \ninvest in their business, or to prepare for their retirement years. It \nis my view that we ought to trust people in our free enterprise system. \nPeople, better than Government, know how best to allocate their own \ndollars.\n  When there is excess money here in Washington, and in an on-budget \nsurplus--money that has not been appropriated; it is not promised, it \nis just coming in at a greater rate than anticipated--the first claim \non that, the first lien, so to speak, the first mortgage, ought to be \nto the taxpayers of this country with accelerated tax reduction.\n  So with that, I see my friend from Kansas has risen.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. OK. I will yield the floor and allow the opposition to \nmake any statements they so desire.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We do not intend to use time on the amendment. So it \nwould be appropriate for the Senator from Kansas to use the time. It \nis, unfortunately, the only way we can stay on schedule with what we \nagreed to on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that I be allotted 5 minutes \nto speak on behalf of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank my colleague from Virginia for his sponsorship in putting \nforward this amendment. I think this is a key amendment.\n  We have been talking a lot about reducing the tax cut because we are \nnot sure that the money may come in. What this amendment says is, if \nthe money does come in, then let's require that there be a vote that we \nhave a larger tax cut. That seems to me to be the symmetrical \ndiscussion that should be taking place.\n  We hear concern about: OK, what if the resources do not come in? What \nif this does not quite work out? Should we lock ourselves into this \nsize tax cut? What we are saying is, once this money comes in--I am \nconfident it is going to come in; I am confident that it will happen--\nif it does come in, then tax cuts of a larger scale should be voted \nupon.\n  Yesterday the step was taken by the Senate to make a smaller tax cut. \nI think that was a wrong step. I think it is a bad step for our \neconomy. That sends a signal to people that there is going to be less \nmoney in their pocket. Less consumer confidence will result and that is \ngoing to be a more difficult situation for our economy and for our \npeople.\n  What we are trying to do is send a different signal, saying that if \nthis economy continues to put these sorts of receipts in the Federal \nGovernment--which I am confident that it will--then we are going to \nreturn more of that to the American taxpayers. That will create an \neconomic climate that allows individuals to make informed savings and \ninvestment decisions. It is the best path for sound, responsible fiscal \npolicy.\n  If individuals are not confident that the economic decisions they \nmake today will be respected in the Tax Code tomorrow, they will be \nless likely to take the kind of risks that make our economy one of the \nmost productive and fastest growing in the world. That level of \npredictability and the assurance is important.\n  This is why offering taxpayers a one-time rebate, in my estimation, \nas has been proposed by some of my colleagues, is bad economic policy. \nThe problem is, it gives the veneer of economic growth while only \nproviding really a Band-Aid to the larger underlying problems of \nsluggish growth and a slowing economy.\n  The goal of our economic policy should be to encourage savings and \ninvestments at the margins, not promoting policies that artificially \nmight prop up the economy through consumption incentives that do \nnothing to solve long-run economic problems.\n  Mr. President, because I know our time is short, I want to make an \nadditional point; that is, for people who are also concerned that we \nare not paying down the debt sufficiently with the policies we put \nforward, what this says is that if we have more coming in, we will vote \non a larger scale tax cut. We are going to continue to pay the debt \ndown. We will pay down all the available debt over a period of 10 \nyears. This has nothing to do with that. We will continue to honor that \ndebt paydown provision that is in the overall budget and is a part of \nour overall proposal. I want to make sure we set that one off to the \nside so people are not concerned about that particular issue as well.\n\n  With those caveats, and for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to \nvote for this triggering mechanism that would go into place if--if--the \ndollars are forthcoming. There really should be no reason to vote \nagainst this amendment. That is why I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment and vote for it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time and \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be made a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I believe the Senator has allocated me a few minutes.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Yes.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Might I inquire of the Chair as to the amount of time \nremaining for the Senator from New Mexico?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time for the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I would like to have just a final closing comment, and \nthen I will yield to the senior Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Let me say in a few seconds--and I want to yield the \nremainder of the time to the senior Senator from Virginia--the Senator \nfrom Kansas has it exactly right. We want to have an insurance policy \nfor the people of this country, the taxpayers. We understand their \nbudgets are strained.\n  If there is a surplus--and we are optimistic there will be because we \nthink reducing taxes helps create jobs, improve our economy, and has a \ndynamic, positive impact on our country. So if you want to make sure \nthe taxpayers of this country get any of the excess money they have the \nfirst claim on, then you should support this amendment because it \nsupports the people of America and will help strengthen our economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the senior Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Warner.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I would like to call up amendment No. 265, and ask \nunanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what was the \nrequest?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a request to call up an amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I object. There is an amendment pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. I have it filed at the desk.\n  Mr. REID. We have a UC that is now in order. There is a unanimous \nconsent agreement in order, and the only amendment in order now is one \nto be offered by Senator Wellstone, after this one is completed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I had consulted with the Senator from New Mexico. I was \ntold I could have a minute. Obviously, I am in error. I apologize to my \ndistinguished colleague, and I withdraw my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, how much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine seconds.\n\n[[Page S3495]]\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. How much?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-six seconds now.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, CBO, in January of 1999, said that the \n2-year forecast showed a total budget surplus of $2.3 trillion. The \nsurplus announced this year is $5.6 trillion. In that 2-year time \nperiod, they more than doubled the size of it. What we are saying is, \nif that happens again, as is likely, let us vote on a bigger tax cut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane. \nTherefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section \n305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, under section 904 of the Budget Act, I move \nto waive section 305 of the Budget Act for the consideration of this \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota. We only have 10 minutes remaining, I advise the Senator--\nactually less than that. We have agreed to provide the other time to \nthe Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is fine.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from North Dakota yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, the Senator from North Dakota can't yield at this \npoint for a question because we are rapidly running out of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 269\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 269.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n     Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Feingold, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Durbin, \n     Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment numbered \n     269.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I introduce this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senators Johnson, Bingaman, Dorgan, Murray, Mikulski, Kerry, \nFeingold, and Landrieu. I ask unanimous consent that Senators Durbin \nand Daschle be included as original cosponsors as well as Senator Harry \nReid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the problem with the President's budget \nrequest and this budget resolution is it provides a $1 billion increase \nover fiscal year 2001 for all of the VA discretionary programs. That is \nno way to say thank you to veterans. Secretary Principi, who is a great \nSecretary, testified before the veterans committee last month. I \nbelieve he will be a great advocate for veterans, but he had a tough \ntime with the following question: How does a $1 billion increase over \nfiscal year 2001 do the job for America's veterans when we are going to \nsee a $900 million increase this year in medical inflation alone?\n  Then if we get beyond the $900 million and add to that our commitment \nto treating people with hepatitis C, our commitment to emergency \nmedical services for veterans who have no coverage, our commitment to \nthe millennium program for older veterans, our commitment to mental \nhealth services for veterans, we get way above $1 billion.\n  Mr. President, there are huge gaps in the veterans health care \nsystem. We can do much better. This amendment would increase the \nveterans health care budget, contained in this budget resolution, by \n$1.7 billion annually. The independent budget, which was produced by \nAmvets, VFW, DAV, the Disabled American Veterans, and Paralyzed \nVeterans, talked about $2.6 billion. This amendment gets us to that \nlevel.\n\n[[Page S3496]]\n\n  Here is the point: $1 billion for all discretionary programs for the \nVeterans' Administration is pathetic. It doesn't come close to meeting \nthe needs.\n  I am joined by Senator Rockefeller, who is the ranking minority \nmember on the veterans committee. He will be speaking in just 1 minute.\n  The arithmetic is compelling, just on veterans health care: $900 \nmillion in inflation, emergency room services for veterans who don't \nhave any coverage, hepatitis C coverage we have committed to, the \nmillennium program, which is so important when we are saying to \nveterans who are 65 years of age and over, we are going to begin to \naddress your long-term care needs.\n  When I am in the medical center in Minneapolis and I am talking to a \nspouse of a World War II veteran, and this happens over and over and \nover again, she doesn't have a clue what she is going to do when her \nhusband gets home. Where is going to be the care for her? Where will be \nthe supportive services for him? Not to mention all the long waits of \nveterans for health care.\n  The county veterans service officers are the best of the best of the \nbest. They do the work down in the trenches. I get my education from \nthem. Even though they are not within the VA system, they talk about \nthe long waits and the gaps.\n  This amendment is all about living up to our commitment to veterans. \nWe need to provide full funding for veterans health care. This \namendment should receive Democratic support and Republican support. The \namendment offset by transferring $1.7 billion out of these Robin-Hood-\nin-reverse tax cuts, of which over 40 percent of the benefits going to \nthe top 1 percent. We surely can transfer $1.7 billion to veterans \nhealth care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nadded as a cosponsor of the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Let's be very clear. The Senator from Minnesota is \ncorrect. For the Department of Veterans Affairs, under the budget \nresolution which is proposed, there will be tremendous damage to the \nVeterans' Administration and to the veterans of our country. It is \naxiomatic that the increase that is contemplated in the budget \nresolution simply will not work. It does not come close.\n  If there is anything which is an immutable fact, it is that the cost \nof health care and the cost of paying those who deliver it goes up by \nmore than a billion dollars a year, just for health care alone. That is \nacross America, and that is true for the veterans.\n  Beyond that, we have a very difficult problem of disability claims. \nWe need $132 million for staffing and technology. My veterans in West \nVirginia are being told they are going to have to wait for a full year \neven for a preliminary examination of their disability claims.\n  Lastly, we cannot forget our commitment to the final resting places \nof honor for our veterans. Our Nation's veterans cemeteries are falling \napart in many cases. Graves are sinking. Tombstones are breaking. That \nmay seem incidental to some. It does not seem incidental to any \nveteran's family.\n  I urge all to remember our promise to our veterans and support the \nWellstone amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I would like to first commend Senate \nBudget Committee Chairman Domenici for including an increase in his \nbudget mark for veterans' health care. This funding level is in line \nwith what the Administration proposed in its budget request and shows a \nrenewed commitment to veterans' health care.\n  While I am pleased that this budget includes an increase in outlays, \nI am disappointed that it falls short of the funding level proposed in \nthe authoritative Independent Budget endorsed by 40 veterans groups and \nmedical societies, including AMVETS, the Disabled American Veterans, \nthe Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the VFW.\n  That is why I join Senator Wellstone in offering an amendment today \nthat would increase appropriations for veterans health care by $1.718 \nbillion over the Budget Committee's level. With our amendment, the \nSenate budget resolution would include an increase in appropriations of \n$2.6 billion for veterans health care over last year's funding level.\n  Our amendment pays for this increase in health care for our nation's \nveterans with a modest decrease in the $1.6 trillion in tax cuts \nproposed by the President.\n  For a number of years, the VA had to contend with a flat-line \nappropriation for veterans' health care as the cost of health care far \noutpaced the rate of inflation. As a result, the VA experienced deep \ncuts at a time when it should have been addressing the growing need for \nmedical care for this country's veterans.\n  For the past 2 years, I have offered amendments in the Budget \nCommittee and on the Senate floor to increase veterans funding to allow \nthe VA to continue giving quality care to veterans. With the help of \nthe chairman, we were able to increase VA health care funding by $1.7 \nbillion for fiscal year 2000 and $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2001. \nThese were good steps in restoring budget equity to veterans' health \ncare.\n  We must continue this process by increasing funding for veterans' \nhealth care to the level recommended in the Independent Budget. It is \ncritical that we increase veterans health care funding over and above \nthe Chairman's mark in order to compensate for previous underfunded VA \nbudgets and to allow the VA to meet the growing health care needs of \nour veterans.\n  Veterans from South Dakota visited my office recently with stories of \nunderstaffed VA hospitals, long waits for appointments, and reductions \nor cuts in vital services. These situations are not unique to my state \nand affect every VA hospital and clinic in the country.\n  With adoption of our amendment, we will have a VA veterans' health \ncare budget that can adequately offset the higher costs of medical care \ncaused by consumer inflation, medical care inflation, wage increases, \nand legislation passed by Congress.\n  Without a total increase of $2.6 billion above last year's \nappropriation in veterans health care, the VA will likely be unable to \naddress the treatment of Hepatitis C, emergency medical services, \nincreased costs due to medical inflation, and long-term care \ninitiatives.\n  The Independent Budget highlights the need to increase funding in a \nnumber of important health care initiatives including: an additional \n$523 million for mental health care; an additional $848 million for \nlong-term care; an additional $25 million to restore the Spinal Cord \nInjury program; an additional $75 million to help homeless veterans.\n  Our efforts over the past 2 years to increase VA veterans' health \ncare have helped to reverse the damaging effects of years of flat-lined \nVA budgets. We have an opportunity to continue this progress by \nadopting our amendment to increase funding for VA veterans' health care \nby $1.718 billion over the Chairman's level in the budget resolution. \nWith our amendment, we will fund veterans' health care at the level \nrequested in the Independent Budget.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Johnson-Wellstone amendment on \nveterans' health care. At this time, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record letters of support for our amendment from \nveterans organizations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                           The Independent Budget,\n\n\n                            A Budget for Veterans by Veterans,\n\n                                                    April 3, 2001.\n     To All Members of the Senate:\n       On behalf of the co-authors of The Independent Budget, \n     AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of \n     America, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, we are writing to \n     urge you to support the Johnson-Wellstone Amendment that \n     would increase Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health \n     care funding to the level we recommended for FY 2002.\n       The President's ``Budget Blueprint,'' and the Domenici \n     substitute to H. Con. Res. 83 provides a discretionary \n     spending increase of $1 billion. This recommended amount \n     would not even cover the costs of mandated salary increases \n     and the effects of inflation. The Independent Budget has \n     identified an increase for VA health care of $2.6 billion \n     over the amount provided in FY 2001. This recommended \n     increase would provide the resources necessary for the VA to \n     meet the needs of the men and women who have\n\n[[Page S3497]]\n\n     served our Nation, and rely upon the VA for the health care \n     they need.\n       Again, we ask for your support of the Johnson-Wellstone \n     Amendment that would increase the amount available for VA \n     health care up to the level we have recommended in The \n     Independent Budget.\n           Sincerely,\n     David E. Woodbury,\n       Executive Director, AMVETS.\n     Keith W. Wingfield,\n       Executive Director, Paralyzed Veterans of America.\n     Robert E.

This \n     recommended increase would provide the resources necessary \n     for VA to meet the needs of the men and women who have served \n     our Nation and rely upon VA for health care.\n       Again, we urge your support of the Johnson-Wellstone \n     Amendment to increase the amount available for VA health care \n     to the level necessary to properly and compassionately \n     provide for veterans' health care needs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

Anything less than the \n     Independent Budgets' recommended 2.6 billion dollar increase \n     will mean a cut in health care services. We must not and can \n     not return to the days of inadequate health care because of \n     the lack of funding.\n       Once again, on behalf of all the members of North Central \n     Chapter PVA, we commend you for all your efforts on Veterans' \n     health care issues. If at any time we can be of assistance, \n     please do not hesitate to contact our office or myself and \n     we'll happy to help.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                    Joel Niemeyer,\n         Government Relations Director, North Central Chapter PVA.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I ask my colleagues to support an \namendment offered by Senators Wellstone and Johnson to S. Con. Res. 20, \nthe concurrent resolution on the fiscal year 2002 Budget. The budget \nresolution provides for an increase of $1 billion for all veterans \nfunding from the fiscal year 2001 amount. The Wellstone-Johnson \namendment goes further and provides for an overall increase of $2.6 \nbillion for veterans' health care.\n  If the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded at the level that the \nBudget Resolution provides, a $1 billion increase over the fiscal year \n2001 appropriation, which might appear generous at first glance, we can \nexpect VA to eliminate staff, delay providing health care and benefits, \nand slash vital programs.\n  While some may describe the funding included in this resolution as a \nmajor increase, I must disagree. Much, if not all, of this proposed \nincrease would be consumed in merely overcoming inflation in the costs \nof providing medical care. After spending vast sums for a tax cut for \nthe wealthiest Americans, there simply isn't enough money to meet VA's \nneeds in the next fiscal year.\n  The alliance of veterans service organizations that authors the \nIndependent Budget for Fiscal Year 2002--AMVETS, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, rightly concluded that ``more must be done to meet the \nincreasing needs of an aging veteran population, adapt to the rising \ncost of health care, enhance and facilitate benefits delivery, and \nmaintain the continuity of funding for VA programs as a whole.''\n  The budget resolution before us would not allow us to fulfill those \nobligations. We must ensure VA a level of funding that will minimize \nthe impact of inflation, fund existing initiatives, and allow the \nsystem to move forward in the ways we all expect.\n  Urgent demands on the VA health care system make increased funding \nessential. The landmark Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits \nAct of 1999 significantly expanded VA noninstitutional long-term care, \nwhich for the first time is available to all veterans enrolled with the \nVA health care system. As we contend with the dilemma of developing \nlong-term care for all Americans, VA will begin this effort with our \nNation's veterans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \nVA noninstitutional extended care program will cost more than $400 \nmillion a year. We must supply adequate funds to fulfill this \nlegislative mandate.\n  The Millennium Act also ensures emergency care coverage for veterans \nwith no other health insurance options. Necessity demands this costly \nprovision: nearly 1 million veterans enrolled with the VA are uninsured \nand in poorer health than the general population. Although this new \nbenefit has not yet been either implemented or publicized, claims are \nalready mounting.\n  Medical inflation and wage increases, factors beyond VA's control, \nhave been estimated to devour nearly $1 billion of VA's budget \nannually. At the same time, more and more veterans are turning to the \nVA for health care. In my own state of West Virginia, the number of \nveterans seeking care from VA has increased, despite a declining total \nnumber of veterans statewide. As an example, the Martinsburg VAMC saw \nits new enrollees increase by 24.7 percent over the last 2 years. \nRapidly expanding enrollment at all four West Virginia VA medical \ncenters has jeopardized their ability to provide high quality care in a \ntimely fashion. Unfortunately, similar examples can be found throughout \nthe Nation.\n  Between new initiatives--long-term care and emergency care coverage, \nand simply maintaining current services, we must secure an increase of \n$1.8 billion for health care alone.\n  Unfortunately, maintaining current services will not be enough to \nensure that VA can meet veterans' health care needs. The aging veterans \npopulation faces chronic illnesses and newly recognized challenges, \nsuch as the disproportionate burden of hepatitis C, that will further \nstrain VA facilities. We must anticipate the difficulties of treating \ncomplex diseases and ensure that we do not neglect the needs of \nveterans with multiple, coincident medical problems.\n  If we simply maintain current services, can we expect VA to restore \nthe capacity for PTSD and spinal cord injury treatment to the 1996 \nlegislatively mandated level? In West Virginia, many veterans not only \nwait months for specialty care, they have to travel hundreds of miles \nto get it. We can depend on community outpatient clinics to increase \nveterans' access to primary health care, but we must also ensure that \nthe many veterans who require more intensive, specialized services can \nturn to adequately funded inpatient programs.\n  VA research not only contributes to our national battle against \ndisease, but enhances the quality of care for veterans by attracting \nthe best and brightest physicians. The Budget Resolution allows, at \nbest, for a stagnant research budget. Not only will this slow the \nsearch for new and better medical treatments, but it could weaken \nefforts to protect human subjects in VA-sponsored studies. An increase \nof $47.1 million will be required merely to offset the costs of \ninflation and to monitor compliance with increasingly stringent \nresearch guidelines.\n  The $2.6 billion increase proposed by Senators Wellstone and Johnson \nin the amendment before us will ensure that VA has the resources \nrequired to provide veterans with the high quality health care that \nthey need.\n\n[[Page S3498]]\n\n  Savings may be gained through more resourceful management of VA \nhospitals and clinics, a possibility that VA is pursuing through its \nCapital Asset Realignment and Enhancement Studies, CARES. In the \nmeantime, efficiencies should not come at the expense of veterans who \nturn to the VA health care system for needed treatment, nor should VA \nneglect essential repairs and maintenance of its infrastructure while \nawaiting the outcome of the CARES process. Accommodating the backlog of \nurgently needed construction projects will require an increase of $280 \nmillion. A shortsighted focus on immediate gains, by delaying essential \nprojects or neglecting existing facilities, may compromise patient \nsafety and prove even more costly to VA and veterans in the long run.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration also faces challenges that \nrequire additional funding for staffing. One of these challenges \nresults from an aging workforce. Projections suggest that 25 percent of \ncurrent VBA decisionmakers will retire by 2004. These losses would be \nin addition to the staff that has already left service. It takes 2-3 \nyears to fully train a new decisionmaker. Therefore, it is critical \nthat VBA hire new employees now to fully train them before the \nexperienced trainers and mentors have retired.\n  In addition to this looming succession crisis, extensive new \nlegislation enacted in 2000 will severely affect VBA's workload. \nSweeping enhancements to the Montgomery GI Bill are expected to double \nVA's education claims work. New legislation reestablishing the ``duty \nto assist'' veterans in developing their claims, regulations \npresumptively connecting diabetes to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam \nveterans, and new software systems intended to improve the quality of \ndecisionmaking have severely affected VBA's workload and slowed output. \nWest Virginia veterans are already receiving letters from the VA \nregional office warning them to expect a 9-12 month delay for even \ninitial consideration of their new claims.\n  If VBA is unable to hire new staff, the increasing backlog of \nclaims--which is already unacceptable--would reach abominable levels. \nWithout an increase in staffing, the backlog of claims is expected to \ngrow from the current 400,000 claims (up from 309,000 in September \n2000) to 600,000 by March 2002. VBA will need a minimum increase of \n$132 million to acquire the tools, staffing and technology, to avert \nthis escalating disaster.\n  The mission of the National Cemetery Administration, NCA, providing \nan honorable resting place for our Nation's veterans--is becoming more \ndifficult as we face the solemn task of memorializing an increasing \nnumber of World War II and Korean War veterans. It is estimated that \n574,000 veterans died last year. The aging of the veterans population \nis placing additional demands on NCA in interments, maintenance, and \nother operations. VA has attempted to meet this demand by opening four \ncemeteries over the last 2 years and planning construction of the six \nnew cemeteries authorized by Congress in 1999. It is estimated that an \nincrease of $21 million will be required to develop these cemeteries.\n  Increases are also required to maintain the VA's National Shrine \nCommitment. We must preserve our national cemeteries so that they do \nnot dishonor those who died serving their country. Sunken graves and \ndamaged headstones cannot be tolerated. We applaud VA's commitment to \nthis initiative and encourage VA to continue the project. In order to \nrise to this task and operate its current facilities, NCA will require \nan increase of at least $13 million for a total appropriation of $123 \nmillion.\n  If we fail to amend the Budget Resolution before us, we tacitly place \nthe needs of affluent Americans before our obligations to our veterans.\n  While we consider the best way to cut taxes responsibly, we mustn't \nlose sight of our obligations. We all need to agree on how much should \ngo to tax cuts and how much should be saved to strengthen Medicare, \ninvest in education, and fully address the needs of the men and women \nwho have served our country. I urge you all to support this amendment \nso that we can fulfill our Nation's promise to our veterans.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we should observe for our colleagues that \nwe set a goal of going to the debate on reconciliation at 3:30. Wonder \nof wonders, we have accomplished that goal.\n  I thank all of our colleagues who have worked together to help make \nthis happen. I single out, of course, the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Mr. Domenici, who, along with his staff, has worked so \ndiligently to bring us to this point.\n  I also want to thank on our side, Senator Reid, the whip, who has \nreally worked night and day to try to expedite the consideration of \nthis budget resolution. I think working together we have managed to get \nthe trains to run on time, which is not always the case in the Senate.\n  Again, I thank very much my colleague, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee along with his very able staff, including the director, Mr. \nHoagland, for the very hard work they have done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, somehow I feel that we are not yet \nfinished, that we have a long way to go. I think I am right. \nNonetheless, we ought to stop over and pat ourselves on the back this \nafternoon because we didn't really have this afternoon all planned out \nwith any unanimous consent agreements. We had 2 hours. I think we have \nmade the best of it. I think from that side four different amendments \nhave been considered with various Senators speaking, and we have had \ntime for others to give speeches on matters of importance. We have \ntaken some on our side. They are all subject to amendment, unless we \naccept them. We have looked at them to see if we can dispose of them.\n  I thank Senator Conrad and his staff because we got a long way today \ntoward accommodating Senators who felt very strongly that they had to \ngive a speech along with their amendment. Nobody is limited in the \nfuture, but the vote-arama will take a very long time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 345\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 345.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n                  (Purpose: To provide for tax relief)\n\n       At the end of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RECONCILIATION OF REVENUE REDUCTIONS IN THE SENATE.\n\n       The Committee on Finance of the Senate shall report to the \n     Senate a reconciliation bill--\n       (1) not later than May 18, 2001: and\n       (2) not later than September 14, 2001\n\n     that consists of changes in laws within its jurisdiction \n     sufficient to reduce the total level of revenues for the \n     period of fiscal years 2001 through 2011 by not more than the \n     sum of the totals set out in Section 101(1)(B) of this \n     resolution and increase the total level of outlays by not \n     more than $60,000,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2001 \n     through 2011.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have 3 hours to \ndebate this reconciliation instruction, one-half hour for the \ndistinguished Senator Byrd, or his designee, and one-half hour for the \nSenator from New Mexico, or his designee; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, since Senator Gramm wants to speak in \nthe\n\n[[Page S3499]]\n\nway that addresses a matter brought up with reference to tax cuts \nearlier, I will yield on our side 10 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. This has been a long, hard process and we are only \npart way through it. Senator Domenici and I don't always agree at every \nsingle moment, but my admiration for him constantly grows as the years \npass and I have an opportunity to work with him more.\n  We are getting ready to have a serious debate, and I don't want to in \nany way infringe on it by getting into any kind of partisan bickering, \nbut I did want to respond to one point that was made earlier when we \ndidn't have time to respond. I can be brief about it.\n  Some of our colleagues lamented the lack of bipartisanship on the \nbudget. I want to respond, with all due respect, that bipartisanship is \na two-way street. Since we started considering the budget, we have had \namendments offered by Democrat Members of the Senate to spend another \n$697 billion over the next 10 years. This is coming on top of the last \n6 months of last year, where we added $561 billion to the underlying \nspending projections of the Federal Government over the next 10 years. \nI just want to say that never in that short a period in American \nhistory, to my knowledge, have we ever had a Congress or a Senate \npropose more spending in a shorter period of time. I guess I would say \nthat you can't have it both ways. You can't have the bipartisanship you \nseek and, at the same time, propose that level of spending.\n  Having gotten all that out of my system, let me turn to the issue \nbefore us. I thank Senator Byrd for his willingness to talk to Senator \nDomenici, to me, and to others, in trying to find a way out of this \nconflict. When you serve in the Senate, when you have competing visions \nfor America's future, when you believe in what you are doing, it is \neasy to get into conflicts that are unavoidable. But when they are \navoidable and you don't avoid them, it is not only poor legislative \nstrategy, but I don't think you are living up to the high standards of \nthis great institution.\n  So when Senator Byrd raised a concern about using reconciliation on \nthe tax bill, even though we feel as strong on our side, based on the \nprecedents that have been used, including the tax increase when \nPresident Clinton was President, and the tax cut that was part of \nreconciliation in 1997, we decided that any time you can accommodate \nthe concerns of another Member without undoing your ability to have a \nchance to achieve what you want to do, that you ought to do it.\n  So we undertook what I call a fairly extensive negotiation. We met \nthree or four times off and on. We submitted a proposal in writing. \nJust to refresh my colleagues' memory, we have about four or five \npeople who work with this law every day. Senator Byrd wrote most of it. \nBut to most Members, and almost everybody else in America, it is all \ngibberish.\n  Basically, under reconciliation, we have a very powerful tool that \nallows you to have special privilege in implementing your budget. You \nare going to hear a lot of debate about that and what it was intended \nto do today.\n  The point is, it does exist. It is part of the law. Under that \nprocedure, it would mean that the tax bill we bring to the Senate would \nbe subject to these special procedures: There would be 20 hours of \ndebate equally divided. The majority could yield back its 10 hours. So \nwe could end up with 10 hours of debate. We have a strict germaneness \nrule on amendments. When the debate is over, we have an up-or-down \nvote.\n  In naming conferees, we have a time limit on debate. We have an up-\nor-down vote. That is the procedure that exists in the budget process.\n  What we had sought to do in trying to work out an accommodation--and \nI am sorry it did not work, as I know Senator Byrd is. I want people to \nunderstand there was a good-faith effort to work this out. We proposed \nthat rather than having 20 hours, we have 50 hours equally divided.\n  We proposed on first-degree amendments there would be no more than 2 \nhours, unless the managers yielded more time, that is, if there was \nreal debate, and on second-degree amendments, only 1 hour; that all \nfirst- and second-degree amendments be germane; that at the end of the \nprocess, we have an up-or-down vote; that on naming conferees, we have \na time limit on debate and then have an up-or-down vote; and the same \nprocedure would apply to the conference report.\n  Some concern was raised that even with this agreement, we could come \nback and use reconciliation again. It was clear from our intent at the \ntime that if we agreed to a unanimous consent agreement, there would be \nno need to use reconciliation.\n  In any case, with the best of intentions, we got together. \nDifferences existed at the end of the process, and no agreement was \nreached. So we are here basically in a debate and with a vote coming \nthat no one wanted, but here it is.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to give a very brief synopsis of my \nargument for the use of reconciliation. We have had an extensive debate \non the floor of the Senate. We are going to adopt a budget at some \npoint. I hope it will be to my liking, but we are going to adopt one \nwhether it is to my liking or not. We are going to go to conference. I \nhope to be a conferee, and I am confident the conference report will be \nmore to my liking if this bill is not.\n  In any case, we want to be sure we have an opportunity to have an up-\nor-down vote on the President's tax cut or something very close to it. \nObviously, there is no way we can make people vote for it, but we want \nto be sure that a new President with a new agenda gets an opportunity \nto have his program voted on.\n  We obviously are at an impasse as a Senate on naming conferees. When \nwe worked out this powersharing agreement--an extraordinary agreement, \nin my opinion, and a very generous agreement from the majority leader, \nin my opinion--one of the things that was not worked out is what do we \ndo about conferences.\n  We believe if we pass a tax bill in the Senate and it requires a \nconference, we do not want to get into a position where we simply try \nto pass the House bill. It may not be the final product we want. That \ndoes not make for good law to do something like that. We ought to be \nable to name conferees, and on a tax bill we adopt, obviously we \nbelieve we should have a majority on the conference committee.\n  Unfortunately, since we could not work out a unanimous consent \nagreement, the only way we can be assured that we have this opportunity \nto make the case and have an up-or-down vote is through reconciliation.\n\n  When reconciliation was used to raise taxes in President Clinton's \nfirst year in office, not one Republican voted for that tax increase, \nbut no one challenged the right of our colleagues who were in the \nmajority then to use reconciliation. No one challenged that right. It \nwas used.\n  In 1997, in the budget when reconciliation was used to adopt a \nbipartisan tax cut, that was a hammered out agreement between the \nRepublican majority then in both Houses and President Clinton. No one \nchallenged our right to use reconciliation for that process.\n  Now we have a situation where we are trying to do for our new \nPresident what President Clinton did. We are trying to follow a \nprocedure that we followed in 1997 when no objection was made. We \nunderstand strong feelings. We are sorry we could not work this out, \nbut in the end, we believe the process is the right process, and given \nour inability to work out an agreement, we want to use it. That is why \nI urge my colleagues to vote to allow us to use the same process that \nhas been used over and over since the budget process first started.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for his succinct \nsummary of where we are and what we are about.\n  The reason this is a serious debate is because it did not take me 28 \nyears being a Senator to learn--in fact, probably in the early years, I \nlearned from my opponent who has been in the Senate 43 years--there are \nsome things\n\n[[Page S3500]]\n\nvery special about the Senate that everybody should know. It has a \ncouple of qualities that are rather incredible for parliamentary \nbodies.\n  One of those is freedom to debate. Sometimes people call that the \nright to filibuster. Filibuster does not sound so good, so of late we \ncall it freedom to debate. That really means if you want to delay \nthings or if you want to get your way or you want to make some changes \nyour colleagues do not want to make in the Senate, you can get the \nfloor and can talk as long as you can talk and nobody can stop you \nuntil you stop yourself. It even means more than that.\n  Essentially, it is the right to debate as long as you want and as \nlong as you can.\n  The second quality that makes this a very different institution is \nthe right to offer amendments. It takes some people a while to know \nwhat that really means.\n  I can recall during the Vietnam war there was a Senator from the west \ncoast who used to sit at one of the desks in the back. I am going to be \nas plain and honest about it as I can. Come 8 o'clock at night, it was \n5 o'clock in the Senator's State. At about that time in the afternoon, \nregardless of what we were debating, that Senator would try to get the \nfloor and try to offer either an amendment or resolution regarding the \nVietnam war because he was becoming known as an anti-Vietnam war \nSenator.\n  Of course, at 8 o'clock in the Senate, it was 5 o'clock in the State \non the west coast. If one does that every 5 or 6 days, you get to be \nknown as the anti-Vietnam Senator. A Senator can also offer that to any \nkind of bill. It can be offered to an appropriations bill. It can be \noffered to an authorizing bill unless there is an agreement to the \ncontrary. It is a Senator's right.\n  Those are the two qualities that are most significant about the \nSenate. I learned them rather quickly. I do not think I appreciated \nthem in terms of the institution for maybe about 10 years.\n  I soon found, once I became a member of the Budget Committee --in \nfact, through a quirk of things, I got on very early and I did not \nchoose to ever get off because I could see myself moving up, never \nthinking I would ever be chairman. I could see myself moving up and \nbeing ranking member. All of a sudden, the Republicans took over the \nSenate, and I got a call from Senator Baker who said: Hi, Mr. Chairman, \nyou are chairing the Budget Committee. If I was not in that position, I \nwas in the position of lead Republican.\n  I found out very quickly those two qualities--the right to filibuster \nor debate as long as you want and the right to amend --were changed by \na law that changed the rules of the Senate. I am holding it up.\n  This is the law. It was adopted 25 years ago. It changed, for as long \nas this law is operative, the rules of the Senate because if you have a \nreconciliation instruction under this Budget Act, which changes the \nrules of the Senate, that reconciliation instruction no longer carries \nwith it on the floor of the Senate those two cherished privileges.\n  It has a limited debate because this law says the debate is limited. \nIt says only 50 hours of debate on a resolution and only 20 hours of \ndebate on a bill that comes forward from this document and a resolution \ncalled reconciliation.\n  Guess what else it did. You do not have a right to amend a bill that \nis a creature of a reconciliation instruction which is a creature of \nthis law. You don't have that right. Laws on amendments are very \nnarrowly construed.\n  I know my good friend, Senator Byrd, is going to attempt to draw a \ndistinction between what we are doing in this budget resolution because \nwe have a surplus and what we did other times--either by increasing the \ntaxes, as we did for President Clinton in a reconciliation instruction, \nwhich meant 20 hours of debate and, for all intents and purposes, no \namendments. We were in the minority, and every single Democrat voted to \ngive the Finance Committee that authority, and then every Democrat \nvoted to pass the bill that was the creature of that reconciliation--\nsplit exactly down party lines. But taxes were increased under the \nprocess created by this act, in derogation of the normal rules of the \nSenate.\n  I happened to have been here through almost every reconciliation, and \nmy friend from West Virginia frequently calls it ``re-conciliation,'' \nand we have agreed that both pronunciations are correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. The pronunciation by the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico is the correct one. I have just gotten into a habit for a long \ntime of saying ``re-conciliation.'' I think it is reconciliation. I am \nliable to stay in the same old habit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe the budget resolution before \nthe Senate today is like other budget resolutions. And I have been a \nparty to every single one. If somebody wants to write the history of \nwhat has happened that is most significant to the Senate in the past 25 \nyears, they can start off with this bill. This has caused the most \nsignificant changes that the Senate has had imposed upon it by virtue \nof a reconciliation instruction that has, on some occasions, reduced \nspending. On other occasions, it has increased taxes. On other \noccasions--and if we get around to the details I will list them for \neveryone--we have used it to cut taxes or reduce taxes.\n  Those who will write the history of the past 25 years will probably \nsay that no other document has caused more changes in the tax laws up \nand down, in the changing of entitlements up and down, without full \ndebate and without the right to amend, than this document over this 25 \nyears.\n  I was thinking I would come to the floor and tell the Senate every \nreconciliation bill of which I have been a part. But the list is too \nlong. It is very long. There have been many. You can tell if you read \nstatutes of the U.S. Congress and you find something that says Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1976 or 1981, almost without exception \nthey are the creature of a reconciliation instruction done on the floor \nof both Houses ultimately to their respective committees.\n  Frankly, I don't see any difference between what we have done in the \npast and what we have done here. As a matter of fact, there was an \noccasion in 1996 when the other side of the aisle challenged a proposal \nin a budget resolution to reduce taxes. They actually raised the point \nof order that it wasn't right, it wasn't permitted under this act. The \nParliamentarian agreed that it was. We had a vote where the other \nside challenged that and sought to appeal the ruling of the Chair. The \nChair was sustained. The Chair was sustained by a partisan vote. We had \nthe majority by three then. We had 53 Senators then. The Senate decided \nyou could use reconciliation to reduce taxes, as they were in 1976. I \nmight suggest they were done again in 1997 and 1999 and no challenge \nwas made to them.\n\n  In two instances we did it, and the President vetoed the bills \nanyway. So you don't find an omnibus reconciliation tax bill for those \nyears. But one did pass the Congress, both Houses.\n  All I have sought in the budget resolution and all I seek here is to \nuse the same process we have been using since this Budget Act was \nadopted. It had many experts, but in order to become what it has \nbecome, because it still works, it had to have some knowledgeable input \nwhen it was written.\n  What did they need to do? They needed to make sure that nothing stood \nin the way of getting a budget resolution, No. 1, including that rules \nof the Senate could not stand in the way of the budget resolution. It \nhad a limited amount of time. And it had to get passed.\n  Then they didn't want reconciliation to be held up. In particular, \nsection 310 of the act, on page 25 of the act, states: Inclusion of \nreconciliation directives in a concurrent resolution on the budget--a \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for any fiscal year to the extent \nnecessary to effectuate the provisions and requirements of such a \nresolution.\n  That is precisely what we are trying to do with our request that this \nprocedure be made available.\n  Frankly, some have asked: Senator Domenici, how can you keep on doing \nthese year after year? I don't know. I think it is because the \nreconciliation process provides an opportunity to get something done. \nIf there wasn't something significant happening because we stood here \non the floor and produced a budget resolution, I say to my good\n\n[[Page S3501]]\n\nfriend Senator Byrd, I don't think I would have been staying on the \nBudget Committee, doing budget resolutions, if we just admonished \ncommittees and then they didn't have to do it. In fact, I stayed on \nbecause we had to tell committees what the parameters were and they did \nit. We always told them, if they didn't do it, something might happen. \nThey misconstrued us sometimes, and they thought we would write their \nlaw. We didn't know what would happen. The leadership would have to \nfind a way to enforce it if the committees didn't.\n  The point is it has been exciting because we have done 12, 14, maybe \n15 reconciliation bills that have literally caused change that would \nnot have happened. Senator Graham you didn't like some of the changes. \nSome of the changes I didn't like. To tell you the truth, I didn't like \nmany of them. But I don't believe we should deny ourselves an \nopportunity for this new President to have us use a reconciliation \ninstruction bound and borne by this Budget Act which changes the rules \nof the Senate for as long as this law exists.\n  I didn't think we should say: We have used it, but you can't use it \nnow. We thought our President's proposals for 4 percent growth in the \nexpenditures of government in the ordinary and regular appropriation \nprocess and a $1.6 trillion tax cut over 10 years out of a surplus of \n$5.6 trillion seemed to be more than justified by the new President's \nproposals for sound fiscal policy and, indeed, for sound tax policy for \nour people.\n  With that as my introductory remarks and my concern, I offer today an \ninstruction, an instruction that we would ask the Senate to vote on \nsoon, sometime this evening, that essentially says we can use the \nprocess called reconciliation to accomplish the tax consequences of \nthis budget resolution in its final form, whatever that is.\n  I am quite sure that I have not made this interesting for those out \nthere listening; it is pretty hard to make this interesting. But \nneither do I hope that I appear anything but serious.\n  A little while ago one of my good friends asked me to smile. I smiled \nin response, so big that I couldn't talk. Then I said I have to either \nquit smiling or I can't talk anymore.\n  In any event, it is serious. I think we should all try very hard to \nmake the average person listening to this understand it is important to \ntheir business. The public's business is really affected by the rules \nand the rights of Senators. But they are also affected by the rules and \nrights created by this Budget Impoundment Act of 1975. I did not help \nwrite it. I voted for it. I think it passed overwhelmingly. I don't \nknow if there were even any negative votes for it. I remember Senators \nsuch as Chuck Percy from Government Operations playing a part in it, \ncoming to the floor, saying it was the biggest change we will ever \neffect.\n  It took me 5 or 6 years to understand it really was a big change. All \nwe want to do now on our budget is make sure the changes permitted by \nthis law be carried over to this President's tax proposals so we can \nget a start, as he would say, toward letting the people of this country \nget back some of their money and also to create a kind of tax policy \nthat will be good for the future.\n  I am going to read this. I will not go into any detail. I would say \nreconciliation has been used by the Senate--with reference, Senator \nGramm, to tax law changes--not 1 time, not 5 times, 15 times--one-five \ntimes it has been used--10 times to increase taxes and all became law, \n5 times to cut taxes, 2 became law, 2 were vetoed, and 1 did not find \nits way beyond the Halls of Congress. It was what was seen to be a \nrather useless chore, to send it down to be vetoed. But the Congress \ndid it. So I repeat, over 25 years no wonder the Senator from New \nMexico wanted to stay on this. We were changing things dramatically, 15 \ntimes--10 to increase taxes, all of which happened; 5 to cut taxes, all \nof which happened.\n  With that history I very much appreciate Senator Byrd wanting this \nmatter to be thoroughly discussed. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a critically important debate. \nThis is not fundamentally a question of the issue of the President's \nproposal for a tax cut. This is a far bigger issue than that. This is \nthe fundamental question of the role of the Senate in our Government.\n  Our Founding Fathers had a genius. They created this structure of \ngovernment to protect the rights of the American people. They built a \nHouse of Representatives that they wanted to respond to the immediate \nfeelings of the people, a body elected every 2 years. They wanted them \nto respond to the will of the people and the immediate passions of the \nmoment.\n  They created the Senate with Senators having 6-year terms for a very \ndifferent reason. They wanted the Senate to be the cooling saucer in \nour Government. They wanted the Senate to be able to debate and amend \nand to coolly reflect on what the policies should be for our country. \nThat is the role of the Senate, and this debate is consequential \nbecause it would dramatically change the role of the Senate.\n  Reconciliation means no less than Senators giving up their \nfundamental right to extended debate and amendment. Those are the \nthings that distinguish this body from parliamentary bodies the world \naround. It is what has made this Chamber the greatest parliamentary \nbody in the world. All of that is at stake in the next 3 hours, because \nat the end of that time we are going to vote, and how we vote will help \ndetermine the future role of this body.\n\n  Reconciliation was established in 1974 to allow Congress to make \nlast-minute spending or revenue changes. It was not intended to be used \nto enact major new spending proposals or major tax cuts or substantive \npolicy changes. It was a device to make small changes. It was in that \ncontext that Senators were willing to limit their right to debate and \noffer amendments, because it was so narrowly to be applied.\n  By the early 1980s, reconciliation had evolved into a mechanism for \ndeficit reduction. For example, in 1981, Congress used reconciliation \nto enact the spending cuts that President Reagan called for. It was not \nused for the tax cuts that President Reagan proposed and that were \npassed precisely for the reasons I have given. It was for deficit \nreduction, not for spending, not for tax cuts.\n  In 1985, Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget \nEmergency Deficit Control Act and, in separate legislation, the Byrd \nrule. Both proposals served to limit the focus of reconciliation solely \nto deficit reduction.\n  What is being proposed now is precisely the opposite, a $1.6 trillion \ntax cut with limited debate, limited time for amendment, the rights of \neach Senator sharply curtailed. That was never the intention of the \nFounding Fathers of our Nation--never.\n  There have been attempts in recent years to dramatically alter \nreconciliation to implement major tax cuts instead of to achieve \ndeficit reduction, but not once have those changes been enacted. No \nreconciliation package that did not reduce the deficit has ever been \nenacted--not one.\n  The Senator from Texas referred to 1993 and President Clinton's \nbudget that included reconciliation. Precisely so, because that was a \ndeficit reduction package.\n  In example after example that has been given by my colleagues on the \nother side, they have neglected to point out that when reconciliation \nactually was used and law was enacted, those were deficit reduction \npackages.\n  Every one that involved a tax cut was never enacted--not once.\n  That is why this debate is so consequential, so profound, and will \nset a very important precedent.\n  In 1981, a colloquy occurred during consideration of the \nreconciliation bill. Majority leader Howard Baker, the Republican \nleader, and the Democratic leader, Senator Byrd, underscored the belief \nthat the intent of reconciliation was limited to deficit reduction.\n  According to Senator Howard Baker, the revered Republican leader:\n\n       Reconciliation was never meant to be a vehicle for an \n     omnibus authorization bill. To permit it as such is to break \n     faith with the Senate's historical uniqueness as a forum for \n     the exercise of minority and individual rights. In 1985, \n     Congress passed the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Balanced Budget \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act in order to reduce the growing \n     budget deficit. The 1985 act provided that no amendments to a \n     reconciliation bill would be in order if the amendment did \n     not have the result of reducing the\n\n[[Page S3502]]\n\n     deficit. That was the purpose of reconciliation, to reduce \n     deficits, to either increase taxes or to cut spending but to \n     reduce deficits. It was not designed to either allow or \n     permit an increase in spending, or cuts in taxes. That is \n     precisely the opposite of what was intended.\n\n  I call my colleagues' attention to something the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee said back in 1985. He said:\n\n       Frankly, as chairman of the Budget Committee, I am aware of \n     how beneficial reconciliation can be to deficit reduction. \n     But I am also totally aware of what can happen when we choose \n     to use this kind of process to basically get around the Rules \n     of the Senate as to limiting debate. Clearly, unlimited \n     debate is the prerogative of the Senate that is greatly \n     modified under this process. I have grown to understand that \n     this institution, while it has a lot of shortcomings, has \n     some qualities that are rather exceptional. One of those is \n     the fact that it is an extremely free institution, that we \n     are free to offer amendments, that we are free to take as \n     much time as this Senate will let us to debate and have those \n     issues thoroughly understood both here and across the \n     country.\n\n  The Senator from New Mexico, our budget chairman, was right when he \nsaid that in 1985.\n  He said in 1989:\n\n       There are few things about the United States Senate that \n     people understand to be very, very, significant. One is that \n     you have the right, a rather broad right, the most \n     significant right, among all parliamentary bodies in the \n     world to amend freely on the floor. The other is the right to \n     debate and to filibuster. When the Budget Act was drafted, \n     the reconciliation procedure was crafted very carefully. It \n     was intended to be used rather carefully because, in essence, \n     Mr. President, it vitiated those two significant \n     characteristics of this place that many have grown to respect \n     and admire. Some think it is a marvelous institution of \n     democracy, and if you lose those two qualities, you just \n     about turn this U.S. Senate into the United States House of \n     Representatives, our other parliamentary body.\n\n  That is what this debate is about. Are we going to have a Senate that \nfunctions as our forefathers intended, as the Framers of the \nConstitution intended, or are we going to turn this body into a second \nHouse of Representatives?\n  That would be a profound mistake--a mistake for our country, a \nmistake for this Chamber, and a mistake for the future.\n\n  I hope very much that cooler heads will prevail, that we will vote to \nreject reconciliation for this purpose, and that we will reserve it for \ndeficit reduction.\n  This is a profoundly important decision. We have just a few hours \nbefore it will be resolved. I hope very much that we understand and \nappreciate that we can consider tax cuts in this Chamber without using \nthe reconciliation process that limits the rights of Senators and that \nchanges the role of the Senate.\n  Massive tax cuts were considered without reconciliation in 1981. They \ncan be considered without reconciliation in the year 2001.\n  That is what we should do. That is what we must do.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor. I ask my colleague from West \nVirginia to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from West \nVirginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Herodotus, the Father of History, instructs \nus that on his way to Salamis, Xerxes the Great, the Persian monarch, \nascended a hill because he had a longing to behold his mighty army, \nwhich was probably the largest army that was ever assembled in the \nhistory of the world. And arriving there, he paused to look upon all of \nhis mighty hosts.\n  As there was a throne of white marble, which had been prepared \nbeforehand at his bidding, Xerxes the Great, son of Darius and grandson \nof Cyrus the Great, took his seat upon it, and he gazed thence upon the \nshore below, beheld at one view, all of his mighty land forces and all \nof his ships, which he had assembled for this great battle, which would \nsoon occur in the Sea of Aegina, and which is recalled to us as the \nbattle of Salamis in 480 B.C.\n  As he looked and saw the whole Hellespont covered with the vessels of \nhis fleet, all the shores and every plain about him as full as possible \nof men, Xerxes congratulated himself on his great power and his great \nfortune, but after a little while, he wept.\n  Then, Artabanus, the King's uncle, when he saw Xerxes in tears, said \nto Xerxes: ``How different, Sire, is what thou art now doing from what \nthou didst a little while ago? Then thou didst congratulate thyself; \nnow, behold, thou weepest.''\n  Replied Xerxes: ``There came upon me a sudden pity when I thought of \nthe shortness of man's life, and considered that all of this mighty \nhost, which has gathered from the many provinces under my control as \nKing of Persia, so numerous as it is, not one --not one--will be alive \n100 years from today.''\n  So, Mr. President, as I stand today and gaze upon this Chamber, I, \nlike Xerxes, consider that of the 100 Senators--when I came here there \nwere 96; and there were 100 Senators in the original Roman Senate--of \nthe 100 Senators who will cast their votes today, not one will be alive \nwhen 100 years are gone by. But just as we who live today revere the \nnames and the works of our illustrious forebears who framed the \nConstitution 214 years ago, so will our posterity--our children, our \nchildren's children, and our children's children's children--look back \nupon us and our works. And may our children, oh, God, have cause to \nbless the memory of their fathers, as we have cause to bless the memory \nof ours.\n  Posterity will see fit to look back upon us, whether it be 100 years \nfrom today or whether it be 10 years from now, and will have reason to \njudge us, in considerable measure, by whether we, in our time, so serve \nas to perpetuate the blessings that have come down to us from our \nforbears, the greatest blessing of all being the Constitution of the \nUnited States--I hold it in my hand--and the perpetuation of the rights \nof men and women, the perpetuation of the constitutional principles \nlaid down in that document, the perpetuation of the principles of \nfreedom to debate and amend that have been handed down to us as \nSenators by our forefathers.\n  Will our posterity thank us for perpetuating a Senate founded upon \nthe bedrock principles of freedom of debate and amendment? Will they \nremember us as having so acted as to hand down to them unblemished, \nuntarnished, and unstained the right and freedom to speak, to debate, \nand to amend? The rights of Senators to debate and amend at length are \nbeing denied. And such a denial is a denial of due process--due \nprocess. And that denial is not only a denial of our rights to amend \nand to speak freely in this Chamber at length, but a denial to our \nconstituents who send us here.\n  These rights go back hundreds of years. They did not originate in \n1787 in Philadelphia. They did not originate there. They were \nrecognized centuries ago. And their roots are buried deep in the mists \nof antiquity.\n  I will read just a few words from the Magna Carta, which was signed \nat Runnymede, in the meadow at Runnymede, on June 15, 1215, when the \nKing was compelled by his subjects to sign that great document. Let me \nread briefly therefrom. Chapter 12:\n\n       No scutage nor aid shall be imposed on our kingdom, unless \n     by common counsel of our kingdom. . . .\n\n  What was an aid? An aid was a revenue, a kind of revenue that vassals \nof the King were compelled to pay him.\n\n       No scutage nor aid shall be imposed in our kingdom, unless \n     by common counsel of our kingdom. . . .\n\n  That means everybody.\n  Chapter 14:\n\n       And for obtaining the common counsel of the kingdom anent \n     the assessing of an aid (except in the three cases aforesaid) \n     or of a scutage, we will cause to be summoned the \n     archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, \n     severally by our letters [under seal]; and we will moreover \n     cause to be summoned generally, through our sheriffs and \n     bailiffs, all others who hold of us in chief, for a fixed \n     date, namely, after the expiry of at least forty days, and at \n     a fixed place; and in all letters of such summons we will \n     specify the reason of the summons. And when the summons has \n     thus been made, the business shall proceed on the day \n     appointed, according to the counsel of such as are present, \n     although not all who were summoned have come.\n\n  Now what was King John saying? He was saying: No tax, no aid, no \nrevenue will be imposed upon my vassals, my people, except by the \ncommon consent of the kingdom, not just by the common consent of a few. \nAnd he indicated in writing, by the way he defined the various groups \nof people--meaning all of his people would be represented: the \narchbishops, the bishops, the earls, and so on--that they would gather \nand that they would pass upon the revenues that he requested.\n\n[[Page S3503]]\n\n  So as we deal with the matter before us, which involves revenue, let \nus remember that our rights, our people's rights to be represented by \nus in full, the roots of those rights go back centuries and centuries \nago.\n\n     At Runnymede, at Runnymede,\n     What say the reeds at Runnymede?\n     At Runnymede, at Runnymede,\n     Your rights were won at Runnymede!\n     No freeman shall be fined or bound,\n     Or dispossessed of freehold ground,\n     Except by lawful judgment found\n     And passed upon him by his peers!\n     Forget not, after all these years,\n     The Charter signed at Runnymede.\n\n  Today we are finding, over the experience of the last few days, that \nthose rights, the roots of which go back to Runnymede and beyond, are \nbeing short-circuited. They are being trampled upon.\n  We are in very uncharted waters with this budget. It is a 10-year \nbudget. This is the first time in my long tenure of nearly 49 years on \nCapitol Hill that the Congress has ever tried to enact a 10-year \nbudget. No one is very sure of any of the assumptions and estimates \nunderlying this 10-year budget plan--nobody. Even those witnesses who \nappeared before our committee, the Budget Committee, indicated they \ncouldn't be sure of their estimates. Yet, some in this body are \nperfectly willing to roll the dice and let the devil take the \nconsequences.\n  I am amazed that this tactic is even being attempted. We have an \nequally divided Senate, 50 Republicans, 50 Democrats. The Presidential \nelection was virtually a tie in the popular vote. There is no clear \nmandate for this President. Mr. Bush is President. He took the oath of \noffice. There is no question regarding his being the President of the \nUnited States--no question--no question whatsoever as to his legitimacy \nin holding this office--none. But there is no clear mandate. We have \nnot heard the voices of the people clamoring for this economic plan. \nYet, the majority side is using this procedural straitjacket called \nreconciliation to keep free-flowing debate, for which our forefathers \nfought and died, from happening, free-flowing debate and amendment on \nthe forthcoming tax cut. There is no mandate for that tax cut, with 50/\n50 in the Senate and the membership in the other body being likewise \nvery close insofar as the number of Republicans and number of Democrats \nare concerned.\n  This President has said over and over and over again that he wants to \nchange things in Washington. This President has said he wants \nbipartisanship. Yet we are very far from any attempt at bipartisanship \nwhen we resort to heavy-handed tactics to shut out one side of the \naisle.\n  We wanted a markup in the Budget Committee. We asked for a markup in \nthe Budget Committee. We pleaded for a markup in the Budget Committee. \nWe were entitled to have a markup in the Budget Committee. But didn't \nget it. The Budget Committee is split 11 to 11. In fact, instead of \nbipartisanship, then, what we have here is gamesmanship--gamesmanship \nof the worst sort.\n  There are those in this town who are so polarized, so intent upon \nwinning that nothing else matters but to win. They don't care what they \nwin as long as they win. They don't care what the cost is to this body, \nthe central balance wheel of the Constitution, this body, the master \nstroke of the Framers, the jewel of the Constitution--the Senate. They \ndon't care what the cost may be to the country. Winning is everything. \nThey have to win.\n  We are tied here 50/50, and it doesn't matter so much how we attain \nthe end, how we win; the important thing is that we win. At the time of \nthe enactment of the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act \nof 1974, it was thought that Congress would pass its first budget \nresolution at the beginning of each session, and this would be followed \nby the annual Appropriations Bills and any other spending measures. \nThen, Congress would issue any reconciliation instructions that might \nbe necessary to bring the spending and revenues into line with the \nBudget Resolution, and that process was to involve the passage of a \nsecond Budget Resolution.\n\n  Reconciliation involves a two-stage process, in which reconciliation \ninstructions are included in the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget--\nthat is what is before the Senate--to direct appropriate Committees to \nachieve the desired budgetary results, and then to incorporate those \nresults into an omnibus bill which is considered under expedited \nprocedures in the House and in the Senate.\n  Fast track procedures were included in the Congressional Budget Act \nto help Congress quickly to enact necessary changes in spending or \nrevenues so as to insure the integrity of the Budget Resolution \ntargets. The fast track procedures limit Senate debate on \nreconciliation bills to 20 hours and allow only germane amendments. \nTime on reconciliation bills may be further limited by non-debatable \nmotion. The managers of a reconciliation bill may yield back their \ntime, which can further cut the time for consideration.\n  Unfortunately, reconciliation bills have proved to be almost \nirresistible vehicles for Senators to use to move all manner of \nlegislation because of these fast-track procedures, and, in recent \ntimes, the misuse has been gross.\n  Fast track procedures take away from Senators--the elected \nrepresentatives of the people in this Chamber-- the opportunity to \noffer their amendments and to fully debate them. Reconciliation, \ntherefore, is a non-filibusterable ``bear trap\" that should be used \nvery sparingly and only for purposes of fiscal restraint.\n  In other words, reconciliation should be used only--hear me now--\nreconciliation should be used only for reducing deficits. I know my \ngood friend from New Mexico says otherwise, but hear me. To trample \nupon the rights of men and women in this body, to take away from them \nthe right to freely debate and amend measures, is a very serious thing.\n  We passed that act in 1974 saying, yes, we will, for a very narrow \npurpose, under certain narrow circumstances, take away for a brief time \nand for a brief purpose those rights, the right to debate and to amend. \nThe Senate is the foremost upper body in the world today. Why is it so \nunique? Why? Because in this Chamber, men and women who are elected by \nthe people back home have the right, the constitutional right, to \nfreely debate and amend.\n  Augustus, the first great Roman Emperor, from 27 B.C. to 14 A.D., \ndidn't like to hear senators argue and debate. So he was critical of \nsenators who had the nerve to debate. And their answer was: ``Don't \nsenators have the right to debate, to speak, to criticize the \ncommonwealth?\"\n  Reconciliation was established only for reducing deficits. In 1999, \nthe reconciliation process was used by the Republican leadership to \nallow for a $792 billion tax cut to be brought to the Senate using \nfast-track procedures, taking away the right to debate fully and amend \nthat tax cut bill. I believe this was the first time--or at least one \nof the rare times--that reconciliation instructions were issued that \nmandated a worsening of fiscal discipline for the Federal Government. \nUnlike the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution, I do not believe that \nthe budget reconciliation instructions in 1999 resulted in improving \nthe fiscal status of the Federal budget. Again, in the year 2000, the \nreconciliation process was used to allow for major tax cuts to be \nbrought before the Senate in reconciliation bills. In short, we have, \nin my view--and I think my view is based upon facts. I am not \ninterested in who wins, whether it is Democrats or Republicans, as far \nas that is concerned; I am interested in maintaining unblemished, \nuntarnished, and unstained the fundamental principles on which this \nSenate rests, and they are involved here. In short, we have, in my \nview, abused and distorted beyond all recognition the original, very \nlimited purpose of the reconciliation procedure.\n  Now let those who wish to contest that do so. It is obvious that the \nRepublican majority will, for the third straight year, attempt \nultimately to fashion a budget resolution that will contain \nreconciliation instructions to the Senate Finance Committee and House \nWays and Means Committee, directing them to bring forth the Bush \nadministration's $1.6 trillion tax cut bill.\n  Taking advantage of the reconciliation procedures in this way would \nbe the latest in what has become a steady degradation of the \ncongressional budget process. Reconciliation, which was created to make \nit easier to impose budget discipline, is instead being used\n\n[[Page S3504]]\n\nto make it easier to get around the Senate's rights to debate and \namend. Reconciliation, therefore, is being turned on its head.\n  Hear me. ``O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth, then with a \npassion would I shake the world!'' There is no reason whatsoever to \nconsider the President's tax cut proposal as a reconciliation bill. The \nSenate should take up this massive tax cut proposal as a freestanding \nbill. That is the way we have always done it. It is a tax cut bill. It \nshould be fully debated and amended. That is what was done in 1981 when \nPresident Reagan sent to Congress his tax cut proposal. On that \noccasion, Congress used the reconciliation process to accomplish the \nspending cuts in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, but the Reagan \ntax cuts were brought before the Senate as a freestanding bill and were \nfully debated, without depending on reconciliation fast-track \nprocedures. More than 100 amendments were disposed of, and the Reagan \ntax cut bill was debated for 12 days prior to its passage. The Senate \nRepublican leadership in that instance chose to do the right thing by \nbringing the Reagan tax cut bill to the Senate as a freestanding \nmeasure rather than use fast-track reconciliation procedures. It was \nthoroughly aired.\n\n  Taking the easy way and doing the expedient thing rarely requires \nmuch leadership. The former Republican leader, Howard Baker, who was \nthe majority leader--I was the minority leader --did the right thing \nfor the Senate, for the President, and for the country.\n  In 1993, my own Democratic leadership--now, listen to this. In 1993, \nmy own Democratic leadership pleaded with me. How many of my friends on \nthe Republican side today would stand as firm as the Rock of Gibraltar \nas I did on that occasion? The Democratic leadership pleaded with me at \nlength to agree to support the idea that the Clinton health care bill \nshould be included in that year's reconciliation package. They came to \nmy office on the floor below. Not only did Majority Leader George \nMitchell and others of my colleagues attempt to persuade me to go along \nand not raise a point of order under the Byrd rule, which would require \n60 votes to waive, President Clinton got on the phone and called me \nalso and pressed me to allow his massive health care bill to be \ninsulated by reconciliation's protection. He called me on the \ntelephone. Here is the President of the United States calling this \nlowly former coal town boy and asking me to let his huge health bill \ncome before the Senate on that fast track. I could not, in good \nconscience, however, look the other way and not make that point of \norder and allow what would clearly have been an abuse of congressional \nintent to occur.\n  How many others would do that today on that side of the aisle, stand \nagainst their President. Well, perhaps that is not too important.\n  I felt that changes as dramatic as the Clinton health care package, \nwhich would affect every man, woman, and child in the United States, \nshould be subject to scrutiny. I said: Mr. President, I cannot in good \nconscience turn my face the other way. That is why we have a Senate--to \namend and to debate freely--and that health bill, important as it is, \nis so complex, so far reaching that the people of this country need to \nknow what is in it and, moreover, Mr. President, we Senators need to \nknow what is in it.\n  He accepted that. He accepted that, thanked me, and we said goodbye.\n  I could not, I would not, and I did not allow that package to be \nhandled in such a cavalier manner. It was the threat of the use of the \nByrd rule--and my how that Byrd rule has been maligned and excoriated \nand criticized by many Members of the other body who should be thanking \nthe Senate for it. It was the threat of the use of the Byrd rule that \nbolstered my position. My view prevailed then; my view is the same \ntoday. It is time for the abuse of the reconciliation process to cease. \nWe should not be using tight, expedited procedures to take up measures \nthat worsen the fiscal situation of the Nation and that have far \nreaching, profound impacts on the people. Reconciliation was never, \nnever, never intended to be a shield, to be used as a shield for \ncontroversial legislation by depriving Senators of their rights and \ntheir duty to debate and to amend.\n  I want the Senate to have an opportunity to work its will and to \napply its considered judgment to the massive tax cut that is being \nproposed by the Bush administration. I strenuously object to having \nsuch a far-reaching, critical matter swathed in the protective bandages \nof a reconciliation process and ramrodded through this body like a \nself-propelled missile. Nobody who has listened to the testimony of \nwitnesses before the Budget Committee could possibly claim that the \nright choices are clear. There is vast uncertainty and disagreement \nabout nearly every aspect of the Bush tax cut.\n  The President's proposal is not an edict, and the Senate is not a \nquivering body of humble subjects who must obey.\n\n       Come one, come all! this rock shall fly\n       From its firm base as soon as I.\n\n  This is the Senate. Reliance on reconciliation as the torpedo with \nwhich to deliver a knock-out punch for the President is a tactic that \nought to be abandoned. It is not a fair course. It is not a wise \ncourse. It is not right to enforce this reconciliation gag rule upon \nthe Senate. It is wrong. We must not shackle the intellects of 100 \nMembers of the Senate in this way. We should not fear the wisdom of \nopen and free-ranging debate about a proposal which is, at best, risky \nbusiness. Now is no time to circle the wagons. Now is the time to hear \nall of the voices on both sides of the aisle. Now is the time to build \nconsensus among ourselves and among the people we represent.\n  There will be no victory if we make the wrong choices and plunge this \nNation back into a deficit status. There will be no victory. We will \nhave plenty of time to regret and to weep.\n  The President has said that he wants bipartisanship. He has said that \nhe has faith in his plan. I believe, therefore, that there is no need \nto hide behind the iron wall of reconciliation. This would be a hollow \nvictory, indeed, for the President, and for the majority leadership in \nthis body.\n\n  As to the tax cut itself, the Bush proposal is pretty stale bread. It \nprobably came from last year's campaign wars that blew up in the snows \nof winter in New Hampshire. If it ever was a good idea, it probably is \nnot now. The economic picture has changed since then and changed \nradically. The type and size of the tax cut proposed in the President's \nbudget--and we have not seen his budget. Why haven't we seen his \nbudget? It was promised to us for Monday of this week, but now we know \nthat it will be Monday of next week before the budget comes here.\n  I have been among those who have urged that we just wait a little bit \nand, before we cross that railroad crossing where the lights are \nflashing, have the budget before us. We can have it by Monday. It is \nwithin 3 blocks of the Capitol right now being printed. So it is \naround. Why can't we have it?\n  The economic picture has changed, as I say, and it has changed \nradically. The type and size of the tax cut proposed in the President's \nbudget obviously bears rethinking. The size of the proposed surplus has \nalready been diminished by the stock market plunge.\n  Even the staunchest supporters of the President's $1.6 trillion tax \ncut idea would have to admit that the ground has shifted and that the \nPresident's plan might need some adjustment. Only an extremely \ndoctrinaire mind would continue to claim that this tax cut is still a \nperfect fit for the present economy or the projected surpluses that go \nout to the far end of 10 years. That would be like claiming that your \nsize 42 pants still fit fine after you have dropped 25 pounds. The \neconomy has lost some weight since the President's plan was created.\n  I can understand the desire to win one for the new President. I can \nunderstand my good friend from Texas, of whom I am very fond and whom I \nconsider a friend. I live with him here 5 days a week, 4 days a week in \nmany of the weeks of the year. I live with the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee who is an extremely able chairman. He is of the true Roman \nstock, and I admire him. I admire him. I am sorry that on this occasion \nwe have to disagree. We will disagree, but disagreement, as far as I am \nconcerned, lasts only for a day and then it is all in the past.\n  On the other hand, it is always well to remember that the Senate is \nan equal branch, with Members having decades--decades--of experience \nwhich is their duty, their responsibility to apply. The Senate should \nnot behave\n\n[[Page S3505]]\n\nlike some eager puppy taking slippers to its master for a good word and \na pat on the head.\n  We do this new President no favors to let him have exactly his way if \nthat way is flawed. He will be blamed. President Bush will be blamed if \nthis budget turns out to be a disaster for the American people. And we \nmight be able to avoid some mistakes if the Senate is given a chance to \ndebate and amend the tax proposal in a separate and freestanding bill.\n  The President would still get the credit if the amount was cut, but \nwhy would it not be better if it were handed to him after a \nfreestanding debate?\n  What is a Republic? Madison in the Federalists No. 14 answered this \nquestion:\n\n       In a democracy, the people meet and exercise the government \n     in person; in a Republic, they assemble and administer it by \n     their Representatives and agents.\n\n  Madison answered that question. Consequently, to whatever degree that \nSenators, the elected representatives of the people, are prevented from \ndebating and amending the legislation of that Congress or the Senate, \nto that same degree the people are denied their rights to be heard and \nto make decisions through their elected representatives in the Senate.\n  Benjamin Franklin was asked by a lady following the Constitutional \nConvention's close on September 17, 1787: Dr. Franklin, what have you \ngiven us? The answer: A republic, madam, if you can keep it.\n  Now, in this regard, let's listen to one of the complaints enunciated \nin the Declaration of Independence against King George III of England. \nIn this little book is contained the Constitution and the Declaration \nof Independence. At the beginning of the Declaration of Independence, \nThomas Jefferson enunciated the complaints that the people had against \nKing George III and the reasons why the colonialists were going to \nsever those bonds forever. Listen to this:\n\n       He [meaning King George III] has refused to pass any laws \n     for the accommodations of large districts of people, unless \n     those people would relinquish the Right of Representation in \n     the legislature, a Right inestimable to them, and formidable \n     to tyrants only. He has dissolved representative houses \n     repeatedly.\n\n  One of their major complaints was that the King had refused to pass \nlaws unless the people would give up something, would give up their \nright of representation in the legislature.\n  That really, in essence, is what is happening here. A budget plan for \n10 years is about to be passed and, as a result of that budget, unless \nthe Senate votes otherwise today and/or tomorrow, the people, through \ntheir elected representatives, will be relinquishing their rights to \nhave full freedom of debate and amendment when it comes to the Bush tax \ncut.\n  I say to Senators, the ranking member of the Budget Committee said \nonly a little while ago that this is the most important legislation the \nSenate will act upon in this session. Why? Not only because it will \ninvolve a huge tax cut, the ramifications of which we cannot clearly \nsee because we have no budget before us, but also because it goes to \nthe root, the very marrow of the bone of Senators' constitutional \nrights on behalf of their constituents to fully debate and amend.\n  I say to Senators, our ancestors fought a war with England because of \nthe denial of representation in the legislature where taxation was \nconcerned. When the reconciliation process is employed to curtail \ndebate and amendments on bills making huge tax cuts, the people are \nbeing denied true representation in the Senate because their elected \nrepresentatives here, who happen to be in the minority, are being \ngagged by the fast-track procedures of the reconciliation process.\n  When a minority of Senators--and keep in mind, this is the largest \nminority that it is possible to have in this Chamber; there are 100 \nMembers in the Chamber, 100 Members have been sworn and the breakdown \nis 50/50, so the minority is as large a minority as the Senate could \npossibly have. A minority of Senators are being denied by the \nreconciliation process the right to debate at length and the right \nto freely amend. The people of the United States, who are represented \nby that minority in the Senate, are, in essence, being forced to \nrelinquish the right of representation in the legislature.\n\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 26\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me briefly respond to the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee. A chairman of any committee could be no more \ndistinguished than the chairman of the Budget Committee. Anent the \nchairman's statement that what we are doing today is fully in accord \nwith the intent of the Budget Act, I am saying that it absolutely is \nnot.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I inquire as to the time remaining on our side and the \ntime remaining on the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 25\\1/2\\ minutes and the \nmajority has 61\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator if he could wrap up fairly quickly so \nwe can turn to the other side so we will have some time remaining for \nrequests of other Senators.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely. I will be glad to do that. I will postpone what \nI was going to say in response to the chairman's claim that this Budget \nAct can be in conformity with the act's intent and be used to cut \ntaxes.\n  I challenge that. I am ready to do so. I will not do so at the \nmoment.\n  On the other hand, I think I should. Section 310 of the Congressional \nBudget Act, as enacted in 1974, was arguably neutral in its purpose. \nThe provision merely authorized reconciliation instructions to change \nlaws or bills within a committee's jurisdiction. However, several \namendments to the Congressional Budget Act have made it quite clear \nthat the purpose of reconciliation was for deficit reduction.\n  Section 310 of the act was amended by the Balanced Budget and \nEmergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, to \nprohibit amendments to reconciliation bills that reduced revenues, if \nthe amendment caused a committee to fail to meet its reconciliation \ninstruction. This prohibition would make no sense if committees could \nbe instructed to reduce net revenues. It only makes sense if a \ncommittee could be instructed to increase revenues. Furthermore, the \nByrd rule was added as section 313 of the Budget Act. It prohibits as \nextraneous any provision reported by a committee that reduces revenues \nif that committee failed to meet its reconciliation instructions. The \nByrd rule also prohibits as extraneous a provision that results in net \nrevenue losses in the years beyond the budget resolution, the outyears, \nunless those losses are compensated for by outlay reductions.\n\n  Again, these provisions make no sense if committees could be given a \nreconciliation instruction to reduce net revenues. They only make sense \nif committees could only be instructed to increase revenue.\n  It should also be noted that section 310 was amended in 1990 to \nspecifically authorize a reconciliation instruction ``to achieve \ndeficit reduction''. Thus, there is explicit and there is implicit \nlanguage standing for the principle that the purpose of reconciliation \nis for deficit reduction. There is nothing in the Congressional Budget \nAct stating that reconciliation can be used to reduce revenues. The \nonly conclusion that can be drawn is that this process is for deficit \nreduction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I inquire of the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee if he would prefer to go at this point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the distinguished Senator wanted to speak \nfor 4 minutes. I am delighted to have him do that, if it is all right \nwith Senator Conrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am delighted to yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, we have very little time left on this \nside. It is our intention, after the Senator from Florida has spoken, \nto allow those on the other side of the aisle to take an extended \nperiod of time to express their view before we come back to our side.\n  With that, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am happy to hear the Senator's \nintention, but I do not know what the intention is\n\n[[Page S3506]]\n\non our side. We are going to do our very best to be fair. We had to sit \nthrough a very lengthy discussion that I thought was very powerful. We \nwould like a little bit of time to make our rebuttal.\n  I am suggesting you can go another 4 minutes if that is all right \nwith you all.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. We thought we would go to the Senator from Florida \nand yield 4 minutes to him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I failed to mention that we have a whole series of \nvotes on amendment, I might say to Senator Reid, that might occur \ntonight after the 6:30 commencement of the vote on the Domenici \nreconciliation amendment. I hope Senators do not run off after this \nnext vote. I think there could be 3 hours' worth of votes tonight just \non what we have already agreed to do.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, if he will yield, the staff is working \nto see if any of those eight amendments can be accepted. But whatever, \nthere is going to be a lot of voting starting at 6:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I am moved to speak because of \nthe eloquence of the Senator from West Virginia and what he has taught \nus today by his statements as the author of the Byrd rule, as the \nauthor of the reconciliation act, and how he has woven the importance \nof this body being able to freely debate and freely amend into the \ncourse of history.\n\n  He talked about Runnymede. He talked about Xerxes. As he was speaking \nso eloquently, it recalled to my mind Athens in the fifth century \nbefore Christ, one of the greatest golden times in the age of \ncivilization of planet Earth. But Athens had a problem in a bald-\nheaded, bandy-legged little man by the name of Socrates who liked to \nask all kinds of questions and who liked to challenge the established \norder of things Athenian.\n  In the process of that experience with democracy and free speech, the \nspecial interests of the day urged the crowd so that the pack became in \nfull cry to shut up the man who dared to ask the questions--Mr. \nSocrates. Ultimately they offered him the cup and said: Have a drink, \nMr. Socrates.\n  Socrates was such a part of that Athenian society that rather than \nbreak the rules, he drank from the cup. He showed by so doing that he \nadhered to the highest principles of Athenian society while they were \nmuzzling and shackling and clamping his mouth shut.\n  It is because of that, as a part of the lessons of history, added to \nthe great lessons of history that the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia has shared with us today, that ultimately led to that \nbrilliant band of political thinkers who all came together to fashion \nthis thing we know as the Constitution of the United States, that we do \nnot want to limit debate or limit amendment, especially, as the Senator \nhas so eloquently explained to us, on something as enormous and \neffective on these United States as a tax bill that will take prevail \nfor 10 years.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for the history lesson he has \ngiven us. I thank him for what he represents as the true historian of \nthis Senate, who can put this debate in perspective and give us another \nreason we should not have this reconciliation instruction that will \nmuzzle this Senate on something so important to the discourse of the \nday, an enormous tax bill.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. From our side of the aisle I want to say Senator \nGrassley is here ready to speak. I understood there were a couple of \nother Senators, including Senator Gregg, who wanted to speak. I cannot \nassure you as soon as you walk on the floor that you will be able to \nspeak because time is back and forth and Senator Byrd was entitled to \nspeak. In a few moments I will yield to my colleague. I understand he \nhas some very responsive remarks. I want to hear them myself.\n  Let me say to Senator Byrd, I have heard often--and perhaps I should \nsay oftentimes--from you of your humble beginnings. I do not in any way \nwant to suggest that I had humble beginnings. I am not sure my humble \nbeginnings are relevant. I am sure yours are.\n  But just so we will know, my father came all the way from Italy, when \nhe was 14, to the city of Albuquerque. He never learned how to write \nEnglish. He could not read well, but he could speak three languages. He \ndid all right with a small grocery business. He took care of five \nchildren; it looks like all of them went to college; it looks like he \nleft enough for his wife, to take care of her; and that is all he \nworried about.\n  But I, too, have been challenged by a President. You were challenged \nby one. I will explain about that challenge in just a moment. I was \nchallenged by Ronald Reagan. You weren't on the Budget Committee then. \nI wish you would have been. We were marking up after an Easter recess, \nhaving asked the President's Defense Secretary to negotiate with us for \n2 months on two different occasions. This Senator from humble \nbeginnings, son of the Italian immigrants, was called by the President, \ncalled out from a committee meeting to an office, and he said: Adjourn \nthe meeting. I need to discuss things with you.\n\n  Let me tell you that we marked up the bill that afternoon. We \nfinished because I had my job to do and he had his job to do. We gave \nhim more defense money. He ended up getting more when Congress was \nfinished, which is interesting, too.\n  Let me suggest to the President, and to those who are quite impressed \ntonight by the remarks given by the senior Senator from West Virginia--\nand I remind everyone that he has had 43 years to learn about this \nSenate; I have only had 28. I feel very strongly about the Senate, just \nas he does, except I don't have any history to quote. That is just \nbecause I am not a history person, be it ancient, modern. Whatever the \nhistory, I am just not very good at it.\n  But I can tell you that Senator Byrd's argument tonight is 27 years \ntoo late. In fact, he should have made that argument before we adopted \nthe Senate Budget and Impoundment Act. He helped write it. I didn't \nhelp write it. I voted for it. But my recollection is that not a single \nSenator voted against it. Let me tell you that Senator Byrd should have \nmade an argument then. This bill was filled with all the risks he talks \nabout to change forever what the Senate stands for. If that wasn't the \ncase, Senator Byrd should have objected and should have come and given \nthis speech the 15 times that we have used reconciliation--10 times to \nraise taxes and 5 times to reduce taxes. He did object to one of those. \nHe lost on a reduction of taxes. But that is when the argument tonight, \never so eloquent, should have been made.\n  For those enraptured about the qualities of the Senate as discussed \ntonight, let me remind everyone that we changed them. We changed them \nunder the authorship of the distinguished senior Senator from West \nVirginia who argued tonight about what a serious impact of a negative \ntype this reconciliation instruction is going to impose on the Senate.\n  I remind everyone. I see the tax-writing staff is here. Some of them \nhave been through all of these. They can probably come over here and \nhelp me. They didn't like it when they were told to do a tax increase. \nThat is probably what they liked the least.\n  We did it. You know what happened on those instructions? The Senate \ndid not have a chance to filibuster them. On not a single one of them \ndid they have a chance to filibuster. Why? Because this act prevailed.\n  Let me remind you that they did not have a chance to filibuster them \nor amend them significantly, whether they increased taxes or diminished \ntaxes.\n  On the argument that this Budget Act is not policy neutral, which the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia challenges, let me just say I \nwas part of the whole thing. I think it remains neutral. The only thing \nit permits us to do of a multiyear nature is to look forward to what \nwill certain policies do in the future. That is what it permits us to \ndo. It doesn't say in this Budget Act that you can do that only if you \nare reducing deficits. It just doesn't say it. The Senator interprets \nit that way. I don't interpret it that way.\n  Let me also talk a minute with the Senate about the event. You know \nthe\n\n[[Page S3507]]\n\nevent, when President Clinton almost got us to vote on a health care \nplan. I don't say any of this in a contentious manner toward any \nSenator. But I have already heard two Democratic Senators submit to the \nSenate, including my friend from West Virginia, that we were \nresponsible for us not considering the plan, which is sometimes called \nthe Hillary Clinton Health Care Plan. They were responsible for \nits failure--President Clinton's big health care plan.\n\n  Let me tell you. The truth is, 3 years before we considered that, my \ngood friend had prevailed in the Senate with a statute--not a ruling, a \nstatute--that created the Byrd budget rule carrying his distinguished \nname. We did it around here for 3 years before that. And we finally \nsaid: You are right. Let's pass the Byrd rule.\n  Guess what the Byrd rule would have done if they would have brought \nPresident Clinton's health care bill to the floor. Any Senator could \nhave raised a point of order under that rule, the Byrd rule. Any \nSenator would have gotten a ruling from the Chair that it was subject \nto a point of order.\n  Guess what next. It would require 60 votes to pass.\n  So let's be honest and realistic. Senator Byrd has been part of \nhelping fix this up for a number of years, but he has never been able \nto fix it up to deny its efficacy as changing forever the rules of the \nSenate so long as this Budget Act exists.\n  Having said that, I want to comment on something else.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I haven't had much time. Let me finish. Am I doing \nsomething wrong that you would like to correct me on?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think you are misstating Senator Byrd's position.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't believe so. I was here for the whole speech. \nYou can speak on your own time.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Chair enforce the rule that \nSenators must address each other through the Chair and in the third \nperson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will enforce the rule.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand. I will try to do that.\n  I want to talk a minute about Leader Baker's role in determining all \nof this, if you will permit me for a moment.\n  First, let me put Senator Baker's comments in context. Maybe it would \nbe best to do this. Senator Baker's comments were made, to the \nrecollection of the Senator from New Mexico, with reference to a \nCommerce Committee bill. The Commerce Committee was then under the \nchairmanship of Robert Packwood. Senator Packwood took a little, tiny \ninstruction that told that committee to change a fee--something that \nyou are charging. He wrote a whole reauthorization of the telecom bill \nwith a little, tiny instruction for a few hundred thousand dollars. \nSenator Baker said: You shouldn't do that.\n  That was the beginning of the Byrd rule. That was the beginning of a \nrule which said amendments have to be fiscally related and germane.\n  We are very pleased that the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \ndid that. We are very pleased that rule governs even today. But it \ndoesn't govern with reference to a tax reconciliation bill because, as \na matter of fact, we have done that 15 times since the adoption of this \nbill.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the origins of reconciliation. I \nremember very vividly because we were in the minority. The other side \nwas in the majority by quite a healthy margin. The chairman of the \nBudget Committee was Senator Ed Muskie when the first reconciliation \nwas used. The other side of the aisle was getting close to election \ntime. There was a concern about a deficit. So a reconciliation \ninstruction was used--$8 billion for all intents and purposes, \nsomething we almost round off these days.\n  Guess what one of the committees was that was reconciled in that \ninstance to raise a few dollars. I know it sounds not right, but it is \nright. The Agriculture Committee was reconciled to change the School \nLunch Program costs to impose an extra 5 cents on the school lunches \nacross America. How do I know that? Because this man right here, the \nchief of staff on the majority side, was then at the Department of \nAgriculture. He was asked to enforce that after it was passed. I \nbelieve the reason he is with the Senate is because they made him the \nscapegoat over there for passing the measure that was reconciled by the \nCongress to them.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield for \na question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. GREGG. In listening to the presentation of the Senator from West \nVirginia, as I understood it, the Senator from West Virginia was \nessentially saying you could use the reconciliation for the purposes of \nraising taxes in order to reduce the deficit but you cannot use it for \nthe purposes of cutting taxes that do not involve addressing a deficit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. At the same time, the Senator from West Virginia argued \nreconciliation was an inherently inappropriate concept because it cut \noff debate here in the Senate and therefore it was inappropriate in the \nsense that it limited the ability of this Senate to exercise its due \nprivileges on an issue.\n  Aren't those two arguments inconsistent: To say that reconciliation \ncould be used in one instance, no matter what the instance is, but, on \nthe other side, it is inappropriate to use reconciliation at any time \nbecause of the nature of the Senate and its need to have debates?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, let me say, I think they are. But I believe \nimplicit in the Senator's argument is that he does not think so. But \nmaybe he should answer that.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Maybe the Senator from West Virginia would like to \nanswer that. I am not asking now. I was trying to follow the admonition \nnot to say ``he'' but ``the Senator from West Virginia.'' I try very \nhard. I slip sometimes.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. In reviewing the Record of the Senate, I noted that when \nthe ruling was made in 1996, the question asked by Senator Daschle to \nthe Chair was:\n\n       Is it the opinion of the Chair that this resolution would \n     continue to be a budget resolution if it directed the \n     creation of that third reconciliation bill--the one that \n     solely worsens the deficit--\n\n  And I underline and emphasize those words, ``the one that solely \nworsens the deficit''--\n  Even under circumstances when the Congress had failed to enact the \nprior two reconciliation bills.\n  And the Chair ruled:\n\n       If the Senator's question is, can the budget resolution \n     direct the creation of a reconciliation bill which lowers \n     revenues, the answer is yes.\n\n  Can this language be any clearer, I would ask the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, that the Chair has ruled that reconciliation can be \nused to reduce taxes even if it worsens a deficit and therefore is not \na deficit issue?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No question about it, I say to the Senator. As a matter \nof fact, you might know that the Senator from New Mexico, in preparing \nthe budget resolution, had that in mind. And it was so clear to me that \nI put the reconciliation in the budget bill because it seemed to me we \nalready decided that--the Chair had already decided it. And unbeknownst \nto me, even though that is what you read, and that is what it says, and \nthat is what I think it says, we had to go around and do what we are \ndoing tonight, even with that interpretation because there was a \nparliamentary understanding that was somewhat different from that. So \nthat is the case.\n  I think you are right. But I think you should understand that we \nasked for that ruling, and we would have been involved in not getting a \ndebate on the budget resolution. It would have been freely debatable if \nwe had tried that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand that. I guess my question is, Hasn't the \nChair, in fact, ruled on this issue? Is it not the precedent of the \nSenate, as defined by this language at least, which is fairly clear?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not think there is any question. That is my \ninterpretation. I thank you for it. I do not think there is any doubt \nwhatsoever.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Does the Senator from New \nMexico yield?\n\n[[Page S3508]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I am not one who is fearful of \nquestions, but I really want you to know I very much would like to \nanswer a few more thoughts because I paid very close attention, and I \ndon't think the Senator from Maryland, in all deference, was even here \nwhen I listened to most of this distinguished Senator's remarks. I \nwould like to finish my remarks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield on that point.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I was here for a good part of it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think the Senator from New Mexico was here for all of \nit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I cannot claim that. And I respect the Senator from New \nMexico for that. But I was here for a good part of the time. Does that \nqualify me to ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It does, I say to the Senator. I am glad to answer a \nquestion. It qualifies. You do not have to make that statement. You are \nqualified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield?\n  Mr. SARBANES. It seems to me what Senator Byrd is underscoring is \nthat the Senate, when they first passed the Budget Act, made a great \nexception to the process of unlimited debate in order to try to bring \nthe deficit under control. The guiding rationale for making that \nexception was limited to accomplishing deficit reduction. No one, in \ntheir wildest dreams, ever imagined we were going to be out here trying \nto deal with reconciliation instructions which would lower the surplus \nor potentially increase the deficit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I believe if you are going to \nmake a speech, it ought to be charged to their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Does the Senator disagree with the initial purpose of \nthe Budget Act?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am very glad to answer. I totally disagree. I do not \nthink that was the initial purpose. The Budget Act simply allows us to \nuse reconciliation to carry out the fiscal policies outlined in the \nbudget.\n  Now if Congress wanted to run deficits with policies it enacted, they \ncould decide to do so with the laws it passed and that were outlined in \nits budget. In other words, if Congress wants to run surpluses, it \ncould do so under the act. Also under the Act, it could also reduce \nthem. So that is my interpretation. And I want to finish my remarks.\n  Now, Mr. President, I note the presence of Senator Grassley who I \nreally want to speak on taxes. But I do want to say, underlying a very \nlarge quantity of the arguments here tonight is inherently an anti-\ngive-the-people-back-their-money attitude--to wit, tax cuts.\n  The truth is, there are some who just do not want to have tax cuts. I \nunderstand that. I do understand that very clearly. There are Senators \nwho would rather spend the money than give it back. I am not saying \nevery Senator--some Senators.\n  Frankly, I do not believe those feelings ought to enter this debate. \nBut if a Senator wants to have those feelings, then he ought to be \nright on this debate because it does not have anything to do with those \nfeelings. It has to do with the Budget Act--a Budget Act that, I \nrepeat, changed the rules of the Senate for so long as we apply that \nBudget Act.\n  I want to repeat, we have used that act for small and large tax \nincreases. How do you think the Senators on the Republican side feel \nwho want to do tax cuts? I am standing up here telling them it is \nsomebody's interpretation that you can surely increase taxes with \nreconciliation, I say to Senator Grassley, chairman of the committee, \nbut you cannot decrease taxes. You cannot reduce taxes. I believe you \nwould have to have a strong, absolute determination in this act that \nthat was the case, or the Senator from Iowa would claim it was \ndiscriminatory against whom? The taxpayers, the average person. You can \nsurely get them for increases, but you cannot give them a decrease, \nright? At least not under this act, if you are going to interpret it as \nsome choose to interpret it tonight.\n  So I know this is a historic argument. And I don't know if I \nappreciated its historical significance when we started tonight, but I \nhave been reminded of it.\n  So if there was any lesser thought on my part, I am right there. It \nis an historic argument, except that it isn't a very new argument. It \nisn't a very new use of reconciliation that is being argued tonight; it \nis a very old use of reconciliation.\n  With that, how much time does the Senator desire? I ask Senator \nGrassley.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I would like to have 25 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 25 minutes to Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Federal Government is collecting too much in taxes. \nThat is what is at the basis of the tax reduction package we hope to \nget through the Senate in a couple months. The Federal Government will \naccumulate over $3.1 trillion in excess tax collections over the next \n10 years. Federal tax receipts are at one of their highest levels in \nour Nation's history. The bulk of these excess collections comes from \nthe individual taxpayer, mostly the individual income-tax payer. \nIndividual income tax collections are currently near an all-time high, \neven higher than they were at some levels imposed during World War II.\n  So I have a series of charts I would like to have my colleagues \nreview with me to illustrate our present situation.\n  The first chart shows total Federal tax receipts as a percentage of \ngross domestic product over the last 40 years. Tax receipts have \nfluctuated frequently since 1960, but the most shocking spike in tax \nreceipts began in 1993.\n  The Congressional Budget Office's January 2001 report to Congress \nshows that in 1992, total tax receipts were around 17.2 percent of GDP. \nBy the year 2000, Federal receipts had exploded to an astronomical 2.6 \npercent of gross domestic product. The significance of this percentage \ncan only be appreciated by its historical comparison.\n  In 1944, at the height of World War II, taxes as a percentage of GDP \nwere 20.9 percent, only one-half percent higher than they are this very \nday. By 1945, those taxes had dropped to 20.4 percent of GDP, which is \nactually lower than collection levels today.\n  It is unbelievable that in a time of unprecedented peace and \nprosperity, the Federal Government should rake in taxes at a wartime \nlevel. The sorriest part of this whole story is that this huge increase \nin taxes has been borne almost exclusively by the individual American \ntaxpayer.\n  As this next chart shows, over the past decade, tax collection levels \nfor payroll taxes, corporate taxes, and all other taxes have been \nrelatively stable. We can see that corporate taxes during the past 10 \nyears have increased very little, from 1.6 percent of GDP to 2.1 \npercent, and estate taxes have remained essentially unchanged. \nCollections of individual income taxes, however, have soared.\n  As this chart shows, in 1992, tax collections from individual income \ntaxes were 7.7 percent of gross domestic product. That percentage has \nrisen steadily each year and, as of the year 2000, was an astounding \n10.2 percent of GDP. Individual income taxes now take up the largest \nshare of GDP in history. Even during World War II, collections from \nindividuals were 9.4 percent of GDP, nearly a full percentage point \nbelow the current levels.\n  As we can see, the source of the current and future surpluses is from \nthe huge runups in a single tax, the individual tax collections. These \nexcess collections are attributable to the tax increases forced through \nby President Clinton in 1993. Since 1992, total personal income has \ngrown an average of 5.6 percent per year. Federal income tax \ncollections, however, have grown an average of 9.1 percent a year, \noutstripping the rate of personal income tax growth by 64 percent.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation, at the request of their parent \ncommittee, estimated that just repealing the revenue-raising provisions \nof President Clinton's 1993 tax hike would yield tax relief of more \nthan $1 trillion over the 10 years. Democrats and Republicans\n\n[[Page S3509]]\n\nalike can agree that individual taxpayers deserve relief from the \nFederal Government's overtaxation.\n  President Bush has offered a plan to reduce individual income taxes \nacross all tax rates, all brackets, and to reduce the number of \nbrackets as well. This benefits taxpayers all across America.\n  Now we hear, however, a hue and cry from some on the other side of \nthe aisle that not all taxpayers should receive rate reductions. They \nsay the President's plan disproportionately benefits upper income-tax \npayers and does not provide enough relief at the lower end of the \nincome scale. There is some good news out there for those who believe \nthat: None of those allegations are true.\n  We need to first understand the current distribution of the tax \nburden in America. We have a highly progressive income tax system. \nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, the top 20 percent of \nincome earners pay over 75 percent of all individual income taxes. By \ncontrast, households in the bottom three-fifths of the income \ndistribution pay 7 percent of all individual taxes. The President's \nplan not only preserves this progressive system but--surprise--actually \nmakes those top income people pay more of the percentage of income \ncoming into the Federal Treasury, if the President's plan is adopted.\n\n  To all those who are trying to engage in class warfare over the \nPresident's tax proposals, I invite them to pay attention to the next \ntwo charts. As the first of these two charts demonstrates, the \nPresident's marginal rate reductions, when combined with his increase \nin the child credit, the additional deduction for the lower earning \nspouse, and his refundable tax credit for individual health insurance, \nprovides the greatest reduction in tax burden for lower income-tax \npayers.\n  Look at the levels of reduction in tax burden shown on this chart. \nThe upper income-tax payers receive an 8.7-percent reduction in their \nburden. Those at the lower end of the income scale, however, receive a \n136.2 percent reduction in their taxes. This is because 4 million \ntaxpayers will be taken off the income tax rolls. A four-person family \nearning $35,000 a year will no longer have any income tax burden.\n  As this chart also shows, a large reduction of tax burden is targeted \ntowards taxpayers making between $30,000 and $75,000 a year. These \ntaxpayers will experience relief ranging from 20.8 percent to 38.3 \npercent of their current tax burden.\n  Now, I also said the President's plan, when passed, actually makes \nour tax system more progressive. Look at the next chart to get the \nproof of that. This is a very important chart for those who will \ndemagogue the President's proposal on the basis of income differences.\n  As this chart demonstrates, under the President's proposal, the \noverall tax burden goes down for all taxpayers earning below $100,000. \nFor taxpayers making $100,000 or more, however, their share of Federal \ntax burden will actually increase under the President's plan.\n  For example, the share of the tax burden for taxpayers earning \nbetween $30,000 and $40,000 a year will drop from 2.5 percent to 1.8 \npercent. Similarly, for those earning between $50,000 and $75,000, the \nburden share drops from 12.2 percent to 11.3 percent.\n  This is not the case, however, for taxpayers earning $200,000 or \nmore. Their share of the overall burden will actually increase, and \nincrease by a full 3 percent.\n  As we can see, then, the President's plan not only retains the \nprogressivity of our tax system, that progressivity is actually \nenhanced. The President's plan gives tax relief to all taxpayers, and \nit does so in a fair manner, one that requires more from those who are \nable to pay and provides the greatest relief for those most in need.\n  There are several Members of the Senate who belong to a group called \nthe Centrist Coalition. There is nothing wrong with that group; they \nare good people. They are out there to try to find compromise and to \npromote bipartisanship. In a time of a 50-50 Senate, you cannot knock \nthat, and I do not. However, they have a plan on which I will comment.\n  The Centrist Coalition is concerned that $1.6 trillion is not the \nright amount of tax reduction and argue that the right number is \nsomewhere between the Democrat's number of $900 billion and the \nPresident's number, $1.6 trillion. I thank Senator Breaux, the head of \nthe Centrist Coalition, for his efforts to find, as he says, a middle \nground.\n  Senator Breaux has a long history as one who tries to secure \nbipartisan consensus. He was one of the few Democrats to cross over and \nsupport the Senate tax relief plan in 1999. He is widely known for his \nefforts to find bipartisan consensus on Medicare. I will be relying on \nSenator Breaux, along with Senator Baucus, when we take up Medicare \nlegislation later this year. Earlier this year, I accepted the \ncentrists' invitation to join their meetings. I attended a meeting in a \nrecent week on tax options and found it to be a very useful discussion.\n  Senator Breaux suggests that the middle ground is splitting the \ndifference between the President's number of $1.6 trillion and the \nDemocratic alternative of $900 billion. If those were the only two \nnumbers to consider, I would probably agree that his number of $1.25 \ntrillion is pretty close to middle ground. But the reality is that the \nnumbers range, as Senator Conrad has said, all the way up to $2.2 \ntrillion down to $900 billion. Some of my colleagues on this side \nreally like that $2.2 trillion number better, and I have to put water \nto dampen their desires, because we have to be realistic in this game.\n  In comparing the numbers, I, like Senator Breaux, am not comfortable \nwith either the Democrat number of $900 billion or the $2.2 trillion \nbeing thrown around by some on my side of the aisle. Unlike Senator \nBreaux, however, I am comfortable with the $1.6 trillion number, and \nthis is why. I am going to run through a hypothetical calculation of a \ntax cut agenda and look at each number to see if it accommodates the \nagenda of its proponents.\n  I want to look at Senator Conrad's number of $900 billion. Now \nSenators Daschle, Conrad, and the Democratic leadership have been \ntalking a lot about their stimulus and rate cut package.\n  Under Joint Tax scoring, that proposal loses around $506 billion over \n10 years. That leaves $394 billion out of their $900 billion for other \ntax cuts that Senator Conrad and other Democrats say they support.\n  The Democrat alternative on marriage tax relief, which was offered in \nthe Finance Committee last year, contained a revenue loss of $197 \nbillion over 10 years, without a sunset.\n  The Democratic alternative on death tax relief contained a revenue \nloss of $64 billion over 10 years.\n  So using Democratic proposals and last year's revenue loss estimates, \nthe Democrats have less than $133 billion in surplus left.\n  You have to keep in mind that these are only the Democrat proposals \nwe are talking about. We have to consider that there are bipartisan tax \ncuts that passed either or both Houses of Congress during the past \nyear.\n  There is the retirement security bill that Senator Baucus and I will \nsoon be introducing. A similar bill passed the House almost \nunanimously. That bill will run about $52 billion.\n  There is a bill to repeal the Spanish-American War phone tax that \npassed the House last year by an overwhelming bipartisan margin, and \nthat will run about $50 billion.\n  Then there is the small business and agricultural tax cuts that \neveryone supports. That package totals over $17 billion.\n  The education tax relief that unanimously passed the Finance \nCommittee last month runs about $20 billion.\n  Now, you have to add up all these bipartisan tax cuts and, when you \ndo, we have now exceeded the $133 billion that was left in the Democrat \nbudget. It is all gone. And we haven't even factored in their greatest \nobjection to the President's proposal, and that is the problem with the \nalternative minimum tax.\n\n  We have heard a lot of pointed criticism of the President's tax plan \nfrom Senators on the other side of the aisle on the issue of the \nalternative minimum tax. Senator Conrad has said that it takes $200 \nbillion to $300 billion to fix the AMT problem under the Bush plan. \nSenator Conrad is correct that the President's plan could make the \nproblem worse. As I have said, I intend to address that problem.\n\n[[Page S3510]]\n\n  The Senate Democratic stimulus and rate reduction package does \nnothing about the AMT problem that they have addressed and found fault \nwith in the President's program. In fact, their legislation will make \nthis problem worse. According to the Joint Tax Committee, the \nDemocrats' package will subject an additional 7 million taxpayers to \nthe AMT.\n  So if Senator Conrad and other Senators on the other side of the \naisle want to practice what they preach, they will have to raise their \nbudget's tax cut numbers to deal with the alternative minimum tax. As \nthey have said, that is another $200 billion to $300 billion.\n  But at this point, after including their priorities and the \nbipartisan tax cuts, they don't have any surplus left to redress the \nAMT problem. So, as you can see, the Democratic budget number of $900 \nbillion does not even accommodate their own tax priorities.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I believe many on the other side, like Senator Breaux, \nknow this.\n  I would like to finish, and then I'll respond; but I only have 25 \nminutes allotted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on my time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I will yield on his time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have great respect for the chairman. He \nand I have worked on many matters together. I want to take this moment \nto advise the Senator that we have $125 billion of our $750 billion tax \ncut unallocated. We have specifically not allocated it all so that some \nof it could be used to address the alternative minimum tax problem. So \nwe have not done what we have criticized the other side for doing.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for what he thinks \nis a clarification. But he, I think, makes my point. They have reserved \nsome money, but when you add all of their proposals, and when you take \ninto consideration the AMT, and when you also take into consideration \ntheir votes on bipartisan tax proposals, there is no way that you are \ngoing to squeeze that into their numbers.\n  Let me tell you, we have had problems on this side of the aisle. Even \nif we go at $1.6 trillion, there is going to be a difficulty squeezing \neverything in. But we have a problem of having the greatest amount of \nflexibility that we can.\n  Now, as has been said, the Democratic budget number of $900 billion \ndoes not even accommodate their own tax priorities. I believe Senator \nBreaux knows that.\n  I think those who have proposed numbers in the range of $2 trillion \nto $2.4 trillion are also pushing the wrong number.\n  That tax cut number doesn't balance our priorities in paying down \ndebt and targeted spending increases.\n  Senator Breaux's number is better than the Democratic number because \nit allows more tax cuts to be addressed. However, it does not have \nenough room. Unlike the Democratic number, Senator Breaux's number \nmight be enough to cover Democratic priorities, plus a little bit more; \nbut it would ignore the President's priorities.\n  So I believe the number that the President has proposed is \nappropriate but not just because he proposed it. It is appropriate \nbecause it will allow us to accommodate the bipartisan tax cut \npriorities before us.\n  Senator Baucus and I will need the full $1.6 trillion to make the tax \ncuts for all of you, through these votes and through these proposals, \nhave indicated that you are interested in, and to make it work.\n  The Democrat side has said they want bipartisan legislation. So in \norder to do that, the Finance Committee will need $1.6 trillion in tax \ncut relief authority from the Senate through the budget resolution.\n  I also think that many in this body are looking at the number too \nmuch in terms of a win or loss for President Bush. This is true of \nRepublicans, who tend to look at the $1.6 trillion number, or anything \nhigher, as a win for the President. Democrats are looking at anything \nless than that number as somewhat of a loss for the President.\n  Democratic leaders, budgetwise and their elected leadership, have \nbeen explicit in this objective. They have worked very hard to try to \ndefeat the President's tax cut. All the amendments we have been voting \non take money from the tax cut, which indicates that is their strategy.\n  We ought to look at the numbers in terms of the tax cut agenda, \nincluding the President's proposal, the bipartisan and the bicameral \nproposals and, of course, the Senate's own proposals.\n  Senator Breaux's amendment, while well intentioned, does not provide \nthe Finance Committee with the tools necessary to do the job of \ndelivering bipartisan tax relief to the American people.\n  I want to bring this down State by State. All politics is local, we \nare told. The Treasury Department has released data showing the number \nof individual tax returns on a State-by-State basis that will benefit \nfrom the President's tax relief plan. These returns are a mix of \nmarried couples filing jointly, single return filers, and heads of \nhousehold.\n  The data is significant for all Senators. For example, in my home \nState of Iowa, over 1 million individual returns would benefit under \nthe President's plan. If even half of those returns are married filing \njointly, that means over 1.5 million people in my State will receive a \ntax benefit from the President's plan.\n  The numbers are even greater for larger States. For example, the \nnumber of individual returns that would receive a tax benefit under the \nPresident's plan in: Arkansas, 787,000; California, 11 million; \nFlorida, 5.5 million; Georgia, 2.7 million; Illinois, 4.5 million; \nLouisiana, 1.3 million; Missouri, 1.9 million; Nebraska, 631,000; New \nJersey, 3.2 million; New York State, 6.5 million; North Carolina, 2.7 \nmillion.\n  Keep in mind that these numbers I just listed are the number of \nindividual tax returns. If a substantial portion in each of these \nStates were married filing jointly, the number of taxpayers benefiting \nunder the President's plan could nearly double.\n  The number of individual taxpayers benefiting under the President's \nproposal is simply too big to ignore; unless, of course, we focus on \nthe smaller States that do not file as many individual tax returns. For \nexample, North Dakota has only 230,000 individual returns filed. South \nDakota has only 236,000 returns; Maine, 465,000; Rhode Island, 385,000; \nVermont, 232,000.\n  Perhaps the tax benefits offered by the President's plan are not \nrelevant to these smaller States. Those taxpayers do not really count, \nbut they certainly count in my State, and I suspect they count in many \nof the other States as well.\n  An interesting study was recently released by the Tax Foundation, a \nnonpartisan tax-exempt organization.\n  I yield myself 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator has yielded 5 more \nminutes and is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am not going to go through this chart, but one can \nsee we list the benefits of the households in the States, so one can \nsee there is tremendous benefit and savings to the people living in \nthese States.\n\n  Just think what these families can do with those dollars if we let \nthem keep their hard-earned money instead of taking it away to squander \nin Washington. For example, I know the cost-of-living in California is \nhigh, but $15,800 in the pockets of the average household in that State \nwould buy quite a bit. If they decide to pay down early on their 30-\nyear mortgage, the interest saved would save them a tremendous number \nof house payments. It can buy kids clothes, family vacations. Let the \nfamily decide how to spend it.\n  The tax savings offered to the residents of each State is laid out in \nthese charts, and I hope our constituents in each of these States hold \nus accountable to provide tax savings.\n  It is time to wrap up the debate on whether the Finance Committee \nwill have an opportunity to cut taxes up to $1.6 trillion over 10 \nyears. I underscore the word ``opportunity'' because that is what this \ndebate is all about: the opportunity for a tax cut.\n  This vote is not about what the tax cut contains. That debate and \nvote will come later. That debate and vote comes when the Finance \nCommittee marks up tax cut legislation. This vote is about whether we \nwill consider the tax cut under reconciliation.\n  Reconciliation plain and simple, as we sit here today, is the only \nway we are going to get a tax cut for the American people in a timely \nmanner.\n\n[[Page S3511]]\n\n  There have been strong statements made by some on the other side \nabout tax cuts and reconciliation. From the tone of the statements, one \nwould think that a reconciled tax cut is a new event. We have gone \nthrough the history of it, and I do not want to repeat that history. It \nhas been discussed between the Senator from New Hampshire and the \nSenator from New Mexico to a great extent, but I think it boils down to \nthe question of cooperation and shared responsibility. A 50/50 Senate \nmeans shared power and, just as important, shared responsibility.\n  The Senate today is operating under a historic powersharing \narrangement reached on January 5, 2001. Republicans following our \nleader yielded a significant concession to the Democrats. What did we \nget in exchange? What we got was, as Senator Lott put it, a good-faith \npromise on the part of Democrats to cooperate.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee, I have had this sort of cooperation \nfrom Senator Baucus, and we will continue to do it. However, the \nopponents of Senator Domenici's amendment depart from the spirit of \nthat historic agreement.\n  In 1993, with a new President and majorities in both Houses, \nDemocrats used reconciliation to raise taxes. Democrats in 1993 used \nreconciliation within their right to further their President's program, \na partisan-designed major tax increase.\n  Eight years later, we are faced with a similar situation, though I am \nhopeful more than one Member of the other side will support us. \nRepublicans, by a razor-thin edge, have control of Congress and the \nPresidency. The core of President Bush's program, much as President \nClinton's program 8 years ago, involves taxes. The difference is that \nPresident Bush wants to return a portion of the record level of income \ntaxes to folks who pay them. Republicans did not object to use of \nreconciliation in 1993; Democrats should not object to Republicans' use \nof reconciliation today.\n  For those of us on this side of the aisle, this is a very compelling \npoint, especially in the context of our concession in powersharing. I \nwant to quote Senator Byrd from West Virginia on this point. He made \nthis point on January 5, 2001, when this agreement was reached.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. May I do this one quote and then I will quit.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield whatever the Senator needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Senator Byrd said:\n\n       I know it has been difficult for Members, particularly on \n     the Republican side to come to an agreement such as has been \n     reached here, but they have been willing to give up their \n     partisanship for the moment in the interests of the Nation.\n       Also, it is exceedingly important--I have already mentioned \n     it here--to George Bush. . . . It is vitally important to \n     him, if he is to expect to see his programs considered and \n     adopted. And hopefully, from his standpoint, certainly, and \n     from the standpoint of many others, if he is to see those \n     programs succeed, he--\n\n  Meaning President Bush--\n\n       is going to have to have help. He can't depend on all of it \n     coming just from his side--\n\n  Meaning the Republican side of the aisle.\n\n       He is going to have some help over here. . . .\n\n  Meaning the Democrats side of the aisle.\n  As always, Senator Byrd said it very well. At this point in history, \nthe President's agenda, including the cornerstone of his proposed tax \nrelief for working men and women, is tied in with his power-sharing \nagreement. With this power-sharing agreement that govern the operation \nof this Senate, this year, certainly from the perspective of those on \nthis side of the Aisle, there is a connection.\n  Therefore, it strikes us as particularly unfortunate that in the \ncontext of power sharing a new obstacle is raised to the use of the \nreconciliation process. It is particularly disappointing to this side \nof the aisle that this argument on reconciliation is forthcoming now. \nWe believe the Domenici amendment should not be necessary. \nReconciliation affords the President an opportunity to consider his \nprogram. It is an appropriate opportunity in the context of the history \nof the budget Act. It is also appropriate, and maybe more so, in the \ncontext of the power-sharing agreement governing the operation of the \nSenate, in this Congress, because the Senate is 50/50.\n  A vote for the Domenici amendment is not a vote for a tax cut; it is \na vote to give the Senate the opportunity we ought to have to consider \nsuch tax relief for working men and women.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate from the North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I remind the Senator form Iowa it was \nentirely appropriate to use reconciliation in 1993 because that was a \ndeficit reduction piece of legislation. That is the difference. This is \nnot deficit reduction.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support including reconciliation \ninstructions in this resolution. This is a very important issue for the \nSenate as an institution and a very important issue for the future \neconomic well-being of the nation. The Senate is a great legislative \nbody, a deliberative body unique in the world. The central feature of \nthe unique role the Senate plays is the fullness of debate and the \nopenness of the amendment process.\n  The reconciliation process is a feature of the Budget Act which was \nadopted in 1974. When it was adopted, it was contemplated that the \nreconciliation process would be used as a tool of fiscal restraint. \nThat is, that reconciliation would be used to reduce deficits.\n  The Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, himself, said \nin 1985:\n\n       Frankly, as the chairman of the Budget Committee I am aware \n     of how beneficial reconciliation can be to deficit reduction. \n     But I'm also totally aware of what can happen when we choose \n     to use this kind of process to basically get around the rules \n     of the Senate as to limiting debate. Clearly, unlimited \n     debate is the prerogative of the Senate that is greatly \n     modified under this process. I have grown to understand this \n     institution. While it has a lot of shortcomings, it has some \n     qualities that are rather exceptional. One of those is the \n     fact that it is an extremely free institution, that we are \n     free to offer amendments, that we are free to take as much \n     time as this Senate will let us, to debate and have those \n     issues thoroughly understood both here and across the \n     country.\n\n  And, in 1989, Senator Domenici said:\n\n       There are a few things about the U.S. Senate that people \n     understand to be very, very significant. One is that you have \n     the right, the rather broad right, the most significant right \n     among all parliamentary bodies in the world, to amend freely \n     on the floor. The other is the right to debate and to \n     filibuster. When the Budget Act was drafted, the \n     reconciliation procedure was crafted very carefully. It was \n     intended to be used rather carefully because, in essence, Mr. \n     President, it vitiated those two significant characteristics \n     of this place that many have grown to respect and admire. \n     Some think it is a marvelous institution of democracy. And if \n     you lose those two qualities you just about turn this U.S. \n     Senate into the U.S. House of Representatives or other \n     parliamentary body.\n\n  In 1981, former Majority Leader Howard Baker stated,\n\n       Reconciliation was never meant to be a vehicle for an \n     omnibus authorization bill. To permit it to be treated as \n     such is to break faith with the Senate's historical \n     uniqueness as a forum for the exercise of minority and \n     individual rights.\n\n  The amendment before us today would add reconciliation instructions \nto this budget resolution for a totally different purpose. The purpose \nis to shield the massive tax cut proposed by President Bush from full \ndebate and the amending process in the Senate. This is the opposite of \nfiscal restraint. This is the opposite of deficit reduction. The \nreconciliation process would restrict debate to only twenty hours and \npotentially less time and would constrain amendments. It reduces the \nlikelihood of compromise. It reduces the likelihood of the enactment of \na tax cut with broad bipartisan support because it weakens minority \nrights and tempts the majority to force their version on the minority.\n  This would be a misuse of the reconciliation process and a disservice \nto the American people. The tax bill will impact the federal budget and \nthe nation's economy for many years to come. It will cost more than \n$1.6 trillion over the next decade, probably much more. The American \npeople, the people who send us here as their representatives have the \nright to have this tax cut considered and evaluated, debated and \namended under the normal procedures which have made the Senate a great \ndeliberative body.\n  In 1981, the reconciliation process was used to enact spending \nreductions which President Reagan sought. That was appropriate. \nHowever, the major\n\n[[Page S3512]]\n\ntax cut which was the centerpiece of his program was considered that \nsame year as a free-standing tax bill in the Senate. That is, it was \nconsidered under the normal Senate rules. The tax bill was fully \ndebated for about twelve days and more than a hundred amendments were \nconsidered. There were fifty roll call votes. That was a process in the \ntradition of the Senate and did it credit. I was one of eleven Senators \nthat voted against that bill. But the process that was used to adopt \nthat tax bill was the appropriate and normal process. This is what \nmakes the Senate the world's preeminent deliberative body.\n  Today, we are being asked to turn our backs on Senate history by \nadding language to this budget resolution which will make it more \ndifficult for the Senate to fully debate, amend and work its will on \ntax legislation which we will consider in the weeks ahead. I support a \ntax cut, but not President Bush's version which I think is too large, \nrelies on highly problematical projections. But, I cannot support this \neffort the circumvent the Senate's rules in order to pass without full \ndebate and amendment any tax cut bill. Doing so is the opposite of the \nintent of reconciliation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think it is useful to sit back and \nreflect, get a little perspective on this issue.\n  I remind Members we have a Constitution. Under the Constitution there \nis an article I, an article II, and an article III. Article I is the \nlegislative article; article II, the executive article; and article \nIII, the judicial.\n  Why is that important? It is important because we are separate \nbranches of government: The legislative branch, the executive. Why is \narticle I the legislative branch? Our Founding Fathers said because it \nis where laws are written, it is the most important. We are coequal \nbranches, but article I is legislative, essentially because this is \nwhere the laws are made.\n  We all run for office. We are elected or unelected by our people, the \ncitizens of our States, the people for whom we work. It is a wonderful \nform of government. It works. We are not a parliamentary form of \ngovernment. We are not a parliamentary form of government because we \nhave a separate legislative branch. In the parliamentary form of \ngovernment, the majority party that is elected in the elections is the \nGovernment.\n  Under the Constitution, we are treated differently. We are separate. \nOf course, we have political parties. That complicates matters. I have \nthe utmost respect for the President of the United States, whether he \nor she be Republican or Democrat. It is important to state, however, \nthat we are Senators, with all that means, proudly doing what we think \nis right, representing the people of our States, which is no small \nmatter. It is a tremendous burden, a tremendous responsibility, and a \ntremendous privilege. That is why we sought this office, that is why we \nlike this job so much, and that is why most Members want to continue \nand seek reelection.\n  The question tonight is very narrow. It is whether or not the tax \nlegislation that will be contemplated this year should be within the \nnarrow confines of reconciliation. It is conceded, it is agreed, that \nreconciliation and all its very narrow constraints is very proper in \norder to reduce deficits, to raise taxes, or cut spending. No one \ndisputes that. Under reconciliation, the Senate is not the Senate; the \nSenate is a different institution with very narrow constraints on \namendments, germaneness, and debate.\n  Rather, the issue before the Senate is whether those extremely tight \nconstraints should also apply to cutting taxes and increasing outlays. \nThat is the question.\n  It has been argued on the other side, yes, it should. It has been \nargued that reconciliation is policy neutral. If we do believe that, \nthen we believe that anything can be in reconciliation that in any way \naffects outlays or revenues--anything: The highway bill, the former \nhealth care bill that has been mentioned. That is what that argument \nmeans.\n  I ask my good friend from Iowa, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, who enjoys the prerogatives of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee--I plead with him--to have a process where the Finance \nCommittee has more opportunity to write more legislation in the \ncommittee and also on the floor.\n  The central point is, we have an opportunity tonight to do what is \nright. There have been a lot of red herrings. For example, the point \nhas been made that Senator Byrd should have made the argument 27 years \nago. That is irrelevant. We are the Senate. We can vote on what we want \nto vote on. Tomorrow we can vote again on a different matter. It is up \nto us to decide what is right.\n  What is right is to use reconciliation where it should be used, in \nreducing deficits. It should not be used to craft anything else under \nthe sun. Because the latter approach disenfranchises, literally, a \nmajority of Americans. The right to offer amendments on the floor of \nthe Senate and the right of unlimited debate are essential. Under \nreconciliation, we have constraints on unlimited debate--which \ndisenfranchises voters.\n  It is wrong for this amendment to pass. It is undermining why we came \nhere. I urge Senators to vote against the pending amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the issue is not whether we are going to \nhave a tax cut or what the specific details of the tax cut will be. The \nquestion is, Are we going to take this historic opportunity with over \n$5.5 trillion of surplus available in the next 10 years and make \ndecisions on how to allocate that surplus in the most rational manner?\n  One of the issues, I am afraid, that will be trampled upon if we do \nnot defeat this amendment, and deny us the opportunity for full debate, \nis the question of how we will finance a prescription drug benefit \nthrough Medicare. Virtually every Member of the Senate, on both sides \nof the aisle, has voted in favor of a prescription drug \nbenefit. Virtually every Member has also voted that that benefit should \nbe in the range of $300 billion to $311 billion over the next 10 years. \nWhere we disagree is how we should pay for it.\n\n  This side of the aisle has voted to pay for it in the traditional \nmanner, general revenue and premiums paid by the beneficiaries. The \nother side of the aisle has voted to pay for it by taking the excess \nfunds that are in the hospital trust fund.\n  For 35 years, there has been a contract between the people of the \nUnited States and their Federal Government. That contract has said: You \npay me every month 1.5 percent of your salary, and when you reach \nretirement age, we will provide you a range of benefits that includes \nhospital, skilled nursing home, and home health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That contract is now about to be broken. We should have a \nfull debate in the Senate before we engage in that unilateral abolition \nof a 35-year commitment by the American people. Before I yield the \nremainder of my time to the Senator from Michigan, I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter from the American Hospital Association dated \ntoday be printed in the Record, which states:\n\n       We believe the Part A Trust Fund should be used for the \n     purpose for which it was intended.\n\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the American Hospital \n     association (AHA), I would like to express our strong support \n     of your amendment to H. Con. Res. 83, the fiscal year (FY) \n     2002 budget resolution requiring a ``super majority'' of 60 \n     votes in the Senate in order to spend Hospital Insurance (HI) \n     Trust Fund dollars for non-Part A services.\n       The AHA represents nearly 5,000 hospitals, health systems, \n     networks and other health care provider members.\n       The Medicare program is expected to experience very rapid \n     growth over the next decade as our nation's 78 million ``baby \n     boomers'' begin to retire. The Part A Trust Fund, which is \n     supported by a payroll tax, is projected to see its \n     obligations exceed its income by 2015, and its assets could \n     be exhausted by 2029.\n       We believe that the Part A Trust Fund should be used for \n     the purpose for which it\n\n[[Page S3513]]\n\n     was intended: to provide beneficiaries with the highest \n     quality hospital acute care services. Congress must be \n     careful not to dilute the trust fund or divert dollars \n     currently in the trust fund for other purposes. It is \n     imperative that Congress avoids legislation that accelerates \n     the insolvency of the Medicare Part A Trust Fund. We need to \n     ensure that Medicare Part A services are there when our \n     seniors need them.\n       Since its inception, the Medicare program has ensured \n     seniors access to high quality affordable health care. It is \n     incumbent upon all of us to ensure that the program is \n     preserved, protected and strengthened for future generations.\n           Sicnerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield the remainder of my time to my distinguished \ncolleague from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a debate about a reconciliation \nprocess by which a tax cut will occur. I think most Members of this \nCongress would, in quiet moments, agree we are unlikely to have 10 \nyears of relentless surpluses. This is truly a triumph of hope over \nexperience, but that is the way politics is sometimes.\n  I want to introduce into the Record a memorandum by Alan Blinder, \nGene Sperling, and Jason Furman, three very distinguished economists \nwho have reviewed the assessment of the 51 leading private sector \nforecasts with respect to recent economic trends on the surplus.\n  I am going to ask consent to have it printed in the Record in its \nentirety, but essentially they say:\n\n       . . . altering only the 2001 growth forecast [with the last \n     three months of information] leaving all other projections \n     unchanged, would result in a roughly $215 billion reduction \n     in the unified surplus. . . .\n\n  They go on to say the effect of the stock market difficulties could \nwell lower the unified surplus by $1 trillion or more.\n\n       Standard & Poor's DRI, for example, project stock market \n     factors could reduce the unified surplus by more than $1 \n     trillion over the next decade.\n\n  My point is very simply if we proceed with the size of a tax cut \nproposed by the Republican Party and by the President and do not \nexperience these surpluses, which is very likely--very likely we will \nnot experience these surpluses--we will head back into big deficits. \nThe discussion is as if these surpluses already exist. They do not. \nThey are not in a silk purse; they are not in a mattress; they are not \nin a bank account. They do not exist. They are projections and they are \nprojections which we may not see. Let's be cautious and conservative. \nLet's have a tax cut, yes; pay down the debt, yes; meet our \npriorities--improving schools and other things--but do it in a prudent \nand thoughtful way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent the memorandum be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Memorandum for Senator Dorgan\n\n  From: Alan Blinder, Princeton University, Gene Sperling, Brookings \n             Institution, Jason Furman, Harvard University\n\n Subject: Analysis of the impact of recent economic conditions on the \n                   10-year projection of the surplus\n\n     Summary\n       Many observers have questioned whether or not the most \n     recent surplus projections would be altered by the recent \n     slowdown in economic activity and fall in the stock market. \n     Although many of the fundamentals of the economy remain \n     strong--with unemployment near 30 year lows, productivity \n     growth still high, and many indications that consumer demand \n     is holding up--other weaker indicators have led many \n     forecasters to lower their growth projections for 2001. In \n     assessing the impact of recent economic trends on the \n     surplus, we have chosen not to offer our own economic \n     projections, but simply to examine how changes in the 51 \n     leading private-sector forecasters who make up the Blue Chip \n     consensus would impact surplus projections.\n       The analysis is informative for at least a couple of key \n     reasons. First, this analysis highlights the degree of \n     uncertainty surrounding the projection of the surplus. \n     Indeed, it shows that altering only the 2001 growth forecast, \n     leaving all the other projections unchanged, would result in \n     a roughly $215 billion reduction in the unified surplus \n     relative to the CBO baseline projection. It should be noted \n     that this change is result of taking into account only three \n     months of new information, representing just 2\\1/2\\ percent \n     of the 10-year period. Second, the recent fall in the stock \n     market further highlights the uncertainty of budget \n     projections that are based not only on economic growth \n     projections but on projections of revenues from taxation of \n     capital gains, stock options, and taxable withdrawals from \n     retirement accounts--all of which are highly dependent on the \n     level of stock market. Indeed, if individual income tax \n     receipts as a share of GDP fall back slightly from the very \n     high levels achieved in 2000, the unified surplus could be \n     lowered by $1 trillion or more. Standard & Poor DRI, for \n     example, project that stock market factors could reduce the \n     unified surplus by more than $1 trillion over the next \n     decade.\n       While we remain optimistic about the future of the American \n     economy, such significant swings in just three months show \n     why even optimists should exercise prudence when making ten-\n     year policy commitments based on ten-year projections. Over \n     the next ten years, there are likely to be many other periods \n     in which economic activity departs substantially from the \n     current projections, resulting in substantial deviations of \n     the actual surplus from the projections that are being made \n     today. CBO estimates that, based on their track record, \n     the unified surplus in 2002 could be anywhere from $69 \n     billion to $556 billion. The uncertainty grows so that in \n     2006, with no tax cuts or spending increases in the \n     interim, the budget balance could be anywhere from a $92 \n     billion deficit to a $1.1 trillion surplus. After setting \n     aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses, the \n     probability of running into deficits increases \n     substantially: the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities \n     (CBPP), relying on CBO analysis, has estimated that there \n     is a ``20 percent chance that, under current law, the \n     budget excluding Social Security and Medicare will be in \n     deficit in each year from 2002 through 2006.''\n       These reductions in the projected surplus and uncertainty \n     come on top of the predictable factors that will reduce the \n     surplus over the next decade, including the likelihood that \n     real discretionary spending will grow with population, \n     several popular tax credits will be extended, and the \n     Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) will be reformed so that it \n     does not affect a growing share of middle-class families. \n     These factors will likely reduce the available surplus by an \n     additional $800 billion.\n     Revisions to GDP Growth and Their Impact on the Surplus\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) finalized the \n     economic forecast underlying their latest budget projections \n     in December 2000. Both CBO and the Administration project 2.4 \n     percent GDP growth in 2001.\n       When CBO made its economic forecast, 2.4 percent GDP growth \n     was consistent with the Blue Chip consensus of leading \n     forecasters. Since December, however, the Blue Chip consensus \n     has been revised down and now stands at 1.9 percent growth \n     for 2001. The Blue Chip forecasters have also revised down \n     their predictions for growth in 2002 to 3.4 percent, the same \n     rate predicted by CBO, and left their growth predictions \n     essentially unchanged thereafter.\n       Estimating the budget impact of the latest Blue Chip short-\n     run macroeconomic forecast provides an example of how just \n     three months of data might lead to revisions in the projected \n     surplus. It is important to note that although the Blue Chip \n     forecast is slightly more pessimistic than CBO, it is still \n     relatively optimistic compared to the recessionary \n     projections of many commentators. Nevertheless, even this \n     relatively small change in the outlook would result in a \n     substantial reduction in the projected surplus over the next \n     decade.\n       To estimate the likely magnitude of this reduction we have \n     relied on Table 1-6 ``Sensitivity of the Budget to Economic \n     Assumptions'' from the Analytical Perspectives volume of the \n     Administration's FY 2001 budget. We updated these estimates \n     to reflect a GDP slowdown in 2001 and projected them forward \n     to cover the period 2002-11 (the Analytical Perspectives \n     table only covers 2000-05). Based on this, every one \n     percentage point reduction of GDP growth in 2001--with \n     unchanged growth projections in 2002-11--will reduce the \n     unified surplus by about $430 billion over 10 years:\n\n                                  IMPACT OF A 1 PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION IN GDP GROWTH IN 2001 ON THE UNIFIED SURPLUS\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                         2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     210      2011      2002-2011\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nReceipts.............................        9       19       23       24       25       26       27       28       30       31       33             265\nOutlays..............................        2        6        6        6        6        6        7        7        7        8        8              67\nInterest.............................        0        1        2        4        6        8       10       13       16       18       22             100\n      Total..........................       11       27       31       34       37       40       44       48       52       57       62             432\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Authors' calculations based on Table 1-6 of FY 2001 Analytical Perspectives\n\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\n       Based on the latest Blue Chip projections, the slowdown \n     would reduce GDP growth by 0.5 percentage point relative to \n     the current CBO forecast--reducing the unified surplus by \n     about $215 billion over 10 years.\n       The actual revision to the surplus forecast based on the \n     latest outlook for aggregate economic activity could be more \n     or less than this $215 billion prediction which is based on \n     the assumption that the level of real GDP remains 0.5 percent \n     lower from 2002-11. On the one hand, the reduction to the \n     surplus would be even larger if the future growth rate of \n     real GDP were slower. CBO estimates that if the GDP growth \n     rate were 0.1 percentage point lower per year, the unified \n     surplus would be reduced by an additional $244 billion. On \n     the other hand, the reduction to the surplus would be less \n     than $215 billion if the current slowdown is followed by a \n     period of stronger growth that returns the economy to \n     potential GDP. In its recent Economic and Budget Outlook CBO \n     presents a ``recession scenario'' in which a sharp slowdown \n     in 2001 is followed by substantially stronger growth, leading \n     to only a $133 billion reduction in the unified surplus from \n     2002-11. CBO's scenario, however, would be less likely if the \n     economy in 2000 was well above potential, if the recent \n     slowdown causes economists to revise down their estimate of \n     the level of potential GDP, or if the adjustment back to \n     potential is very slow.\n     Uncertainty from the short-term economic outlook\n       The key point from examining the impact of recent economic \n     changes on the long-run surplus projections is the large \n     amount of uncertainty, which has only been increased by the \n     uncertainty over the short-run outlook. The bottom 10 Blue \n     Chip forecasters project growth of 1.3 percent in 2001--\n     compared to the 2.6 percent GDP growth projection of the top \n     10 Blue Chip forecasters. Taking the range of Blue Chip \n     projections for GDP growth in 2001 and 2002 would lead to a \n     range in projections of the unified surplus of roughly $370 \n     billion more than CBO's current forecast to roughly $730 \n     billion less than CBO's current forecast.\n     Additional sources of downward revisions in the surplus: The \n         impact of the stock market on Revenues\n       The level of economic activity is not the only factor that \n     affects the surplus. A major factor in the recent rise in the \n     surplus is the increase in individual income tax receipts \n     from 8.1 percent of GDP in 1995 to 10.2 percent of GDP in \n     2000. Although legislation in 1997 reduced taxes, several \n     factors contributed to tax receipts growing more quickly than \n     the economy. CBO estimates that half of the recent increase \n     has been due to rising capital gains realizations and higher \n     income for high-income taxpayers. The strong stock market has \n     clearly played an important role in these strong tax \n     receipts.\n       Going forward, CBO projects that individual income tax \n     receipts will stay above 10.2 percent of GDP for the next \n     decade. Part of this is driven by the projection of continued \n     strong capital gains. Although CBO builds in some declines in \n     capital gains from the extraordinarily high levels in the \n     last few years, it still projects capital gains realizations \n     of around 4\\1/2\\ percent of GDP going forward, which is \n     substantially higher than the 2.4 percent of GDP that \n     prevailed from 1990-96.\n       In addition to capital gains, the level of the stock market \n     has a substantial impact on individual income tax receipts as \n     a share of GDP through its impact on the flow of nonqualified \n     stock options (which are taxed as ordinary income) and \n     withdrawals from taxable savings accounts. Standard & Poors \n     DRI estimates that 15 percent of Federal revenue ``is coming \n     from the stock market.''\n       With the broad Wilshire 5000 stock index down 14 percent \n     since December 31st, this factor is likely to reduce the \n     surplus even more than the conservative projection based on \n     the GDP slowdown alone. It is difficult to estimate the \n     impact of the past changes in the stock market, let alone to \n     predict future changes in the stock market. But even small \n     changes could have a big impact on the surplus. For example, \n     if individual income tax receipts stay at 9.6 percent of \n     GDP--their level in 1998-99 and well above their level from \n     1994-97--then the unified surplus over the next decade would \n     be $1.2 trillion lower than the current projections. In this \n     example, receipts as a share of GDP are still substantially \n     higher than CBO's ``pessimistic scenario,''\n       Severla investment banks and economic forecasters have made \n     rough estimates about the likely impact of economic \n     conditions on the surplus that are very large in magnitude. \n     These predications include:\n       Merrill Lynch has projected that the surplus for FY 2001 \n     will be $250 billion, $31 billion less than CBO's projection. \n     Merrill Lynch's more pessimistic projections for GDP growth \n     only accounts for about one-quarter of this difference from \n     CBO; the majority of the difference is due to other factors \n     like the fall in the stock market.\n       Standard & Poors DRI estimates that CBO's underestimate of \n     the impact of the stock market on the economy could wipe out \n     $1 trillion of the projected surplus over 10 years.\n       Mark Zandi, chief economist of economy.com, has been quoted \n     as saying that the 10-year surplus could be half the current \n     projections--$2.7 trillion downward revision.\n     General uncertainty about the future\n       If a new budget forecast were to take into account the news \n     from the last three months, it would most likely revise down \n     the projected surplus. As an example, just taking into \n     account the revised short-run economic outlook by the Blue \n     Chip forecasters would lead to a downward revision of about \n     $215 billion in the projected surplus. Taking into account \n     the stock market and other factors could reduce the surplus \n     by substantially more.\n       These changes appear to be relatively small compared to the \n     projected $5.6 trillion surplus. But these revisions, which \n     are only based on three months of additional data, highlight \n     how much uncertainty surrounds projections of the forecast \n     ten years in the future. The uncertainty in the projection of \n     the unified surplus grows over time, from a margin of error \n     of plus or minus $244 billion in 2002 to plus or minus $612 \n     billion in 2006. This is especially important in light of the \n     fact that 71 percent of the 10-year non-Social Security, non-\n     Medicare surplus occurs after 2005.\n       CBO itself captures the uncertainty in its estimates by \n     making projections for an ``optimistic scenario'' and a \n     ``pessimistic scenario.'' On this basis the projected 10-year \n     non-Social Security balance ranges from a $525 billion \n     deficit to a $6.2 trillion surplus. In assessing these \n     projections, CBO writes ``If CBO's track record is any guide, \n     both the optimistic and pessimistic scenarios lie well within \n     the range of uncertainty of the budget projections.''\n     Likely expenditures not included in CBO's forecast\n       In addition to the uncertainties about the future, there \n     are several ways that policies are likely to deviate from the \n     interpretation of ``current law'' that is used by CBO and the \n     Administration in putting together their budget baselines. \n     Independent groups and experts like the Concord Coalition, \n     the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and William Gale \n     and Alan Auerbach have all estimated that the available \n     surplus is about $900 billion to $1.4 trillion lower than the \n     projected on-budget surplus. The elements of this predictable \n     reduction in the surplus are:\n       Medicare off-budget. Virtually the entire House and a \n     majority of the Senate have voted to make the Medicare HI \n     surplus unavailable for tax cuts or spending increases--\n     taking $392 billion off CBO's projection of the non-Social \n     Security surplus.\n       Real discretionary spending rising with population. The \n     current baseline does not incorporate the impact that \n     increasing population has on the cost of maintaining a \n     constant level of government services. This could reduce the \n     surplus by $300 billion.\n       Alternative Minimum Tax. The Alternative Minimum Tax will \n     affect an increasing number of middle-class families over the \n     next decade; policymakers are likely to fix this provision so \n     that it serves its historic intent which is to ensure a \n     minimum level of taxation for upper-income taxpayers. This \n     reform would cost about $80 billion.\n       Expiring tax provisions. Several popular tax provisions are \n     set to expire at the end of this year; extending them, as is \n     likely, will cost $112 billion over 10 years according to \n     CBO.\n       Taking into account these realistic expenditures reduces \n     the available surplus to about $2 trillion over 10 years--\n     without even taking into account the recent changes in the \n     outlook for the economy. Taking recent economic factors into \n     account, it is more than likely that less $2 trillion will be \n     available for tax cuts, spending increases, or additional \n     debt reduction.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I hope all of our colleagues were listening very \ncarefully to Senator Byrd as he made that very powerful statement about \nthe Senate as an institution.\n  The reconciliation process, this great exception to Senate rules, was \nallowed and adopted in order to bring down the deficit. It has been \ntwisted all out of shape. This amendment proposes to use it for a \npurpose that is not relevant to reducing the deficit.\n  They talk about taxes going up, taxes going down--the end objective \nis supposed to be reducing the deficit. That is absent in this \nsituation. Reconciliation is now being used, in effect, for any purpose \nwhatsoever.\n  I very much hope the Senate will reject this amendment. I thank \nSenator Byrd for a very powerful statement. I also want to commend the \nvery able Senator from North Dakota for his leadership on the budget. \nAs he has often said, it is a matter of balance. It is a matter of \nprudence. It is a matter of restraint. We can do a tax cut to help \nworking people, we can strengthen Social Security and Medicare, we can \npay down the national debt, and we can invest in the future of our \ncountry, in education, in health, in environment, in infrastructure. \nAll of this can be done if we use prudence and caution. But we cannot \ndo it if we go to excess.\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\n  That was demonstrated yesterday when we adopted an important \neducation amendment. But in order to do it, we had to bring down the \namount of the tax proposal.\n  What matters is how you blend these priorities together. What balance \ndo you achieve? The Senator from North Dakota, in my judgment, has done \nan extraordinary job of laying out an approach which encompasses these \nmultiple goals, reconciles them, and moves the Nation forward. That is \nwhat we ought to be doing. That would not give away our fiscal \nresponsibility. Under that approach, we would not do a huge tax cut \nbased on 10-year surplus projections, 70 percent of which appear only \nin the last 5 years of the 10-year period. No one in their private or \nbusiness life would engage in that kind of reliance on tenuous \nprojections. We ought not to do it on the floor of the Senate.\n  I thank the Senator from North Dakota for the tremendous leadership \nhe has provided and the vision he has outlined of a balanced program \nthat will encompass tax reduction, protect Social Security and \nMedicare, pay down the debt, and invest in the future of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 3 minutes to my good friend, Senator Sessions \nfrom Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senators Domenici and Grassley \nfor their courageous effort to make sure this body has a full chance to \nvote on the President's tax cut proposal. It has been objected to by a \nhost of procedural objections in a desperate effort to throw it off \ntrack, but we are going to get that vote up, I believe, and have a \nchance to let the American people fully consider the issue.\n  The question I want to raise is why do we have this extraordinary \nsurplus? Why are we having big surpluses this year? In fact, we were \ntold recently, within the last week, that even though we have had a \nslowdown in this year's economy, our projection of last year \nunderestimates the surplus we will have this year--maybe by 20 or more \nbillion dollars. We will see how it turns out. But even with this \nslowdown, we have more coming in than we projected and we have had more \ncoming in for the last 3 years than has been projected by the CBO or \nOMB.\n  Why is it happening? It is because the Federal Government not only is \ntaking in more, and not only are the American people making more, the \nFederal Government is taking a larger percentage. It is taking a larger \npercentage of America's wealth--too much.\n  In 1992, the Federal Government took 17.6 percent of the total gross \ndomestic product, all that we make and manufacture in the United \nStates. Today it has hit 20.7 percent, a monumental increase. That is \nthe highest percentage of the economy taken by the Federal Government \nsince the height of World War II. The American people are entitled to \nnot see that continue upwards. In fact, this tax reduction, if passed \nfully, would not really reduce that number but just flatten it out and \nkeep it from going up.\n  We need this tax cut now. We need to have this bill on the floor so \nwe can fully debate the President's proposals. I say let it go. Let the \nSenators vote, vote to move this budget forward.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his effective leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of \nSenator Clinton. I want to say if I referred to the distinguished \nSenator in the first person an hour or so ago, I apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. I yield.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the Budget Committee, on \nwhich I am honored to serve, that I appreciate those words. I came down \nto the floor after hearing that to say just two quick things.\n  One, in 1993, we made a considerable effort to reform health care. I \nlearned a lot from that experience. I learned that we had to go in a \nstep-by-step, progressive way to try to achieve quality, affordable \nhealth care. I also learned that we needed to have an open, spirited \ndebate about what needed to be done for the good of our country.\n  I appreciate the chance to rise and state my objections to adding \nreconciliation instructions to the budget resolution because I think \nthe lesson we learned is a lesson we should apply.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator for his remarks.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am glad to do that.\n  Mr. President, to all of those on the other side who have spoken \neloquently about the Senate rules and the fact that we ought to have \nfree and open debate, I want to say one more time that the time for \nthose arguments was 27 years ago. When this bill, the Budget \nImpoundment Act, was adopted, it essentially permitted reconciliation \ninstructions. And if they were given by majority vote of the Senate and \nthe House, then a committee had to adopt laws consistent with it.\n  If that was too early, we have adopted 15 tax bills under this Budget \nAct--10 were tax increases; 5 were tax decreases. If 27 years ago was \ntoo long ago to raise the objection, we had 15 different budget \nresolutions that came to the floor that had taxes in them. Some might \nhave objected. But the truth is, the strongest arguments have been made \non this particular reconciliation instruction. I believe it is because \nsome don't want to let the President have a chance to have his taxes \nvoted on--plain, pure, and simple. I think that is going to fail \ntonight. He is going to get his chance. I think eventually his tax plan \nwill get taken care of in the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means \nCommittee. Those members will pass the bill out of their committee and \nit will come to the floor under this Budget Act, which is now 27 years \nold.\n  I yield the floor. Whatever time I have remaining, I yield to the \nmajority leader. However, he doesn't need my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might need off \nthe leader time for the opportunity to sort of go over what is going to \nbe the process at this point. The chairman and ranking member might \nwant to be prepared to comment or respond.\n  For the information of all Senators, we are about to start a series \nof votes, which has been unfortunately referred to correctly as the \n``vote-arama.'' The first of these votes will be in relation to the \nDomenici amendment regarding reconciliation. Following that vote, we \nwill have votes on the remaining pending amendments in the order in \nwhich they have been offered. I believe Senators have access to those \namendments in their order and, therefore, will know when they will come \nup.\n  I also announce that in order for us to be able to bring this to some \nconclusion, it is going to be necessary to move forward into the night, \nand we will shorten the voting period from 15 minutes after the first \nvote to 10 minutes on the subsequent amendments.\n  There are approximately, as I understand it, 160 amendments that have \nbeen filed. I hope Senators will show restraint, not offer the \namendments, and work with the chairman and the manager to identify the \namendments we really do want to consider. If we did all of the \namendments on the list that are available here tonight, assuming we \ncould do about three votes an hour, we would be here until I guess \nuntil 9 or 9:30--something such as that.\n  I know the chairman, the manager, and the sponsors will work with \nthem. Maybe they can work through some of those amendments to reduce \nthem. Of course, tomorrow morning we will continue with the so-called \nvote-arama every 15 minutes to vote on other amendments that would be \npending or would be necessary to be voted on, with the idea that we \nwould get conclusion of voting sometime and final passage tomorrow \naround 2:30.\n  I know it is going to take a lot of patience to get to that point. \nBut that is our goal. I believe that is the way it is presently lined \nup. Is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the things that would help \ntremendously\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\nand which would help the staff is when we have a 10-minute vote, it \nshould end at 10 minutes. These votes take forever. Members walk off, \ngo back to their offices, or go have dinner, whatever it is. I think if \nyou called the vote to an end at 10 minutes and set an example, some \nMembers would simply miss the votes, but I think we can move this \nalong.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think we need to do that. We quite often have legitimate \nrequests. Senators are stuck in elevators, are in the area and we can't \nfind them, or whatever. After the first vote I will remind Senators \nagain, if you will join me and remind them that we need them to stay in \nthe Chamber, we can get through at a more reasonable hour and still be \nable to complete the list of amendments tomorrow and get to final \npassage at a reasonable time tomorrow afternoon.\n  Senator Daschle I see just came on the floor. I was just going over \nthe process of how we will proceed tonight and tomorrow.\n  With that, I believe we are ready to proceed to the first vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, will the distinguished leader yield to \nme for a couple of observations? I believe both the ranking member and \nI have agreed on sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that are nongermane, \nboth of us will object to them, which I believe means that they are \ngoing to fall. I think that is the rule now if they are not germane. We \nwill make a point of order, which means they will fall. There are a lot \nof sense-of-the-Senate proposals.\n\n  But I would like to yield to my ranking member of the committee for \nhis observations on those kinds of amendments that are pending.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it should sober us up to understand that \nif we don't show some restraint and self-discipline, we face 50 hours \nof straight voting. That is the harsh reality of what confronts us \ntonight--50 straight hours of voting every 10 minutes. That is not a \ngood process. It is not credible. And it can't be allowed to happen.\n  We have to simply say to Members that they cannot expect to have each \nand every one of these amendments voted on. We will join in resisting \namendments that are not practical, that are not fiscally responsible, \nand others that are just sense-of-the-Senate amendments. We hope that \nmessage goes out very clearly. We ask leaders, if they could, to rivet \nthat point to our colleagues.\n  Mr. LOTT. We will do that on an individual basis, and also publicly \nafter the next vote. We don't want to eat up a lot of time. We will \nremind them of that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wanted to weigh in as well. I \nappreciate so much the leadership and partnership shown by our chairman \nand ranking member.\n  Let me go to the point the majority leader has made. If we want to \nfinish by 2:30 tomorrow--and the reason we need to finish by 2:30 \ntomorrow, of course, is that we have a Jewish holiday coming up, and \nthere are a number of personal matters that have to be tended to. I \nhope we can get everyone's cooperation tomorrow morning. If we are \ngoing to do that, we have to be at a point tonight with no more than 20 \namendments, and 2 minutes on each, if we come in at 9 o'clock in the \nmorning. That doesn't leave us with a lot tomorrow. In other words, we \nhave to virtually finish our work tonight.\n  A number of us are going to go to our colleagues and ask for their \nfull cooperation and partnership and effort to try to get us to the \npoint that we have nothing left but no more than 20 amendments in the \nmorning. I hope we can all work together to make that happen.\n  I appreciate very much the leader yielding.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle. We will work with you on that.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are we prepared to go to the first in a series of votes? \nHave the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: Has all time expired? We \nunderstood that we had 1 minute left, and that the other side had 1 \nminute 30 seconds. We have been on leader time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico yielded his time \nto the leader, which was used. Then leader time was used. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota spoke and he was charged 1 minute 40 seconds.\n  Are you pondering a request to have 1 minute 30 seconds restored?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that we have 1 minute restored on \nboth sides so the managers can conclude the argument on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it may sound, to those listening, as \nthough this is a debate on the President's tax cut. It is not. This is \na debate on how the President's tax cut will be considered.\n  On our side, we do not believe we should restrict the Senators' right \nof freedom to debate and freedom to amend. That is what this vote is \nabout.\n  Let me cite Senator Domenici in a debate in 1989 on an amendment from \nthe majority and minority leaders at the time to limit the scope of the \nbill that was then being considered to deficit reduction. Senator \nDomenici said:\n\n       We are going to use the process available under the Budget \n     Act to strip from this bill not only those matters which the \n     Parliamentarian would call extraneous but also those which \n     were never intended because they were not pure deficit \n     reduction matters.\n\n  That is the issue. This is not a deficit reduction matter. It should \nnot be considered under reconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, deficit reduction was the issue then; \nsurpluses are the issue today.\n  But the real issue is whether or not we are going to consider and \ngive the American people a tax break. The issue is whether the \nPresident of the United States is going to have his proposals \nconsidered by a committee and then voted on by the Senate, instead of \nbeing whittled away by time and by the consumption of all types of \namendments and all types of dilatory tactics.\n  Last, without question, we have tried by unanimous consent--we have \noffered unanimous consent approaches--so we would not have to do \nreconciliation. We cannot get that done. When that cannot be done, we \nhave to do this one, or we will not get a tax cut for the American \npeople. That is the issue. The rest is talk. The issue tonight is, will \nwe or will we not have a tax cut for the American people?\n  I yield whatever time I have and ask for the yeas and nays on the \nDomenici amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 345.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 75 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 345) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is the Senate in order at this time? There \nis no quorum call; right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nNevada, as well as the Senator from North Dakota for their willingness \nto work with the majority leader and me and others to try to reduce the \namount of amendments and the time and try to get through this process \nas best we can. These vote-aramas are not pretty or very pleasant.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the regular order with respect to the \namendment so that we will vote on the remaining amendments in the order \noffered and, further, that the next votes in this series be limited to \n10 minutes in length.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object--how about all votes rather \nthan just the next vote?\n  Mr. NICKLES. All the votes in this series.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. We have some problems we need to work out before the first \nvote. With everybody's cooperation, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 202\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the Durbin amendment, I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided in favor \nand in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. This \nis the economic stimulus amendment that provides an immediate rebate to \nthe taxpayers of America, both income-tax payers and payroll-tax \npayers, of at least $300 per person, $600 per family.\n  It also provides a permanent rate reduction of the lowest rate from \n15 percent to 10 percent. It will cost us $60 billion. It will go into \neffect immediately. It will help families across America this year.\n  This also provides that the total tax cut in addition to this will be \n$745 billion. This has been mischaracterized as a tax increase. We do \nnot have a tax cut in place. We are debating the size of the tax cut.\n  We think a third of the surplus should go to a tax cut, a third to \ndeficit reduction, and a third to crucial priorities, such as Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and investments in education. I urge my colleagues \nto support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to correct the record. The pending \namendment provides additional tax relief in the year 2002, $31 billion, \nand in 2003, $11 billion, but it also has over $400 billion in tax \nincreases compared to the resolution before us.\n  If we adopt this amendment, the net tax cut will boil down to not \n$1.6 trillion, not $1.1 trillion, which is where we ended up last \nnight, but a total of $746 billion. That means the President gets less \nthan half the tax cut he proposed.\n  There is a lot of spending. My colleagues on the Democratic side have \noffered $697 billion in new spending and higher taxes, now $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  The pending amendment raises taxes $418 billion over and above the \ntax increase we passed last night, which was $448 billion.\n  If my colleagues want a tax cut that is less than half of what the \nPresident proposed, adopt this amendment. I urge my colleagues to vote \nno on the underlying amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n202. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I had understood from the distinguished \nSenator who offered the next amendment there was no need to have a \nrollcall vote on it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If I may say, we have not yet cleared this on this side. \nWe are not prepared. I recommend we go to a quorum call.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we have order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 216\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 216) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

We have 2 minutes now on \nthe amendment of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist. \n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator can take his minute, but I \nwonder if we need a rollcall vote. We are willing to accept it.\n  Mr. FRIST. I would like a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I say to the Senator from Tennessee, if he can \naccept a voice vote, he will have strong support. If we have to go to a \nvote, he may lose the amendment.\n  We urge the Senator to think about the circumstance and to accept the \nvoice vote.\n  Mr. FRIST. I request a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had 154 amendments. We are never \ngoing to end this thing unless people cooperate a little bit. If the \nother side is worried about us getting out of here\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\ntomorrow, they had better start cooperating a little bit. There is no \nneed to have a vote on this amendment. We agree. We accept it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have done my best. I talked to \nSenators. He has requested a rollcall vote since early this afternoon. \nHe told me about it. We can waste more time talking about why he should \nnot get it than to go ahead and have the vote. Then we will get on to \nthe next one and do everything we can to avoid it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I recommend we move to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes equally divided on the \namendment of the Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have the concurrence of the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee and the ranking member of our \ncommittee that we set this amendment aside temporarily. I ask unanimous \nconsent that be the status of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I might just say to our colleagues, \nplease understand. We are set up to have 50 straight hours of voting \nunless people show a little restraint, a little discipline, and a \nlittle courtesy towards our colleagues. Please, let's not get into a \ncircumstance in which we spend the next 50 hours in this Chamber voting \nevery 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is now on the Corzine amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 346\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the situation is such that \nSenator Murkowski wants to offer a second degree. But I understand that \nwe want to handle that as we have handled other second-degree \namendments.\n  Is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That means they will have an amount of time to debate \nbetween them. It should be 2 minutes. It was going to be 1. Then we \nwill be able to vote on the two amendments side by side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will please report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) proposes an \n     amendment No. 346.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this amendment would raise the level of \nthe conservation spending cap to the statutory level of $1.76 billion \nin budget authority and $1.38 billion in outlays at 2002.\n  Last year, this cap was created through careful compromise in the \nInterior appropriations bill. It assures funding for certain high-\npriority conservation programs. Those include the Land and Water \nConservation Fund; National Park Service; management urban and \ncommunity forestry; State wildlife grants; Pacific coastal salmon \nrecovery; urban parks restoration; historic preservation; payment in \nlieu of taxes; and other important programs which provide funding to \nmaintain our national parks, provide funding to help support \ncommunities with large Federal land ownership, help create urban parks, \nassure the survival of the Pacific salmon, and many other worthwhile \nprojects.\n  Last year, we made a commitment to these programs. We should keep our \ncommitment to these programs and to our natural resources.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment. The amendment will \nrestore $50 billion in cuts included in the underlying resolution. The \namendment will fund priority environmental and natural resource energy \nconservation programs--programs such as brownfield restoration, \nwildfire prevention, sewer and water infrastructure programs, energy \nconservation and efficiency programs, and the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. These restorations are offset by reduced tax cuts \nand administrative savings.\n  The amendment also sets aside an additional $50 billion for debt \nreduction. I urge my colleagues to stand up for our legacy to future \ngenerations. I urge my colleagues to stand up for our environment and \nsupport the amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Murkowski amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me ask colleagues, we are going to \nhave to exercise discipline tonight or we are going to have chaos. This \nis just as clear as it can be. So, please, let's try to be quiet while \nSenators are speaking, and let's try to restrict debate so that we can \nfinish. The manager and I believe, given the fact that none of us have \nseen the amendment of the Senator from Alaska, that it would be \nappropriate to give him another minute to explain his amendment, and \nanother minute on the side of the Senator from New Jersey in response. \nWe ask unanimous consent for an additional minute for the Senator from \nAlaska and an additional minute for the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield time to the Senator from Texas \non the amendment that I have offered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the Corzine amendment spends another $46 \nbillion, adding to total spending in a budget which is now already \ngrossly bloated. Our Democrat colleagues in the last 2 days have in the \nprocess of adding spending, added $697 billion of new spending in their \namendments. That is more than the entire Government spent in the first \n150 years of our great Republic.\n  If anybody has any doubt as to what the two parties are about, all \nthey have to do is look at this spending orgy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Corzine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized for \na minute\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the short time we have had to look at the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Alaska, we recognize that \nit is quite good. It has $200 million to help fund CARA. It is ``CARA-\nlite,'' though.\n\n  What the Senator from New Jersey has done is recognize that there \nhave been tremendous cuts in this underlying budget in programs in \nwhich we all believe, not the least of which is arsenic in the water \nand all these things we talked about during the day.\n  We believe the amendment of the Senator from Alaska is very weak. It \nis about $50 billion weak. It does nothing to address the real problems \nthis country faces, and it does not reduce the debt.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished ranking member \nif\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nwe could let Senator Corzine have the first vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Alaska \nwas an amendment in the second degree. Normally that would be the first \nvote.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. So the amendment of the Senator from Alaska would \nnormally be considered as the first vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, that isn't true. Just a while ago we agreed to \na unanimous consent that they would be side-by-side amendments. That is \nnot a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. No. No.\n  Mr. CONRAD. But it is in the form of a second degree.\n  I think we have also in every one of these circumstances but one----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am not going to argue. We are going to vote for \nSenator Murkowski's first. I hope they vote for it because the \nalternative is going to be the Corzine amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might I ask that we take the Senator's vote on a voice \nvote? Would the Senator accept a voice vote?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We believe we have an agreement to go to a voice vote on \nthe amendment by the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n346.\n  The amendment (No. 346) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 257\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Corzine \namendment No. 257.\n  Mr. REID. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 46, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 77 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--54\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 257) was rejected.\n  Mr. GRAMM.

There are 2 minutes now on the Bond amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest that as to the Bond amendment, \nwhich is going to be discussed, and the Dodd-Collins amendment which \nfollows, we accept those two amendments. They are bipartisan. I am \nwilling to accept them, and we won't have to have votes. That means the \nnext vote will be on the Voinovich amendment, which is an appeal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we are willing to accept those mentioned \namendments as well, the Bond-Mikulski amendment and the Dodd-Collins \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this amendment, cosponsored by Senators \nMikulski, Lieberman, Allen, Bingaman, and Domenici, adds a very \nimportant $1.4 billion to function 250, the general science function.\n  Basic science research in this country is suffering because we have \nnot adequately funded the National Science Foundation in recent years. \nThe funding in this function leverages the research done in NIH and \nother areas. We believe it is extremely important. We expect that we \nare on a path for doubling the NSF budget in 5 years. This will put us \nback on the path.\n  I yield to my colleague from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the United States of America every year \nwins Nobel Prizes. We want to be sure that every year we win the global \nmarkets, as well as the Nobel Prizes. By doubling the National Science \nFoundation, by increasing funding for NASA and increasing funding for \nthe Department of Energy, we are making public investments in great \ncore science and engineering laboratories.\n  This is where we create the new ideas that lead to new products as \nwell as educate the next generation of Sally Rides, of other great \nscientists, the Dr. Varmuses who go on and lead our Nation. If we don't \nincrease the funding for the National Science Foundation, we are not \ngoing to have the mathematicians, the physicists, and the engineers we \nneed.\n  We are the greatest country in the world because we are willing to \ntake risks. We are the greatest country in the world because we are \ninventors and we are discoverers. Why don't we put our public money \nwhere our national values are? Let's pass the Bond-Mikulski amendment \nand take America right into the 21st century.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to proceed with the first of \nthose amendments, the Bond amendment No. 211.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n211.\n  The amendment (No. 211) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 322, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the Senator from \nMaine, we offer this amendment which restores some funding that is \nbeing cut for children's hospitals, as well as for the child care \ndevelopment block grant and the child abuse prevention programs. These \nmoneys total around $270 million, which gets us back to the level of \nfunding for this year. It is not beyond that at all. It just brings \nthese numbers up to the present year level.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine, who has worked tirelessly over the \nyears on this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues' support. I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his support, as well as my own ranking Democrat on the \nBudget Committee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are prepared to vote.\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The question is on agreeing to \nthe amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 322), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 288\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The next amendment is Senator Voinovich's appeal of the \nruling of the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment with my \ncolleagues, Senators Feingold, Gregg, and Domenici. This amendment we \nare offering helps to refine the procedures in the budget process that \nare designed to control spending. It is clear from the egregious levels \nof spending in the past couple of years that the existing process needs \nreinforcement. That is what this amendment does.\n  Our amendment is designed to tighten the enforcement of existing \nspending controls. To do this, we create an explicit point of order \nagainst the emergency spending that doesn't meet the definition for \nemergency spending as laid out by OMB.\n  The amendment also closes budget loopholes by creating a point of \norder against actions that raise the discretionary spending caps; \ncreating a point of order against efforts to waive sequesters, which is \na budget enforcement mechanism; and last, creating a point of order \nagainst directed scoring--in essence, telling OMB and CBO how to treat \nspending that others use in order to dodge spending limits. Any waiver \nof these measures will require 60 votes.\n  I urge my colleagues' support. It will guarantee that the budget \nprocess is more transparent.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senators Domenici and Gramm be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this is a nongermane amendment. As a \nresult, this is subject to a 60-vote point of order. This amendment has \nsome parts that are good, but, unfortunately, it also contains a fatal \nflaw. It would establish a 60-vote point of order against all emergency \ndesignations, both defense and nondefense. I don't think we want to set \na precedent here that we require supermajority points of order to \nrespond to a defense emergency or a natural disaster emergency.\n  I urge colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to the Senate we thank you very \nmuch for the way things are going. We very much appreciate your \nattention. We haven't had much disturbance or much talking on the \nfloor. For that, I thank each Senator on both sides of the aisle. We \nthank you very much for your cooperation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 54, the \nnays are 46. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of \norder is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we laid aside the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee, Mr. Frist. He will accept a voice \nvote. If we can proceed to that now, he will not ask for a rollcall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to publicly apologize to my friend \nfrom Tennessee for raising my voice to him and the rest of the Senate. \nI recognize being unreasonable is not only on one side of the aisle. I \napologize to the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 215\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, it is time for the world to wake up. We are \nconfronted today with the worst international health crisis in 600 \nyears: the international scourge of HIV/AIDS; 8,000 people died today, \n15,000 new infections today.\n  In Africa, the life expectancy in more than a handful of the \ncountries has been cut in half.\n  Currently, the United States spends about $500 million annually. Our \namendment increases that by $200 million next year, ultimately doubling \nour commitment.\n  The goal is simple: Reduce the devastation of the most significant \nmoral, humanitarian, and developmental challenges of our time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a year ago we joined together in the Senate \nwith Senator Helms as leader, and others in the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, to make a major effort with respect to the international \nAIDS program. President Bush and his security team the other day joined \nwhat President Clinton and his security team had found, which is that \nthis is an international security issue. It is a national security \nissue for the United States. I hope all of our colleagues will join \ntogether in restoring this critical funding that will deal with \nprevention, care, and treatment across the globe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the yeas and nays are \nvitiated.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The amendment (No. 215) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to reconsider the vote by which the amendment \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 225\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the next amendment is amendment No. 225 \noffered by the distinguished Senator Hollings. We have a second-degree \namendment we will offer, but we would like to treat them side by side \nas we have other amendments. Senator Hutchison of Texas will offer it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I didn't know about the second degree. I thought there \nwould not be a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is a simple amendment. It is an amendment about \nwhich the Senator feels strongly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I think the real point here is to send a message to the \nmarket, to the consumers, and to the people of this country that we \nfeel their pain. As the old expression goes around this town, we know \nthat we need an immediate stimulus to the economy to stop this \ndownturn. This is divorced entirely from the tax cut, divorced entirely \nfrom budgets for 10-year considerations. It is a 1-year immediate \nrepayment to the 95 million income-tax payers and another $500 to the \n25 million payroll-tax payers who\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\ndo not pay income tax for a total of 120 million, as recommended by \nHarvard Business School, Lester Thurow, the Concord Coalition, Business \nWeek, former Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin, the Economic Policy \nInstitute, and others.\n  This is the need. We have been going on and on about the tax cut for \nthe rich, poor, and everyone else.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 347\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk which \nadds language to the Hollings amendment that basically assures the \nmarriage penalty is fully repealed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 347.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     resolution, the revenue levels and other aggregates in this \n     resolution shall be adjusted to reflect an additional $69 \n     billion in revenue reductions for the period of fiscal years \n     2002 through 2011.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. It would add $69 billion to assure that there is a \nmarriage penalty elimination for this country. We have said we want to \neliminate it. Now is the time to do it. We want to add the amount we \nbelieve it will cost to fully eliminate the marriage penalty in this \ncountry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of \nthe Senator from Texas because after doing an analysis of the \namendments previously agreed to and passed, it is very clear that this \namendment will raid the Medicare trust fund. We can't accept an \namendment that would do that. I am asking colleagues to oppose this \namendment because it raids the Medicare trust fund in the years 2004, \n2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry: On whose time is the Senator from \nTexas proceeding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes allotted before each vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Texas already spoke.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator like another minute?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I don't think we exhausted the time. I spoke, but I \ndid not speak for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator had 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Chair explain this to Senators.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for 30 seconds to respond to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas spoke for 1 minute in \nopposition to the Hollings amendment. She is allowed 1 minute to speak \nin favor of her own amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I respectfully disagree with the \nnumbers that my colleague from North Dakota has given. We did not raid \nthe Medicare trust fund when we had $1.6 billion in tax cuts. Now we \nare talking about $1.1 billion or so, and we are adding $69 billion. \nThis is to eliminate the marriage penalty tax. We are squeezing down \nthe tax cuts and I do not want married couples in this country to think \nthat it is not important for us to eliminate the marriage penalty. We \nshould not penalize people for getting married. I hope you will vote \nfor my amendment, and I hope you will vote for the amendment of Senator \nHollings as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the budget resolution does not determine \nany specific tax policy. All of us know that. This does not eliminate \nthe marriage penalty or anything else. It simply adds $69 billion to \nthe tax cut, which raids the Medicare trust funds in each of the years \nI previously referenced.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The $69 billion will go to the marriage penalty \nbecause we will say so. I hope my colleagues will support elimination \nof the marriage penalty.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Hutchison \namendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 50, nays 50, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 79 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Mr. President, may I just inform Senators where we are. \nPeople would like to go home this evening. The next amendment is that \nof Senator Allen from Virginia. We have a minute; whoever opposes him \nhas a minute. The next amendment would be Senator Wellstone with \nreference to veterans spending, and we have a second-degree amendment \nto that. They will be voted side by side. If we can get those finished, \nthat is all we have lined up by way of votes.\n  We have an amendment on vote-arama and streamlining the process so we \nwon't get into these problems next year.\n  We should proceed with the votes we have: Senator Allen, to be \nfollowed by Wellstone and a second degree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to indicate to our colleagues and \nto the manager of the bill that there will be a second-degree amendment \nto Senator Allen's amendment as well, so everybody is on notice with \nrespect to how that amendment will be treated.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 201\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Brownback, Hutchison, \nCraig, Warner, and myself, the tax cut accelerator ensures that \nunexpected on-budget surpluses are used to accelerate tax cuts rather \nthan accelerate more Government spending. The tax relief accelerator \nprovides a tax relief insurance policy so that the Federal Government \nwill fulfill its promise to return excess tax collections to the \ntaxpayer. The tax cut accelerator does not touch Social Security or \nMedicare. It does not threaten funding for current programs. It allows \nus to set priorities in education, national defense, and scientific \nresearch.\n  It does hold the Government accountable to the American people, \nsetting priorities, determining the amount and type of tax relief, \ntaking action, and justifying our decisions to the American people.\n  I respectfully ask my colleagues to please say yes to the taxpayers \nof America and improve our economic vitality.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this amendment is a nongermane amendment. \nIt is subject to a 60-vote point of order. We have brought that order \nunder the Budget Act. I hope my colleagues will support that point of \norder.\n  This would require fully expedited procedures beyond even what \nreconciliation provides. I hope our colleagues will reject this \namendment on a point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I will address colleagues on my side for a \nmoment to say we still have 27 amendments pending. This would be a \nwonderful opportunity, while we are waiting to work things out, for \ncolleagues to come down and voluntarily give up their amendment in the \ninterest of the whole body. What a good way to end the evening, to have \na few more amendments given up so we could finish by our goal of 2:30 \ntomorrow afternoon.\n  I am making the offer. We will be here. We will be in business, and \nwe will be eagerly awaiting our colleagues who want to give up \namendments this evening.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I thank the distinguished Senator. I thank him \nfor his request on his side. I say to our side, we have 10 amendments. \nWe sure hope we can find some way to narrow that down to three or four. \nWe will be working with Senators when we finish tonight.\n  Let me tell Members what these amendments are: 289 is Crapo-Murray; \n237 is Grassley; 286, Santorum; 236, DeWine; 214, Collins; and four \nSmith amendments, 83, 46, 45, and 57.\n  We very much would like to get the list down to about three.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have been consulting on both sides of the \naisle as to how to complete action tonight and how we will begin in the \nmorning. I think everybody understands the best way to proceed at this \npoint. I ask consent the Wellstone amendment be laid aside and the \nSenator from Louisiana be recognized to offer a first-degree amendment; \nthat it be laid aside and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, offer a \nfirst-degree amendment; that no amendments be in order to these \namendments prior to the votes, and votes occur in relation to these \namendments, also in a stacked sequence, first in relation to the Breaux \namendment and then in relation to the Collins amendment.\n  I further ask consent the first vote tomorrow morning occur in \nrelation to the Wellstone amendment beginning at 9:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT. To clarify that, on the two I just outlined, the Collins \nand the Breaux amendments, those votes would occur tonight. Then \ntomorrow, of course, we would have the Wellstone amendment which would \nhave the parallel second-degree amendment to it also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Did the Senator from Minnesota object?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I object for right now. I want to try \nto understand a little bit further how we are proceeding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not object.\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I renew my request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to proceed, then, with the two \namendments. Of course, they would be 10-minute votes with a brief \nexplanation of the two amendments, a minute each.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 348\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I ask it \nbe reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux], for himself and \n     Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment numbered 348.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n           (Purpose: To increase funding for IDEA amendment)\n\n       At the appropriate place add:\n       Sec.  . Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     resolution, the spending aggregates, functional totals, \n     allocations, and other levels in this resolution shall be \n     adjusted to reflect an additional $70 billion in budget \n     authority and outlays for function 500 for the period of \n     fiscal years 2002 through 2011, and a reduction of $70 \n     billion in revenue reductions (and an increase of $70 billion \n     in total revenues) for the period of fiscal years 2002 \n     through 2011.\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, we have only a minute. For the sake of our \ncolleagues, this amendment simply takes $70 billion off the tax cut \nwhich is now at approximately a level of $1.275 trillion, I think. It \nsays that $70 billion is going to be used for education purposes, and \nthe purpose is to fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nIDEA; to put the money back where I think it is a high priority. This \namendment is offered on behalf of myself and Senator Jeffords who has \nbeen a long-time champion for the funding of the IDEA program.\n  This amendment does not take it out of the contingency fund. There is \nno more contingency fund. Remember the spectrum? Remember how many \ntimes we spent it? It is gone; agriculture and defense and everything \nelse ate it up. If you want the $70 billion, there is only one place to \nget it, and my amendment provides the one place to get it by reducing \nthe tax cuts. I ask my colleagues to support this effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I reserve the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Collins would like to offer an amendment. I \nthink that is the way we have been doing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 349\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Collins] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 349.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Propose: To provide tax credits for small business to purchase health \n insurance for their employees and to provide for the deductibility of \n  health insurance for the self-employed and those who don't receive \n     health insurance from their employers and for long-term care)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     resolution, the revenue levels and other aggregates in this \n     resolution shall be adjusted to reflect an additional $70 \n     billion in revenue reductions for the period of fiscal years \n     2002 through 2011.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first let me make clear that the \namendment I am offering does not change the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana. What it would do instead is add \nto the tax cut $70 billion in order to cover the following: A tax \ncredit for small businesses to help them purchase health insurance.\n  This is based on legislation that the Senator from Louisiana--the \nother Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu--and I recently introduced \nto address the problem of small businesses having a difficult time in \naffording health insurance for their employees. It would provide for \nfull deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed, an issue \nthat I know is something the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, and the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, have worked on. And it would provide \nfor long-term care insurance above the line deduction to help people \nand encourage them to purchase long-term care insurance.\n  The combined total of those provisions would be approximately $70 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That would bring the total tax cut to \napproximately $1.3 trillion.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, how much time is left in opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Maine?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opposition has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I might just take a minute in opposition to the Senator's \namendment. I have a great deal of respect for her, but I suggest the \nbudget authorization doesn't do any of those things. The respective \ncommittees that are going to be authorizing this will decide how it is \ngoing to be spent. While the list is a nice list, it has nothing to do \nwith reality because the Budget Committee does not make that decision. \nThe respective committees that had jurisdiction are going to make the \ndecision on how to spend the money.\n  Anyone can stand up and read a laudatory list of noble things, but \nthere is no assurance that will happen. I respect everything she said \nabout the intent, but the committee of jurisdiction has to make those \ndecisions. We do not make those decisions on the floor.\n  Our amendment, however, does provide $70 billion specifically for \neducation which allows that decision to be made. It does not come out \nof a nonexistent fund. That is the big difference.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have 1 minute in opposition to the \nBreaux amendment. Exactly the same argument is true with regard to the \nBreaux amendment.\n  Nothing in the Breaux amendment in any way requires that the money go \nfor the purpose he specifies. All his amendment does is basically \nreduce the tax cut by $70 billion and add it to spending. What Senator \nCollins has done is given us an opportunity as a Senate to go on record \nin favor of something we all claim we are for; that is, to provide $70 \nbillion for the purpose of making a health insurance tax credit for \nsmall business, so they can cover their employees, and to give \ndeductibility for health insurance.\n  I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana has 11 seconds.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I can only say in 11 seconds that it specifies it has to \nbe for education, and it comes out of the function 500. That is the \neducation function. It can't be used for anything else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment by the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 82 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n  The amendment (No. 348) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the \nHelsinki Commission, I take this opportunity to let my colleagues know \nthat on Sunday, April 8, Roma from around the world will commemorate \nthe 30th anniversary of the inaugural meeting of World Romani Congress. \nIn countries across Europe as well as in North America, Roma will \ngather together to demonstrate solidarity with each other and to draw \nattention to the human rights violations they continue to face.\n  Roma are a dispersed minority, present in virtually every country in \nthe region covered by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope, OSCE, including the United States. They first arrived in Europe \naround the 13th century, after migrating from Northern India and their \nlanguage, Romani, is related to Sanskrit. Roma were enslaved in what is \nnow modern Romania and Moldova until 1864 and, in much of the rest of \nEurope, the Romani experience has been marked by pronounced social \nexclusion.\n  The single most defining experience for Roma in the 20th century was \nthe Holocaust, known in Romani as the Porrajmos, the Devouring. During \nthe war itself, Roma were targeted for death by the Nazis based on \ntheir ethnicity. At least 23,000 Roma were brought to Auschwitz. Almost \nall of them perished in the gas chambers or from starvation, \nexhaustion, or disease.\n  Not quite a year ago, the Helsinki Commission, which I now chair, \nheld a hearing on Romani human rights issues. I heard from a panel of \nsix witnesses, four of whom were Romani, about the problems Roma \ncontinue to face. Unfortunately, since the fall of Communism, the \nsituation for Roma in many post-Communist countries has actually gotten \nworse. As Ina Zoon said, ``the defense of Roma rights in\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nEurope is probably one of the biggest failures of the human rights \nbattle in the last ten years.''\n  The more I learn about the plight of Roma, the more I am struck by \ncertain parallels with the experience of American Indians here in our \nown country. Increasingly, Roma have begun to raise their voices not in \nsearch of special treatment, but for an opportunity to freely exercise \ntheir human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination.\n  At the OSCE's Summit of Heads of State and Government, held in \nIstanbul in 1999, the United States strongly supported the commitment, \nadopted by all OSCE participating States, to adopt anti-discrimination \nlegislation to protect Roma. It is heartening that a number of Central \nEuropean governments, countries where Roma are the most numerous, have \npublicly recognized the need to adopt legislation that will protect \nRoma from the discrimination they face. The adoption last year of the \nEuropean Union's ``race directive'', which will require all current EU \nmember states, as well as applicant countries to adopt comprehensive \nanti-discrimination legislation, should spur this effort.\n  The Helsinki Commission will continue to monitor the plight of the \nRoma in the 107th Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3526-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CHINA RISKS FLUNKING INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS 101\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. Ralph Cossa, President of the Pacific Forum \nCSIS, which is based in Honolulu, recently published an insightful \nanalysis in the International Herald Tribune entitled ``Spy Plane Poses \nTest That Beijing Risks Flunking.'' I will ask unanimous consent that \nhis article be printed in the Record following my remarks, and I urge \nmy colleagues and Chinese officials to read carefully his article. A \nrecent colleague of Mr. Cossa's at CSIS, James Kelly, has been \nnominated by President Bush to be the Assistant Secretary of State for \nEast Asia and the Pacific.\n  The Center for Strategic and International Studies' pacific Forum has \na long history of both monitoring and working to improve relations \nbetween the United States and China. For this reason especially, Mr. \nCossa's analysis of the current crisis in American-Chinese relations is \nparticularly disturbing.\n  As Mr. Cossa points out, ``Beijing's automatic reaction to any mishap \nis to quickly incite anti-American sentiments. This is contrary to \nChina's stated desire to develop improved relations with Washington.''\n  He makes the point that some in China in the past have accused the \nUnited States of a ``Cold War mentality'' but that today it is China \n``that is demonstrating such a mindset in the way it has reacted to \nthis accident.''\n  Yesterday, Secretary of State Colin Powell expressed regret for the \ndeath of the Chinese pilot and has made suggestions to the Chinese on \nhow to resolve the current crisis and prevent further such incidents. \nNow it is time for China to respond with similar magnanimous gestures \nby releasing our air men and women and returning our aircraft. Any \nfurther delay may damage American-Chinese relations in an irreparable \nway.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the analysis to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the International Herald Tribune, Apr. 4, 2001]\n\n            Spy Plane Poses Test That Beijing Risks Flunking\n\n                          (By Ralph A. Cossa)\n\n       Honolulu--The collision between a Chinese fighter and an \n     American reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace \n     over the South China Sea is an unfortunate, unplanned, but \n     nonetheless important test of the maturity of both the \n     relationship between China and the United States. So far, \n     Beijing appears to be flunking the test.\n       The collision, about 70 miles southeast of China's Hainan \n     Island while the American plane was on a routine, unarmed \n     surveillance mission, was probably caused by overzealousness \n     on the part of the Chinese pilot.\n       Chinese jets routinely conduct intercept training against \n     such convenient American ``targets'' but have reportedly \n     become more aggressive, if not reckless, in recent months. \n     The rules of the road call for the faster, more maneuverable \n     Chinese F-8 jets that were involved in the collision to yield \n     to the slower, larger EP-3 propeller-driven aircraft.\n       China's immediate handling of the incident--to publicly \n     blame the United States even before the facts were known and \n     to protest the U.S. spy plane's ``violation'' of Chinese \n     airspace--was reminiscent of Beijing's handling of the \n     aftermath of the Belgrade bombing, which was immediately \n     branded a deliberate act. It seems that Beijing's automatic \n     reaction to any mishap is to quickly incite anti-American \n     sentiments. This is contrary to China's stated desire to \n     develop improved relations with Washington.\n       Equally disturbing was Chinese refusal to grant American \n     diplomats immediate access to the crew or to the plane, which \n     is loaded with sensitive surveillance equipment (although \n     much of it was no doubt destroyed by the crew before landing \n     at the Chinese airfield).\n       Will China, the self-proclaimed defender of national \n     sovereign rights, treat the plane as the piece of American \n     sovereign territory that it is, or--as it has already done, \n     according to some reports--board the plane and attempt to \n     exploit its sensitive equipment? How China behaves will be a \n     sign of just how important maintaining good relations with \n     Washington really are for Beijing.\n       Some elements in China have long accused the United States \n     of harboring a Cold War mentality. But it is China today that \n     is demonstrating such a mindset in the way it has reacted to \n     this accident. In his recent meeting with Deputy Prime \n     Minister Qian Qichen of China, President George W. Bush \n     pledged to treat the Chinese with respect. But respect must \n     work both ways. The longer the release of the crew members is \n     delayed, the more one must conclude that Mr. Qian's pledge to \n     cooperate with Washington was an empty promise.\n       Continued Chinese heavy-handedness will certainly result in \n     more calls for increased arms sales by Taiwan's supporters in \n     the United States. Any attempt by Beijing to trade the crew \n     or aircraft's release for a reduction in arms sales is sure \n     to backfire.\n       Poor handling of this incident by either side could result \n     in a serious setback in the broader relationship and would \n     magnify the impact of other decisions. Instead of merely \n     asserting that the other is to blame, both sides should agree \n     to cooperate in a full inquiry into the accident, aimed first \n     and foremost at ensuring that this type of tragedy does not \n     occur again.\n       The Chinese government should also ensure that a full, \n     fair, and objective accounting of what actually happened \n     reaches the Chinese people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3526-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3526]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            UND HOCKEY TEAM\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nrecognize the University of North Dakota's Hockey team. As a native \nNorth Dakotan, I am very proud of the rich hockey tradition at the \nUniversity of North Dakota. The defending NCAA Champion ``Fighting \nSioux'' defeated Michigan State in NCAA hockey's ``frozen four'' semi-\nfinal today in Albany, New York by a final score of 2-0. They will \ndefend their title Saturday at 4 p.m. in the national championship \ngame.\n  Dean Blais, the team's coach, has done a fantastic job in continuing \nthe UND hockey program's tradition of excellence. The ``Fighting \nSioux'' have won a total of 7 national championships. In just 6 years \nas head coach, Blais has led the team to four Western Collegiate Hockey \nAssociation regular season titles in the past five years and National \nchampionships in 1997 and 2000. Last year, the ``Fighting Sioux'' were \nhonored as the first collegiate hockey team ever invited to the White \nHouse.\n  The ``Fighting Sioux'' are led by Jeff Panzer, a Grand Forks, North \nDakota native who is nominated for the Hobey Baker Award, which \nrecognizes college hockey's top play. Panzer had 26 goals and 55 \nassists during the regular season and led the Nation in scoring with 81 \npoints. But at UND, teamwork and team spirit has always been a \nparamount, and the team's success this year has once against been the \nproduct of a team effort.\n  On behalf of the entire State of North Dakota, I wish the ``Fighting \nSioux'' the best of luck in the championship game on Saturday.

RICHARDSON PREYER, FORMER NORTH CAROLINA CONGRESSMAN AND \n                                 JUDGE\n\n Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to note with sadness \nthe death of a truly great North Carolinian and a great personal friend \nof mine, Richardson Preyer. Richardson Preyer succumbed to cancer on \nApril 3 at the age of 82 after a long and productive life serving the \npeople of North Carolina.\n  Many of you may remember Richardson Preyer from his distinguished \nservice in the House, but I'd like to share with you today a few things \nyou may not know about this truly inspirational North Carolinian.\n  Rich Preyer left his native Greensboro, NC as a young man to attend \ncollege at Princeton University and law school at Harvard. He served \nhonorably in World War II, earning a Bronze Star from the Navy for his \ncourage at Okinawa.\n  After the war, Rich could've chosen a lucrative career in the family \nbusiness, Vick Chemical, or made his mark and fortune in any number of \nfields. Instead, he dedicated his life to public service, and went on \nto become one of the finest, noblest servants of the public good my \nstate has ever known.\n  Richardson Preyer began his career in Greensboro as a municipal court \njudge before rising to the state Superior Court bench. In a landmark \n1957 decision, Judge Preyer courageously upheld a ruling that allowed \nfive African-American children to attend an all-white Greensboro \nschool. This marked the first time that black and white children would \nlearn together in a Greensboro school.\n  Rich's courage and his absolute respect for the law and for people \ncaught the eye of President John F. Kennedy, who named him to a U.S. \nDistrict Court judgship in 1961. Judge Preyer stepped down in 1963 to \nlaunch an unsuccessful bid for Governor.\n  Now, the early '60's were a contentious time in this country, \nparticularly in the South. Many people speculated that he could win the \ngovernor's race if he would just denounce school integration, but \nanyone who knew Richardson Preyer knows that he could never compromise \nhis principles for victory.\n  An unabashed optimist, Rich turned his loss into opportunity. Four \nyears after his defeat, he ran for Congress. Congressman Preyer went on \nto serve the people of North Carolina's 6th District for 6 terms, from \n1968 to 1980.\n  As a member of Congress, he won the respect of both Republicans and \nDemocrats for his dignity, intelligence and integrity. He chaired the \nHouse Select Committee on Ethics, crafting the Congressional code of \nethics. He also served on the House Select Committee on Assassinations, \nhelping to investigate the deaths of President Kennedy and Martin \nLuther King Jr.\n  Congressman Preyer left the House of Representatives in 1980. He and \nhis wife Emily returned home to Greensboro, where they continued to \ntouch the lives of so many in their community and in their state. I am \npersonally grateful to Rich for encouraging me during my Senate \ncampaign in 1998.\n  Richardson Preyer was truly a blessing to those of us who knew him, \nand to all the people of North Carolina. We will miss him deeply. Our \nprayers go out to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3527-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       TRIBUTE TO JOHN ``ANDY'' LOVE'S PROMOTION TO MAJOR GENERAL\n\n Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I want to recognize and \ncongratulate a special Coloradan, John A. Love, for his promotion to \nMajor General of the Colorado Air National Guard.\n  Just last week, on March 30, 2001, John Love, who is better known as \nAndy by his family and friends, earned his second star as a Major \nGeneral when the U.S. Senate unanimously approved his promotion. His \npromotion to Major General was Andy's 7th promotion since he first \nstarted his military career with the Colorado National Guard as a \nSecond Lieutenant on June 1st, 1968. I send my congratulations to Andy \nfrom the floor of the U.S. Senate for this well deserved promotion.\n  Major General Andy Love's roots run deep and true in Colorado. His \ndistinguished father, John Arthur Love, was elected to serve as the \nGovernor of Colorado three times. Governor Love was first elected \nGovernor in 1962 and served the people of Colorado well. Governor Love \nalso served as the Chairman of the National Governors' Conference from \n1969-1970. In 1972, his time as Governor ended when he was appointed by \nPresident Nixon to serve as our nation's first Director of the Energy \nPolicy Office, a predecessor of the U.S. Department of Energy.\n  In addition, Andy's sister, Rebecca Love Kourlis, currently serves \nthe people of Colorado as a Justice on the Colorado Supreme Court. \nOther members of the Love family have also served Colorado, and \ncontinue to serve to this day.\n  Major General Love's career with the Colorado Air National Guard has \ngone far beyond the ``one weekend a month, two weeks a year'' \ncommitment we usually think of when we think of this kind of service. \nFor the past 34 years, Andy has dedicated time every week, putting in \nmore than 2,500 flying hours. He did this to keep his skills as a \nfighter pilot sharp and current. Over the past 34 years he has mastered \nseveral generations of fighters, including the F-100, A-7 and F-16. \nAndy's proficiency and commitment has been underscored twice by his \nwinning the squadron's ``Top Gun'' award, and he won these distinctions \non two different fighter jets.\n  In his newest role, Major General Love serves as an assistant to the \ncommander of the Air Force Space Command and the director of Air \nNational Guard Forces at Peterson Air Force Base. He is responsible for \nadvising the commander on all issues impacting the Air National Guard \nand provides administrative oversight of assigned personnel. He also is \nslated with assuring the successful planning, programming and execution \nof the Guard's missions, including total force and space operations.\n  While serving our nation, and the state of Colorado, is an important \npart of Andy's active and busy life's work, it is important to point \nout that it is just one of numerous other important parts of his life. \nHe also has a civilian job as a Principal of Morrison, Love & Company.\n  For nearly 10 years, Andy has been married to a charming and \nsuccessful lady, Virginia Morrison Love. Not only is Virginia his \npartner in life, she is also one of Andy's key partners in his civilian \njob. Virginia's 15-plus years of government affairs experience and \naccumulated expertise enable her as a partner in her role as a \nPrincipal at Morrison, Love & Company. Her community service also \ndistinguishes her as one of Colorado's leading ladies.\n  Like his wife, Major General Love also has dedicated many hours to \ncommunity service. He serves as the Chairman of the Denver Health and \nHospital Foundation, as a member of Colorado's State Board of \nAgriculture and as a member of the Cherry Hills Planning and Zoning \nCommission, just to name a few.\n  In his free time, which I understand is quite limited due to his \npublic service and work and family commitments, Andy enjoys fly fishing \nand vigorous horseback riding. I understand that each summer, Andy sets \noff on a week-long pack trip along Colorado's Continental Divide with \nthe Roundup Riders of the Rockies.\n  Major General Love is an outstanding Coloradan and a patriotic \nAmerican. He has earned, and deserves, our appreciation and \napplause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3527-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3527-S3528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO SCARLET CROW\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute and \nrestore honor\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nto a Native American who contributed much to the expansion of our \nNation and the development of what would later become my home State of \nNorth Dakota.\n  After seeing an exhibit at the Library of Congress recently, I became \ninterested in learning more about the Native Americans who are buried \nin the Congressional Cemetery. Through my research, I came across the \nname of Scarlet Crow. Scarlet Crow, a member of the Wahpeton Sisseton \nSioux Tribe, died in Washington, DC., under mysterious circumstances in \n1867, and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery east of Capitol \nHill.\n  I learned from further research that Scarlet Crow's death certificate \nreported his cause of death to be suicide. But the facts reveal a \ndifferent, more tragic story.\n  In February 1867, Scarlet Crow left a family that included eight \nchildren to undertake a long journey from the Dakota Territory to \nWashington, DC. He was a tribal chief who came here to renegotiate a \ntreaty with the U.S. Government. He was, in fact, one of many Native \nAmericans who came to the Nation's capital in those days to negotiate \nin good faith, only to discover that the United States continued to \nmistreat Native Americans by forging agreements the Government \nsubsequently failed to honor.\n  Before his work here was done, tragedy struck. Scarlet Crow was \nreported missing on February 24th that year. Two weeks later, his body \nwas discovered near the Occoquan Bridge in Northern Virginia several \nmiles outside Washington. At first, his death was reported to be a \nsuicide. But investigators later described evidence that could not \nsupport that conclusion.\n  The mystery of what really happened to Scarlet Crow still remains. We \ndo know that criminal investigators pointed out that the cloth Scarlet \nCrow would have used to hang himself would not have supported a weight \nof more than 40 pounds. The branch from which he supposedly hung \nhimself would have broken under the weight of a small child, they said. \nIn addition, his blanket was folded neatly by his body, with no signs \nof a struggle. Despite this evidence, which might suggest that Scarlet \nCrow was murdered, there is no record that anyone followed up on the \ninvestigation. And today, Scarlet Crow's death certificate still lists \nsuicide as the cause of death.\n  There are no records to tell us when and how Scarlet Crow's family \nlearned of his death, or what happened to his family afterward. Records \ndo tell us, however, that he was an honorable and trustworthy man who \ndevoted his efforts to a peaceful life with the settlers who came to \ntame the great Midwest. He is described in one Government letter as an \nindustrious man who worked to promote agriculture among his fellow \nNative Americans. And at one time, it was reported that his ``laborious \nhabits had made him a prosperous farmer,'' a prosperity that was later \nlost during hostilities in 1862.\n  In 1916, Congress voted to provide a headstone for Scarlet Crow's \ngrave, at the request of North Dakota Senator Asle J. Gronna. Since \nthat action nearly a century ago, the memory of Scarlet Crow has been \nrelegated to obscurity.\n  The mysterious circumstances of Mr. Crow's death and the unusual \nstory about his burial in the Congressional Cemetery led me to visit \nthe cemetery recently to locate his tombstone.\n  The cemetery has fallen into some disrepair over the years and it is \nin some ways a rather forlorn place. Perhaps as we move forward with \nour planning for this year, Congress can find the resources to restore \ndignity to our Congressional Cemetery. In the meantime, I urge my \ncolleagues to find time to visit this cemetery. And while there, I hope \nyou will pause a moment in tribute to this dedicated Native American, \nScarlet Crow, whose life came to such a tragic and untimely end in our \nNation's capital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3528-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO SENATOR BUNNING\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate our \nfriend and colleague from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Senator \nBunning, on the occasion of his number being retired by the \nPhiladelphia Phillies.\n  On April 6, Senator Bunning's number, 14, will become only the fifth \nnumber to be retired in the franchise's 119-year history. The Senator \nfrom Kentucky will join fellow Hall of Famers Robin Roberts, Richie \nAshburn, Steve Carlton, and Mike Schmidt. The honor to be bestowed is \nfitting for the pitcher who led the majors in wins, innings and \nstrikeouts from 1955 to 1971.\n  This is one of many accolades in a distinguished career in \nprofessional athletics and public service. Senator Bunning was elected \nto the baseball Hall of Fame after a career in the Major Leagues which \nspanned seventeen seasons. At the time of his retirement from the big \nleagues in 1971, he ranked second only to the great Walter Johnson in \ncareer strikeouts with 2,855. The Senator is identified as an \n``intimidating right-handed sidearmer'' on his Hall of Fame plaque. His \nbrilliant career may have reached its pinnacle on June 21, 1964, \nFather's Day, when the father who has raised nine children threw a \nperfect game. With this feat Jim Bunning became the first pitcher in \nthe twentieth century to throw a no-hitter both in the National and \nAmerican leagues.\n  I have been fortunate enough to witness many of the distinguished \nSenator's accomplishments in public service. I first met Jim Bunning in \nthe House of Representatives in the 102nd Congress. My wife Karen also \nmet Mary Bunning, Jim's amazing wife and mother of those nine children. \nShe was Karen's big sister and continues to be a great friend to both \nof us. During the 103rd Congress I served with Jim on the Ways and \nMeans Committee. In 1998, the people of Kentucky elected Jim Bunning to \nthe U.S. Senate where I am proud to serve with him once again.\n  It is with great pleasure that I commend my friend and colleague, \nSenator Bunning, for his remarkable career as a Hall of Fame pitcher. I \nask my colleagues to join with me in congratulating him on this \nmilestone relative to his performance as a member of the Philadelphia \nPhillies. Once again quoting from the right-hander's Hall of Fame \nplaque, he has ``maintained dedication and consistency'' throughout his \ncareer as a Major League pitcher, as a member of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives and the U.S. Senate. His service is an example of \nexcellence for young and old, including his thirty-five grandchildren. \nI congratulate him and I applaud him for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3528-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3528-S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WILLIE LOUIS KING\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, Willie Louis King of Niagara \nFalls, NY, took seriously his role as citizen-activist and acted on the \ndemocratic ideals that many of us only talk about. To honor Mr. King's \nmemory, I ask that Ken Hamilton's eloquent tribute be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The tribute follows:\n\n                Willie King Walked to the Circle's Edge\n\n       I read Willie King's obituary, and it did not say enough. \n     One of the problems with obituaries is that they are hastily \n     written biographies of loved ones that attempt to convey to \n     the world ``who'' the individual was and ``whom'' they leave \n     to mourn. For most of us, that is fine, because our lives are \n     about the ``whos'' (ourselves) and ``whoms'' closest to us, \n     those who will mourn the end of our existence, as we know it.\n       More often than we know, many of those same people were \n     about much more than just ``who'' and ``whom,'' and their \n     lives are not simply measured in the many names that are \n     listed in the ``survived by'' paragraph of their obituaries. \n     Though their lives were not ideal, nonetheless, they lived \n     their lives based on ideals.\n       It was hard for the principled Willie King to change his \n     mind about the things he strongly believed in. He was a dyed-\n     in-the-wool Democratic committeeman, and I, a registered \n     Republican and former committeeman who believes, among other \n     things, that while party affiliation is a consideration, the \n     value of the person is more important.\n       We were members of the same church, but even there, our \n     encounters ended in political talk. Though Willie King and I \n     disagreed upon many issues, he was the one man I knew who \n     believed in one thing more than anything else in the world: \n     It was more than everyone's right to vote; it was their \n     responsibility to do so.\n       Perhaps it was his rural, southern upbringing and the \n     associated hardships and attitude that were endemic in a \n     then-segregated South, that led him to believe that ideal. He \n     often spoke, and was qualified to do so, of those who had \n     died--of all races--so that we might have that privilege. Yet \n     while the youthful Willie King endured inequity in the South, \n     the elder King believed in, and at every opportunity that he \n     had, practiced equality in the North.\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\n       I know this because, as expected, this dyed-in-the-wool \n     Democrat crossed racial lines and voted against me when I ran \n     for state Senate and boldly let me know that he did so. \n     Moreover, our mutual dear and tearful Italian friend, Tony \n     Mondi, called me to tell me of Willie's passing. In the \n     telling, he spoke of his last time seeing Willie.\n       It was Election Day, and Tony had talked to Zola, Willie's \n     wife, and found that Willie, who was rapidly succumbing to \n     the cancer that was ravaging his body, was too sick to go to \n     the polls to vote. As far as anyone knew, this would be the \n     first time that he would not exercise that privilege--no--\n     responsibility, that he so dearly believed in.\n       Hanging around campaign headquarters that day were a couple \n     of firefighters. Tony knowing how important it was to his \n     friend, talked to them about the situation. ``No \n     problem,'' they said. ``We'll go get him so that he can \n     vote.''\n       Tony called Zola, and all that she asked for was for 15 \n     minutes. Off they went, into the rain, to exercise the ideal. \n     Tony ``chauffeured'' his own big, black Cadillac, and the two \n     firefighters, Greg Colangelo and Rick Horn, went into the \n     house to ``pick up'' this man and ``carry'' him to the polls. \n     There was a wheelchair available, but Willie was not going to \n     have that! For as many years that he had voted, he had \n     proudly walked into the polls and done so. There would be no \n     prouder time for him than Tuesday, November 2, 1999. With all \n     of the strength that he, and all of his ancestors, could \n     muster, he again ``walked'' into those polls and voted--most \n     probably, straight across the line!\n       Yes, this one-time fruit picker, Willie King, one rainy \n     afternoon, dragging death behind him and carrying with him \n     the memories of counseling with great political leaders, \n     walked into the polls.\n       You know, I often hear people speak of others whom I have \n     never met, and whom I will never know, of how they gave their \n     lives for the ideal of democracy and our right to vote. These \n     heroes all stand together in a very special place in \n     history--Abraham, Martin, John, and others. On Nov. 12, as \n     Willie King slept, cared for by his beloved wife; those \n     heroes welcomed him, another King, to the edge of that very \n     special circle.\n       Therefore, next Election Day, I am interested in hearing \n     your excuse for knowing the issues, but not going out to \n     vote. Walk proudly into those polls.\n       Willie did.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3529-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                KARI WARBERG WINS ENTREPRENEURIAL AWARD\n\n Mr. DORGAN.

A bill for the relief of Gao Zhan; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation on behalf \nof myself, Senators Warner, Helms, Specter, Brownback, Feinstein and \nTim Hutchinson. This bill will grant citizenship to a Chinese woman, \nGao Zhan, who has been living in Virginia and is a researcher at \nAmerican University.\n  Early this year, Gao Zhan, her husband, Dong Hua Xue and their 5-\nyear-old son, Andrew, went to the People's Republic of China to visit \nthe parents of Gao Zhan and Dong Hua. On February 11, 2001, Gao, Dong \nHua, and Andrew were detained as they were leaving the People's \nRepublic of China. They were separated, blindfolded and taken \nincommunicado to unknown locations.\n  After 26 days of separated detention, Chinese authorities released \nDong Hua and Andrew. Dong Hua and Andrew returned to their home in \nVirginia. Gao Zhan has remained in a Chinese prison. We do not know \nwhere she is and no one has been permitted to visit her.\n  The U.S. Department of State has made over a dozen protests to the \ngovernment of the People's Republic of China about this matter but the \ngovernment of the People's Republic of China has refused to permit \naccess to Gao Zhan.\n  The requirements to become a U.S. citizen are: Establishing residency \nfor five years prior to application; Passing the INS test on U.S. \nhistory, government and language; Passing the FBI background \ninvestigation; and Taking the oath of renunciation and allegiance.\n  Gao Zhan and her husband, Dong Hua, have been permanent resident \naliens of the United States since September 28, 1993. They filed \napplications to become citizens on August 3, 1998. Their applications \nto become citizens were granted on November 24, 1999. The only step \nthat remained before they could become citizens was to take their oath \nof renunciation and allegiance.\n  Gao Zhan and Dong Hua had completed the first three of these \nrequirements before they visited the People's Republic of China. Last \nFriday, March 30, Dong Hua took his oath of renunciation and \nallegiance.\n  This legislation would permit Gao Zhan to become a U.S. citizen \nwithout her having to take the oath. In addition, the legislation \nprovides that the Attorney General may deliver the certificate \nindicating that Gao Zhan is a citizen to her husband if it cannot be \ndelivered personally to her.\n  This bill will be referred to the Subcommittee on Immigration of the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary. I have spoken with Senator \nBrownback, chairman of the Subcommittee, as well as Senator Feinstein \nranking member, and Senator Hatch, chairman of the full Committee, and \nurged them to move this bill as rapidly as possible.\n  The first step that will be taken by the Subcommittee on Immigration \nis to request a report on this case from the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, INS, which will provide the Subcommittee with a \nfactual record from which to operate. I have been told that this report \nmay take about two weeks to prepare.\n  When the Deputy Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China \nvisited the United States last month, President Bush raised the issue \nof Gao Zhan's continued detention and the refusal to permit officials \nof the U.S. government to visit her.\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell recently called for the release of \nGao Zhan on humanitarian grounds and criticized the People's Republic \nof China for holding Andrew, Gao Zhan's 5 year old son and a U.S. \ncitizen, without notifying our Embassy in Beijing as required by \ntreaty.\n  It has been reported that this past Tuesday, the People's Republic of \nChina formally accused Gao Zhan of ``accepting money from a foreign \nintelligence agency and participating in espionage activities in \nChina.'' If Gao Zhan is tried on this charge, she is likely to be \nconvicted and given a long prison sentence. China tries such security \ncases in secret and allows little chance for defendants to respond to \nthe charges.\n  I hope the introduction of this bill and its consideration by the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nwill improve Gao Zhan's conditions in the People's Republic of China, \nafford her protections and rights that she doesn't currently have as a \npermanent resident alien and hopefully lead to her release. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 702\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NATURALIZATION OF GAO ZHAN.\n\n       (a) Naturalization.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Attorney General shall naturalize Gao Zhan as a \n     citizen of the United States, without her being administered \n     the oath of renunciation and allegiance pursuant to section \n     337(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \n     1448(a)), not later than 5 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Certificate of Naturalization.--Not later than 5 days \n     after the date of naturalization under paragraph (1), an \n     appropriate official of the United States Government \n     designated by the Attorney General shall deliver to Gao Zhan \n     a certificate of naturalization prepared by the Attorney \n     General. If the Attorney General determines that delivery of \n     the certificate of naturalization cannot be made within the \n     period specified, the Attorney shall furnish the certificate \n     to Gao Zhan's spouse, Xue Donghua, on her behalf.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Kennedy, and \n        Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 703. A bill to extend the effective period of the consent of \nCongress to the interstate compact relating to the restoration of \nAtlantic salmon to the Connecticut River Basin and creating the \nConnecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \na bill to extend the authorization of the Connecticut River Atlantic \nSalmon Commission, CRASC, for an additional 20 years.\n  CRASC is a cooperative effort that includes multiple state and \nfederal agencies, conservation organizations, industry and citizens \nthroughout the Connecticut River basin. It was initially recognized by \nCongress in 1983. For the past twenty years, the Commission has been \nworking to restore Atlantic salmon and other anadromous fish \npopulations in the Connecticut River watershed.\n  The Connecticut River basin runs through the states of New Hampshire, \nVermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut. The native Atlantic salmon \nstocks declined through the 18th century, and disappeared from the \nConnecticut River and its tributaries in the 1800s. Since 1983, CRASC \nhas been successful in reintroducing the Atlantic salmon throughout the \nwatershed.\n  The success of the CRASC is due to the cooperative nature in which it \nruns. Without the support of all the stakeholders, the restoration \nefforts would be slower and more difficult. Restoration efforts include \nthe construction and maintenance of fish passage systems; salmon \nhatcheries and reintroduction; habitat restoration; research, \nmonitoring and evaluation; and education and public outreach. The \nhealth of the salmon population is directly related to the quality of \nthe river, and without these efforts, the two million people who live \nin the basin would be unable to enjoy the benefits that can be derived \nfrom a cleaner, healthier river system.\n  The legislation that I am introducing does two basic things. First, \nit reauthorizes the Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission for \nanother twenty years. Second, the bill authorizes $9 million in \nappropriations to the Secretary of the Interior through 2010 to carry \nout Atlantic salmon and anadromous fish restoration activities. The \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provides the Commission with just over \nhalf of its annual expenditures; however, the level of funding has not \nkept pace with needs. This authorization level would provide $5 million \na year to federal and state agencies for operations and maintenance \nneeds, and $4 million a year for construction and capital improvement \nneeds for the hatcheries and fish passage systems.\n  The Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon Commission is the perfect \nexample of federal and state agencies and the public working together \nto conserve our natural resources. In the past twenty years, this \ncooperative approach to conservation has resulted in the successful \nconservation of anadromous fish populations throughout the Connecticut \nRiver basin, as well as the improvement in the quality of the river and \nits tributaries. This kind of effort deserves the continued support of \nCongress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 704. A bill to prohibit the cloning of humans; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to \nprohibit the cloning of human beings. This bill, which is similar to \nthe bill I introduced in 1998, would be an outright ban on human \ncloning, whether publicly or privately funded.\n  My bill intends to prohibit human reproductive cloning in a \ncomprehensive manner. It includes a ban on the use of human and animal \ntissues for the purpose of creating a cloned human child. However, this \nbill does not address the prohibition of embryo cloning, nor does this \nbill extend to cloning technologies for animals or plants.\n  Though an executive order in 1997 banned the use of federal money for \nany project involving the cloning of humans, no law limits such \nresearch with private funds. And, though the Food and Drug \nAdministration has declared its authority to regulate human cloning, we \nhave very recently heard testimony before a House subcommittee stating \nthat several research groups are moving ahead in their experiments \nwithout such approval.\n  In addition to the moral dilemma this process presents, a recent \nTime/CNN poll shows 90 percent of the respondents think it is a bad \nidea to clone human beings. And, as a nation, we are not alone in \nrejecting both the notion and the practice of altering creation. There \nis broad international agreement that the cloning of human beings for \nreproductive purposes should be prohibited.\n  I am not a scientist and do not wish to insert myself in the process \nof scientific research and the advances from that research from which \nwe all benefit. However, when science and technology cross over the \nboundary of what is ethically and morally appropriate, I believe I have \nan obligation to respond on behalf of myself and my constituents. \nCongress, and its law-making authority, is the only mechanism available \nto assert the will of the American people that human cloning not go \nforward.\n  I believe now is the time to enact an immediate ban on such efforts \nbefore this research opens doors we will never be able to close.\n  I urge my colleagues to take swift action to impose a ban on human \ncloning. In doing so, we must ensure that the prohibition is \ncomprehensive, and covers all possible techniques in this rapidly \nadvancing field. We are all aware of the announced efforts to move \nforward with human cloning experiments so we must act quickly. I urge \nmy colleagues to work together so we can pass a bill to prevent these \nand future efforts to clone humans.\n  I thank the chair and ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 704\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Human Cloning Prohibition \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Human cloning procedure.--The term ``human cloning \n     procedure'' means--\n       (A) the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer or any other \n     cloning technique for the purpose of initiating or attempting \n     to initiate a human pregnancy;\n       (B) the implantation of a conceptus, blastocyst, or embryo \n     created through somatic cell nuclear transfer into a \n     mammalian uterus; or\n       (C) the creation of genetically identical siblings by \n     dividing a conceptus, blastocyst, or embryo for the purpose \n     of initiating or attempting to initiate a human pregnancy.\n       (2) Egg.--The term ``egg'' means a mature female germ cell \n     of any species.\n       (3) Oocyte.--The term ``oocyte'' means an immature female \n     germ cell of any species.\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\n       (4) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any individual, \n     partnership, firm, joint stock company, corporation, \n     association, trust, estate, or other legal entity.\n       (5) Somatic cell.--The term ``somatic cell'' means any \n     diploid cell of the human organism, including a cell of a \n     conceptus, embryo, fetus, child, or adult, not existing as a \n     haploid germ cell.\n       (6) Somatic cell nuclear transfer.--The term ``somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer'' means transferring the nucleus of a human \n     somatic cell into an oocyte or egg from which the nucleus has \n     been removed or rendered inert.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish programs \nto alleviate the nursing profession shortage, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nJeffords in introducing the Nurse Reinvestment Act. This legislation \nwill increase the number of nurses in our country, and also ensure that \nevery nurse in the field has the skills he or she needs to provide the \nquality care patients deserve.\n  We are in the midst of a serious nursing workforce shortage. Every \ntype of community, urban, suburban and rural, is touched by it. No \nsector of our health care system is immune to it. Across the country, \nhospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies and hospices are \nstruggling to find nurses to care for their patients. Patients in \nsearch of care have been denied admission to facilities and told that \nthere were ``no beds'' for them. Often there are beds, just not the \nnurses to care for the patients who would occupy them.\n  Our Nation has suffered from nursing shortages in the past. However, \nthis shortage is particularly severe because we are losing nurses at \nboth ends of the pipeline. Over the past five years, enrollment in \nentry-level nursing programs has declined by 20 percent. Lured to the \nlucrative jobs of the new economy, high school graduates are not \npursuing careers in nursing in the numbers they once had. Consequently, \nnurses under the age of 30 represent only 10 percent of the current \nworkforce. By 2010, 40 percent of the nursing workforce will be over \nthe age of 50, and nearing retirement. If these trends are not \nreversed, we stand to lose vast numbers of nurses at the same time that \nthey will be needed to care for the millions of baby boomers enrolling \nin Medicare.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act will support the recruitment of new \nstudents into our nation's nursing programs. The bill will fund \nnational and local public service announcements to enhance the profile \nof the nursing profession and encourage students to commit to a career \nin nursing. Our legislation will also expand school-to-career \npartnerships between health care facilities, nursing colleges, middle \nschools and high schools to show our youth the value of a nursing \ndegree.\n  Our legislation will ensure that barriers to higher education do not \ndissuade Americans who are interested in nursing from pursuing a degree \nin the field. The Nurse Reinvestment Act will support remedial \neducation for students who need help getting-up to speed on math, \nscience and medical English. Our legislation will also ensure that \nthere is support for single moms and dads with children who need a hand \nin daycare or a lift in getting to their classroom because they are \nwithout transportation.\n  In addition to recruiting new nurses, our legislation will reinvest \nin nurses who are already practicing by providing them with education \nand training at every step of the career ladder and at every health \ncare facility in which they work. It will ensure that nurses can obtain \nadvanced degrees, from a B.S. in Nursing to a PhD in Nursing. It will \nenable nurses to access the specialty training they require to learn \nhow to treat a specific disease or utilize a new piece of technology. \nOur bill will also help colleges and universities develop curriculum in \ngerontology and long-term care so that nursing students can pursue \nconcentrations, minors and majors in this growing field of health care \nand be ready to apply their knowledge to the current and future senior \npopulation.\n  To assist institutions in providing advanced education and training \nfor nurses across the career ladder, our bill will strengthen the \npartnerships between colleges of nursing and health care facilities. \nGrants will be available to support such initiatives as the teaching of \na courses in gerontology in the conference rooms of a hospital or \nnursing home. Grants will also support the use of distance learning \ntechnology to extend education and training to rural areas, and \nspecialty education and training to all areas.\n  The Nurse Reinvestment Act will authorize, for the first time in \nhistory, a National Nurse Service Corps. Separate from, though modeled \nafter, the National Health Service Corps, the NNSC will administer \nscholarships to students who commit to working in a health care \nfacility that is experiencing a shortage of nurses. In urban, suburban \nand rural communities across the country, where facilities turn away \npatients due to staff shortages, the NNSC will send qualified nurses to \nserve and provide the care that patients deserve.\n  Our legislation will place nursing students in hospital-based \nprograms on equal footing with medical students by enabling those \nnurses to obtain training in community health centers, federally \nqualified health centers and rural health clinics. To support nurse \neducation and training in non-hospital-based programs, which are not \neligible to bill Medicare for their training expenses, our bill \nestablishes a Dedicated Fund for Clinical Nurse Education. Home health \ncare agencies and hospices would be able to draw from the fund to \nestablish new or upgrade old training programs. Finally, the Nurse \nReinvestment Act will reauthorize the 1987 Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act's enhanced federal Medicaid match for clinical nurse \neducation and training in nursing homes. Under our bill, states will be \neligible to receive an enhanced federal match of 90 percent for the \ncosts of nurse education and training in nursing homes.\n  Our country boasts the best health care system in the world. But, \nthat health care system is being jeopardized by the shortage plaguing \nour nursing workforce. Indeed, state-of-the-art medical facilities are \nof no use if their beds go unfilled and their floors remain empty \nbecause the nurses needed to staff them are not available. The Nurse \nReinvestment Act not only seeks to increase the numbers of new nurses \nin our country, but also ensures that all nurses have the skills they \nneed to provide the high quality care that makes our health care system \nthe best in the world.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, in response to the nursing shortage, I \nam joining Senators Kerry, Hutchinson, Daschle, and other in \nintroducing the Nurse Reinvestment Act. Our legislation increases the \nnumber of qualified individuals entering the nursing profession and \nprovides them with the skills they need to provide care in the twenty-\nfirst century.\n  We are facing a looming crisis. There is a need to encourage more \ndedicated Americans to enter the profession, and to support them once \nthey are there. All facets of the health care system will have a role \nto play in ensuring a strong nursing workforce. Nurses, physicians, \nhospitals, nursing homes, academia, community organizations and state \nand federal governments all must accept responsibility and work towards \na solution.\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\n  Yet, the size of our nursing workforce is remaining stagnant, while \nits average age is increasing rapidly. In 1980, 53 percent of all \nnurses were under the age of 40. In 2000 that percentage dropped to 32 \npercent. In Vermont the numbers are even lower, where only 28 percent \nof nurses are under the age of 40.\n  The major medical advances of the nineteenth century were in the area \nof public health. The world population growing exponentially as we \nexpanded access to clean water, sanitary environments, and \nimmunization. Later, driven by numerous wars, the twentieth century saw \nadvances in surgery and clinical care for specific conditions. \nLikewise, pharmaceutical therapies have improved our ability to cure or \nmanage hundreds of diseases and conditions. All of these developments \nmean that more of us are living, and we are living longer.\n  This leads us to the twenty-first century, where I believe we will \nface the challenge of providing quality long-term care to the very \nelderly and the chronically ill. We know the population of people over \nthe age of 85 is growing and we know the ``Baby-boom'' generation is \napproaching retirement. Much of the care for this population will need \nto be provided by a skilled nursing workforce.\n  I would now like to enumerate some of the ways in which the Nurse \nReinvestment Act expands and improves the federal government's support \nof ``pipeline'' programs which maintain a strong talent pool and \ndevelop a workforce that can address the increasingly diverse needs of \nAmerica's population.\n  First and foremost, our legislation creates a National Nursing \nService Corps that provides scholarships to nursing schools in exchange \nfor a commitment to serve two years in a health facility determined to \nhave a critical shortage of nurses. We have developed this scholarship \nprogram to mirror the current Nursing Loan Repayment Program, and we \nspecify that these nursing scholarships shall be qualified as non-\ntaxable income.\n  The Act authorizes two new grant programs under the Health Resources \nand Service Administration's Division of Nursing. The first program, \nInitiatives to Combat Nursing Shortages, develops national, state, and \nlocal public service announcements to enhance the profile of nursing. \nIt conducts outreach at primary and secondary schools, and provides \nappropriate student support services to individuals from disadvantaged \nbackgrounds.\n  The second grant program, Initiatives to Strengthen the Nursing \nWorkforce, provides financial incentives for the pursuit of additional \neducation across the nursing career ladder. It also helps schools \ndevelop curriculums in gerontology, and establishes distance learning \npartnerships between schools and providers to improve access to care in \nunderserved communities. Such measures recognize the changes in the \ndelivery of care that nurses will face in the coming decades.\n  Finally, the Nurse Reinvestment Act expands and adjusts the Medicare \npayments for clinical nurse education to reimburse qualified hospitals \nfor the costs of training nurses in hospital-affiliated provider sites, \nsuch as federally qualified community health centers, rural health \nclinics, nursing homes, home health care agencies and hospices. Nurses \nwill therefore be able to receive their clinical training in the \nsettings in which they are increasingly likely to practice.\n  I am aware that there is other legislation being introduced today \nthat addresses the nursing shortage. I applaud that action. I believe \nthe numerous nursing bills demonstrate the deep congressional interest \nin reducing the nursing shortage, and the broad choice of policy \nproposals available. This is an issue that rises above partisanship and \nI anticipate that we will be able to work together to produce the very \nbest policy.\n  Adequate health care services cannot survive any further diminishing \nof the nursing workforce. All patients depend on the professional care \nof nurses, and we must make sure it will be there for them. Once again, \nI want to thank all my fellow cosponsors, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Nurse Reinvestment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO:\n  S. 707. A bill to provide grants for special environmental assistance \nfor the regulation of communities and habitat (``SEARCH grants'') to \nsmall communities; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nauthorize a national environmental grants program for small communities \ncalled Project SEARCH.\n  I am particularly excited about the proposal because with each \npassing month, I have been hearing from new interested partners in \nhelping with the legislation or have seen similar concepts advanced by \nothers. Because of our mutual interest in helping small communities \nrespond to environmental problems, I invite my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this measure.\n  The national Project SEARCH, Special Environmental Assistance for the \nRegulation of Communities and Habitat, concept is based on a pilot \nprogram that operated with great success in Idaho in 1999 and 2000. In \nshort, the bill establishes a simplified application process for \ncommunities with populations under 2,500 to receive assistance grants \nfor meeting a broad array of federal, state, or local environmental \nregulations. Grants would be available for initial feasibility studies, \nto address unanticipated costs arising during the course of a project, \nor when a community has been turned down or underfunded by traditional \nsources. The program would require no match from the recipients.\n  Some of the major highlights of the program are: A simplified \napplication process--no special grants coordinators required; No \nunsolicited bureaucratic intrusions into the decision-making process; \nCommunities must first have attempted to receive funds from traditional \nsources; It is open to studies or projects involving any environmental \nregulation; Applications are reviewed and approved by citizens panel of \nvolunteers; The panel chooses the number of recipients and size of \ngrants; The panel consists of volunteers representing all regions of \nthe state; and No local match is required to receive the SEARCH funds.\n  Over the past several years, it has become increasing apparent that \nsmall communities are having problems complying with environmental \nrules and regulations due primarily to lack of funding, not a \nwillingness to do so. They, like all of us, want clean water and air \nand a healthy natural environment. Sometimes, they simply cannot \nshoulder the financial burden with their limited resources.\n  In addition, small communities wishing to pursue unique collaborative \nefforts might be discouraged by grant administrators who prefer \nconformity. Some run into unexpected costs during a project and have \nborrowed and bonded to the maximum. Others are in critical habitat \nlocations and any project may have additional costs, which may not be \nrecognized by traditional financial sources. Still others just need \nhelp for the initial environmental feasibility study so they can \nidentify the most effective path forward.\n  With these needs in mind, in 1998, I was able to secure $1.3 million \nthrough the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, for a grant program \nfor Idaho's small communities. Idaho's program does not replace other \nfunding sources, but serves as a final resort when all other means have \nbeen exhausted.\n  The application process was simplified so that any small town mayor, \ncounty commissioner, sewer district chairman, or community leader could \nmanage it without hiring a professional grant writer. An independent \ncitizens committee with statewide representation was established to \nmake the selections and get the funds on the ground as quickly as \npossible. No bureaucratic or political intrusions were permitted.\n  Although the EPA subsequently insisted that grants be limited to \nwater and wastewater projects, forty-four communities in Idaho \nultimately applied, not including two that failed to meet the \neligibility requirements. Ultimately, twenty-one communities were \nawarded grants in several categories, and ranged in size from $9,000 to \n$319,000. Communities serving Native Americans and migrants, as well as \nseveral innovative collaborative efforts were included in the \nsuccessful applicants. The communities that were not selected are being \ngiven assistance in exploring other funding sources and other advice.\n\n[[Page S3536]]\n\n  The response and feedback from all participants has been \noverwhelmingly positive. Environmental officials from the state and EPA \nwho witnessed the process have stated that the process worked well and \nwas able to accomplish much on a volunteer basis. There was even \nextraordinary appreciation from other funding agencies because some \ncommunities they were not able to reach were provided funds for \nfeasibility studies. The only negative comments were from those who \nwished that the EPA had not limited the program to water and wastewater \nprojects.\n  The conclusion of all participants was that Project SEARCH is a \nprogram worthy of being expanded nationally. So many small communities \nin so many states can benefit from a program that assists underserved \nand often overlooked communities. This legislation provides us the \nopportunity to help small communities throughout the United States.\n  I have been encouraged by statements from regulatory officials at the \nfederal, state, and local level that have identified small communities \nas particularly in need of assistance in this area. Environmental \norganizations have also made favorable remarks about the importance of \nassisting small communities with the compliance costs of environmental \nregulations. Finally, I should also note that organizations \nrepresenting small towns and rural areas recognize this long overlooked \nproblem.\n  I invite my colleague to take this opportunity to assist small \ncommunities in each of their states. Although the grant program \nprovided for in this bill is not large in comparison to other things \nthe federal government funds, these resources could be put to good and \neffective use, as Idaho has proven. Moreover, I will remind everyone \nthat nowhere does this measure contemplate a change in environmental \nregulations or standards. This is simply about relief for small \ncommunities that would not otherwise be able to serve the public \ninterest or the environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 709. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe tax treatment of Alaska Native Settlement Trusts; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nStevens in introducing legislation that will allow Alaska Native \nCorporations to establish settlement trusts designed to promote the \nhealth, education, welfare and cultural heritage of Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. President, in 1987, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was \namended to permit Native Corporations to establish settlement trusts to \nhold lands and investments for the benefit of current and future \ngenerations of Alaska Natives. Assets in these trusts are insulated \nfrom business exposure and risks and can be invested to provide \ndistributions of income to Native shareholders and their future \ngenerations.\n  Although the 1987 amendments were designed to facilitate the \ndevelopment of settlement trusts, many Native Corporations have been \nstymied in their efforts because the tax law, in many cases, imposes \nonerous penalties on the Native shareholders when the trusts are \ncreated. For example, when assets are transferred to the trust, they \nare treated as a de facto distribution of assets directly to the \nshareholders themselves to the extent of the corporation's earnings and \nprofits.\n  Even though the current shareholders receive no actual income at the \ntime of the transfer into the trust, they are liable for income taxes \nas if they received an actual distribution. This not only requires the \nshareholder to come up with money to pay taxes on a distribution he or \nshe never received, but also can result in a situation where a trust \nfund beneficiary is required to prepay taxes on his share of the entire \ntrust corpus, which may be substantially more in taxes than the amount \nof cash benefits he or she will actually receive in the future.\n  Our legislation remedies this inequity by allowing an Alaska Native \nCorporation to transfer property to an electing trust without tax to \nthe beneficiaries. Electing trusts would annually pay tax on their and \nfuture distributions to beneficiaries would be taxable only to the \nextent such distributions exceeded the taxable income of the trust in \nthat year and all prior years for which an election was in effect.\n  Alaska Native Corporations are unique entities. Unlike Native \nAmerican tribes in the lower 48, Alaska Native corporations are subject \nto income tax. But unlike ordinary C corporations, Alaska Native \ncorporations have diverse purposes, one of which is to preserve and \nprotect the heritage of the Native shareholders. The settlement trust \nconcept is well suited to the special needs of Alaska's Natives. As the \nConference Committee Report to ANSCA amendments of 1987 stated:\n  ``Trust distributions may be used to fight poverty, provide food, \nshelter and clothing and served comparable economic welfare purposes. \nAdditionally, cash distributions of trust income may be made on an \nacross-the-board basis to the beneficiary population as part of the \neconomic welfare function.''\n  Settlement trusts will ensure that for generations to come, Native \nAlaskans will have a steady stream of income on which to continue \nbuilding an economic base. The current tax rules discourage the \ncreation of such trusts with the result that Native corporations are \nunder extreme pressure to distribute all current earnings rather than \nprudently reinvesting for the future.\n  It is my hope that we will be able to see this legislation adopted \ninto law this year. For the long-term benefit of Alaska Natives, this \ntax law change is fundamentally necessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 709\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require coverage for colorectal cancer screenings; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the ``Eliminate \nColorectal Cancer Act of 2001''. I am pleased to have my colleague, \nSenator Helms, as the leading co-sponsor of this important legislation.\n  Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths among \nmen and women in America. Over 50,000 Americans will die of this \ndisease this year alone.\n  The good news on colorectal cancer is that if it is detected early, \nwe can dramatically improve the chance of survival. We have tried and \ntrue screening techniques that can not only discover this cancer early, \nbut can prevent this disease by finding and eliminating growths before \nthey become cancerous.\n  The tragedy is that too often Americans do not get these lifesaving \nscreenings. Today, only one-third of those at-risk for colorectal \ncancer are screened--and screening rates for minorities and women are \neven lower. All Americans age 50 and over should be screened for this \ndisease, and there are many at increased risk who may need to start \nscreening even earlier.\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n  Some are simply not aware they should be screened and others cannot \nafford to get this lifesaving test. We must work together for the day \nwhen no American is denied access to these lifesaving screening \nprocedures simply because their health insurance company would not foot \nthe bill.\n  Medicare offers this important benefit. Now it's time that every \nAmerican has that same assurance.\n  That is why this week we are introducing ``The Eliminate Colorectal \nCancer Act of 2001'', bipartisan legislation that will ensure that all \nhealth insurance covers screening procedures that can discover \ncolorectal cancer in its earliest and most treatable stages.\n  I am pleased that Representative Slaughter and Representative Morella \nare offering a similar bipartisan bill in the House, and I express my \nappreciation of so many from the cancer community on this legislation \nover the past couple of years.\n  In this case, an ounce of prevention brings a lifesaving cure that \ncould save tens of thousands of lives this year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the ``Eliminate Colorectal \nCancer Act of 2001'' be printed in the Record with a bill summary.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 710\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Each year, more than 56,000 \n     Americans die from this devastating disease, yet colorectal \n     cancer can be easily prevented or treated when it is \n     diagnosed early through regular, appropriate screening tests. \n     Unfortunately, only one-third of the at-risk United States \n     population is currently screened for colorectal cancer. In \n     the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, Congress acted to encourage \n     more screening by creating a new colorectal cancer screening \n     benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. We believe the time has \n     come for persons under age 65.\n       The Eliminate Colorectal Cancer Act of 2001 would require \n     all health insurance plans to cover colorectal cancer \n     screening for all patients age 50 and over and for others who \n     have significant risk factors for the disease. The screening \n     method and frequency of the test would be based on the \n     patient's medical condition and decided by the treating \n     physician, in consultation with the patient. Methods covered \n     under the Act are those that are available under Medicare.\n       As colorectal cancer survivors in every state will attest, \n     early detection and treatment are essential to winning this \n     battle. More than 90 percent of people whose colorectal \n     cancer is detected and treated early are able to resume \n     active and productive lives.\n       This legislation is strongly supported by these and many \n     other leading organizations:\n       American Cancer Society, American Gastroenterological \n     Association, Cancer Research Foundation of America, American \n     Association for Clinical Chemistry, Digestive Disease \n     National Coalition, Association of Community Cancer Centers, \n     American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging, \n     American College of Gastroenterology, American Society for \n     Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, Colon Cancer Alliance, Hereditary \n     Colon Cancer Association, Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of \n     America, Men's Health Network, Cancercare, Society for \n     Gastroenterological Nurses and Associates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 711. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to maintain \nexemption of Alaska from dyeing requirements for exempt diesel fuel and \nkerosene; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senator Ted \nStevens in introducing legislation that would clarify a provision in \nthe tax code that exempts the State of Alaska from the IRS diesel \ndyeing rules.\n  The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 included a provision \nthat exempted Alaska from the diesel dyeing requirements during the \nperiod the state was exempted from the Clean Air Act low sulfur diesel \ndyeing rules. For various reasons, it was believed at the time that \nAlaska would ultimately be permanently exempted from the Clean Air Act \nrules. However, technological changes suggest that Alaska may in the \nnext few years lose its exemption from the low sulfur rules.\n  However, in our view, whether Alaska is exempted from the low sulfur \nrules, it is imperative that Alaska be permanently exempted from the \nIRS diesel dyeing rules. That is what our bill does.\n  Today, more than 95 percent of all diesel fuel used in Alaska is \nexempt from tax because it is used for heating, power generation, or in \ncommercial fishing boats. Under the diesel dyeing rules in place in 49 \nstates, exempt diesel must be dyed. If these diesel dyeing rules were \napplied to Alaska, refiners would have to buy huge quantities of dye, \nalong with expensive injection systems, to dye all of this non-taxable \ndiesel fuel.\n  Although the Joint Tax Committee originally estimated in 1996 that \nrepealing the dyeing rules for Alaska could cost the Treasury $500,000 \na year, some refiners were spending as much as $750,000 on dye alone. \nAdd on another $100,000 for injection systems and you begin to wonder \nwhat happened to common sense regulation. Congress saw it that way and \ndecided to exempt Alaska. Now that exemption should be made permanent.\n  Approximately 65 percent of the state's communities are served solely \nby barges. For many of these communities, the fuel oil barge comes in \nonly once a year when the waterways are not frozen. It is absurd to \nrequire these communities to build a second storage facility for undyed \ntaxable fuel simply for the few vehicles in town that are subject to \ntax.\n  It is currently projected that the state will have to spend from $200 \nmillion to $400 million just to repair fuel storage tanks in hundreds \nof rural communities because of leaking fuel problems. If IRS dyeing \nrules were in place, millions more would have to be spent simply to \nmaintain a small supply of taxable diesel in each of these communities.\n  In 1996, Congress acted sensibly in exempting Alaska from the IRS \ndiesel dyeing rules. It is my hope that we will again see the wisdom of \nexempting Alaska, this time making it a permanent exemption.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 711\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit commercial air tour operations over \nYellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprotect two crown jewels of the National Park Service, Yellowstone and \nGrand Teton National Parks.\n  The ``Yellowstone and Teton Scenic Overflight Act of 2001'' is \nsimilar to legislation I introduced last Congress regarding an \nimportant issue facing these two parks. Specifically, this legislation \nwould prohibit all scenic flights--both fixed wing and helicopter--over \nYellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks. Recently, a proposed scenic \nhelicopter tour operation near Grand Teton had many folks concerned \nabout the impact its operations would have on these magnificent areas.\n  This legislation is designed to protect Yellowstone and Teton and the \nnatural and historic values of these parks in the interest of all who \nvisit and enjoy these areas. I am aware of that the National Parks Air \nTour Management Act, which became law during the 106th Congress, \nprovides a process that attempts to address scenic overflight \noperations in our parks. Unfortunately, the regulations being developed \nfor the Act continue to be delayed and it is unclear when they will \nultimately be published. The unique nature of Yellowstone and Teton \nparks requires us to act in a quick and decisive manner to address this \nissue as soon as possible.\n  Grand Teton National Park is home to the only airport in the \ncontinental United States that is entirely within a national park. \nCommercial air tours by their very nature, fly passengers purposefully \nover the parks, at low altitudes, often to the very locations and \nattractions favored by ground-based visitors. The threats posed by \nthese operations to Yellowstone and Teton require our quick action.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee's Subcommittee on National \nParks and Historic Preservation, I understand the importance of our \nnation's parks. They are our national treasures and deserve to be \nprotected to the best of our ability. I hope the\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nSenate will take quick action on this legislation so that visitors can \nenjoy the sounds of nature at Grand Teton and Yellowstone National \nParks now and in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 713. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na charitable deduction for certain expenses incurred in support of \nNative Alaskan subsistence whaling; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nStevens to introduce legislation that would resolve a dispute that has \nexisted for several years between the IRS and native whaling captains \nin my state. Our legislation would amend the Internal Revenue Code to \nensure that a charitable donation tax deduction would be allowed for \nnative whaling captains who organize and support subsistence whaling \nactivities in their communities.\n  Subsistence whaling is a necessity to the Alaska Native community. In \nmany of our remote village communities, the whale hunt is a tradition \nthat has been carried on for generations over many millennia. It is the \ncustom that the captain of the hunt make all provisions for the meals, \nwages and equipment costs associated with this important activity.\n  In most instances, the Captain is repaid in whale meat and muktuck, \nwhich is blubber and skin. However, as part of the tradition, the \nCaptain is required to donate a substantial portion of the whale to his \nvillage in order to help the community survive.\n  The proposed deduction would allow the Captain to deduct up to $7,500 \nto help defray the costs associated with providing this community \nservice.\n  I want to point out that if the Captain incurred all of these \nexpenses and then donated the whale meat to a local charitable \norganization, the Captain would almost certainly be able to deduct the \ncosts he incurred in outfitting the boat for the charitable purpose. \nHowever, the cultural significance of the Captain's sharing the whale \nwith the community would be lost.\n  This is a very modest effort to allow the Congress to recognize the \nimportance of this part of our native Alaskan tradition. When this \nmeasure passed the Senate two years ago, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation estimated that this provision would cost a mere three million \ndollars over a 10 year period. I think that is a very small price for \npreserving this vital link with our natives' heritage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 713\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to urge the United States Trade Representative to \npursue the establishment of a small business advocate within the World \nTrade Organization, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to promote export opportunities for our nation's small \nbusinesses.\n  Nationwide, an estimated 13 to 16 million small businesses account \nfor over 99 percent of all employers. They also employ over 50 percent \nof the workforce, and account for virtually all of the new jobs being \ncreated. Maine, in particular, is a state with a historical record of \nself-reliance and small business enterprise. Of the roughly 37,000 \nemployers, about 97 percent are small firms. Maine also boasts an \nestimated 73,000 self-employed persons. Surveys credit small businesses \nwith virtually all of the new job creation in the state as well.\n  In addition, small firms played a central role in the latest economic \nexpansion. From 1992 to 1996, for example, small firms created 75 \npercent of the new jobs, up 10.5 percent, while large company \nemployment grew only 3.7 percent. In the trade arena, according to the \nU.S. Small Business Administration, SBA, the number of small U.S. firms \nengaged in exporting has tripled since 1987, and over the past five \nyears, the dollar value of small business exports has grown 300 \npercent. Small business now accounts for 31 percent of the value of \nU.S. exports. Overall, 97 percent of all exporters are small \nbusinesses, with the most dramatic export growth among companies \nemploying less than 20 people. Firms engaged in international trade are \n20 percent more productive, and employee wages are 15 percent higher in \nfirms that trade as compared to firms that do not engage in trade. \nThese firms are also 9 percent less likely to go bankrupt, and \nexperience 20 percent greater job growth than non-traders.\n  Despite these impressive statistics, less than one percent of U.S. \nsmall businesses are engaged in international trade-related business \nactivities. That is why I believe so strongly that there is substantial \nexport potential in the small business community that has yet to be \nfully realized.\n  Small and medium-sized businesses are the fastest growing segment of \nthe international business community. However, many report that their \ninterests have not been given sufficient attention by our international \ntrade negotiators. In addition, small businesses often cannot afford to \nmaintain in-house international trade expertise to resolve complex \ntrade problems. Small business advocacy groups often lack political \ninfluence in foreign markets, which hinders solving problems outside of \nthe legal process. Small firms often do not have the sales volume to \novercome the costs of trade barriers and substantial overhead expenses \nin international transactions.\n  With these concerns in mind, in January, I introduced the Small \nBusiness Enhancement Act of 2001, which contains a provision to \nestablish the position of Assistant United Trade Representative for \nSmall Business. I believe that this important step would ensure that \nsmall businesses have a seat at the table when international trade \nagreements are being negotiated.\n  The measure I am introducing today takes this concept one step \nfurther by expressing the sense of the Senate that the United States \nTrade Representative, USTR, should pursue the establishment of a small \nbusiness advocate within the World Trade Organization, WTO, as a matter \nof U.S. policy.\n  Because the WTO is the principal international organization for rules \ngoverning world-wide international trade, it has the potential to \naddress a range of global trade issues of concern to small businesses \nin the U.S. In addition, it stands to reason that better coordination \nis needed between small business support and advocacy agencies around \nthe world and small firms and trade associations.\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\n  My bill requires the USTR to pursue the establishment of a small \nbusiness advocate at the WTO in order to safeguard the interests of \nsmall firms and represent those interests in trade negotiations and \ndisputes. It also directs the USTR to submit a report to Congress on \nthe steps taken to establish this advocate.\n  I hope this legislation will provide a foundation for small \nbusinesses during the next round of WTO negotiations. I look forward to \nworking with the Senate Small Business Committee and the Senate Finance \nCommittee as we work to ensure that U.S. businesses enjoy the full \nbenefits of international trade.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 715.

Considered by many youths to be a casual, soft-core drug with few \nlasting effects. They couldn't be more wrong. Meth can actually cause \nmore long-term damage to the body than cocaine or crack. The physical \ndamage is just the beginning. The societal damage resulting from \nrampant meth use is incalculable. The damage caused ranges from broken \nhomes to violent crime such as increased child abuse to a higher \nrobbery rate.\n  Meth use in Montana alone has skyrocketed in the past few years. \nDuring 1996, 1 meth lab was seized statewide, 4 in 1997, twelve in \n1998, 50 in 1999, 100 in 2000, and at least 150 expected this year. The \nDEA reported an increase of meth lab seizures in Montana of 900 percent \nfrom 1993 to 1998. And according to the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, based on admission rates per 100,000 persons, Montana is one of \nthe eight states with a ``serious methamphetamine problem.''\n  The meth problem is particularly severe on Montana's Indian \nreservations, of which our state has seven. Life is hard there. In some \nreservation towns, over half of the working age adults are unemployed. \nBecause meth is cheap and relatively easy to make, these lower-income \nindividuals are a natural target for meth peddlers. Without viable \nemployment options, too often these young people turn to drugs.\n  So how does a rural state like Montana deal with such a scourge? The \nanswer is not very well. The fact is, there are a good many talented \nMontanans working on the meth problem, but they have few resources with \nwhich to wage the battle. Fewer every day with no options for \nleveraging additional resources. Moreover, their efforts are often \nfragmented, not coordinated to the extent they could be, particularly \namong the treatment, prevention, and law enforcement communities. \nAgain, it's simply an issue of scarcity of resources.\n  To make their job easier, Montana has petitioned to be considered \npart of the Rocky Mountain High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area \n(HIDTA). Although the Rocky Mountain HIDTA authorities have stated \ntheir willingness to include Montana in its organization, they lack the \nresources to make that happen.\n  The bill I am introducing today would authorize funding to make \nMontana's admission to the Rocky Mountain HIDTA a reality. This \nlegislation would provide Montana the resources to put forth a \ncoordinated effort in the fight against meth in Montana. By admitting \nthe seven counties included in the legislation, we begin to attack the \nscourge at its roots-where it enters the state and is the most \nproblematic for meth use. In a perfect world, we could include all 56 \nMontana counties, but I believe this is a good start. It will increase \nlaw enforcement and forensic personnel in Montana; coordinate efforts \nto exchange information among law enforcement agencies; and engage in a \npublic information campaign to educate the public about the dangers of \nmeth use.\n  Mr. President, the time has come to fight this scourge. Montana is \nunder siege by meth, and we must do all we can to continue our efforts \nto stop it.\n           By Mr. SANTORUM:\n       S. 716. A bill to amend the Consolidated Farm and Rural \n     Development Act to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to \n     make grants to nonprofit organizations to finance the \n     construction, refurbishing, and servicing of individually-\n     owned household water well systems in rural areas for \n     individuals with low or moderate incomes; to the Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2001.'' I am pleased to reintroduce \nthis bill in the 107th Congress as I believe it sets out an innovative \napproach to meet the safe drinking water needs of rural Americans \nnationwide.\n  The Affordable Drinking Water Act of 2001 provides a targeted \nalternative to water delivery in rural areas. Low to moderate income \nhouseholds who would prefer to have their own well, or are experiencing \ndrinking water problems, could secure financing to install or refurbish \nan individually owned household well. In my home state of Pennsylvania, \n2.5 million citizens currently choose to have their drinking water \nsupplied by privately-owned individual water wells.\n  The approach envisioned under this bill would establish a partnership \nbetween the federal government and non-profit entities to administer \ngrants to eligible homeowners for the purposes of: bringing old \nhousehold water wells up to current standards; replacing systems that \nhave met their expected life; or providing homeowners without a \ndrinking water source with a new individual household water well \nsystem.\n  Another important component of this legislation will afford rural \nconsumers with individually owned water wells the same payment \nflexibility as other utility customers. Centralized water systems \ncurrently are eligible to receive federal grants and loans with \nrepayment spread out over 40 years. The Affordable Drinking Water Act \nof 2001 would provide loans to low to moderate income homeowners to \nupgrade or install a household drinking water well now, and then repay \nthe cost through monthly installments. This ability to stretch out \npayments over the life of the loan gives rural well owners an \naffordable option that they otherwise do not have.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this legislation today, and \nbelieve that it is appropriately balanced to meet the safe-drinking \nwater needs of rural households.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 717. A bill to provide educational opportunities for disadvantaged \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to \nauthorize a three-year nationwide school choice demonstration program \ntargeted at children from economically disadvantaged families. The \nprogram would expand educational opportunities for low-income children \nby providing parents and students the freedom to choose the best school \nfor their unique academic needs, while encouraging schools to be \ncreative and responsive to the needs of all students.\n  This bill authorizes $1.8 billion annually for fiscal years 2002 \nthrough 2004 to be used to provide school choice vouchers to \neconomically disadvantaged children through the nation. The funds would \nbe divided among the states based upon the number of children they have \nenrolled in public schools. Then, each state would conduct a lottery \namong low-income children who attend the public schools with the lowest \nacademic performance in their state. Each child selected in the lottery \nwould receive $2,000 per year for three years to be used to pay tuition \nat any school of their choice in the state, including private or \nreligious schools. The money could also be used to pay for \ntransportation to the school or supplementary educational services to \nmeet the unique needs of the individual student.\n  In total, this bill authorizes $5.4 billion for the three-year school \nchoice demonstration program, as well as a GAO evaluation of the \nprogram upon its completion. The cost of this important test of school \nvouchers is fully offset by eliminating more than $5.4 billion in \nunnecessary pork and inequitable corporate tax loopholes.\n  Mr. President, we all know that one of the most important issues \nfacing our nation is the education of our children. Providing a solid, \nquality education for each and every child in our nation is a critical \ncomponent in their quest for\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\npersonal success and fulfillment. A solid education for our children \nalso plays a pivotal role in the success of our nation; economically, \nintellectually, civically and morally.\n  We must strive to develop and implement initiatives which strengthen \nand improve our education system thereby ensuring that our children are \nprovided with the essential academic tools for succeeding \nprofessionally, economically and personally. I am sure we all agree \nthat increasing the academic performance and skills of all our nation's \nstudents must be the paramount goal of any education reform we \nimplement.\n  School vouchers are a viable method of allowing all American children \naccess to high quality schools, including private and religious \nschools. Every parent should be able to obtain the highest quality \neducation for their children, not just the wealthy. Tuition vouchers \nwould finally provide low-income children trapped in mediocre, or \nworse, schools the same educational choices as children of economic \nprivilege.\n  Some of my colleagues may argue that vouchers would divert money away \nfrom our nation's public schools and instead of instilling competition \ninto our school systems we should be pouring more and more money into \npoor performing public schools. I respectfully disagree. While I \nsupport strengthening financial support for education in our nation, \nthe solution to what ails our system is not simply pouring more and \nmore money into it.\n  Currently our nation spends significantly more money that most \ncountries and yet our students scored lower than their peers from \nalmost all of the forty countries which participated in the last Third \nInternational Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS) test. Students in \ncountries which are struggling economically, socially and politically, \nsuch as Russia, outscored U.S. children in math and scored far above \nthem in advanced math and physics. Clearly, we must make significant \nchange beyond simply pouring more money into the current structure in \norder to improve our children's academic performance in order to \nmaintain a viable force in the world economy.\n  It is shameful that we are failing to provide many of our children \nwith adequate training and quality academic preparation for the real \nworld. The number of college freshman who require remedial courses in \nreading, writing and mathematics when they begin their higher education \nis unacceptably high. In fact, presently, more than 30 percent of \nentering freshman need to enroll in one of more remedial course when \nthey start college. It does not bode well for our future economy if the \nmajority of workers are not prepared with the basic skills to engage in \na competitive global marketplace.\n  I concede that school vouchers are not the magic bullet for \neradicating all that is wrong with our current educational system, but \nthey are an important opportunity for providing improved academic \nopportunities for all children, not just the wealthy. Examination of \nthe limited voucher programs scattered around our country reveal high \nlevels of parent and student satisfaction, an increase in parental \ninvolvement, and a definite improvement in attendance and discipline at \nthe participating schools. Vouchers encourage public schools, \ncommunities and parents to all work together to raise the level of \neducation for all students. Through this bill, we have the opportunity \nto replicate these important attributes throughout all or nation's \ncommunities.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``The purpose of education is to create young \ncitizens with knowing heads and loving hearts.'' If we fail to give our \nchildren the education they need to nuture their heads and hearts, then \nwe threaten their futures and the future of our nation. Each of us is \nresponsible for ensuring that our children have both the love in their \nhearts and the knowledge in their heads to not only dream, but to make \ntheir dreams a reality.\n  The time has come for us to finally conduct a national demonstration \nof school choice to determine the benefits or perhaps disadvantages of \nproviding educational choices to all students, not just those who are \nfortunate enough to be born into a wealthy family. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill and put the needs of America's school children \nahead of pork barrel projects and tax loopholes benefitting only \nspecial interests and big business.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist States to--\n       (A) give children from low-income families the same choices \n     among all elementary and secondary schools and other academic \n     programs as children from wealthier families already have;\n       (B) improve schools and other academic programs by giving \n     parents in low-income families increased consumer power to \n     choose the schools and programs that the parents determine \n     best fit the needs of their children; and\n       (C) more fully engage parents in their children's \n     schooling; and\n       (2) to demonstrate, through a 3-year national grant \n     program, the effects of a voucher program that gives parents \n     in low-income families--\n       (A) choice among public, private, and religious schools for \n     their children; and\n       (B) access to the same academic options as parents in \n     wealthy families have for their children.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to direct the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology to establish a program to support research and training in \nmethods of detecting the use of performance-enhancing drugs by \nathletes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined by my colleagues, Senators \nBrownback and Jeffords, today in introducing the Amateur Sports \nIntegrity Act. This bill does two things: it amends the Ted Stevens \nOlympic and Amateur Sports Act to make it illegal to gamble on Olympic, \ncollege, and high school sports, and it authorizes appropriations for \nthe National Institute of Standards and Technology to fund the \ndetection and prevention of athletic performance-enhancing drugs.\n  This bill implements a recommendation made by the congressionally \ncreated National Gambling Impact Study Commission. In the summary of \nits comprehensive report to Congress dated June 1999, the Commission \nnoted that ``There is growing concern regarding increasing levels of \nsports wagering by adolescents in high school and by young adults on \ncollege campuses. A 1996 study sponsored by the National Collegiate \nAthletic Association found that of the over 200 student athletes \nsurveyed in Division I basketball and football programs, 25.5 percent \nadmitted betting on college sports events while in school.''\n  In its report, the NGISC recommended that betting on collegiate and \namateur athletic events that is currently legal be banned altogether. \nThe bill that we are introducing today does just that. Just as the use \nof performance enhancing drugs threatens the integrity of amateur \nsports, so does gambling. Betting on amateur athletics invites public \nspeculation as to their legitimacy and transforms student athletes into \nobjects to be bet upon. Adding unwarranted pressure from corrupting \ninfluences to the pressures that these intensely competitive young \npeople already feel is unacceptable. Congress must act to close the \nloophole that currently allows one state to serve as a national \nclearinghouse for betting on our youth.\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\n  Let me make one thing clear: Although the Amateur Sports Integrity \nAct bans legal gambling on amateur athletics, I expect that it also \nwill reduce a substantial amount of illegal gambling as well. The \nrelationship between legal and illegal gambling was addressed by the \nNGISC, which observed that ``legal sports wagering--especially the \npublication in the media of Las Vegas and offshore-generated point \nspreads fuels a much larger amount of illegal sports wagering.'' I \nwon't pretend, however, that closing the one-state loophole on legal \ngambling on amateur sports will put an end to illegal gambling on these \nathletes and competitions. For this reason, I say to my colleagues who \nare backing a bill that has the support of the gaming industry and that \nprovides additional resources to combat illegal gambling--I agree with \nthe intent of your legislation and appreciate your recognition that \ngambling on amateur athletics is a problem that must be addressed at \nthe federal level. That bill, however, while perhaps acceptable as a \ncomplement, is not acceptable as an alternative to the Amateur Sports \nIntegrity Act.\n  Mr. President, in its report the NGISC recommended that all students \nshould be warned of the dangers of gambling, from the time they are in \nelementary school to when they finish college. As the Commission \nconcluded, the loophole that currently encourages gambling by, and on, \nthese young people, should be closed. The bill we are introducing today \ncodifies the NGISC recommendation, and further ensures the integrity of \namateur sports by addressing athlete doping. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport its swift passage.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce today with \nSenator McCain, the Amateur Sports Integrity Act. This legislation \ncombats performance enhancing drugs use by athletes, as well as the \ncorruptive influence of legal gambling on high school, college, and \namateur sports. I would like to thank my colleague for his continued \ninterest in and leadership on this issue. I look forward to winning an \nup or down vote on this bill this Congress.\n  The Amatuer Sports Integrity Act serves two purposes. First, it \ncombats the use of performance enhancing drugs by athletes through the \ncreation a new grant program to be administered by the National \nInstitute of Science and Technology. This program will support research \non the use of performance-enhancing drugs, and methods of detecting \ntheir use. Quite simply, Mr. President, we need to find out who's \ncheating and how they're doing it so we can disqualify their \ndishonorable efforts to compete. The Act will achieve this goal.\n  Our legislation will also ban the continued and unseemly practice of \nlegal wagering on high school, college, and amateur sports at the \nexpense of the achievements of our nation's student and amateur \nathletes. This bill closes the loophole in the Professional and Amateur \nSports Protection Act that allows legal sports betting in Nevada to \nnegatively impact student athletics in other states.\n  This bill is supported by the National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation, which represents more than 1000 colleges and universities \nnationwide. In addition, numerous coaches among the college ranks \nsupport this effort, and I can think of no better advocate then the \ncoaches who spend time day in and day out with the athletes and prized \nsporting institutions negatively affected by legal sports gambling.\n  My continuing efforts on this issue are in direct response to the \nrecommendation made by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission \n(NGISC), which in 1999 concluded a two-year study on the impact of \nlegalized gambling in our country. The Commission's recommendation \ncalled for a complete ban on all legalized gambling on amateur sports.\n  The Commission in its report recognized the potential harm of \nlegalized gambling by stating that sports gambling ``can serve as a \ngateway behavior for adolescent gamblers, and can devastate individuals \nand careers.'' This Amateur Sports Integrity Act will serve notice that \nbetting on college games or amateur athletics is not only inappropriate \nbut can result in these significant social costs.\n  Legislation addressing illegal gambling has been introduced in the \nHouse and Senate by members of the Nevada delegation. I would like to \ntake a moment to commend my colleagues, Senators Reid and Ensign, for \nrecognizing that the social consequences of gambling for the public \nmust be addressed. I agree with the Nevada delegation that we should be \nvigilant in our efforts to increase our knowledge regarding illegal \ngambling activities, and find ways to help law enforcement combat such \nactivities. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee to which that \nbill has been referred, I look forward to working with the Nevada \ndelegation to improve the bill and, ultimately, support its passage.\n  However, we must also address the fact that legal gambling has a real \nand telling impact on high school, college, and amateur athletics and \nthe public, and in fact facilitates illegal gambling activity. If there \nare any doubts, just ask Kevin Pendergast who orchestrated the \nbasketball point-shaving scandal at Northwestern University. He had \nstated that he never would have been able to pull off his scheme if it \nweren't for the ability to lay a large amount of money on the Las Vegas \nsports books.\n  The frequency of point shaving scandals over the last decade, and the \ntie-in to the Vegas sports books of the episodes at Northwestern and \nArizona State is a clear indication that legal gambling on college \nsports stretches beyond Nevada, impacting the integrity of other \nstate's sporting events. The now familiar opposition to this bill on \nthe theory of states rights simply does not hold water, and I \ncategorically reject the notion that Kansas college athletics should be \njeopardized so the casinos in Vegas can rake in some additional \ngambling revenues.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor the Amateur \nSports Integrity Act and I look forward to a vote before the full \nSenate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Clinton, and Ms. \n        Cantwell):\n  S. 719. A bill to amend Federal election law to provide for clean \nelections funded by clean money; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senate this week took a historic \nstep toward fairer elections. I was proud to join a solid majority of \nmy colleagues in voting for the McCain-Feingold bill. However, passage \nof that bill is not the end of the reform debate, but hopefully merely \na beginning.\n  It is clear to me that we need to go still further to reform our \nelections comprehensively, and for that reason I rise today along with \nSenators Kerry, Clinton and Cantwell to re-introduce ``Clean Money, \nClean Elections'' campaign finance reform legislation.\n  Debates about campaign finance reform should be debates about who is \nat the table and how to level the playing field. Looking back at the \ntwo weeks of debate on McCain-Feingold from this perspective highlights \nthe importance of and also the severe limitations of the bill. I say \nimportance of the bill, because if you believe that reform of our \nfederal elections is essential for the reasons I believe, restoring the \ncentrality of one person, one vote, then you need to get soft money out \nof the system since it allows too much political power to flow from too \nfew. I say severe limitations of the bill because even if we ban soft \nmoney and sham issue ads, we will still have too much money in American \npolitics. And, the wealthy investors will still have an all too \nprominent role in our elections.\n  Fundamentally, we need to go beyond legislation that merely seeks to \npatch a badly broken system. The McCain-Feingold legislation seeks to \nstop a leak here, and block a loophole there. It does not eliminate \nprivate, special interest money flowing to candidates and parties. The \nClean Money, Clean Elections legislation that I am reintroducing today \nwill fix this problem--it will reduce the costs of campaigns and \nprovide public funds to eliminate the dependence on wealthy investors \nentirely. Hence the Clean Money, Clean Elections legislation will truly \nlevel the playing field for all candidates and ensure fair elections.\n  Now that the Senate will finally go on record in favor of the modest \nreform that McCain-Feingold represents, I believe the time is right to \nbegin the fight for fundamental reform: public financing of elections.\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n  The Clean Money, Clean Elections bill is the ``gold standard'' of \ntrue campaign finance reform, against which any more modest legislation \nought to be assessed. The conceptual approach it embodies, replacing \nspecial interest money in our current system with clean money, is being \nadopted by state legislatures and in referenda across the country.\n  In Maine, for example, there was broad participation in the Clean \nMoney, Clean Elections program during the last election with 116 out of \n352 general election candidates both Republicans and Democrats \nparticipating. In Maine, Arizona and Vermont, Clean Money, Clean \nElections reduced the influence of special interest money and provided \na level playing field by offering qualified candidates a limited and \nequal amount of public funds. The earliest indications from Maine's \nfirst election under the Clean Elections law do inspire hope. Far more \ncandidates than expected stepped forward to seek Clean Elections \nfinancing, and all but one succeeded in qualifying. There comments \nabout the process tell us we are on the right track. Some of their \ncomments are for example: ``Without Clean Elections I couldn't even \nthink about running for office. I just couldn't afford it.'' said \nShlomit Auciello, democrat challenger; ``The main reason I did it was \nthat this is what people want.'' Chester Chapman, Republican \nchallenger; ``I spent a lot of kitchen table time explaining the system \nto people. Once they knew what it was they really liked it. They like \nthat it means no soft money and no PAC money will be used. I want to \nwork for the people of Maine and I don't want to be beholden to anyone \nelse.'' Glenn Cummings, Democrat challenger; ``It will definitely \nchange some things. For one thing I will have about half the amount of \nmoney I raised last time but much more time to talk with people which \nis a good thing.'' Gabrielle Carbonear; and ``We have an obligation to \nput into practice the system that was approved by voters in 1996. Maine \nis in the lead in this area. It will only work if it is used, and it is \nimportant for incumbents to embrace it. Also, the Clean Election Act is \nmaking it easier to recruit candidates to run for office.'' Rick \nBennet, Republic incumbent, Assistent Senate Minority Leader and a \ncandidate for reelection.\n  When asked, 60 percent of Americans say they think that reforming the \nway campaigns are financed should be a high priority on our National \nagenda. There is no question in my mind that these people are right, \nreforming the way campaigns are financed should be, must be, a high \npriority.\n  Many people believe our political system is corrupted by special \ninterest money. I agree with them. It is not a matter of individual \ncorruption. I think it is probably extremely rare that a particular \ncontribution causes a member to cast a particular vote. But the special \ninterest money is always there, and I believe that we do suffer under \nwhat I have repeatedly called a systemic corruption. Unfortunately, \nthis is no longer a shocking announcement, even if it is a shocking \nfact. Money does shape what is considered do-able and realistic here in \nWashington. It does buy access. We have both the appearance and the \nreality of systemic corruption. And we must act. Here in the Senate, we \nmust push forward this spring on tough, comprehensive reform.\n\n  I wonder if anyone would bother to argue that our budget debates are \nunaffected by the connection of big special-interest money to politics? \nThe budget cuts proposed most deeply affect those who are least well \noff, while the tax cuts proposed mostly go to the wealthy. That is \nwell-documented. The tax breaks we offer benefit not only the most \naffluent as a group, but numerous very narrow wealthy special \ninterests. Does anyone wonder why we retain massive subsidies and tax \nexpenditures for oil and pharmaceutical companies? What about tobacco? \nAre they curious why we promote a health care system dominated by \ninsurance companies? Or why we promote a version of ``free trade'' \nwhich disregards the need for fair labor and environmental standards, \nfor democracy and human rights, and for lifting the standard of living \nof American workers, as well as workers in the countries we trade with? \nHow is it that we pass major legislation that directly promotes the \nconcentration of ownership and power in the telecommunications \nindustry, in the agriculture and food business, and in banking and \nsecurities? For the American people, how this happens, I think, is no \nmystery.\n  I think most citizens believe there is a connection between big \nspecial interest money and outcomes in American politics. People \nrealize what is ``on the table'' or what is considered realistic here \nin Washington often has much to do with the flow of money to parties \nand to candidates. We must act to change this.\n  We must act to change this because too many people have lost faith in \nthe system. People are turning away from the political process. They \nare surrendering what belongs most exclusively to them, their right to \nbe heard on the issues that affect them, simply because they don't \nbelieve their voices will carry over the sound of all that cash. The \ndegree of distrust, dissatisfaction, and outright hostility expressed \nby the American people when asked about the political process \noverwhelms me.\n  We must act on comprehensive campaign finance reform. We must act to \nrestore Americans' trust in our political process. We must act to renew \ntheir hope in the capacity of our political system to respond to our \nsociety's most basic problems and challenges. We must act to provide a \nchannel for the anger that many Americans feel about the current \nsystem, and acknowledge the grassroots reform movement that's been \nbuilding for years. These are our duties, and we must act to move the \nreform debate forward.\n  As Members of Congress, most pressing for us should be the question \nof why so many people no longer trust the political process, especially \nhere in Congress, and what we can do to restore that trust. Polls and \nstudies continue to show a profound distrust of Congress, and of our \nprocess. Many Americans see the system as inherently corrupt, and they \ndespair of making any real changes because they figure special \ninterests have the system permanently rigged.\n  Too many Americans believe that a small but wealthy and powerful \nelite controls the levers of government through a political process \nwhich rewards big donors, a system in which you have to pay to play. \nWhy do you think corporate welfare has barely been nicked, but welfare \nfor the poor and needy in this country has been gutted? The not-so-\ninvisible hand of corporate PACs and well-heeled lobbyists, and huge \ncorporate soft money contributions can be seen most openly here.\n  Too many Americans see our failures: to alleviate the harsh poverty \nthat characterizes the lives of far too many of our inner-city \nresidents; to reduce the widening gulf between rich and poor; to combat \nhomelessness, drug addiction, decaying infrastructure, rising health \ncare costs, and an unequal system of education.\n  And they want to know why we can't, or won't, act to address these \nproblems head-on. Americans understand that without real reform, \nattempts to restructure our health care system, create jobs and rebuild \nour cities, protect our environment, make our tax system fairer and \nmore progressive, fashion and energy policy that relies more on \nconservation and renewable sources, and solve other pressing problems \nwill remain frustrated by the pressures of special interests and big-\nmoney politics.\n  In thinking about reform legislation, I start with the premise that \npolitical democracy has several basic requirements: First, free and \nfair elections. It is hard to argue plausibly that we have them now. \nThat's why people stay home on election day, why they don't participate \nin the process. Incumbents outspend challengers 8 or 10-1, and special \ninterests buy access to Congress itself, all of which warps and \ndistorts the democratic process.\n  Second, the consent of the people. The people of this country, not \nspecial interest big money, should be the source of all political \npower. Government must remain the domain of the general citizenry, not \na narrow elite.\n  Third, political equality. Everyone must have equal opportunity to \nparticipate in the process of government. This means that the values \nand preferences of all citizens, not just those who can get our \nattention by waving large campaign contributions in front\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\nof us, must be considered in the political debate. One person, one \nvote--no more and no less--the most fundamental of democratic \nprinciples.\n  Each of these principles is undermined by our current system, funded \nlargely through huge private contributions. Contributions that come \nwith their own price tag attached--greater access and special \nconsideration when push comes to shove. It's time for real reform.\n\n  Which is why I stand here today, re-introducing the ``Clean Money, \nClean Elections'' legislation that we introduced during the last \nCongress. We have tightened and strengthened some of the nuts and bolts \nof the legislation, but it is much the same bill that it was when we \nfirst introduced it: simple and sweeping, fundamental campaign finance \nreform.\n  Money has always played a role in American politics and campaign \nspending is not a new problem, but it has exploded during the 1990s. In \nthe 1993-94 election cycle, the national political parties raised \n$101.6 million dollars in soft money contributions. By the 1997-98 \nelection cycle that figure was up to $224.4 million dollars in soft \nmoney. In the 99-2000 election cycle that figure more than doubled to \nmore than $487.5 million.\n  However, we must not forget that nearly 80 percent of the money spent \non elections during the last cycle was hard money. All together, over \n$2.2 billion in hard money was raised by federal candidates and parties \nduring the 2000 elections, a figure that dwarfs party soft money. \nUnfortunately, under McCain-Feingold, even more hard money will pour \ninto our elections.\n  Of all the money given to Congressional candidates, almost none \nrepresented the millions of Americans who are poor, or parents of \npublic school children, or victimized by toxic dumping or agri-chemical \ncontamination, or who are small bank depositors and borrowers, or \npeople dependent on public housing, transportation, libraries, and \nhospitals. It is clear who is represented under the current system and \nwho is shut out.\n  During the last election, only 4 out of every 10,000 Americans made a \ncontribution greater than $200. Only 232,000 Americans gave \ncontributions of $1000 or more to federal candidates--one ninth of one \npercent of the voting age population. By raising the hard money limits \nin McCain-Feingold, the Senate voted to increase the amount of special \ninterest money in politics and entrench candidates' dependence on a \nnarrow, political, elite made up of wealthy individuals. This was step \nbackward and it makes Clean Money reform all the more necessary.\n  The bill I am introducing today strikes directly at the heart of the \ncrisis in the current system of campaign finance: the only way for \ncandidates of ordinary means to run for office and win is to raise vast \nsums of money from special interests, who in turn expect access and \ninfluence on public policy. Real campaign finance reform needs to \nrestore a level playing field, open up federal candidacies to all \ncitizens, end the perpetual money chase for Members of Congress, and \nlimit the influence of special interest groups. This legislation does \nall of these things by offering: The strictest curbs on special-\ninterest money and influence. The ``Clean Money, Clean Elections'' \nlegislation bans completely the use of ``soft money'' to influence \nelections, discourages electioneering efforts masquerading as non-\nelectoral ``issue ads,'' provides additional funding to clean money \ncandidates targeted by independent expenditures, and most importantly, \nallows candidates to reject private contributions if they agree to \nparticipate in the clean money system of financing. The greatest \nreduction in the cost of campaigns. Because it eliminates the need for \nfundraising expenses and provides a substantial amount of free and \ndiscounted TV and/or radio time for Federal candidates, this \nlegislation allows candidates to spend far less than ever before on \ntheir campaigns. The most competitive and fair election financing. By \nproviding limited but equal funding for qualified candidates, and \nadditional funding for clean money candidates if they are outspent by \nnon-participating opponents, this legislation allows qualified \nindividuals to run for office on a financially level playing field, \nregardless of their economic status or access to larger contributors. \nRight now, the system is wired for incumbents because they are \nconnected to the connected. The big players, the heavy hitters, tend to \nbe attracted to incumbents, becuase that is where the power lies. This \nbill would allow all citizens to compete equally in the Federal \nelection process. And an end to the money chase, shorter elections, and \nstronger enforcement. ``Clean Money, Clean Elections'' campaign finance \nreform frees candidates and elected officials from the burden of \ncontinuous fundraising and thus allows public officials to spend their \ntime on their real duties. In effect, it also shortens the length of \ncampaigns, when the public is bombarded with broadcast ads and mass \nmailings, by limiting the period of time during which candidates \nreceive their funding. Moreover it strengthens the enforcement and \ndisclosure requirements in Federal campaigns.\n  What I am proposing are fundamental changes, necessary changes if we \nhope to ever regain the public's confidence in the political process. \nThis legislation is both simple to understand and sweeping in scope. As \na voluntary system this bill is constitutional, and it effectively \nprovides a level playing field for all candidates who are able to \ndemonstrate a substantial base of popular support. ``Clean Money, Clean \nElections'' strengthens American democracy by returning political power \nto the ballot box and by blocking special interests' ability to skew \nthe system through large campaign contributions.\n  Most importantly, this legislation attacks the root cause of a system \nfounded on private special interest money, curing the disease rather \nthan treating the symptoms. The issue is no longer one of tightening \nalready existing campaign financing laws, no longer a question of \nwhat's legal and what's illegal. The real problem is that most of \nwhat's wrong with the current system is perfectly legal. Big money \nspecial interests know how to get around the letter of the law as it is \nnow written. This current system of funding congressional campaigns is \ninherently anti-democratic and unfair. It creates untenable conflicts \nof interests and screens out many good candidates. By favoring the deep \npockets of special interest groups, it tilts the playing field in a way \nthat sidelines the vast majority of Americans. This legislation takes \nspecial interest out of the election process and replaces it with the \npublic interest, returning our political process to the hallowed \nprinciple of one person, one vote.\n  This week the Senate took an excellent, but limited, step forward. A \ncomplete overhaul of the financing of elections is required to fully \nrestore the public confidence in our democracy. I believe the Clean \nMoney approach is what is needed to get the job done.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Warner, Mr. \n        Enzi, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Frist, and Ms. Collins):\n  S. 721. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nNurse Corps and recruitment and retention strategies to address the \nnursing shortage, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pension.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nNurse Employment and Education Development--or NEED Act--critical \nlegislation to address the current and impending nursing shortages in \nour country. I am joined by Senators Mikulski, Warner, Enzi, Bingaman, \nRoberts, Frist and Collins.\n  This year, the first order of business of the Aging Subcommittee, of \nwhich I am Chairman, was to hold a hearing on the nursing shortage and \nits impact on our health care delivery system. Recent nursing \nstatistics paint a grim picture for the future of the nursing \nworkforce, when millions of Baby Boomers will retire and place an \nunprecedented strain on the health care system. By the year 2020, it is \nprojected that nursing needs will be unmet by at least 20 percent.\n  This is in large part due to a shrinking pipeline. The average age of \nRegistered Nurses is 43.3 years. Nurses under age 30 comprise less than \n10 percent of today's nurse workforce. Minorities, including men, \nremain a minuscule percentage of the workforce.\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\nThe cumulative effect of all this is that nurses and nurse faculty are \nretiring or leaving the profession at a rapid rate, and only a small \nnumber of nurses and nurse educators are taking their place.\n  In my home state of Arkansas, 153 eligible nursing students were \nturned away in 1999 because of the lack of faculty to teach them. In \nthe meantime, over 750 nursing vacancies have been reported by Arkansas \nhospitals, and I know that this trend is being experienced by many more \nhealth care providers across the state. What is happening in Arkansas \nis becoming a major issue across the country.\n  The NEED Act builds on the programs currently in the Nurse Education \nAct and adds several new, innovative approaches to alleviate the \nnursing shortage. In the area of recruitment, the NEED Act establishes \na Nurse Corps, which is essential to attracting able individuals into \nthe nurse workforce to fill current and future health needs. In \nparticular, the NEED Act expands the existing nurse loan repayment \nprogram under the Nurse Education Act and by adding scholarships for \nwhich nursing students can qualify in exchange for at least 2 years of \nservice in a critical nurse shortage area or in a variety of health \ncare facilities determined to have a shortage in nursing. In addition, \nthe NEED Act adds nursing homes, home health agencies, public health \ndepartments and nurse management health centers to the list of eligible \nentities to fulfill this service requirement.\n  Changing the image of nursing and promoting workforce diversity is \nanother key recruiting factor to get people, especially young people, \ninterested in nursing careers. The NEED Act provides funding for multi-\nmedia campaigns at the federal and state level to reach out to \nindividuals to encourage them to consider nursing as they make career \nchoices.\n  The NEED Act also provides grants for community partnerships to \ndevelop innovative nurse recruiting and retention strategies tailored \nto a particular community, and authorizes additional funding for \nworkforce diversity grants already provided for under the Nurse \nEducation Act.\n\n  In order to strengthen the existing workforce, the NEED Act provides \ngrant funding for: career ladder programs to facilitate educational \nadvancement for individuals with existing nursing degrees or health \ncare training; long-term care training for nurses who will inevitably \nbe dealing with an older patient population; and nursing internships \nand residencies to meet the current demand for nurses with specialty \ntraining, be it in the ER or the labor and delivery room\n  Finally, the NEED Act provides for a fast-track faculty development \nprogram, which seeks to encourage master's and doctoral students to \nrapidly complete their studies through loans and scholarships. We must \nrealize that getting people into the pipeline will mean very little if \nwe do not have the teachers to teach them. Individuals receiving \nfinancial assistance through the fast-track faculty program must agree \nto teach at an accredited school of nursing in exchange for this \nassistance.\n  This is a bipartisan issue and it is becoming a nationwide concern. I \nhope that we can work together to successfully secure passage of the \nNEED Act and other meaningful solutions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Nurse Employment and \nEducation Development (NEED Act) be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 721\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we are in the midst of a nursing workforce \nshortage. Not only are fewer people entering and staying in the nursing \nprofession, but we are losing nurses at a time of growing need. Today, \nnurses are needed in a greater number of settings, such as nursing \nhomes, extended care facilities, community and public health settings, \nnursing education, and ambulatory care settings. Nationally, health \ncare providers, ranging from hospitals and nursing homes to home health \nagencies and public health departments are struggling to find qualified \nnurses to provide safe, efficient quality care for their patients.\n  Though we have faced nursing shortages in the past, this shortage is \nparticularly troublesome because it reflects two trends that are \noccurring simultaneously: (1) a shortage of people entering the \nprofession and (2) the retirement of nurses who have been working in \nthe profession for many years. Over the past 5 years, enrollment in \nentry-level nursing programs has declined by 20%, mirroring the \ndeclining awareness of the nursing profession among high school \ngraduates. Consequently, nurses under the age of 30 represent only 10% \nof the current workforce; and by 2010, 40% of the nursing workfoce will \nbe over the age of 50 and nearing retirement. If these trends are not \nreversed, we stand to lost vast numbers of nurses at the vert time that \nthey will be needed to care for the millions of baby boomers reach \nretirement age.\n\n[[Page S3551]]\n\n  Further, greater efforts must be made to recruit more men and \nminorities to this noble profession. Currently, only 10% of the \nregistered nurses in the United States are from racial or ethnic \nminority backgrounds, even though these individuals comprise 28% of the \ntotal United States population. In 2000, only 5.9% of the registered \nnurses were men. We must work to promote diversity in the workforce, \nnot only to increase the number of individuals within the profession \nbut also to promote culturally competent and relevant care.\n  Even if nursing schools could recruit more students to deal with the \nshortage, many schools could not accommodate higher enrollments because \nof faculty shortages. There are nearly 400 faculty vacancies at nursing \nschools in this country. And, an even greater faculty shortage looms in \nthe next 10-15 years as many current nursing faculty approach \nretirement and fewer nursing students pursue academic careers.\n  Therefore, I am pleased to join Senator Hutchinson in introducing the \nNursing Employment and Education Development (NEED) Act to expand \ncurrent programs addressing the increasing number of settings which \nrely on nurses to provide care, to attract young people to the nursing \nprofession, and to promote career mobility. The NEED Act complements \nlegislation that I am developing as Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nPublic Health--the reauthorization of the National Health Service Corps \n(NHSC). The NHSC, a program designed to address the geographic \nmaldistribution of health professionals, cannot be the only solution \nsought to deal with our nursing shortage. Initiatives like the NEED Act \nare also a critical component of a comprehensive strategy to address \nthis growing problem.\n  Specifically, the NEED Act will develop a national Nurse Corps \nProgram that will allow nurses to receive scholarships and loan \nrepayment assistance for agreeing to serve at least two years in \nnursing homes, home health agencies, public health departments, health \ncenters, public hospitals, or rural health clinics. This program \nexpansion more accurately address the number of settings affected by \nthe nursing shortage and allows for stronger recruitment efforts for \ndisadvantaged students.\n  The bill will also help to attract young people to the profession by \nfunding a multi-media, public campaign to enhance the image of the \nnursing profession, promote diversity in the workforce, and encourage \ncareer development for those already in the profession. The NEED Act \nfurther promotes community involvement by providing community outreach \ngrants to providers and community partners to develop and implement \ncreative strategies for nurse recruitment and retention. The bill also \nexpands the Area Health Education Centers program to enhance \nrecruitment and retention of nurses in rural areas.\n  The NEED Act promotes career mobility by expanding career ladder \nprograms and encouraging individuals to pursue advanced education \nthrough available scholarships and stipends. The bill also authorizes a \nFast-Track Nursing Faculty Scholarships and Loan Program--a program \nproviding scholarships, loans, and monthly stipends to college \ngraduates and master's students to allow full-time study and faster \ncompletion of doctoral studies. To assist nursing schools in preparing \nthose students, the NEED Act provides needed funding for long-tern care \ntraining and for internship or residency programs to encourage \nmentoring and the development of subspecialists.\n  The NEED Act will help assure a strong and vibrant nursing workfoce, \nallowing us to avoid the harmful effects of a long-term nursing \nshortage. I appreciate Senator Hutchinson's work on this issue, and I \nam pleased to join him to day to introduce a bill that represents an \nimportant and thoughtful response to this pressing issue.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join with my colleague, \nSenator Tim Hutchinson, today to introduce the Nursing Employment and \nEducation Development or ``NEED'' Act. This bill is sorely needed, \nbecause we have a nursing shortage. In Maryland, 15% of the nursing \njobs are vacant. Last year, it took an average of 68 days to fill a \nnurse vacancy, and we need about 1,600 more full-time nurses to fill \nthose vacancies. There were 2,000 fewer nurses in Maryland in 1999 than \nthere were in 1998. The shortage exists across the United States, and \nwill get worse in the future. Nationwide, we will need 1.7 million \nnurses by the year 2020, but only about 600,000 will be available.\n  We depend on nurses every day to care for millions of Americans, \nwhether in a hospital, nursing home, health center, hospice, or through \nhome health. They are the backbone of our health care system. If we \ndon't effectively address the crisis in nursing, those hospitals, \nnursing homes and clinics will soon be on life support.\n  This bill is a downpayment. It doesn't address the fact that nurses \nare underpaid, overworked, and undervalued, but it does focus on \neducation. The NEED Act seeks to help bring men and women into the \nnursing profession, and help them advance within it. The bill does this \nunder five major approaches:\n\n       Nurse Corps: Creates a Nurse Corps Scholarhip Program, \n     which provides scholarships in exchange for at least 2 years \n     of service in a critical nurse shortage area, authorizes \n     increased funding for the nursing education loan repayment \n     program,\n       Nurse Recruitment and Retention:\n       Creates a public awareness and education campaign, to be \n     carried out on the state and national level, to enhance the \n     image of nursing, promote diversity in the nursing workforce, \n     and encourage people to enter the nursing profession, enables \n     Area Health Education Centers (AHECs) to expand their junior \n     and senior high school mentoring programs for nurses and \n     develop ``models of excellence'' for community-based nurses, \n     creates networks between health care facilities and community \n     organizations that will recruit and retain nurses in the \n     community.\n       Nurse Training: Creates ``career ladder'' programs that \n     will encourage nurses and nursing students to pursue \n     additional education and training and advance within the \n     profession, encourages students to enter the nursing \n     profession with a focus on long-term care develops internship \n     and residency programs that encourage mentoring and the \n     development of specialties such as labor and delivery and \n     emergency room nursing.\n       Nursing Faculty Development: Provides scholarships and \n     loans for graduate-level education in nursing, to help ensure \n     that we have enough teachers at our nursing schools.\n       National Commission on the Nursing Crisis: Creates a \n     National Commission on the Nursing Crisis, modeled after the \n     Maryland Commission on the Crisis in Nursing, which will \n     study and make recommendations to Congress within 1 year on \n     how to address the nursing shortage in the short and long \n     term.\n\n  This bill is about nursing education, but it's also about \nempowerment. We can empower people to have a better life and go into a \ncareer to save lives.\n  The bill will empower the single mom who has been working in a dead-\nend retail job to forge a better life for herself and her family. It \nwill help her get a scholarship to help pay for tuition, books, and lab \nfees, and by funding child care programs to help her balance work and \nfamily.\n  The bill empower the nurse who has a baccalaureate degree, but wants \nto get a Master's degree so she can teach nursing at a community \ncollege. It will help her get loans, scholarships, and living stipends \nto pursue that degree.\n  This bill also will fund partnerships between schools and health care \nproviders to inspire the next generation of nurses. For example, a 12-\nyear old boy or girl in Suitland, Maryland who is interested in \nnursing, could like up with a ``buddy'' or mentor at the local \nhospital. That mentor could help the student with science homework, or \neven let the student ``shadow'' the mentor at work.\n  It is important that we add these programs to the federal law books. \nBut as a member of the Appropriations Committee, I know how important \nit is that we fund them and our existing programs in the federal \ncheckbook. That's why I was disturbed to read in the newspaper \nyesterday that President Bush plans to cut funding for education and \ntraining programs for doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other health \nprofessionals from $353 million to just $140 million. That's a cut of \n$213 million! Such a move would be penny-wise and pound-foolish.\n  President Bush wants to slow the growth of federal spending, but he \ncan't slow the growth of illness, or of our aging population. He adds \nmoney for community health centers, which I support. But who will staff \nthem? Without nurses, more community health centers are a hollow \nopportunity. He adds more money for medical research at the National \nInstitutes of Health, which I support. But he\n\n[[Page S3552]]\n\ndoesn't fund the programs that will train the pharmacists who will \ndispense the medicines that come from that medical research, or a real \nMedicare prescription drug benefit so that seniors can afford them. \nAgain, this is a hollow opportunity. I urge the President to \nreconsider, and the Congress to reject his approach.\n  I hope to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nenhance opportunity for nurses and recruit new nurses into the \nprofession by enacting this bill into law this year. Thank you.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Reed, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 722.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nhuman embryonic stem cell generation and research; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce the ``Stem Cell Research Act of 2001.'' As chairman of the \nSenate appropriations subcommittee that funds medical research, my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Tom Harkin and I convened a series of \nseven hearings to learn more about an exciting medical discovery and \nthe promise it holds. The source of this new hope is what scientists \ncall ``stem cells.'' These are living cells which, in their earliest \nstages, have the ability to transform into any type of cell in the \nhuman body. If the scientists are correct, a stem cell implanted in a \nheart, for example, would become a healthy heart cell; if the same stem \ncell were implanted in a liver, it would grow into a healthy liver \ncell. It is this remarkable adaptability that leads scientists to \nbelieve that one day, stem cells could be transplanted to any part of \nthe body to replace tissue that has been damaged by disease, injury or \naging.\n  A team of researchers also found that human embryonic stem cells that \nwere injected into the spinal cords of monkeys stricken with Lou \nGehrig's disease showed promising signs of movement. These early \nresearch findings indicate that stem cells hold hope for countless \npatients with cancer, Parkinson's, heart disease, Alzheimer's and \nspinal cord injury, just to name a few. These cells could become a \nveritable fountain of youth.\n  What had been delaying the advancement of this new line of research \nis a provision in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill that prohibits \nresearch on\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\nhuman embryos. In early 1999, the Department of Health and Human \nServices ruled that Federal researchers could conduct research on stem \ncell lines derived from private sources. I applaud the HHS ruling and \nencourage the NIH to review, on an expedited basis, the compliance \napplications they recently received. However, we have a duty to \naccelerate medical research by allowing researchers to utilize Federal \nfunds to derive their own stem cells.\n  Human embryonic stem cell research holds such potential for millions \nof Americans who are sick and in pain that we believe it is wrong for \nus to prevent or delay our world-class scientists from building on the \nprogress that has been made.\n  Our legislation creates one narrow and specific source for Federal \nresearchers to obtain embryos for use in stem cell research: embryos \nwhich would otherwise be discarded from in-vitro fertilization clinics, \nwith the expressed consent of the donating families. In addition, a \nprovision is included which requires that all Federally-funded research \nmust adhere to strict procedural and ethical guidelines to ensure that \nsuch research is conducted in an ethical, sound manner. It is important \nto note that as it stands today, embryonic stem cell research in the \nprivate sector is not subject to Federal monitoring or ethical \nrequirements.\n  I am pleased that my colleagues, Senators Thurmond, Chafee, G. Smith, \nHollings, Reid, Murray, Clinton, Corzine, Feinstein, Kerry, and Inouye \nhave joined me and Senator Harkin as original cosponsors of this vital \nlegislative effort. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this important legislation that will give many Americans the \npromise to treat diseases that today are incurable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Stem Cell Research Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL GENERATION AND RESEARCH.\n\n       Part H of the Title IV of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 289 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section \n     498B the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 498C. HUMAN EMBRYONIC STEM CELL GENERATION AND \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary may only conduct, support, or fund \n     research on human embryos for the purpose of generating \n     embryonic stem cells and utilizing stem cells that have been \n     derived from embryos in accordance with this section.\n       ``(b) Sources of Embryonic Stem Cells.--For purposes of \n     carrying out research under subsection (a), the human \n     embryonic stem cells involved shall be derived only from \n     embryos that have been donated from in-vitro fertilization \n     clinics after compliance with the following:\n       ``(1) Prior to the consideration of embryo donation and \n     through consultation with the progenitors, it is determined \n     that the embryos will never be implanted in a woman and would \n     otherwise be discarded.\n       ``(2) The embryos are donated with the written informed \n     consent of the progenitors.\n       ``(c) Restrictions.--\n       ``(1) In general.--The following restriction shall apply \n     with respect to human embryonic stem cell research conducted \n     or supported under subsection (a):\n       ``(A) The research involved shall not result in the \n     creation of human embryos.\n       ``(B) The research involved shall not result in the \n     reproductive cloning of a human being.\n       ``(2) Prohibition.--\n       ``(A) In general.--It shall be unlawful for any person \n     receiving Federal funds to knowingly acquire, receive, or \n     otherwise transfer any human embryos for valuable \n     consideration if the acquisition, receipt, or transfer \n     affects interstate commerce.\n       ``(B) Definition.--In subparagraph (A), the term `valuable \n     consideration' does not include reasonable payments \n     associated with transportation, transplantation, processing, \n     preservation, quality control, or storage.\n       ``(d) Guidelines.--The Secretary, in conjunction with the \n     Director of the National Institutes of Health, shall issue \n     guidelines that expand on the rules governing human embryonic \n     stem cell research (as in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this section) to include rules that govern the derivation of \n     stem cells from donated embryos under this section.\n       ``(e) Reporting Requirements.--The Secretary shall annually \n     prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     a report describing the activities carried out under this \n     section during the preceding fiscal year, and including a \n     description of whether and to what extent research under \n     subsection (a) has been conducted in accordance with this \n     section.''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Specter, on the introduction of the ``Stem Cell \nResearch Act of 2001.'' I want to commend Senator Specter for having \nthe leadership and foresight to introduce legislation which will \nbroaden the ability of federally-funded scientists to pursue stem cell \nresearch, under certain, limited conditions.\n  From enabling the development of cell and tissue transplantation, to \nimproving and accelerating pharmaceutical research and development, to \nincreasing our understanding of human development and cancer biology, \nthe potential benefits of stem cell research are truly awe-inspiring.\n  Stem cells hold hope for countless patients through potentially \nlifesaving therapies for Parkinson's, Alzheimers, stroke, heart disease \nand diabetes. Also exciting is the possibility that researchers may be \nable to alter stem cells genetically so they would avoid attack by the \npatient's immune system.\n  Currently, for example, researchers are conducting groundbreaking \nresearch on the devastating condition commonly known as ``Lou Gehrig's \ndisease.'' They are injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of \nmoneys in an attempt to treat the disease. And they are reporting very \npromising early results.\n  But the potential benefits of this study and others could be delayed \nor even denied to patients without a healthy partnership between the \nprivate sector and the federal government.\n  While market interest in stem cell technology is strong, and private \ncompanies will continue to fund this research, the government has an \nimportant role to play in supporting the basic and applied science that \nunderpins these technologies. The problem is that early, basic science \nis always going to be underfunded by the private sector because this \ntype of research does not get products onto the market quickly enough. \nThe only way to ensure that this research is conducted is to allow the \nNIH to support it.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services ruled last year that \nunder the current ban on human embryo research, federally-funded \nscientists can conduct stem cell research if they use cell lines \nderived from private sources. Unfortunately, the current administration \nhas placed this ruling under review. We are anxiously awaiting the \noutcome of this review.\n  In the meantime, I am pleased to join my colleagues in stating my \nstrong support for stem cell research. There is broad agreement, across \nparty lines, that this research is important, it could save lives, and \nit should not be halted.\n  In its report, ``Ethical Issues in Human Stem Cell Research,'' the \nNational Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) concludes that stem cell \nresearch should be allowed to go forward with federal support, as long \nas researchers were limited to only two sources of stem cells: fetal \ntissue and embryos resulting from infertility treatments. And they \nrecommend that federal support to be contingent on an open system of \noversight and review.\n  NBAC also arrived at the important conclusion that it is ethically \nacceptable for the federal government to finance research that both \nderives cell lines from embryos and that uses those cell lines. Their \nreport states, ``Relying on cell lines that might be derived \nexclusively by a subset of privately funded researchers who are \ninterested in this area could severely limit scientific and clinical \nprogress.''\n  The Commission goes on to say that ``scientists who conduct basic \nresearch and are interested in fundamental cellular processes are \nlikely to make elemental discoveries about the nature of ES [embryonic \nstem] cells as they derive them in the laboratory.''\n  NBAC's report presents reasonable guidelines for federal policy. Our \nbill bans human embryo research, but allows federally-funded scientists \nto derive human pluripotent stem cells from human embryos if those \nembryos are obtained from IVF clinics, if the donor has provided \ninformed consent and the embryo was no longer needed for fertility \ntreatments. The American Society of Cell Biology estimates that\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\n100,000 human embryos are currently frozen in IVF clinics, in excess of \ntheir clinical need.\n  In addition, our language requires HHS and NIH to develop procedural \nguidelines to make sure that stem cell research is conducted in an \nethical, sound manner. As it stands today, stem cell research in the \nprivate sector is not subject to federal monitoring or ethical \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, stem cell research holds such hope, such potential for \nmillions of Americans who are sick and in pain, it is morally wrong for \nus to prevent or delay our world-class scientists from building on the \nprogress that has been made.\n  As long as this research is conducted in an ethically validated \nmanner, it should be allowed to go forward, and it should receive \nfederal support. That is why Senator Specter and I have joined together \non legislation that will allow our nation's top scientists to pursue \ncritical cures and therapies for the diseases and chronic conditions \nwhich strike too many Americans. I urge my Senate colleagues to join us \nin supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3554-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3554]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 66--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nRELEASE OF TWENTY-FOUR UNITED STATES MILITARY PERSONNEL CURRENTLY BEING \n               DETAINED BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nMurkowski, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Edwards, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nJohnson, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.

As the leading \n     cause of death in Africa, AIDS has killed 17 million and will \n     claim the lives of one quarter of the population, mostly \n     productive adults, in the next decade. In addition, 13 \n     million children have been orphaned by AIDS--a number that \n     will rise to 40 million by 2010.\n       (3) The Agency for International Development, along with \n     the Centers for Disease Control, Department of Labor, and \n     Department of Defense have been at the forefront of the \n     international battle to control HIV/AIDS, with global \n     assistance totaling $330,000,000 from USAID and $136,000,000 \n     from other agencies in fiscal year 2001, primarily focused on \n     targeted prevention programs.\n       (4) While prevention is key, treatment and care for those \n     affected by HIV/AIDS is an increasingly critical component of \n     the global response. Improving health systems, providing \n     home-based care, treating AIDS-associated diseases like \n     tuberculosis, providing for family support and orphan care, \n     and making anti-retroviral drugs against HIV available will \n     reduce social and economic damage to families and \n     communities.\n       (5) Pharmaceutical companies recently dramatically reduced \n     the prices of anti-retroviral drugs to the poorest countries. \n     With sufficient resources, it is now possible to improve \n     treatment options in countries where health systems are able \n     to deliver and monitor the medications.\n       (6) The UN AIDS program estimates it will cost at least \n     $3,000,000,000 for basic AIDS prevention and care services in \n     Sub-Saharan Africa alone, and at least $2,000,000,000 more if \n     anti-retroviral drugs are provided widely.

UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION \n                   INVESTIGATION OF STEEL IMPORTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) total steel imports in 2000 were 6.2 percent higher \n     than in 1999, continuing the alarming trend of sharply \n     increasing steel imports over the past decade;\n       (2) unprecedented levels of steel imports flooded the \n     United States market in 1998 and 1999, causing a crisis--\n     which continues to this day--in which thousands of \n     steelworkers have been laid off and 16 steel companies have \n     declared bankruptcy;\n       (3) steel prices continue to be depressed, with hot-rolled \n     sheet steel prices approximately 35 percent lower in March \n     2001 than in May 2000, and cold-rolled sheet steel prices \n     down approximately 25 percent over the same period;\n       (4) the United States Government must maintain and fully \n     enforce all existing relief against foreign unfair trade;\n       (5) the United States steel industry is a clean, highly \n     efficient industry having modernized itself at great human \n     and financial cost, shedding over 330,000 jobs and investing \n     more than $50,000,000,000 over the last 20 years;\n       (6) capacity utilization in the United States steel \n     industry fell sharply during 2000 and the market \n     capitalization and debt ratings of the major United States \n     steel firms are at precarious levels;\n       (7) the Department of Commerce recently documented the \n     underlying market-distorting practices and long-standing \n     structural problems that plague the global steel trade with \n     excess capacity and cause diversion of unfairly traded \n     foreign steel to the United States; and\n       (8) a vital steel industry is essential to United States \n     national security and is a key element of the domestic \n     manufacturing base.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) the budget of the United States International Trade \n     Commission is increased by $3,340,000 for fiscal year 2002, \n     so that it may improve its utilization of information \n     resources and thereby more effectively assess the impact of \n     steel imports on United States industry;\n       (2) the President should take all appropriate action within \n     his power to provide the United States steel industry with \n     relief from injury caused by steel imports, without imposing \n     restructuring preconditions that would exact additional human \n     and financial costs on the industry and its employees; and\n       (3) the President should immediately request that the \n     United States International Trade Commission commence an \n     expedited investigation for positive adjustment under section \n     201 of the Trade Act of 1974 of such steel imports.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 223.

and\n       (3) timely Federal tax and spending decisions have the \n     capacity to produce further gains in productivity by building \n     a better educated workforce, and to produce further \n     scientific and technological breakthroughs by supporting \n     ongoing research and development.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) calendar year 2001 taxes are reduced by $70,000,000,000 \n     in a manner that provides every taxpayer with a relatively \n     equal amount of tax savings as expeditiously as practicable \n     to provide the economy with an immediate stimulus;\n       (2) a plan increasing the level of exemption for property \n     subject to the estate tax to $2,000,000 immediately and \n     $4,000,000 over the decade, estimated to cost $66,000,000,000 \n     between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2011, is substituted \n     for the Administration's proposal to repeal the estate tax at \n     a cost of $267,000,000,000 over 10 years;\n       (3) the $200,000,000,000 that is saved as a result of \n     substituting estate tax reform for repeal is used to \n     strengthen the Nation's economy and keep it strong over the \n     next decade by increasing budget authority by the following \n     amounts over the amounts that were proposed at the outset of \n     the Senate debate on the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution:\n       (A) Function 250, General Science, Space and Technology, is \n     increased by $30,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, \n     including $1,500,000,000 next year, to continue advancing \n     science and technology through civilian research conducted \n     under the auspices of the National Science Foundation, the \n     National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and the \n     Department of Energy;\n       (B) Function 370, Commerce and Housing Credit, is increased \n     by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $188,000,000 next year, to continue Department of Commerce \n     initiatives that help small businesses create and use \n     technology, including the Advanced Technology Program and the \n     Manufacturing Extension Partnership;\n       (C) Function 450, Community and Regional Development, is \n     increased by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $300,000,000 next year, to clean and develop abandoned \n     industrial sites in communities throughout the Nation under \n     the Brownfields revitalization program administered by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (D) Function 500, Education, Training, Employment, and \n     Social Services, is increased by $150,000,000,000 over the \n     next 10 years, including $12,000,000,000 next year, to ensure \n     that the kind of education and training needed to make \n     economic opportunities available to all over the next decade, \n     including--\n       (i) $65,000,000,000 for aid to disadvantaged students under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act;\n       (ii) $12,000,000,000 to improve teacher quality;\n       (iii) $10,000,000,000 to continue reducing class sizes;\n       (iv) $7,000,000,000 to ensure access to quality bilingual \n     education;\n       (v) $4,000,000,000 to continue repairing and modernizing \n     schools;\n       (vi) $2,000,000,000 to improve teacher training under title \n     II of the Higher Education Act;\n       (vii) $27,000,000,000 to increase the maximum Pell Grant to \n     at least $4,700;\n       (viii) $2,000,000,000 for mentoring of low-income youth who \n     have worked to prepare themselves for college;\n       (ix) $20,000,000,000 to expand employment training \n     opportunities under the Workforce Investment Act and other \n     programs specifically designed to assist workers to develop \n     technology skills; and\n       (x) $1,000,000,000 to assist institutions of higher \n     education in conducting business incubator initiatives;\n       (E) Function 600, Income Security, is increased by \n     $14,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $2,180,000,000 next year, to ensure that the Nation's \n     Unemployment Insurance System responds to the needs of the \n     modern workforce in times of economic uncertainty;\n       (4) equally important to the Nation's continued economic \n     health, the tax cuts authorized under this resolution should \n     be structured to include provisions that would--\n       (A) make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent;\n       (B) enable taxpayers to deduct college tuition for income \n     tax purposes;\n       (C) promote energy conservation and development of \n     renewable and alternative energy sources;\n       (D) encourage low-income working families to save and build \n     assets, including a first home, small business, and a post-\n     secondary education, through Individual Development Accounts;\n       (E) bridge the digital divide in small businesses;\n       (F) encourage employers to make remedial education \n     available to employees; and\n       (G) adjust tax depreciation periods to accurately reflect \n     the useful life of high-technology capital equipment;\n       (5) tax cuts provided to individual taxpayers under this \n     resolution should be fairly distributed among all Federal \n     taxpayers, considering the percentage of total Federal taxes \n     paid by individuals, including income, payroll, and excise \n     taxes; and\n       (6) tax cuts authorized under this resolution should not be \n     backloaded so as to either deprive the economy of the greater \n     short-term stimulus benefits of evenly distributing tax cuts \n     over the decade, or to distort the true size of the tax cuts \n     in later years.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 233. Mr. SARBANES (for himself and Mr. Dodd) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed to amendment SA 170 proposed by Mr. \nDomenici to the concurrent resolution (H.Con.Res. 83) establishing the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2002, revising the congressional budget for the United States \nGovernment for fiscal year 2001, and setting forth appropriate \nbudgetary levels for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2011; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. . FEDERAL FIRE PREVENTION ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Increased demands on firefighting and emergency medical \n     personnel have made it difficult for local governments to \n     fund necessary fire safety precautions adequately.\n       (2) The Federal Government has an obligation to protect the \n     health and safety of the firefighting and emergency medical \n     personnel of the United States and to ensure that they have \n     the financial resources to protect the public.\n       (3) The high rates in the United States of death, injury, \n     and property damage caused by fires demonstrates a critical \n     need for Federal investment in support of firefighting and \n     emergency medical personnel.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Federal Government should support the core \n     operations of the Federal Emergency Management Agency by \n     providing needed grant programs for assisting the Nation's \n     firefighters and rescue and emergency medical personnel to \n     respond to more than 17,000,000 emergency calls annually;\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\n       (2) to accomplish that task, the Senate supports full \n     funding for the Firefighter Assistance program of grants and \n     other assistance that is authorized by section 33 of the \n     Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974; and\n       (3) funding the Firefighters Assistance program at the \n     level of $300,000,000 authorized for the program for fiscal \n     year 2002 will significantly assist local firefighters in \n     adequately protecting themselves, as well as the lives and \n     property of countless Americans from the dangers of fire.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 234.

As the recent acts of school violence have shown \n     us, having a police officer in schools saves lives.\n       (5) The COPS program has assisted in advancing community \n     policing nationwide. Today, 86 percent of the Nation is \n     served by a law enforcement agency that has full-time \n     officers engaged in community policing activities.\n       (6) Law enforcement organizations such as the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police, the International \n     Brotherhood of Police Officers, the Fraternal Order of \n     Police, the National Sheriffs' Association, the National \n     Troopers Coalition, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \n     Association, the National Association of Police \n     Organizations, the National Organization of Black Law \n     Enforcement Executives, the Police Executive Research Forum, \n     and the Major Cities Chiefs support the continuation and full \n     funding of the COPS program through fiscal year 2007.\n       (7) The implementation of community policing as a law \n     enforcement strategy is an important factor in the recent \n     reduction of crime in our communities. The national crime \n     rate has fallen for an unprecedented 8\\1/2\\ years. The \n     violent crime rate in 1999 fell to its lowest levels since \n     1978. The COPS program has demonstrated the Nation's \n     commitment to help reduce the crime rate to levels unseen for \n     the past 26 years.\n       (8) Despite recent gains, crime is still too high in the \n     United States. A violent crime is committed every 22 seconds, \n     a woman raped every 6 minutes, and person murdered every 34 \n     minutes in the United States.\n       (9) On February 28, 2001, President George W. Bush \n     submitted to Congress the Administration's budget highlights, \n     ``A Blueprint for New Beginnings,'' which stated, ``[t]o a \n     great degree, States and localities have proved themselves \n     able to pursue vigorous law enforcement agendas without \n     relying on Federal grant funding.''\n       (10) ``A Blueprint for New Beginnings'' makes no mention of \n     the COPS program.\n       (11) On April 1, 2001, the Washington Post reported that \n     ``[t]he Community Policing Services Program (COPS) . . . will \n     be cut by 13 percent, from $1 billion to about $850 \n     million.''\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume the commitment of \n     the Federal Government to continue funding the COPS program, \n     and that funding for the COPS program will continue at levels \n     necessary to hire up to 50,000 new officers, hire community \n     prosecutors, and assist local police departments in procuring \n     the latest high-technology crime fighting equipment.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 243. Mr. BIDEN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment SA 170 proposed by Mr. Domenici to the concurrent resolution \n(H. Con. Res. 83) establishing the congressional budget for the United \nStates Government for fiscal year 2002, revising the congressional \nbudget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2001, and \nsetting forth appropriate budgetary levels for each of fiscal years \n2003 through 2011; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING SUPPORT FOR FEDERAL, \n                   STATE, AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FOR THE \n                   VIOLENT CRIME REDUCTION TRUST FUND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Our Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers \n     provide essential services that preserve and protect our \n     freedom and safety, and with Federal assistance in the form \n     of the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant program, the \n     Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant program, the \n     COPS program, and the Byrne Grant program, State and local \n     law enforcement officers have succeeded in reducing violent \n     crime. The violent crime rate has dropped in each of the \n     years since the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund was \n     established.\n       (2) Assistance, such as the Violent Offender Incarceration/\n     Truth in Sentencing Incentive Grants, provided to State \n     corrections systems to encourage truth in sentencing laws for \n     violent offenders, has resulted in longer time served by \n     violent criminals and safer streets for law abiding people \n     across the Nation.\n       (3) Through a comprehensive effort by State and local law \n     enforcement to attack violence against women, in concert with \n     the efforts of dedicated volunteers and professionals who \n     provide victim services, shelter, counseling, and advocacy to \n     battered women and their children, important strides have \n     been made against the national scourge of violence against \n     women.\n       (4) Despite recent gains, crime is still too high in the \n     United States. A violent crime is committed every 22 seconds, \n     a woman raped every 6 minutes, and a person murdered every 34 \n     minutes in the United States.\n       (5) Federal efforts to investigate and prosecute \n     international terrorism and complex interstate and \n     international crime are vital aspects of a national anti-\n     crime strategy, and should be maintained.\n       (6) The recent gains by Federal, State, and local law \n     enforcement in the fight against violent crime and violence \n     against women are fragile, and continued financial commitment \n     from the Federal Government for funding and other assistance \n     is required to sustain and build upon these gains.\n       (7) The Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund, enacted as part \n     of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, \n     funds the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of \n     1994, the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, and the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that the Federal \n     Government's commitment to fund Federal law enforcement \n     programs and programs to assist State and local efforts to \n     combat violent crime, such as the Local Law Enforcement Block \n     Grant program, the Juvenile Accountability Incentive Block \n     Grant program, the Violent Offender/Truth in Sentencing \n     Incentive Grants program, the Violence Against Women Act, the \n     COPS program, and the Byrne Grant program, shall be \n     maintained, and that funding for the Violent Crime Reduction \n     Trust Fund shall continue to at least fiscal year 2005.\n       On page 27, line 3, increase the amount by $628,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, increase the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, increase the amount by $657,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, increase the amount by $438,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 11, increase the amount by $687,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 12, increase the amount by $619,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 15, increase the amount by $716,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 16, increase the amount by $678,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 19, increase the amount by $747,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 20, increase the amount by $707,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 23, increase the amount by $778,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 24, increase the amount by $738,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 2, increase the amount by $808,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 3, increase the amount by $768,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 6, increase the amount by $841,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 7, increase the amount by $799,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 10, increase the amount by $873,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 11, increase the amount by $831,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 14, increase the amount by $907,000,000.\n       On page 28, line 15, increase the amount by $864,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $628,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $35,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 19, decrease the amount by $657,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 20, decrease the amount by $438,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 23, decrease the amount by $687,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 24, decrease the amount by $619,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 2, decrease the amount by $716,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 3, decrease the amount by $678,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 6, decrease the amount by $747,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 7, decrease the amount by $707,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 10, decrease the amount by $778,000,000.\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\n       On page 44, line 11, decrease the amount by $738,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 14, decrease the amount by $808,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 15, decrease the amount by $768,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 18, decrease the amount by $841,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 19, decrease the amount by $799,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 22, decrease the amount by $873,000,000.\n       On page 44, line 23, decrease the amount by $831,000,000.\n       On page 45, line 2, decrease the amount by $907,000,000.\n       On page 45, line 3, decrease the amount by $864,000,000.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 245.

Mr. CORZINE (for himself and Mr. Bayh) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed to amendment SA 170 proposed by Mr. Domenici to \nthe concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 83) establishing the \ncongressional budget for the United States Government for fiscal year \n2002, revising the congressional budget for the United States \nGovernment for fiscal year 2001, and setting forth appropriate \nbudgetary levels for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2011; which was \nordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While various public housing developments suffer from \n     serious crime problems, many have made significant progress \n     in reducing crime through initiatives funded by the Public \n     Housing Drug Elimination Program (PHDEP).\n       (2) PHDEP was first established in 1988 under former \n     President George Bush and the former Secretary of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, Jack Kemp, and \n     has enjoyed strong bipartisan support since its inception.\n       (3) PHDEP funds a wide variety of anticrime initiatives, \n     that include--\n       (A) the employment of security personnel and investigators;\n       (B) the reimbursement of local law enforcement agencies for \n     additional security; (C) drug education and prevention, \n     intervention, and treatment programs;\n       (D) voluntary resident patrols; and\n       (E) physical improvements designed to enhance security, \n     including fences and cameras.\n       (4) PHDEP has successfully enabled housing authorities to \n     work cooperatively with residents, local officials, police \n     departments, community groups, Boys and Girls Clubs, drug \n     counseling centers, and other community-based organizations \n     to develop locally-supported anticrime initiatives.\n       (5) The Internet web site of the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development has stated that the program's ``success is \n     rooted in the fact that the people respond better and become \n     more involved in something they have helped to build''.\n       (6) In addition to providing direct funding for anticrime \n     initiatives, PHDEP has developed housing authorities leverage \n     funding from other sources that might otherwise be \n     unavailable, such as funding for local banks, Rotary and \n     Kiwanis Clubs, and private foundations.\n       (7) A portion of funding allocated to the PHDEP is also \n     used to reduce crime in privately-owned, publicly assisted \n     housing, and assisted housing on Indian reservations, which \n     also can suffer from serious crime problems.\n       (8) The Internet web site of the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development has pointed out that ``in several of the \n     Nation's largest public housing authorities--largest in terms \n     of unit size--the rate of crime has fallen since the mid-\n     1990's, even though the crime rate in the respective \n     surrounding communities increased. And know that crime levels \n     in many housing authorities are dropping, in both absolute \n     and percentage terms. These are merely the successes that we \n     can measure. There are many more that are simply \n     immeasurable.''.\n       (9) Congress has recognized the success of the PHDEP by \n     increasing program funding from $8,200,000 in fiscal year \n     1989 to $310,000,000 in fiscal year 2001.\n       (10) Evicting residents who engage in unlawful activity can \n     help reduce crime, but much of the crime in public housing is \n     perpetrated by nonresidents, and evictions must be \n     supplemented by the more comprehensive anticrime approach \n     supported by the PHDEP.\n       (11) Public housing authorities could use operating \n     subsidies to fund some anticrime initiatives under applicable \n     law, but those subsidies are based on a formula that does not \n     account for PHDEP eligible activities and are inadequate to \n     fund most of the anticrime initiatives supported by the \n     program, and PHDEP has the added advantage of requiring \n     public housing authorities to develop and implement anticrime \n     plans with the support and participation of residents and \n     local communities, which has proved critical in ensuring the \n     effectiveness of such plans.\n       (12) While, as with any program of its size, there have \n     been reports of isolated problems, PHDEP generally has been \n     well run and free of the widespread abuses that have plagued \n     other housing programs in the past, in part because of the \n     broad participation of residents and local communities, and \n     because the program has required housing authorities to \n     provide comprehensive plans before\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\n     receiving funds, and complete reports on their progress.\n       (13) During the process leading to his confirmation, the \n     Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, \n     Mel Martinez, stated in a written response to a question \n     posed by Senator Jon S. Corzine that, ``HUD's Public Housing \n     Drug Elimination Program, PHDEP, supports a wide variety of \n     efforts by public and Indian housing authorities to reduce or \n     eliminate drug-related crime in public housing developments. \n     Based on this core purpose, I certainly support the \n     program.''.\n       (14) PHDEP is critical not only to millions of public and \n     assisted housing residents, most of whom are hard working, \n     law abiding citizens, but also to surrounding communities, \n     residents of which also suffer if neighboring housing \n     developments are plagued with high rates of crime.\n       (15) Continued funding of PHDEP would demonstrate that the \n     Nation is serious about maintaining its commitment to \n     reducing the problem of crime in public housing.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) reducing crime in public housing should be a priority; \n     and\n       (2) the successful Public Housing Drug Elimination Program \n     should be fully funded.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 249.

SALES TAX DEDUCTION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) in 1986, the ability to deduct state and local sales \n     taxes was eliminated from the Federal tax code;\n       (2) the States of Tennessee, Texas, Wyoming, Washington, \n     Florida, Nevada, and South Dakota have no state income tax;\n       (3) the citizens of those seven states continue to be \n     treated unfairly because they are required to pay \n     significantly more in taxes to the federal government than \n     similarly situated taxpayers living in states that raise \n     revenue primarily through an income tax;\n       (4) the federal tax code provides preferential treatment to \n     citizens of states with state and local income taxes over \n     those without state and local income taxes;\n       (5) the current federal tax code infringes upon states' \n     rights to tax their citizens as they see fit, because the \n     federal tax code treats state and local sales taxes \n     differently than state and local income taxes; and\n       (6) the current and projected non-Social Security budget \n     surpluses provide the opportunity to restore equity to the \n     federal tax code by allowing taxpayers to deduct either their \n     state and local sales taxes or their state and local income \n     taxes on their federal tax returns, but not both.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Committee on Finance should consider legislation to \n     make state and local sales taxes deductible against federal \n     income taxes, as are state and local income taxes now.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 265.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A BUDGET THAT \n                   PRESERVES AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historic economic growth that the Nation \n     experienced over the past decade has largely been driven by \n     the increased productivity of American workers and by \n     technological advances:\n       (2) the Federal budget is an essential tool for responsible \n     economic stewardship, both in providing effective short-term \n     economic stimulus, and in promoting the long-term development \n     of human resources and scientific research that are essential \n     to preserve the Nation's economic health; and\n       (3) timely Federal tax and spending decisions have the \n     capacity to produce further gains in productivity by building \n     a better educated workforce, and to produce further \n     scientific and technological breakthroughs by supporting \n     ongoing research and development.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) calendar year 2001 taxes are reduced by $70,000,000,000 \n     in a manner that provides every taxpayer with a relatively \n     equal amount of tax savings as expeditiously as practicable \n     to provide the economy with an immediate stimulus;\n       (2) a plan increasing the level of exemption for property \n     subject to the estate tax to $2,000,000 immediately and \n     $4,000,000 over the decade, estimated to cost $66,000,000,000 \n     between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2011, is substituted \n     for the Administration's proposal to repeal the estate tax at \n     a cost of $267,000,000,000 over 10 years;\n       (3) the $200,000,000,000 that is saved as a result of \n     substituting estate tax reform for repeal is used to \n     strengthen the Nation's economy and keep it strong over the \n     next decade by increasing budget authority by the following \n     amounts over the amounts that were proposed at the outset of \n     the Senate debate on the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution:\n       (A) Function 250, General Science, Space and Technology, is \n     increased by $30,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, \n     including $1,500,000,000 next year, to continue advancing \n     science and technology through civilian research conducted \n     under the auspices of the National Science Foundation, the \n     National Aeronautic and Space Administration, and the \n     Department of Energy;\n       (B) Function 370, Commerce and Housing Credit, is increased \n     by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $188,000,000 next year, to continue Department of Commerce \n     initiatives that help small businesses create and use \n     technology, including the Advanced Technology Program and the \n     Manufacturing Extension Partnership;\n       (C) Function 450, Community and Regional Development, is \n     increased by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $300,000,000 next year, to clean and develop abandoned \n     industrial sites in communities throughout the Nation under \n     the Brownfields revitalization program administered by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (D) Function 500, Education, Training, Employment, and \n     Social Services, is increased by $20,000,000,000 over the \n     next 10 years, including $2,000,000,000 next year, to support \n     the worker training needed to make economic opportunities \n     available to all over the next decade, and this amendment \n     also secures the resources that will be necessary for funding \n     the levels contained in Amendment 185;\n       (E) Function 600, Income Security, is increased by \n     $14,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $2,180,000,000 next year, to ensure that the Nation's \n     Unemployment Insurance System responds to the needs of the \n     modern workforce in times of economic uncertainty;\n       (4) equally important to the Nation's continued economic \n     health, the tax cuts authorized under this resolution should \n     be structured to include provisions that would--\n       (A) make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent;\n       (B) enable taxpayers to deduct college tuition for income \n     tax purposes;\n       (C) promote energy conservation and development of \n     renewable and alternative energy sources;\n       (D) encourage low-income working families to save and build \n     assets, including a first home, small business, and a post-\n     secondary education, through Individual Development Accounts;\n       (E) bridge the digital divide in small businesses;\n       (F) encourage employers to make remedial education \n     available to employees; and\n       (G) adjust tax depreciation periods to accurately reflect \n     the useful life of high-technology capital equipment;\n       (5) tax cuts provided to individual taxpayers under this \n     resolution should be fairly distributed among all Federal \n     taxpayers, considering the percentage of total Federal taxes \n     paid by individuals, including income, payroll, and excise \n     taxes; and\n       (6) tax cuts authorized under this resolution should not be \n     backloaded so as to either deprive the economy of the greater \n     short-term stimulus benefits of evenly distributing tax cuts \n     over the decade, or to distort the true size of tax cuts in \n     later years.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 271.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A BUDGET THAT \n                   PRESERVES AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historic economic growth that the Nation \n     experienced over the past decade has largely been driven by \n     the increased productivity of American workers and by \n     technological advances;\n       (2) the Federal budget is an essential tool for responsible \n     economic stewardship, both in providing effective short-term \n     economic stimulus, and in promoting the long-term development \n     of human resources and scientific research that are essential \n     to preserve the Nation's economic health; and\n       (3) timely Federal tax and spending decisions have the \n     capacity to produce further gains in productivity by building \n     a better educated workforce, and to produce further \n     scientific and technological breakthroughs by supporting \n     ongoing research and development.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) calendar year 2001 taxes are reduced by $70,000,000,000 \n     in a manner that provides every taxpayer with a relatively \n     equal amount of tax savings as expeditiously as practicable \n     to provide the economy with an immediate stimulus;\n       (2) $70,000,000,000 is used to strengthen the Nation's \n     economy and keep it strong over the next decade by increasing \n     budget authority by the following amounts over the amounts \n     that were proposed at the outset of the Senate debate on the \n     fiscal year 2002 budget resolution:\n       (A) Function 250, General Science, Space and Technology, is \n     increased by $30,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, \n     including $1,500,000,000 next year, to advance science and \n     technology through civilian research conducted under the \n     auspices of the National Science Foundation, the National \n     Aeronautic and Space Administration, and the Department of \n     Energy;\n       (B) Function 370, Commerce and Housing Credit, is increased \n     by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $188,000,000 next year, to continue Department of Commerce \n     initiatives that help small businesses create and use \n     technology, including the Advanced Technology Program and the \n     Manufacturing Extension Partnership;\n       (C) Function 450, Community and Regional Development, is \n     increased by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $300,000,000 next year, to clean and develop abandoned \n     industrial sites in communities throughout the Nation under \n     the Brownfields revitalization program administered by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (D) Function 500, Education, Training, Employment, and \n     Social Services, is increased by $20,000,000,000 over the \n     next 10 years, including $2,000,000,000 next year, to support \n     the worker training needed to make economic opportunities \n     available to all over the next decade;\n       (E) Function 600, Income Security, is increased by \n     $14,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $2,180,000,000 next year, to ensure that the Nation's \n     Unemployment Insurance System responds to the needs of the \n     modern workforce in times of economic uncertainty;\n       (3) equally important to the Nation's continued economic \n     health, the tax cuts authorized under this resolution should \n     be structured to include provisions that would--\n       (A) make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent;\n       (B) enable taxpayers to deduct college tuition for income \n     tax purposes;\n       (C) promote energy conservation and development of \n     renewable and alternative energy sources;\n       (D) encourage low-income working families to save and build \n     assets, including a first home, small business, and a post-\n     secondary education, through Individual Development Accounts;\n       (E) bridge the digital divide in small businesses;\n       (F) encourage employers to make remedial education \n     available to employees; and\n       (G) adjust tax depreciation periods to accurately reflect \n     the useful life of high-technology capital equipment.\n       (4) tax cuts provided to individual taxpayers under this \n     resolution should be fairly distributed among all Federal \n     taxpayers, considering the percentage of total Federal taxes \n     paid by individuals, including income, payroll, and excise \n     taxes; and\n       (5) tax cuts authorized under this resolution should not be \n     backloaded so as to either deprive the economy of the greater \n     short-term stimulus benefits of evenly distributing tax cuts \n     over the decade, or to distort the true size of the tax cuts \n     in later years.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 272.

Res. 83) establishing the congressional budget for the United \nStates Government for fiscal year 2002, revising the congressional \nbudget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2001, and \nsetting forth appropriate budgetary levels for each of fiscal years \n2003 through 2011; which was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE ENACTMENT OF A \n                   PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President on February 7, 2001, presented the \n     following principles by which he will gauge any Patient's \n     Bill of Rights legislation:\n       (A) A Federal Patients' Bill of Rights should ensure that \n     every person enrolled in a health plan enjoys strong patient \n     protections. Because many States have passed patient \n     protection laws that are appropriate for their States, \n     deference should be given to these State laws and to the \n     traditional authority of States to regulate health insurance.\n       (B) A Federal Patients' Bill of Rights should provide \n     patient protections such as--\n       (i) access to emergency room and specialty care;\n       (ii) direct access to obstetricians, gynecologists and \n     pediatricians;\n       (iii) access to needed prescription drugs and approved \n     clinical trials;\n       (iv) access to health plan information;\n       (v) a prohibition of gag clauses;\n       (vi) consumer choice; and\n       (vii) continuity of care protections.\n       (C) Patients should have the right to appeal a health \n     plan's decision to deny care through both internal review and \n     independent, binding external review.\n       (D) Slow and costly litigation should be a last resort. \n     Patients should exhaust their appeals process first and \n     thereby allow independent medical experts to make medical \n     decisions and ensure that patients receive necessary medical \n     care without the expense or delay of going to court.\n       (E) After an independent review decision is rendered, \n     patients should be allowed to hold their health plans liable \n     in Federal court if they have been wrongly denied needed \n     medical care.\n       (F) Employers, many of whom are struggling to offer health \n     insurance coverage to their employees, should be shielded \n     from unnecessary and frivolous lawsuits and should not be \n     subject to multiple lawsuits in State court. Increased \n     litigation will only result in higher health care costs, \n     potentially forcing employers to drop employee health \n     coverage altogether. Only employers who retain responsibility \n     for, and make, final medical decisions should be subject to \n     litigation.\n       (G) Americans want meaningful remedies, not a windfall for \n     trial lawyers resulting in expensive health care premiums and \n     unaffordable health coverage. To protect patients' rights \n     without encouraging excessive litigation, damages should be \n     subject to reasonable caps.\n       (2) Rapid changes in the health care marketplace have \n     impacted the confidence of Americans in the health system of \n     the United States.\n       (3) American consumers want more convenience, fewer \n     hassles, more choices, and better service from their health \n     insurance plans.\n       (4) All Americans deserve quality-driven health care that \n     is supported by sound science and evidence-based medicine.\n       (5) Patients should receive the health care benefits that \n     they have been promised.\n       (6) As Congress considers health care legislation, it must \n     first commit to ``do no harm'' to health care quality, \n     patient access to health coverage, and the evolving health \n     care marketplace.\n       (7) American businesses who voluntarily provide health care \n     benefits to their employees stated that ``A Patients' Bill of \n     Rights that allows lawsuits against employers would force \n     many to re-evaluate their roles in voluntarily offering \n     health care coverage to their employees. For some businesses, \n     their only option to avoid costly litigation would be to stop \n     offering coverage altogether.''.\n       (8) Health care costs have begun to rise significantly in \n     the past year. According to a Deloitte and Touch study of \n     private employer health care coverage, health care costs \n     increased by 12.4 percent in 2000, well above the 9 percent \n     increase that was anticipated. Further, the survey predicts a \n     12.7 percent increase for 2001.\n       (9) When health insurance premiums rise, Americans lose \n     health insurance coverage. Studies indicate that a 1 percent \n     increase in private health insurance premiums will be \n     associated with an increase in the number of persons without \n     health insurance of about 250,000 to 300,000 persons.\n       (10) There are 7,300,000 Americans who have access to \n     employer subsidized health insurance coverage today but \n     decline such coverage because they cannot afford the cost-\n     sharing requirements. As costs increase, employers tend to \n     shift costs to employees which has a direct, negative impact \n     on employee enrollment rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Senate should consider and pass legislation that \n     meets the President's principles for a Patients' Bill of \n     Rights that--\n       (1) does not make health care unaffordable;\n       (2) encourages, not discourages, employers to offer health \n     care; and\n       (3) empowers doctors, not lawyers or health maintenance \n     organization bureaucrats, to make medical decisions.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 292.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NEED FOR A BUDGET THAT \n                   PRESERVES AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STRENGTH.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the historic economic growth that the Nation \n     experienced over the past decade has largely been driven by \n     the increased productivity of American workers and by \n     technological advances;\n       (2) the Federal budget is an essential tool for responsible \n     economic stewardship, both in providing effective short-term \n     economic stimulus, and in promoting the long-term development \n     of human resources and scientific research that are essential \n     to preserve the Nation's economic health; and\n       (3) timely Federal tax and spending decisions have the \n     capacity to produce further gains in productivity by building \n     a better educated workforce, and to produce further \n     scientific and technologicalbreakthroughs by supporting \n     ongoing research and development.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that--\n       (1) calendar year 2001 taxes are reduced by $70,000,000,000 \n     in a manner that provides every taxpayer with a relatively \n     equal amount of tax savings as expeditiously as practicable \n     to provide the economy with an immediate stimulus;\n       (2) a plan increasing the level of exemption for property \n     subject to the estate tax to $2,000,000 immediately and \n     $4,000,000 over the decade, estimated to cost $66,000,000,000 \n     between fiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2011, is substituted \n     for the Administration's proposal to repeal the estate tax at \n     a cost of $267,000,000,000 over 10 years;\n       (3) the $200,000,000,000 that is saved as a result of \n     substituting estate tax reform for repeal is used to \n     strengthen the Nation's economy and keep it strong over the \n     next decade by increasing budget authority by the following \n     amounts over the amounts that were proposed at the outset of \n     the Senate debate on the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution.\n       (A) Function 250, General Science, Space and Technology, is \n     increased by $30,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, \n     including $1,500,000,000 next year, to continue advancing \n     science and technology through civilian research conducted \n     under the auspices\n\n[[Page S3603]]\n\n     of the National Science Foundation, the National \n     Aeronautic and Space Administration, and the Department of \n     Energy;\n       (B) Function 370, Commerce and Housing Credit, is increased \n     by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $188,000,000 next year, to continue Department of Commerce \n     initiatives that help small businesses create and use \n     technology, including the Advanced Technology Program and the \n     Manufacturing Extension Partnership;\n       (C) Function 450, Community and Regional Development, is \n     increased by $3,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $300,000,000 next year, to clean and develop abandoned \n     industrial sites in communities throughout the Nation under \n     the Brownfields revitalization program administered by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (D) Function 500, Education, Training, Employment, and \n     Social Services, is increased by $150,000,000,000 over the \n     next 10 years, including $12,000,000,000 next year, to ensure \n     that the kind of education and training needed to make \n     economic opportunities available to all over the next decade, \n     including--\n       (i) $65,000,000,000 for aid to disadvantaged students under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act;\n       (ii) $12,000,000,000 to improve teacher quality;\n       (iii) $10,000,000,000 to continue reducing class sizes;\n       (iv) $7,000,000,000 to ensure access to quality bilingual \n     education;\n       (v) $4,000,000,000 to continue repairing and modernizing \n     schools;\n       (vi) $2,000,000,000 to improve teacher training under title \n     II of the Higher Education Act;\n       (vii) $27,000,000,000 to increase the maximum Pell Grants \n     to at least $4,700;\n       (viii) $2,000,000,000 for mentoring of low-income youth who \n     have worked to prepare themselves for college;\n       (ix) $20,000,000,000 to expand employment training \n     opportunities under the Workforce Investment Act and other \n     programs specifically designed to assist workers to develop \n     technology skills; and\n       (x) $1,000,000,000 to assist institutions of higher \n     education in conducting business incubator initiatives;\n       (E) Function 600, Income Security, is increased by \n     $14,000,000,000 over the next 10 years, including \n     $2,180,000,000 next year, to ensure that the Nation's \n     Unemployment Insurance System responds to the needs of the \n     modern workforce in times of economic uncertainty;\n       (4) equally important to the Nation's continued economic \n     health, the tax cuts authorized under this resolution should \n     be structured to include provisions that would--\n       (A) make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent;\n       (B) enable taxpayers to deduct college tuition for income \n     tax purposes;\n       (C) promote energy conservation and development of \n     renewable and alternative energy sources;\n       (D) encourage low-income working families to save and build \n     assets, including a first home, small business, and a post-\n     secondary education, through Individual Development Accounts;\n       (E) bridge the digital divide in small businesses;\n       (F) encourage employers to make remedial education \n     available to employees; and\n       (G) adjust tax depreciation periods to accurately reflect \n     the useful life of high-technology capital equipment;\n       (5) tax cuts provided to individual taxpayers under this \n     resolution should be fairly distributed among all Federal \n     taxpayers, considering the percentage of total Federal taxes \n     paid by individuals, including income, payroll, and excise \n     taxes; and\n       (6) tax cuts authorized under this resolution should not be \n     backloaded to as to either deprive the economy of the greater \n     short-term stimulus benefits of evenly distributing tax cuts \n     over the decade, or to distort the true size of the tax cuts \n     in later years.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 293.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Animal Disease Risk \n     Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n     healthy livestock herds;\n       (2) managing the risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine \n     spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United \n     States may require billions of dollars for remedial \n     activities by consumers, producers, and distributors of \n     livestock and animal and blood products;\n       (3) the potential introduction of those diseases into the \n     United States would cause devastating financial losses to--\n       (A) the agriculture industry and other economic sectors; \n     and\n       (B) United States trade in the affected animals and animal \n     products;\n       (4) foot and mouth disease is a severe and highly \n     contagious viral infection affecting cattle, deer, goats, \n     sheep, swine, and other animals;\n       (5) the most effective means of eradicating foot and mouth \n     disease is by the slaughter of affected animals;\n       (6) while foot and mouth disease was eradicated in the \n     United States in 1929, the virus could be reintroduced by--\n       (A) a single infected animal, an animal product, or a \n     person carrying the virus;\n       (B) an act of terrorism; or\n       (C) other means;\n       (7) once introduced, foot and mouth disease can spread \n     quickly through--\n       (A) exposure to aerosols from infected animals;\n       (B) direct contact with infected animals; and\n       (C) contact with contaminated feed, equipment, or humans \n     harboring the virus or carrying the virus on their clothing;\n       (8) foot and mouth disease is endemic to more than \\2/3\\ of \n     the world and is considered to be widespread in parts of \n     Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America;\n       (9) foot and mouth disease occurs in over 7 different \n     serotypes and 60 subtypes;\n       (10) as foot and mouth disease outbreaks have occurred, the \n     United States has banned the importation of live ruminants \n     and swine and many animal products from countries affected by \n     foot and mouth disease;\n       (11) recently, the United States has implemented bans in \n     response to outbreaks in Argentina, the European Union, and \n     Taiwan;\n       (12) although United States exclusion programs have been \n     successful at keeping foot and mouth disease out of the \n     United States since 1929, recent outbreaks in Argentina, the \n     European Union, and Taiwan are placing an unprecedented \n     strain on our animal health system;\n       (13) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a transmissible, \n     neuro-degenerative disease found in cattle;\n       (14) in cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the \n     active agent is found primarily in the brain and spinal cord \n     and has not been found in commonly consumed beef products;\n       (15) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is thought to have an \n     incubation period of several years but is ultimately fatal to \n     cattle within weeks of onset of the active disease;\n       (16) bovine spongiform encephalopathy was first widely \n     found in 1986 in cattle in the United Kingdom;\n       (17) bovine spongiform encephalopathy-carrying cattle have \n     been found in cattle in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, \n     Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \n     Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland;\n       (18) cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy \n     originating from the United Kingdom have been found and \n     intercepted in Canada;\n       (19) since 1989, the Secretary of Agriculture has \n     prohibited the importation of live grazing animals from \n     countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been \n     found in cattle;\n       (20) other products derived from grazing animals, such as \n     blood meal, bonemeal, fat, fetal bovine serum, glands, meat-\n     and-bone meal, and offal, are prohibited from entry, except \n     under special conditions or under permits issued by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture for scientific or research purposes;\n       (21) on December 12, 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     extended those restrictions to include all countries in \n     Europe because of concerns about widespread risk factors and \n     inadequate surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy;\n       (22) on December 7, 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     prohibited all imports of rendered animal protein products \n     from Europe;\n       (23) Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is a human spongiform \n     encephalopathy;\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\n       (24) on March 20, 1996, the Spongiform Encephalopathy \n     Advisory Committee of the United Kingdom announced the \n     identification of 10 cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-\n     Jacob disease;\n       (25) all 10 patients developed onsets of the disease in \n     1994 or 1995;\n       (26) scientific experts (including scientists at the \n     Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human \n     Services, and the World Health Organization) are studying the \n     possible link (including potential routes of transmission) \n     between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant \n     Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease;\n       (27) from October 1996 to December 2000, 87 cases of \n     variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease have been reported in the \n     United Kingdom, 3 cases in France, and 1 case in Ireland; and\n       (28) to reduce the risk of human spongiform \n     encephalopathies in the United States, the Commissioner of \n     Food and Drugs has--\n       (A) banned individuals who lived in Great Britain for at \n     least 180 days since 1980 from donating blood in the United \n     States; and\n       (B) established regulations that prohibit the feeding of \n     most animal-derived proteins to grazing animals.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the \n     people of the United States and Congress with information \n     concerning--\n       (1) actions by Federal agencies to prevent foot and mouth \n     disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related \n     diseases;\n       (2) the sufficiency of legislative authority to prevent or \n     control foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform \n     encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United States;\n       (3) the economic impacts associated with the potential \n     introduction of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform \n     encephalopathy, and related diseases into the United States; \n     and\n       (4) the risks to public health from possible links between \n     bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other spongiform \n     encephalopathies to human illnesses.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Preliminary Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Agriculture shall \n     submit to the Committees and Subcommittees described in \n     paragraph (2) a preliminary report concerning--\n       (A) coordinated interagency activities to assess, prevent, \n     and control the spread of foot and mouth disease and bovine \n     spongiform encephalopathy in the United States;\n       (B) sources of information from the Federal Government \n     available to the public on foot and mouth disease and bovine \n     spongiform encephalopathy;

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 67) commending the Blue Devils of \n     Duke University for winning the 2001 National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association Mens Basketball Championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, Monday night, April 2, I was one of the \ncountless North Carolinians--along with students, alumni, and admirers \nfrom across the country--watching the Blue Devils of Duke University \nwin the 2001 NCAA Men's College Basketball National Championship.\n  The talented young men who make up Duke's remarkable team have \nassembled a fine record in winning its third championship in the last \neleven years.\n  Mr. President, Duke University's Men's Basketball program has indeed \nachieved a special place in sports history.\n  North Carolinians have become accustomed to outstanding basketball \nteams representing our state during the past quarter century. In \naddition to Duke's three National Championships, the North Carolina Tar \nHeels brought home the trophy in 1982 and 1993, while the North \nCarolina State Wolfpack won in 1974 and again in the memorable 1983 \ntournament when coached by the brave and inspirational Jim Valvano, \nwhom is missed greatly.\n  But on the April 2 night, after a hard-fought battle with the fine \nWildcats of Arizona University, the Duke Blue Devils emerged \nvictorious, 82-72. Led by All-Americans Shane Battier and Jason \nWilliams and boosted by a stellar performance by sophomore sharpshooter \nMike Dunleavy, this Duke team is an example of what can be achieved \nthrough hard work and dedication.\n  Mr. President, the 2001 Duke team breezed through the season with \ncustomary excellence, finishing tied for first place in the Atlantic \nCoast Conference regular season, winning or sharing this honor for an \nunprecedented fifth time in five years. Duke then proceeded to win the \nACC championship for the third year in a row.\n  Coach Mike Krzyzewski has built a much admired program during his 21 \nseasons at Duke. He recruits talented and committed student-athletes \nand molds them into a tightly-knit basketball ``family''. His \ndedication to the team members has been rewarded with long-lasting \nrelationships between coach and player.\n  ``Coach K's'' guidance is often cited by his former players as \ncrucial to each of them realizing his potential both on and off the \ncourt.\n  This program has earned Coach Krzyzewski and his teams not only three \nnational championships, but seven appearances in National Championship \ngames during the past 16 years.\n  The Duke program is a meaningful example for Americans, especially \nyounger Americans, of determination, perseverance, and success in North \nCarolina. Day in and day out, whether in the classroom or on the court, \nthe members of this team have shown the country what it takes to be \nnational champions.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 67) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 67\n\n       Whereas the 2000-2001 Duke University Blue Devils' men's \n     basketball team (referred to in this resolution as the ``Duke \n     Blue Devils'') had a spectacular season;\n       Whereas the Duke Blue Devils finished the regular season \n     with a 26-4 record, claiming a record 5 straight finishes in \n     first place during the Atlantic Coast Conference regular \n     season;\n       Whereas the Duke Blue Devils won the 2001 Atlantic Coast \n     Conference Tournament Championship, winning the championship \n     of that tournament for the third year in a row;\n       Whereas the Duke Blue Devils are the first men's basketball \n     team to be a number 1 seed in the National Collegiate \n     Athletic Association's Men's Basketball Tournament during 4 \n     consecutive seasons since that association began seeding \n     teams in 1979;\n       Whereas the Duke Blue Devils amassed the most wins, 133, in \n     a 4-year period of any National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association men's basketball team in history;\n       Whereas Shane Battier received the 2001 Naismith Award as \n     men's college basketball Player of the Year;\n       Whereas Coach Mike Krzyzewski has taken the Duke Blue \n     Devils to 7 national championship games in 16 years;\n       Whereas Coach Krzyzewski led the Duke Blue Devils to the \n     team's third national championship;\n       Whereas the Duke Blue Devils are a fine example of academic \n     and athletic dedication and success;\n       Whereas the team's success during the 2000-2001 season was \n     truly a team accomplishment; and\n       Whereas the Duke Blue Devils won the 2001 National \n     Collegiate Athletic Association Men's Basketball \n     Championship: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate commends the Blue Devils of Duke \n     University for winning the 2001 National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association Men's Basketball Championship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/05/senate-section/article/S3634-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3634-S3636]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          MAD COW AND RELATED DISEASES PREVENTION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) it is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n     healthy livestock herds;\n       (2) managing the risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine \n     spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United \n     States may require billions of dollars for remedial \n     activities by consumers, producers, and distributors of \n     livestock, and animal, and blood products;\n       (3) the potential introduction of those diseases into the \n     United States would cause devastating financial losses to--\n       (A) the agriculture industry and other economic sectors;
