Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the Steel \nRevitalization Act of 2001. This is the companion measure to H.R. 808 \nwhich, as of this moment, has 189 cosponsors in the House of \nRepresentatives. The measure represents a comprehensive approach to a \nserious crisis which is facing our domestic iron ore and steel \nindustry.\n  Several of the provisions contained in this act are ones that my \ncolleagues in the bipartisan Steel Caucus have introduced in the \nSenate. I particularly thank Senators Rockefeller and Specter for their \nwork in cochairing this caucus, and Senator Byrd for his unflinching \nsupport of the entire steel industry and his creative efforts on behalf \nof the industry's working families. A special thank you to Senator \nRockefeller, who has been absolutely the leader on this issue.\n  The Steel Revitalization Act includes the following components:\n  First, there is import relief. We go back to a 5-year period of \nquantitative restrictions on the import of iron ore. We go back prior \nto the import surge in 1997. We go to a 3-year average. That is where \nwe hold the line. Between February and March, 2001, there was a 40-\npercent surge in the import of steel or semifinished steel, way under \nthe cost of production, constituting unfair trade and putting people \nout of work.\n  Second, there is creation of a steelworker retiree health care fund \nwhich is administered by the steelworker retiree health care board at \nthe Department of Labor. This fund would be underwritten through a 1.5-\npercent surcharge on the sale of all steel products in the United \nStates, both imported and domestic.\n  One of the awful things about what is going on is many of the \nretirees worked their whole life, thought they had health care \ncoverage, and are terrified they will not have the health care \ncoverage. A 70-year-old struggling with cancer now is worried there \nwill be no health care coverage.\n  Third, we have the enhancement of the current Steel Loan Guarantee \nProgram which provides the steel companies greater access to funds \nneeded to invest in capital improvements to take advantage of the \nlatest technological advancements.\n  Finally, we have the creation of a $500 million grant program at the \nDepartment of Commerce to help defray the costs of environmental \nmitigation and the restructuring as a result of\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nconsolidation--again, assuming these companies make a commitment to \ninvest in our country; again, assuming these companies make a \ncommitment to the workers.\n  I think all Senators can appreciate this legislation. The Iron Range \nof Minnesota, and if you think of our sister State of Michigan, this is \na part of the United States of America with a proud history of \nproviding key raw materials to the producers of steel for well over a \ncentury. In these taconite mines are some of the hardest working people \nyou ever want to meet. LTV has closed down in Hoyt Lakes; 1,400 miners \nlost their work. They are steelworkers, but they work in the mines. \nThese were good, middle-class jobs. It is not just these workers who \nhave lost their jobs; it has the ripple effect on all the small \nbusinesses, all the subcontractors, all the suppliers--all the \nfamilies.\n\n  I am in schools all the time. There is such pain, such concern about \nthe future of these families and concern for the future of their \nchildren. From my point of view, and I know I speak for Senator Dayton, \nthere is probably not a more important piece of legislation to \nintroduce.\n  The introduction of a piece of legislation is not symbolic politics. \nIt does not mean it passes. We have a lot of work cut out for us, but I \nwill say to my colleague from Virginia, I thank publicly on the floor \nof the Senate--I certainly have called her--Secretary of Labor Chao. We \nare, again, in a situation right now where there is a lot of economic \npain, a lot of economic desperation. The Secretary of Labor has \nprovided the workers up there with at least some relief, which was \nextremely important. We were so hopeful we could get trade adjustment \nassistance benefits. The Secretary of Labor granted us an additional \nyear, above and beyond unemployment benefits that workers receive \nthrough the State of Minnesota.\n  It is additional money for job relocation. For workers and their \nfamilies to get that trade adjustment assistance is a lifeline. It \ngives them more time. It gives them an opportunity to think about what \nladder there is for career development. It gives them some financial \nassistance for their families. I have told Secretary Chao--I don't know \nif I will get her in trouble with the administration by being so \nglowing about what I have to say about her--I so appreciate it and so \ndo the people in the State of Minnesota. I want to publicly thank her.\n  I also want to say we are now waiting, of course, for the \nadministration on a decision--Secretary Evans will make a decision \nsoon--as to whether or not we will be taking some trade action to \nreally make sure we have a future for this industry. The next big \ndecision is going to be in mid-June about whether or not the taconite \nworkers on the Iron Range in Minnesota are going to have a future. This \nindustry will not survive if it is continually faced with unfair trade \npractices, if it continues to face this import surge of slab or \nfinished steel. Our taconite workers on the Iron Range of Minnesota ask \nnothing more than to have a level playing field. We wait for a decision \nmid-June.\n  I think steelworkers and industrial workers all across the country--\nand I think they will have a lot of allies--will in a strong voice say \nyou have to take some action. For the Iron Range in Minnesota, \nnortheast Minnesota, time is not neutral. Time moves on. It is \nextremely important, above and beyond this lifeline assistance, that we \nget serious about a fair trade policy so these workers and their \nfamilies have a future.\n  There is companion legislation in the House. Very important work has \nbeen done by Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter. I think we can \nget some strong bipartisan support, but it is not going to be enough to \njust introduce a bill. We will need action from the administration and \nwe will need legislative action if there is to be a future for this \nextremely important industry--which, by the way, I think is essential \nto our national security.\n  This legislation is legislation near and dear to my heart because it \nis so connected to the lives and people I truly love, that is to say \nthe steelworkers and their families on the Iron Range of the State of \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will please call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask consent to speak in morning business for 15 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I want to speak this morning about international trade \nand our growing and troubling trade deficit. In March, the merchandise \ntrade deficit surprised economists, jumping to $37.6 billion in that \nmonth alone. That is the latest month for which we have data. In March \nimports into this country increased to $101 billion, while American \nexports decreased to $64 billion.\n  This is a very serious problem. The trade deficit continues to \nballoon. We had a $450 billion merchandise trade deficit last year and \nit continues to grow and grow. It increases our indebtedness in this \ncountry. Unlike a budget deficit, about which economists over strong \ncoffee can make the point that we owe to ourselves, you cannot make the \npoint that our trade deficit is owed to ourselves. It is owed to others \noutside this country and will be and must be repaid one day with a \nlower cost of living in this country. We must get a handle on this \nexploding trade deficit.\n  Let me speak to one portion of the trade issue. We are about to see \nthe administration take a step that I vigorously oppose. I am going to \noffer a piece of legislation today on behalf of myself and my colleague \nfrom Nevada, Senator Reid, that deals with the issue of Mexican trucks \nentering this country under the provisions of NAFTA, the North American \nFree Trade Agreement.\n  What is the issue? We signed a free trade pact with the country of \nMexico. It has not turned out very well, as a matter of fact. We had a \ntrade surplus with Mexico when we signed the trade pact. Now we have a \n$24 billion trade deficit with Mexico. So we went from a surplus to a \nvery large and exploding deficit with Mexico.\n  But one aspect of the trade pact with Mexico is the question of \nmovement of goods and individuals back and forth across the boarder and \nespecially the question of Mexican trucks coming into this country. \nPresident Clinton, I believe in violation of NAFTA, prescribed a 20-\nmile zone in which Mexican trucks could haul goods into this country \nfor trade purposes. But they could not go beyond that zone. This \nadministration is about to lift that and provide unrestricted access \ninto this country for Mexican trucks. My legislation will say that is \nnot possible, we will not allow that to happen until and unless the \nAdministration implements certain safeguards to protect those who use \nAmerica's highways.\n  Let me describe why this is important. Do you want to drive down a \nhighway in this country and drive next to a Mexican truck that is \npulling double the load we allow pulled in this country behind our \ntrucks, driven by a driver who is making less than the minimum wage in \nthis country--on average, incidentally, of $7- to $10-a-day salary for \nthat Mexican truck driver; a truck that has not been inspected in most \ncases, if inspected, not inspected to the same standards to which we \ninspect trucks in this country?\n  This is a circumstance where the Mexican trucks are determined to be \nunsafe at the border crossings at which the trucks are inspected. In \nmany cases, 40 percent are turned back because they are unsafe, do not \nmeet standards. Is that what we want to have on American highways? I \ndon't think so.\n  This is what has happened. Mexico threatened, under NAFTA, to sue the \nU.S. for billions of dollars per year in compensation if the U.S. did \nnot lift this longstanding control on allowing Mexican commercial \ntruckers to operate within the United States. President Bush has agreed \nto allow them to operate in the United States beyond the limit, even \nthough the Department of Transportation says it cannot certify\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nthe safety of any, except a tiny fraction, of the Mexican trucks that \nenter this country.\n  This month, in fact, the Department of Transportation's own inspector \ngeneral concluded that the Department of Transportation's enforcement \nprogram cannot reasonably assure the American people of the safety of \nMexican trucks entering this country.\n  Barely 1 percent of the 3.7 million Mexican trucks that enter into \nthe United States are inspected. Of those inspected, 36 percent are \ndeclared out of service for serious safety violations. At the border \ncrossing in El Paso, TX, there are 1,300 trucks that come across every \nsingle day. One inspector is on duty--one--and he or she can inspect \nabout 10 to 14 trucks a day. Most inspectors work only during daylight \nhours, leaving crossings with no inspectors at all during much of the \nday.\n  Now Mexico still lags far behind the United States when it comes to \ntruck safety. They do not have an effective drug and alcohol testing \nprogram for truck drivers as we do. They simply do not have it. They \nhave no hours-of-service regulations and only recently proposed the use \nof logbooks for hours of service. A reporter from the San Francisco \nChronicle recently drove with a Mexican truck driver. They drove 20 to \n21 hours straight--20 to 21 hours. That is significant and also \ndangerous. That cannot happen legally in this country. I do not want \nthat driver on the road next to my family or my neighbors or my friends \nor anyone else in this country who is driving.\n  Right now there is no way for American law enforcement agencies to \naccess a database containing information on Mexican truckers. If a \npolice officer pulls me over to the side of the road or pulls the \nPresiding Officer, from the State of Virginia, over to the side of the \nroad, and asks to see our license, they can put that name into a \ndatabase. They can figure out very quickly what we have or have not \ndone, what is on our driving record and what isn't. If the same police \nofficer pulls over a Mexican truck driver, he will not find any \ninformation on him because it does not exist.\n  Despite these unresolved issues, and despite all of these facts and \nfigures, despite the written objections of 258 Members of the House and \n48 Senators, on both sides of the aisle, the administration has said \nthat the NAFTA trucking provisions should be implementing. They are \nwrong. The provisions should not be implemented until and unless we can \ndemonstrate safety for the American people by allowing these trucks \ninto this country. If we cannot demonstrate safety--and clearly we \ncannot at this point--they should not be allowed in.\n  I am introducing legislation to prohibit the administration from \ngranting operation rights to Mexican motor carriers until we can ensure \nthat they meet the safety standards we require in this country. My bill \nwould require the implementation of inspections and the deployment of \nneeded resources to ensure that the trucks that would come in would \nmeet basic safety standards.\n  This is not some issue where one can say: These people are antitrade, \nand therefore they want to stop trucks from this country or that \ncountry. This is very real. Every day, every hour, we have massive \nnumbers of trucks coming into this country. There is evidence from \nCalifornia and New Mexico and from Arizona. The evidence of the number \nof trucks turned back for serious safety violations is overwhelming.\n  Mexico does not have the same standards. Their drivers can drive 20 \nhours a day and no one will know it. They have no logbooks. They have \nno drug testing. They do not have the same equipment standards as we \ndo. It demonstrates, in my judgment, the concern that many of us have \nabout this unfettered notion of opening up borders without making sure \nwe have adequate safety in place for the American people. I am going to \nintroduce this legislation on behalf of myself and my colleague, \nSenator Reid, from the State of Nevada. And other colleagues I know \nwill join us because there are nearly 50 Members of the Senate who have \nexpressed their reservations about this issue.\n\n  I urge the administration to reconsider this issue. Change your mind \nabout this. The American people don't want to be driving down a highway \nto pull up next to an 18-wheel truck that is hauling a load that is \ntwice as heavy as that which could be hauled by an American trucker in \nthis country, with a driver who has been driving 20 hours, who has \nnever been drug tested, and driving equipment that doesn't meet safety \nspecifications on American roads. That is not what we want on American \nroads and not what we want for the safety of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I am happy to yield to my colleague from Nevada.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I am very happy to join with my colleague from North Dakota \non this most important legislation. He has outlined very clearly the \nproblems we have.\n  Let's think about this. In the United States there are 400,000 \ntrailer truck accidents every year. Keep in mind, we have pretty \nstrong, strict safety standards. Over 14,000 of those accidents involve \nhazardous materials. Do we want to add to that mix unsafe vehicles?\n  The trucks that have accidents in America that are American trucks \nare not unsafe. Those accidents are caused by driver errors, weather \nconditions.\n  We need to move forward on this legislation yesterday, not today. I \ncertainly hope, through administrative fiat, that the President does \nnot allow this to happen. That is our fear. That is what we have heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is really a visionary as far as \nlegislation goes, on what he has focused in making statements in this \nChamber, what he has done as a Senator, and what he has done as a \nMember of the House, focusing attention on our trade deficits. It is a \nstealth monster. Ultimately, if we do not do something about it, it is \ngoing to destroy the economy of this country. It is getting bigger and \nbigger and bigger. As the Senator has outlined with the chart he has \nbehind him, this balloon is going to continue to get bigger and bigger \nand thinner and thinner and finally explode. I say he is a visionary \nbecause he has talked about our trade situation. This legislation in \nregard to dangerous trucks is excellent legislation.\n  Also, we have an amendment pending on the education bill that I think \nsays it all. What it says is we should have the House and the Senate \nhave a joint committee and convene immediately to determine what is \nhappening with the gasoline and fuel prices in this country.\n\n  They expect in California, which is a neighboring State to Nevada, \nthat the price of gasoline will be $3 a gallon this year. If we can \ninspect and investigate the price of chickens, can't we investigate the \nprice of gasoline? Yes, we can.\n  So I say to my friend from North Dakota, I hope that when that \namendment comes up--which was written by the Senator from North Dakota \nand on which I happily joined as a cosponsor--it is adopted \noverwhelmingly. I also acknowledge and appreciate his authoring the \nlegislation that deals with these trucks, in which I happily join.\n  Also, as an aside, I tell him how much I appreciate him being one of \nthe lone voices who talks continually about the dangers of this \nburgeoning debt we have in the form of a trade debt. It is just as \ndangerous as any debt we have. We need to do something about it. But it \nis a difficult issue to understand. It is in the background and people \nreally don't focus on it. I appreciate very much the Senator not \nletting us not focus on it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n  I have a couple minutes remaining. Let me point out what is happening \nwith our trade deficit.\n  As you can see: With Canada, our trade deficit has dramatically \nincreased from 1999 to 2000; China, $83 billion merchandise trade \ndeficit in a year; European Union, $55 billion; Japan $81 billion. \nJapan, a $50 billion-plus trade deficit for us almost forever. Mexico--\nthis used to be a surplus, incidentally--now the trade deficit is $24 \nbillion-plus.\n  We cannot continue to do that. We just cannot continue to run up \nthese kinds of trade deficits.\n  Just for a moment, let me describe some of the circumstances of the \ntrade deficit. When we want to ship apples into Japan, they say the \napples must come from trees that are separated at least 500 feet from \napples on apple trees\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\nin the orchard that are not going to be shipped to Japan. So if we are \ngoing to ship apples to Japan, they have to be in a grove 500 feet away \nfrom other apple groves. What kind of sense is that?\n  We ship T-bone steaks to Japan. Guess what the tariff is after 12 \nyears of an agreement. Twelve years after an agreement with them, the \ntariff is 38.5 percent on beef going into Japan.\n  In Korea, just as an example, we exported 4,400 cars last year. They \nexported 470,000 to us. One might ask the question, Where is the fair \ntrade here? Where is the reciprocal treatment? This country needs to \ndemand of its trading partners that they open their markets to us so we \ncan have fair trade.\n  Our deficit with China is going up, up, way up. It is now $83.8 \nbillion. We take all their trousers and shirts and tennis shoes and \njeans. They ship them into our country, and guess what. When we try to \npenetrate the Chinese market, we get a pitiful amount of exports into \nChina.\n  People say: Hoorah, it is increasing. Hoorah, it is increasing at a \nminuscule level, and we have an $83 billion deficit with them. We have \nto change that.\n  I have other things to say.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for 30 additional seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The President says he now wants fast-track trade \nauthority. Fast-track trade authority to do more of this? Not on my \nwatch. Let's have some trade authority that says when we do trade \nagreements in the future, we do them on behalf of this country's best \ninterests. Maybe we should put some jerseys on those trade negotiators \nthat read: USA. We do that for the Olympians. How about doing it for \ntrade negotiators so they remember for whom they are negotiating.\n  My legislation on Mexican trucking is very important. I encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 30 minutes under the control of the Senator from Wyoming, \nMr. Thomas, or his designee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I ask the Senator from Wyoming if he will yield for \na question?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, some good news came out this week. I \ndon't know how many people saw it. It was a report of the status of the \nsurplus in our accounts for the United States. As it was reported in \nthe Wall Street Journal and other organizations, for the month of April \nof this year, the surplus was $30 billion larger than the surplus for \nApril of last year. For the first 4 months of this year, it showed that \nthe surplus was $41 billion larger than the surplus of the first 4 \nmonths last fiscal year.\n  That is a rather significant event because we are in an economic \nslowdown. As everyone knows, a vibrant economy is the greatest \nmotivator for creating surpluses.\n  There is a lot of fear out there that we may not continue to have \nsurpluses. Since I have been in the Senate, going on my fifth year now, \nevery projection on the status of the budget has understated the income \nto the Federal Government. For the last 3 years, the surplus has \nsubstantially exceeded what OMB and the Congressional Budget Office \nhave projected for the surplus.\n  To me, we have one goal as a Congress and a Government: To try to \nmake sure this economy gets on its feet again and gets humming and \nmakes even more money for the taxpayers and for individual Americans. \nBut at the same time, we have to look at what is happening.\n  The good news is that even in a time of slowdown, we have a real \nsurplus churning out there. We have gone from a gross domestic product \ntake by the Federal Government of 17.6 percent of GDP to 20.6 percent \nof GDP. The Government is taking a larger and larger percentage of \nAmerican wealth to fund governmental programs.\n  That is a historic change. It may not sound like much to go from 17.6 \nto 20.6, but 20.6 represents the highest amount we have taken from the \nAmerican economy for the Government since the height of World War II.\n  What is at work here is an opportunity for the American people to \nsay: Great, we are paying down this debt in record numbers. We are \npaying down all debt that can be paid down without a penalty being paid \non it. We are doing the right thing as far as debt is concerned. We are \nsetting aside money for contingencies, $500 billion or so for \ncontingencies. That is extra spending.\n  Remember, this surplus is calculated above inflation. When they \nfigured how much the surplus would be, they figured in that the \nGovernment would increase spending at the rate of inflation every year. \nSo we have the rate of inflation in there, another $500 billion for \nextra spending, and we are paying down debt at record numbers.\n  It is time for us to have at least this $1.35 trillion tax cut. We \ncan do that. If we do not do that, we will spend more, and we will \ncontinue to take more of the overall wealth of the American economy. It \nwill move us into a system such as those that exist in Europe that some \nin this body admire and want for us.\n  Our economy is more vibrant. Our economy is more productive. Our \npeople have better health care and better incomes than Europeans. Our \nunemployment rate is lower by and large than our competitors, even \nthough they have so many good things to offer their people.\n  We are on the right track. I am pleased with where we are today. \nNothing could give me greater anticipation that within hours, perhaps, \nwe will be able to send to the President of the United States a piece \nof legislation that will represent perhaps the largest tax cut in over \n20 years, that could allow him to fulfill the promise on which he was \nelected to allow the American people to keep a larger portion of their \nwealth, to be able to spend it on their needs for their families, and \nfor their children.\n  It is a great day. I am excited about it. I hope the conferees can \ncomplete their work promptly and we can bring that bill to the floor \nand we can make it law promptly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to talk about taxes, which is the \nfocus of where we are, and prior to that, to mention that despite all \nthe discussions we have had about certain issues, this Senate has \naccomplished quite a bit in the several months we have been in session. \nThat is our task; we ought to be doing that.\n  A number of things have happened. First of all, we abolished the \nClinton ergonomics regulation. We used a technique that allows the \nCongress to bring back regulations that are put in and to review them, \nwhich, quite frankly, is something we ought to be able to do on all \nregulations. I come from Wyoming. I was in the Wyoming Legislature. \nThere, when you have a statute passed by the legislature, the rules are \nthen put in by the appropriate agency, and those rules come back to the \nlegislature to see if, indeed, they are consistent with the purpose of \nthe legislation.\n  That doesn't happen in the Congress. It is too bad. You can pass a \nlaw, and by the time the regulations are in, the concepts under the law \ncan be quite different. In any event, this one was brought back on \nergonomics. It was successfully overhauled in the Congress. That is \ngood.\n  Of course, we approved a deficit reduction budget, a budget that \nstill has more expenditures perhaps than we\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\nought to have. But in any event, it probably is about a 5-percent \nincrease, which is less than the increases of the past number of \nyears--less because when you have a surplus, it is awfully hard to hold \ndown spending. It was an appropriate thing to have this budget that \ndoes reflect at least some control in spending and we are pleased about \nthat.\n  Of course, currently pending and perhaps the most important thing we \nwill do in a very long time will be the tax reduction that is now being \nconsidered by committee. It has passed the Senate as well as the House. \nAnd when the conference committee completes their work, it will be back \nhere for consideration. We are anxious for that to happen.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act was passed as well. We had brownfields \nrevitalization, which is something that has gone on for a very long \ntime that allows lands to be put back into use more easily. We have \nconstruction of a memorial honoring World War II and those who served \nthere. We have intellectual property, a number of things that are quite \nimportant and that have, in fact, been achieved during this relatively \nshort time.\n  So we are looking forward to that. But in the meantime, I am going to \nsoon yield the floor to my friend from Idaho. I believe one of the most \nimportant bills we will be passing in this session of the Congress is \nthe bill to cut tax rates across the board, bury the death tax, fix the \nmarriage penalty, and double the child credit. We can do a lot to make \nthis economy stronger, more fair, and to allow people to utilize more \nof their own money for the purposes upon which they decide.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from the State \nof Wyoming for yielding to me, and I thank him for his leadership on \nall of these many issues that he has discussed. He comes from a \nfascinating State, a State with a basket full of potential energy for \nthis Nation if we can change a few of our policies and allow Wyoming, \nMontana, and other such States to be able to use the abundance of their \ncoal to produce electricity at the mouth of the mine itself, and then \nthrough transmission lines to transport it across the Western States \nand to the State of California, where they are so desperately in need \nof more energy.\n  I say that in my opening comments because we are on the threshold of \nbeginning to work on a national energy policy. The President has \npresented one. The Senate has produced a bill. The Energy Committee, on \nwhich I serve, will now begin to review all aspects of that proposed \npolicy and begin to shape for our Nation new public laws, amended \npublic laws, a new regulatory process, a reduced regulatory process \nthat will allow this country, once again, after nearly a decade, to get \nback in the business of producing energy.\n  Senator Thomas and I were downtown yesterday speaking to a group, and \nI, at that time, said we are a rich Nation. Compared with all other \nnations of the world, we are one of the most wealthy. It is because of \na combination of assets that we have had and have uniquely combined in \nthe American character.\n  First of all is the free enterprise system where an individual is \nallowed to create at his or her level and with his or her talent, and \nto use that creation not only to create wealth for themselves but for \neveryone around them. That is probably the No. 1 resource in our \ncountry and always has been. But tied to that resource is an abundance \nof energy in almost all forms--electrical, hydrocarbon, you name it. We \nhave never wanted for energy in our country. But today we do. The \nAmerican public is paying a higher price for gas than at any time in \nour Nation's history. They are paying higher electrical rates than at \nany time in our Nation's history, and they are asking a fundamental \nquestion: Why? Why are we? Why do we have to?\n\n  Of course, we already know that those higher costs have depleted or \nreduced the wealth-generating capability of our country. It has cost \nthousands of jobs. It has hurt households. Every day, the commuter to \nhis or her job is paying nearly double in the commuter costs than a \nyear ago.\n  This country cries out for a new energy policy of production. But \nthey also want to see it done in a clean and responsible way when it \ncomes to the environment. All of those things can be accomplished if \nthis Senate will put its mind to it to assuring that we make that \nhappen, and that we partner with States and local governments to assure \nthey are fully involved and engaged with us in this most important \nprocess.\n  A lot of people are saying right now: Well, George Bush, why aren't \nyou helping out in California?\n  After about 20 decisions coming out of the new administration, 3 \ndecisions coming out of the FERC, at some point we have to do the very \ncommon and necessary thing and say to California: Help yourself.\n  California, finally, is beginning to do that. They are beginning to \nrecognize that after 10 long years of not producing any energy, they \nare going to have to produce some. They used to buy a lot of energy \nfrom Idaho. We used to ship a lot of energy down there. But we Idahoans \nnow need our energy because we are growing. We also had a drought in \nthe Western States of Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. We used to produce \nmost of our power by turbines and dams and hydro power. As a result, \nthis year we have less capability to produce and therefore we have less \npower to sell to California.\n  Those are some of the critically important dynamics of the policy we \nwill have to develop in the Senate. I have already had some of my folks \ncalling me from Idaho saying, with what happened yesterday and with \nDemocrats taking control of the Senate, is the energy policy dead?\n  No, I don't think it will be. It can't be. My colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle cannot be viewed as obstructionists who are advocates \nof $2 or $3 gasoline or $400 or $500 megawatt power. They aren't now, \nand they can't be later. They must work with us and the Bush \nadministration to get this country back into the business of producing \nand conserving and balancing out our electrical needs.\n  President Bush said: Give me a tax cut now and give me some immediate \nresponse so at least in the short term a consuming family will have \njust a little bit of relief in their energy bill or any other part of \nfamily expenses.\n  That is what we are struggling with at this very moment. The House \nand the Senate are meeting in conference to work out the differences \nbetween what we have produced in the Senate and what our colleagues in \nthe House have produced. I hope in the end it will look very closely \nlike what our President is asking--to return some of their tax dollars \nto them in the form of tax relief, both in the short term and in the \nlong term, to stimulate the economy and to allow the producer to keep \nmore of his or her hard-earned cash.\n  In the midst of all of that, for just a little bit of time, maybe \nthey can afford to pay just a little more for energy. I wish they \ndidn't. I wish we had been smart enough 10 years ago, 5 years ago, 4 \nyears ago, to shift the policy. But we had an administration that said \nall you have to do is conserve and maybe use a little gas--that is, \nnatural gas--to generate electricity, and we will get through all of \nthis. We know that didn't work very well. Conservation was an important \npart of that energy message, and it is today.\n\n  The average consumer today is now making a choice. I heard on the \ntelevision a couple of mornings ago that the American Automobile \nAssociation says consumers are going to travel less this summer. \nInstead of a 10-day trip in their automobile, they are going to take an \n8-day trip or a 7-day trip. That is the American consumer doing what \nthey do best--evaluating the cost of the trip and what they have in \ntheir pocketbooks and what their family can afford and stepping back.\n  It is OK to do that in the short term, but when it comes to industry \nand the creation of jobs and the fact that industry may have to produce \nless and step back because of the input cost of energy, that then \nbegins to hurt the whole economy of our country.\n  So how can I talk about tax relief and energy in the same \nconversation? They are, in fact, integrally related. The ability to \ncreate a job, the ability to earn a paycheck, and to have a fair\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\namount of that which you can apply to yourself, your family, and your \nkids' education has, in part, always been in direct relation to the \namount it takes you to live; and the cost of living has gone up \nsubstantially in the last 2 years because of the fundamental cost of \nenergy. All of these issues are tremendously important. Thank goodness \nwe now have a President who speaks boldly, clearly, and bluntly about \nthese kinds of issues.\n  He says we are in an energy crisis and we can get out of it if we \nsimply produce and get back to the business of providing for the \nconsumer of this country. He has laid out a plan on how to do it. On \nmost of it, I agree. I certainly hope this Senate in future days, and \nunder its new leadership, will recognize the importance of such a \npolicy to the American people. You simply cannot deny it any longer. If \nconservation is the only message out there, then look at California, \nthe greatest conserving State in the Nation. They have conserved \nthemselves right into darkness. That is no way to run a State. They now \nknow they have to produce along with that conservation, and we ought to \nallow this great country of ours that opportunity.\n\n  I have always been one who believed that the freer our citizens, the \nfreer our economy, the more flexibility to do what we do best--generate \nthis great country's wealth and, therefore, this great country's world \npresence.\n  Wealthy nations can provide for their people, and we do. Poor nations \ncannot. There is nothing wrong with the idea of creating wealth and \nallowing people to share it, allowing people to have the fruits of \ntheir labor and their genius. It is what has made us great, and it is \nwhat allows us to turn to those less fortunate here and around the \nworld, to say we can help, and the only reason we can help is because \nwe are, fortunately, a rich nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my colleague from Idaho just discussed the \nenergy issue. There is not any question the energy policy is a critical \npolicy for this country. We must develop a national energy plan that \nmakes sense for our long-term future.\n  Every American every day has a claim on the need for energy. We need \na consistent, predictable supply of energy that is reasonably priced. \nWe need a policy that allows that to happen. When the price of oil went \nto $10 a barrel for some long while, people stopped looking for oil and \nnatural gas. It is pretty predictable. There were fewer rigs looking \nfor oil when the price of oil and natural gas was very low. When the \nprice of oil went up and natural gas spiked back up, there were more \ndrilling rigs and more people are searching for more oil and natural \ngas. That is predictable. That is how the market system works.\n  It is not in this country's best interest to have a roller coaster of \nexploration, and that is what happens. That is what describes only part \nof our current problem with the imbalance between supply and demand for \nenergy.\n  We are too dependent on the OPEC countries. All of us know that. One \nday we will wake up--I hope this is not the case--it is likely we will \nwake up when some grotesque terrorist act in the Middle East interrupts \nthe supply of oil, even if temporarily, and it will allow us to \nunderstand how overly dependent we are on a source of energy and oil, \nnatural gas from a region that is so unstable.\n  In addition to having this roller coaster on exploration and being \noverly dependent on a supply of energy from the Middle East, we also \nare a country that has largely decided to ignore conservation. One can \ndrive down the road these days and see someone driving a new vehicle \nthat looks a lot like a Humvee, except it is bigger and heavier and is \nsold at your local dealership as a family vehicle. People have a right \nto drive that, but the point is that is moving in the opposite \ndirection of having a national conservation ethic.\n  It is true, as the Senator from Idaho said, that we must produce \nmore. I do not think you will find Members of the Senate in \ndisagreement on that. We must produce more oil and natural gas. We must \nuse coal resources. There are ample resources in our coal fields. We \ncan do it using clean coal technology. We must use our fossil fuels in \na thoughtful way, and we can do that in a manner that is not \ninconsistent with a good and clean environment.\n  That is important, but it is also important to understand we just \ncannot produce ourselves out of this problem. We cannot produce our way \nout of this problem. We have a President and a Vice President who come \nfrom oil backgrounds so it is probably not surprising their energy plan \nis to just drill more. They have an easy solution to America's energy \nproblem: Just drill more.\n  That is one approach, but it is not a balanced approach. Yes, we must \nproduce more, and I support that, but we also must conserve more. \nConservation of energy is another way of producing energy. We must have \na conservation component that is real, not just talk, but real as we \ndeal with this energy policy.\n  We also must have an efficiency process in this energy plan. All of \nthe appliances, the things we use every day in our lives that make our \nlives better, easier, can be made more efficient and should be. We have \nefficiency standards. The question is whether we continue to press for \ngreater efficiency in all of these appliances or not. The answer should \nbe yes.\n\n  Finally, renewable resources. We ought to use renewable forms of \nenergy, and I know the big oil companies have never liked that very \nmuch, but I happen to believe that using ethanol, taking a drop of \nalcohol from a kernel of corn and using it to extend our energy supply, \nmakes good sense.\n  We can take a drop of alcohol from a kernel of corn and still have \nthe protein feedstock left. So we have extended America's energy supply \nand we still have protein feedstock for animals. What a wonderful thing \nto do. Plus, it is renewable. We are not depleting it every year.\n  Wind energy. North Dakota happens to be the Saudi Arabia of wind, \naccording to the Department of Energy. There is nothing wrong, as an \nimportant part of our energy plan, of putting up more efficient wind \nturbines and using that wind energy to extend America's energy supply.\n  It is true, as my colleague from Idaho says, we need to produce more, \nand all of us support that, but a balanced energy plan will include \nproduction, conservation, renewable energy, and also efficiency with \nappliances and the things we use day to day. If we have a bold energy \nplan that includes all of those components, I believe we will find a \nbroad area of support for it in this Congress.\n  As I mentioned, we have a President and Vice President who come from \nthe oil industry, so it is not unnatural for them to produce a plan \nthat says: By the way, let's just drill more. But that is not a \nbalanced plan. We can, should, and must do much better than that and \nhave a plan that balances all of these interests.\n  And, finally, another thought on this issue of an energy plan. We \nhave other dislocations occurring in this country in a very significant \nway. In California, the price of electricity is going through the roof. \nSome say that is supply and demand. That is nonsense. That market is \nbroken. It is flat dead broke, and the regulators should have \nintervened.\n  The Federal regulators are doing their best imitation of potted \nplants. They sit on their hands, we pay them salaries, and they do \nnothing. The fact is, they should have put a cap on wholesale prices \nfor electricity in California.\n  We have big traders and big economic interests that take an Mcf of \nnatural gas, trade it from an unregulated market to a regulated market, \nand in 24 to 48 hours, the price of that same Mcf of natural gas will \ndouble, triple, or quadruple. Guess who gets hit right square in the \njaw with that. The consumer.\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\n  The price of power in California was $7 billion 2 years ago. It is \nexpected to be $70 billion this year, a tenfold increase.\n  My point is this: Whether it is the price of natural gas that is \nbeing sold into California or the price of natural gas that is doubling \naround the rest of the country, or the price of gasoline at the gas \npump, or the price of electricity, the fact is, we need to shine the \nspotlight of investigation on energy pricing in this country.\n  The education bill is going to be pending in the Senate when we \nreturn. It has an amendment that is pending which I offered calling for \na joint House-Senate investigative committee on energy pricing. Is \nthere some manipulation going on? Are there some interests that are \nmanipulating both price and supply and driving up energy prices for the \nAmerican people? I do not know, but I suspect so.\n  Some very limited investigations have shown that supply has been \nmanipulated in a way to drive up price. It seems to me, given what is \nhappening in California and the rest of the west coast, and given what \nis happening to natural gas prices and other things around the country, \nand the price at the gas pump for that matter, the American people will \nbe served well by shining a spotlight of investigation on energy \npricing practices all across this country.\n  That would represent a component to an energy plan that gives the \nAmerican people some confidence that we are doing the right thing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for highlighting \nthis energy issue. If there were ever a moment in time when we should \ntalk about energy, it is on the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend \nwhen families across America are making plans to head out for vacations \nor family reunions. It is the time when they get in the car or decide \nwhether to take a long or short trip and become sensitized to the price \nof gasoline.\n  In Chicago and in the Midwest, for the second year running, we have \nseen devastating increases in the price of gasoline. It seems Easter is \nthe kickoff for the oil companies to start raising the prices and then \nto catch all sorts of criticism from the public and elected officials \nand to bring them down after Memorial Day. In the meantime, families \nand businesses are being socked by the high prices.\n  The Senator from North Dakota puts his finger on it. This Congress \nhas been unwilling to take a look at the energy industry. Certainly, we \ndo not expect the White House, with the President and Vice President, \nwith their background in this field, to do it. If this Congress will \nnot do it, the consumers of America stand on the sidelines. They stand \non the sidelines with their pockets empty because each time they go to \nthe gasoline station, they are putting more and more money into their \ncars and trucks, into their vehicles to move their families.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, if we have an opportunity for a \njoint conference with the House and Senate in a bipartisan approach to \nget into the energy pricing, how soon can we have that hearing, what \nkind of things can we look into, what kind of relief can we offer to \nbusinesses and families across America who are being nailed by the high \nenergy prices?\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Illinois knows we have an amendment \npending on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act that calls for \nthe creation of a select committee on investigation. One of the \nproblems is you need resources to do that; you need investigators. You \ncannot do this without the ability to investigate pricing practices. My \nhope is that we can move quickly when we get back. We will have a vote \nand see who wants to do this.\n  I make another point that is important. One hundred years ago, Teddy \nRoosevelt, carrying a big stick, said to John D. Rockefeller: ``You \ncan't do that.'' He was talking about price fixing with respect to oil \nand energy. He began to break it up.\n  I am not alleging there is widespread fraud or abuse. All I am saying \nis there are things that do not add up. We have big energy traders, \nhuge economic interests, trading energy and doing it at secret prices \nfrom unregulated markets into regulated markets. We have oil companies \nmuch, much bigger than they used to be because they merged, and merged, \nand merged again. We have economic power with the opportunity to \nmanipulate markets and try to drive up prices. Who are the victims? The \nvictims are the American consumers. They deserve to know.\n  There was a limited Federal Trade Commission investigation dealing \nwith gas prices last year in the Midwest. Some say that exonerated the \ncompanies. It did no such thing. It was such a limited investigation. \nEven that limited investigation showed some deliberately limited \nrefinery output. They did not want to increase supply because they knew \nif they restricted supply, they could jack up prices.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator another question. When we ask the \npeople in the energy business, why are prices out of control, they say \nit is the market mechanism, market forces.\n  There are two things I find interesting. Our common experience says \nwhen gasoline prices go up in a town, they all go up at the same time \nin lockstep. When they come down, they trickle down at the same rate. \nYou don't see competition in pricing that could be found in any other \nmarket.\n  Second, the oil companies consistently guess wrong about supply. That \nis what the Federal Trade Commission said. Why would they guess wrong? \nThey make more money when they guess wrong. These oil companies are now \nhaving record profits and they are saying: We just did not have \npipeline capacity; we were not prepared for reformulated gas, for clean \nair; we made a mistake.\n  Look at what resulted from the mistake. It did not result in their \nbeing penalized. It resulted in their being rewarded with some of the \nhighest profits they have seen in 10 years. I cannot think of another \ncompany or another industry in America that can guess wrong so \nconsistently and profit from it time and time again.\n  Vice President Cheney recently he saw no evidence of price gouging. \nMr. Vice President Cheney, come to Chicago, come to Illinois. Take a \nlook at what happened in a 30-day period. The price of gasoline went up \n50 cents a gallon. No price gouging?\n  I have a quote from Vice President Cheney who said:\n\n       Americans are more understanding and tolerant of high gas \n     prices than most pundits believe.\n\n  Again, I invite the Vice President to speak not only to the families \nwho are now paying $50 and $60 and $70 to fill the gas tank but also \ntalk to business people, the small businesses that have been forced to \nconsider layoffs and a reduction in their own activities because of \nhigh energy prices. To say people understand this and accept it is to \nignore our responsibility. We are supposed to be there for these \nconsumers and these businesses and these families who have no other \nvoice in the process.\n  I have joined with the Senator from North Dakota. I think it is \nimportant we have this investigative hearing to make certain that the \npeople who run this industry come in and are held accountable.\n  I also think when we get into the debate about energy, we ought to \nhave consumers at the table. It is not enough to have the energy giants \nand the government agencies and people in pinstriped suits from K \nStreet in Washington. Let's have people representing small businesses \nin Illinois, farm families from North Dakota, who can talk about the \npractical impact. I know the Senator from North Dakota supports that. I \nwould appreciate it if he told me what he thinks we can do to deal with \nthe market mechanism which always is stacked against the consumer.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the market is broken. It is clearly \nbroken.\n  Look at what is happening in California: $7 billion was the cost of \npower in California 2 years ago. This year it is estimated to be $70 \nbillion, a tenfold increase. Who are the victims? The folks in \nCalifornia who are going to work every day, coming home to open the \nbills and figure out how to pay an electric bill that has dramatically \nincreased.\n  That is why I say, look, we need a new energy plan. I don't disagree \nwith that. We have not had a good energy plan for decades. We are too \ndependent on foreign sources.\n\n  The Senator from Idaho piqued my interest on the subject. There are a \nlot\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nof areas we can agree. I agree with the Senator from Idaho, that we do \nneed to produce more oil and gas. I agree with that. We need to build \nmore power lines and more transmission capability. I agree with that. \nWe need to build more powerplants, I agree. We need to use more coal \nsources, use more clean coal technology, and do all of that while being \nsensitive to the needs of the environment. We can do that. I support \nthat in a manner consistent with protecting our environment.\n  Then I say: Support us on this. We need better conservation. More \nconservation. We need more effort towards renewable sources of energy. \nWe need more effort towards greater efficiency of appliances and the \nrules that support that are in place. And now the administration \nthreatens to retract on some of those rules.\n  Finally, we also need to have an investigation of pricing practices. \nJoin us on that.\n  If my colleague from Idaho and his colleagues would join in the \nresolution I have included on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct that calls for the selection of a House and Senate committee to \ninvestigate pricing, we will have an energy plan that includes a lot of \nthe right things but also says, while we are doing this, let's take a \nlook to make sure the American people are not victims of pricing \npractices and supply manipulation that enriches some of the bigger \neconomic interests, but takes it out of the pockets of the folks who \nare trying to gas up at the pump in order to go to work.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I follow up on a point. There was an old saying during \ndebate of the Clean Air Act, a belief that once we established \nstandards for clean air in America, it was said as a result of that \nGovernment decision, the people in the automobile industry in Japan \nwent out and hired an army of engineers to figure out how to make their \ncars cleaner and more fuel efficient.\n  The people in charge of the American automobile industry went out and \nhired an army of lawyers to fight the regulations at every possible \nlevel. That is an oversimplification.\n  But I want to say to the Senator from North Dakota that 8 years ago, \nduring the Clinton-Gore administration they said to Detroit: We want \nyou to sit down and work on a more fuel-efficient automobile that is \nsafe for families. We are prepared to make certain that you do not run \nafoul of any antitrust violations. We want you to come together, the \nbig three, put your heads together with your best creative talent and \ncome up with that automobile, come up with that SUV, come up with that \ntruck. They gave them that assignment. They moved forward with it and \nthey hoped for the best.\n  Let's take a look at where we are today. Today the only vehicle I \nknow of that is on the road that offers fuel economy over 50 miles a \ngallon in a car that is of normal size is, sadly, from Toyota Motor \nCompany. It is a model called the Prius. They have a 5-month waiting \nlist of people who want to buy this car which combines electric power \nwith a gas engine and gives much greater fuel economy.\n  Detroit announced last week that they will have a competitor for the \nToyota Prius in about 3 or 4 years.\n  You have to ask yourself, what is going on here? If this country, \nwith all its creative talent and technological skill, cannot come up \nwith a product, an automobile, a truck, an SUV, that is safe and fuel \nefficient, what are we missing?\n  I think what we are missing is the guidance and leadership and \ndirection from the top. We cannot just say let market forces come to \nwork because if market forces come to work, we are going to get scooped \ntime and time again by someone with more vision. Sadly, in this case it \nhappens to be a foreign automobile manufacturer.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota if part of this energy debate \nshould not include incentives for those who are making the automobiles \nand the trucks and other vehicles to come up with more fuel-efficient \nvehicles so we can have safe vehicles that also reduce our need for \nforeign oil.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Illinois, I \nthink that makes a great deal of sense. I know one of our colleagues \ndrives one of the hybrid cars. I have seen it parked outside of the \nbuilding when we have late votes. It is a car that runs on both \ngasoline and electricity. I understand they are very efficient.\n  But the roads are not populated with many of those cars, largely \nbecause we have an energy industry and auto industry that moves down \nthe road with the internal combustion engine, and they fight every step \nof the way on increased efficiencies people propose in Congress.\n  Mr. President, I have told my colleagues this before, my first car \nwas a 1924 Model T Ford. I bought an antique car and restored it. My \ndad told me where it was. He was hauling gasoline and was out on a farm \nand they had an old car in a granary. He told me about it and said you \nshould write to this fellow and see if he wants to sell it. The guy had \nlong since moved to Wisconsin. So I wrote to this fellow from Wisconsin \nand asked if he wanted to sell an old Model T stored in a granary for \n30 or 40 years. I was a teenager.\n  He said he would sell it for me for $25, and he sent me the owner's \nmanual and the key. So I went out and hauled the old Model T in and \nrestored it.\n  It is interesting, that 1924 Model T Ford is fueled exactly the way a \ncar built in 2001 is fueled. You pull up to a gas pump and you stick \nthe nozzle in the tank and you pump gas in it. Think of the few things \nthat have changed in 75 or 80 or 90 years--almost everything has \nchanged around us. Almost everything we do is dazzling, breathtaking \nnew technology, technological change that takes your breath away. Guess \nwhat. Eighty years ago you pulled up to a pump and stuck a hose in and \npumped a little gas in, and 80 years later you do exactly the same \nthing.\n\n  You wonder why; why would nothing change? Clearly, part of the \nsolution is technology. I just described the technology of a car that \nis occasionally parked in front of the Capitol. We have the capability \nof making more efficient automobiles. Of course we have the capability. \nWe ought to have the will. As the Senator from Illinois says and \nproposes, we ought to provide incentives as part of an energy plan to \nsay to those who are interested in doing that: Here is your head, go do \nit. We encourage you to do it. Here are the financial incentives to do \nit.\n  That is another way to provide conservation and new technology to \nmove out of this energy problem that we have. That is longer term, not \nshort term. But it is certainly part of what we ought to be doing.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to ask him this \nquestion. There are those who argue from the energy industry side that \nthe only way we can improve our energy future in America is by \ncompromising on air quality standards. They suggest it is environmental \nregulation which is causing the problem we face today.\n  I disagree with that. I think they ignore realities. One of the \nrealities we should not ignore is to perhaps visit a local hospital, go \nto an emergency room, and ask the doctor who is in control what is the \nNo. 1 diagnosis of children going to emergency rooms in America today. \nI was surprised to learn it is not trauma, kids falling off a bicycle; \nit is asthma. The No. 1 reason kids miss school: Asthma. The No. 1 \ndiagnosis in emergency rooms: Asthma. Pulmonary disease, lung problems, \nand asthma are, unfortunately, becoming epidemic in our country. I \ncannot give you the specific reason for all of it, but the people I \nhave spoken to say air quality is part of it.\n  I will mention something else to the Senator from North Dakota. The \nformer head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Carol Browner, told \nme that the Web site for the Environmental Protection Agency had a \ndramatic increase in visits from a few thousand a month to millions a \nmonth when they started posting ozone alerts on cities across America. \nFamilies literally got up in the morning and logged on, went to the EPA \nWeb site to find out whether it was safe for their child to go outside. \nThink about that.\n  If we are talking about compromising air quality standards in \nAmerica, more kids are going to be sitting inside their homes; more \nelderly people with pulmonary disease are going to be at risk. We \ncannot afford that. We can have a good energy policy and not compromise \nthe public health of this Nation and the health of families across the \nboard. I totally reject the concept that I have\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nheard from some in this administration and from the energy industry \nthat the only way we can move forward in America is at the expense of \nour health.\n  This should not be ``your money or your life.'' In this situation I \nthink we can have a good energy policy that does not compromise that \nbasic quality standard. We have made amazing progress over the last 20 \nyears. Visit any foreign industrialized country and take a look at the \nmuck they call air. Go to Beijing in China. You wake up in the morning \nand say it is a foggy day; at noon you say it is still a foggy day; \nmidafternoon, still a foggy day; at night, still foggy; and the next \nmorning, the same. Every day, day after day, the air quality is \nmiserable.\n\n  I don't pick on China. There are many other comparable countries. The \nUnited States should lead, not only being an industrial power but also \nsensitive to the health of its people. I ask the Senator from North \nDakota for his comments on this relationship between energy and the \nenvironment.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Illinois makes a good \npoint. Increasing the supply of energy in this country does not have to \nbe at odds with protecting and preserving a good environment. It just \ndoes not.\n  We have had experience with this in North Dakota. Some 25 years ago, \nthe proposals to build coal-fired electric generating plants in our \nState produced a great deal of controversy. I was one in the State \ncapital who led the fight saying if we are going to build coal-fired \ngenerating plants, then you must provide the latest available \ntechnology on those stacks. We must have wet scrubbers and the latest \navailable technology to scrub down those emissions.\n  The industry was furious with me because I led a vigorous fight and \nwe built those plants in North Dakota. But they did it and they had to \nhave latest available technology scrubbers on their stacks. When they \nstrip-mined to get the coal, they had to segregate top soil and do \nlayers and topography restoration. They did not like it. But guess \nwhat. We did it the right way.\n  Mr. President, 25 years later, looking in the rear-view mirror, they \nwould all agree that was the right thing to do. We were the first State \nin the Union to meet the ambient air quality standards. We now have \nsegregated top soil and topography restored on strip-mined lands of \nwhich we are proud.\n  You can do this the right way. I know the energy industry sometimes \ndoesn't want to because it is more costly to do it that way. But it \nmakes sense to do it the right way. Increasing the supply of energy \ndoes not have to be at odds with protecting our environment.\n  Let me make one final important point. Gregg Easterbrooke wrote a \nbook that I believe was entitled ``America the OK.'' It was published a \nfew years ago. In it he said we have doubled our use of energy in our \ncountry in the last 20 years, and we have cleaner air and cleaner \nwater. Why? Because this country demanded it. We demanded, through the \nClean Air and Clean Water Acts, that we take steps to protect our air \nand our water.\n\n  The point is, no one 20 years ago would have predicted you could \ndouble the use of energy without significantly fouling your air and \nwater. If you do it the right way, you can coexist: an increased energy \nsupply with a good, clean environment. That is what the Senator from \nIllinois is saying.\n  So as we go through these battles about energy policy, my hope is \nthat the good ideas on that side of the aisle can be merged with our \ngood ideas and we can have a policy that is balanced. Yes, more \nproduction, but production the right way, with environmental \nsafeguards. Yes, let's also insist on some conservation, efficiency, \nand renewable energy at the same time; we can do all of this together.\n  But it is not a balanced energy plan simply to say, the market will \ntake care of this. The market is broken, and we know it. Buy \nelectricity in California today, and ask yourself whether you think \nthis market works, while the big economic interests get rich and you \nget gouged. Ask yourself then, on the west coast: Do you think this \nmarket works? Everyone in the country knows that is not the case.\n  Americans deserve the opportunity to have an investigation of energy \npricing that shines a spotlight on pricing and supplies and evaluates \nwhether they are being manipulated in a way that victimizes consumers.\n  As I said before, 100 years ago, Teddy Roosevelt took a big stick and \nsaid to John D. Rockefeller, you cannot do this any more, because he \nwas manipulating the price of oil. And 100 years later it is useful for \nus to have a significant investigation of both the price and supply of \nenergy and find out who is doing what so the American people have some \nconfidence, as we develop a new energy plan, that the big economic \ninterests will not gouge the American consumers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the magnificent discussion on energy \npolicy and environmental concerns led by the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the Senator from Illinois.\n  I would like to change the subject for a moment as we approach \nMemorial Day weekend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5671-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5671-S5672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MEMORIAL DAY\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on next Monday, May 28, and acting \npursuant to a joint resolution actually approved by the Congress back \nin 1950, the President of the United States will issue a proclamation \ncalling upon the people of the United States to observe a day of prayer \nfor permanent peace in remembrance of all of those brave Americans who \nhave died in our Nation's service.\n  In many ways, this is part of our history and heritage, Memorial Day. \nIn 1866, citizens from both the North and the South, after the Civil \nWar, decided to form the first Memorial Day effort and place a flag on \nthe grave sites of those brave Americans who had died in the Civil War.\n  That is actually how Memorial Day got started.\n  Whenever Memorial Day comes around, I am reminded of what may well \nhave been the first, and is still one of the finest, memorials to \nfallen soldiers. Thousands of years ago: the Funeral Oration of the \ngreat Athenian leader Pericles, as recorded by the historian \nThucydides, during the Peloponnesian War in the 5th century BC:\n\n       For this offering of their lives made in common by them all \n     they each of them individually received that renown which \n     never grows old, and for a sepulcher, not so much that in \n     which their bones have been deposited, but that noblest of \n     shrines wherein their glory is laid up to be eternally \n     remembered upon every occasion on which deed or story shall \n     call for its commemoration. For heroes have the whole earth \n     for their tomb; and in lands far from their own, where the \n     column with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in \n     every breast a record unwritten with no tablet to preserve \n     it, except that of the heart.\n\n  There are many thoughts as we approach Memorial Day weekend. In that \nspirit, I am pleased that both the House and the Senate have now passed \nlegislation that will expedite a monument commemorating the sacrifice \nof those who served in World War II.\n  My father served in World War II after the attack at Pearl Harbor. \nThis weekend I will be visiting some of my fellow veterans, and we will \nsee the premiere of the new movie ``Pearl Harbor.''\n  I introduced a resolution on Tuesday calling upon all Americans to \nespecially dedicate Memorial Day of 2001 to those brave American men \nand women who have given their lives in service to their country \nespecially since the end of the war in Viet Nam.\n  As a Vietnam veteran, I appreciate the monument in this great city, \nsometimes called ``The Wall,'' the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.\n  But no grand edifices or other public monuments commemorate the deeds \nof those who have died after the Vietnam war, but their service to \ntheir country was just as strong, their sacrifice just as great, their \nfamilies' and communities' loss just as keen as that of their \npredecessors in the two world wars of the 20th century, Korea and Viet \nNam.\n  Honoring our fallen heroes is altogether fitting and proper, as \nPresident Lincoln said at Gettysburg. At this point, I thank my many \ncolleagues, on both sides of the aisle, who joined me\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nin cosponsoring this resolution: Senators McCain, Levin, Hutchison, \nMiller, Biden, Jeffords, Landrieu, Bennett, Murray, Johnson, Carnahan, \nDayton, Conrad, Kennedy, Durbin, Hatch, Sessions, Clinton, and Allen. I \nalso thank the entire Senate for adopting this measure by unanimous \nconsent last evening.\n  I am reminded of the line from one of Wellington's troops that: ``In \ntime of war, and not before, God and the soldier men adore. And in time \nof peace, with all things righted, God is forgotten and the soldier \nslighted.''\n  Mr. President, I am honored to live in a country that forgets not God \nand does not slight the soldier.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, some weeks ago, I was on an airplane, and \nI had a laptop computer with me and my briefcase. Like most of my \ncolleagues sitting on an airplane, I went through my briefcase and \nfound a letter from the U.S. Park Service. I read the letter, and it \nprovoked me to get my laptop computer out of its case and put it on the \ntray table, and I started typing.\n  I created a message for the U.S. Park Service. Here is what their \nletter said to me. The U.S. Park Service wrote me a letter and said in \nthe Teddy Roosevelt National Park, one of their picnic grounds was \nbeing colonized by prairie dogs. So they were going to do something \ncalled a ``scoping'' exercise and an EA, called an environmental \nassessment, to think about spending a quarter of a million dollars to \nmove the picnic grounds.\n  I read and reread this Park Service letter about the scoping and the \nenvironmental assessment they were doing to spend a quarter of a \nmillion dollars to move the picnic grounds, and I sent them a letter.\n  What I said to the Park Service was that I found it interesting that \nthey had the time to do scoping and EAs on these kinds of issues. I \nsaid, at the moment, we are in a rather complicated budget fight in \nCongress, but you have solicited my opinion, so let me give you a few \nthoughts.\n  I said: I am not unsympathetic to prairie dogs. I think they are cute \nlittle creatures. They, unlike the rats, were blessed with a furry tail \nand a button nose and they have a good deal more human sympathy, \ntherefore, than rats do.\n  I asked the Park Service what would have been the Park Service's \nresponse if it had been a group of rats that had colonized the picnic \narea rather than prairie dogs. Then I thought better of asking because \nmaybe they would have had a larger EA and scoping mission.\n\n  My point to them was: Do not waste the taxpayers' money; do not move \nthe picnic grounds, move the prairie dogs.\n  I said: When I was growing up, about 50 miles from where they have \nthis problem in the Badlands, I was growing up in Regent, ND, we had a \ngroup of rats ``colonize,'' to use the Park Service's word, our horse \nbarn. I was about 14 at the time, and my dad said the rats could live a \nvery good life just 1 mile from our barn in the town dumps, which is \nwhere a lot of rats live, and he said he would like me to enlist a \ncouple of my schoolmates and see if we couldn't move the rats.\n  It turns out these rats were no match for three 14-year-old boys. We \nvery quickly retook the Dorgan horse barn. We understood that we could \ndo that without a lot of effort.\n  Getting back to the prairie dogs, I told the Park Service that I \nfigure there are about 1.4 million acres of ground in the Badlands in \nNorth Dakota in which prairie dogs can, do, and are colonizing. They \nhave many prairie dogs in the Badlands. So the prairie dogs can \ncolonize in a million and a half acres or so. They just cannot colonize \nin this picnic area.\n  I said: The way to handle these prairie dogs is to find somebody who \ncan communicate with them. That is not hard. We have a lot of folks who \nranch and farm and spend a lot of time around animals, and one very \nquickly learns how to communicate with animals. I raised some horses. \nWe raised cattle, and we learned how to communicate with animals.\n  I said to the Park Service: If you do not have anybody who knows how \nto communicate with an animal, go out in a ranching area and get some \ninstruction, and once they have taught you how to send certain \ncommunications to animals, go back and have a little discussion with \nthose prairie dogs and tell the prairie dogs they are not welcome in \nthe picnic area; that you do not want to spend a quarter of a million \ndollars of the taxpayers' money to move the picnic area, and you want \nthem to leave. And if they will not leave, I said to the Park Service, \nhere is a cost-free way to deal with it: Get about three 14-year-old \nboys from somewhere in that area, and they will take care of that \nproblem real quick for you.\n  As I was sitting on this airplane thinking about all the things we \nconfront in rural America--yes in and near the Badlands where I grew \nup--I was thinking that we are not short of prairie dogs; we are short \nof people. We have Federal agencies that want to treat lightly that \nwhich is serious and then treat seriously that which is light, and they \ndo not quite understand.\n  The real problem in our part of the country, where the Park Service \nis worried about prairie dogs and picnic areas, is that human beings \nare becoming an endangered species. All of our rural counties are \nshrinking like prunes. The counties are shrinking in population. People \nare leaving, not coming in. Farmers and ranchers are leaving the land \nat an alarming rate. Small towns are shrinking. Many rural counties are \nvery fast becoming a wilderness area. That is not by Federal \ndesignation, it is the way things are working in rural America.\n  I said to the Park Service: When I received your letter about prairie \ndogs, picnic areas, and environmental assessments, and scoping, it just \nseemed to be such an unusual bureaucratic effort for such a minor \nissue.\n  Having prairie dogs move into a picnic area, in my judgment, does not \nrank up there with having people moving out of rural America. So I \nsaid: You have to excuse me for being a little impatient.\n\n  Just once, I told the Park Service, I would like to see a Federal \nagency crank up a little energy, a little emotion about the real \nproblems facing rural America.\n  Have my colleagues ever heard of a Federal agency say: This county \nhas shrunk 50 percent; we are going to do a scoping exercise to figure \nout what we can do to solve that problem.\n  Have my colleagues ever heard of a Federal agency cranking up an \neffort to do an environmental assessment of what is happening with the \ncreation of\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\nwilderness areas, where people are moving out, jobs are leaving, and \npeople on Main Street are having a devil of a time keeping their front \ndoor open because rural areas are shrinking?\n  Have my colleagues heard a Federal agency say that matters to them; \nthey are going to make an effort to find out about that?\n  No; oh no. Scoping and environmental assessments are reserved for \ndealing with furry little creatures that inhabit a picnic area. God \nforbid a Federal agency ought to spend its money and its time worrying \nabout a few prairie dogs.\n  Again, we are just not short of prairie dogs, we are short of people \nin rural America. I would like very much just once to have a Federal \nagency, the Park Service, the Forest Service--you pick it--just once to \nhave a Federal agency get aggressive on something that really matters \nto us in rural America.\n  I said to the Park Service: You probably regret asking for my advice. \nYou probably certainly regret I had time on an airplane to read your \nletter and had a laptop available to respond to it. But, frankly, my \nadvice is do not spend the taxpayers' money, do not spend a quarter of \na million dollars; get those prairie dogs out of the picnic area and \nget your people, if you have the time work on things that really \nmatter, to work on things with us that matter to rural America in a \nreal way.\n  I know the Park Service has read my letter because they sent me \nanother letter and said this is not just about prairie dogs and picnic \nareas, it is now about the bubonic plague or some god- awful thing, and \nthey have developed several areas of new dimensions to this tiny little \nissue, as is always the case. I am sure they brought in four or five \nspecialists now to respond to this issue that I have raised with them \nabout worrying about all the wrong things.\n  Some days you just scratch your head and wonder whether bureaucracy \nhas any common sense left.\n  I say to the Park Service, and all the others who are engaged in \nthese Federal agencies: Give us some help from time to time on things \nthat really matter to people living in rural America.\n  I live in a wonderful State. It provides a wonderful environment for \npeople who want to live in an area where they have good neighbors, no \novercrowding, and very little crime. It is a wonderful place with \nwonderful values. The fact is, we are fighting a losing battle in many \nways trying to keep people, jobs, promote economic opportunity and a \nfuture that has some assistance for people who want to live in rural \nareas.\n  I say to Federal agencies: If you want to worry about something, do \nnot worry about a few prairie dogs in a picnic area. Help us worry \nabout promoting some economic help in rural America for a change.\n  If you don't want to do that, cut some of the positions out of some \nof the agencies to say you have too many people working on some of the \nissues. Maybe we can cut down on the idle time.\n  It was therapeutic for me to say this on the floor. It probably was a \nslow water drip for the Presiding Officer. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the Record the letter I sent to the Park Service on the \nsubject of prairie dogs and picnic areas and scoping and environmental \nimpacts, and I say to them, save your breath and save the taxpayers' \nmoney and work on things for a change that do matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Move the Prairie Dogs\n\n             (By U.S. Senator Byron Dorgan, D-North Dakota)\n\n       The National Park Service wants to spend nearly a quarter \n     of a million of dollars to move a picnic area in Theodore \n     Roosevelt National Park to accommodate a colony of prairie \n     dogs that moved into the area. A quarter of a million \n     dollars? To move a picnic area? To accommodate prairie dogs?\n       They must be kidding, right? No. They're serious.\n       Following is the text of a letter I'm sending to the acting \n     Director of the National Park Service in Washington, D.C.:\n\n       Dear Mr. Galvin: This is in response to the Park Service \n     letter asking for my thoughts about how to deal with some \n     prairie dogs that have ``colonized'' your picnic area in the \n     south unit of the Badlands in North Dakota.\n       Your letter stated that you are ``scoping'' the issues and \n     about to prepare an ``Environmental Assessment'' (EA) to \n     determine whether you should spend $223,000 to reconstruct \n     the picnic area in a different location.\n       We're in the middle of a rather complicated fight about the \n     federal budget here in Congress, but still, I'm pleased to \n     offer a few thoughts about prairie dogs and picnic areas.\n       Now I want you to know that I'm not unsympathetic to \n     prairie dogs. They are cute little creatures. Unlike a rat, \n     the prairie dog was blessed with a furry tail and button nose \n     and seems to have a better public image. But, I just wonder \n     if it had been rats that had colonized the picnic grounds if \n     you would be talking about spending a small fortune to fix \n     the problem? Maybe I shouldn't ask. . . .\n       My advice is this: don't waste the taxpayers' money. You \n     don't have to move the picnic grounds. Move the prairie dogs!\n       When I was growing up in Regent, some rats ``colonized'' \n     (to use your term) our horse barn. My dad told me that since \n     it was our barn, and the rats could live a good life just a \n     mile south in the town dump, I should get rid of them. I \n     recruited a few school friends to help. We didn't do any \n     ``scoping'' or ``Environmental Assessment.'' The rats were in \n     a foul mood, but they were no match for three fourteen year \n     old boys. We reclaimed the Dorgan barn in no time.\n       Now getting back to the prairie dogs that are \n     ``colonizing'' your picnic area, I figure that there are \n     about 1,428,288 acres of ground in the Badlands that those \n     little dogs can colonize. But they have no right to do it in \n     your picnic area.\n       So here's what you should do. And it's nearly cost free. \n     Find a way to communicate with those prairie dogs. If you \n     don't know how, check with some of the neighbors living in \n     western North Dakota. When you live on a farm or ranch, you \n     learn quickly how to communicate with animals.\n       Once your Park Service employees get the hang of \n     communicating with prairie dogs, have them let those dogs \n     know you're reclaiming your picnic area, with force if \n     necessary. And if those prairie dogs won' leave, you go out \n     and hire three or four teenagers from the area and tell them \n     to get the job done. I guarantee you those kids will have \n     this problem solved in just a couple of days. And it don't \n     cost you $223,000.\n       Don't misunderstand me. I am a supporter of our \n     environment, of wildlife and, yes, of the Endangered Species \n     Act. And so are most North Dakotans. But prairie dogs are not \n     endangered in western North Dakota. To those who insist they \n     are, I challenge them to put a male prairie dog and a female \n     prairie dog in their own backyard and report back to us in a \n     couple of years.\n       The fact is, we're not short of prairie dogs.\n       We're running short of people!\n       The real endangered species, especially in the western part \n     of our state, is the human species.\n       Farmers and ranchers are leaving the land at an alarming \n     rate. Small towns are shrinking like prunes. Many rural \n     counties are fast becoming wilderness areas.\n       When I received your letter about prairie dogs, picnic \n     areas and environmental impact statements, it seemed such an \n     unusual response to such a small issue.\n       Having prairie dogs move into a picnic area doesn't rank up \n     there with the problem of people moving out of our state.\n       You'll have to excuse me for being impatient with federal \n     agencies that treat the light too seriously and the serious \n     too lightly.\n       Just once I would like to hear of a federal agency \n     interested in doing an impact statement on what our country \n     will lose when there are no family farms or ranches left in \n     rural America. How about ``scoping'' that issue? Or how about \n     an impact statement on the damage done to our farmers and \n     ranchers from the mergers and monopolies that are being \n     formed in the industries that farmers rely on such as the \n     railroads, grain trade, packing plants and more.\n       By now you probably regret asking for my advice. Simply \n     put, my advice is don't you dare spend nearly a quarter of a \n     million dollars to move that picnic ground. Move the prairie \n     dogs.\n       And then spend some time with me and others in Congress to \n     help create a friendly environment for people to make a \n     decent living on our farms and ranches in rural America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Byron L. Dorgan,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Mr. President, this has been a tumultuous week in the \nSenate. We have had significant legislative accomplishments. I think it \nis an interesting process to watch the changes that are taking place. \nIt always makes me value our Constitution\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\nand the peaceful transitions of power our Constitution has provided.\n  I was watching C-SPAN this morning. The topic was ``The Greatest \nGeneration.'' People were talking about what they consider to be our \ngreatest generation. The debate was about whether the greatest \ngeneration was the wonderful heroes who went to battle in World War I \nand especially World War II, because we are talking to them, and in Tom \nBrokaw's book ``The Greatest Generation'' being the silent heroes, the \npeople who answered the call of their country and fought bravely and \ncame home and never talked about it, never whined, never complained. \nThey are, indeed, our great heroes.\n  Then people started talking about the greatest generation being our \nFounding Fathers and their families, and the sacrifices they made when \nthey declared independence and when they crafted our Constitution that \nset in place the document that has kept us vibrant and alive today.\n  Through all of the things that I, personally, have lived, even in my \nmere 7 years in the Senate, I have seen our Constitution tested and \nprevail, tested and come through, tested and show the wisdom of the \nbalance our Founding Fathers put in place so we could have changes in \npower and have them peacefully.\n  While talking about the greatest generation, it also has come home to \nme when I have visited foreign countries, foreign countries that have \nseen the despotism of military rule, of dictatorships, of communism. \nThey are coming out of those totalitarian governments. They are coming \ninto democracy. I thank the Lord, I thank my lucky stars, and I feel so \ngrateful we had Founding Fathers, and families who supported our \nFounding Fathers, who created a document that is living today, that has \ngiven the balance so we have never had a totalitarian government since \nthe democracy we formed in 1776.\n  I feel very proud, and it came home to me today as I started thinking \nabout the greatest generation. I think our Founding Fathers and their \nfamilies certainly created generations behind them who also were great \nin that they answered the call of the time. That is what has happened \nthroughout the 17 or so generations since the founding of our country. \nSometimes we have not had to answer a crisis. Sometimes the United \nStates has had a period of peace and prosperity. When we have been \ntested throughout the 17 or 18 generations, we have met the test. We \nhave met the test because we have learned from our Founding Fathers and \ntheir families and we have built on their strengths and the \nConstitution they created. We have been able to answer every test with \nsuccess.\n  I feel very grateful to live in a society where we can debate which \nwere the greatest generations. I don't think we have had a generation \nthat has ever sunk to the lows we have seen in other countries and \nother societies where our Government has broken apart or our \ninstitutions have broken apart. I think we have perhaps expanded beyond \nthe boundaries, but we have always come back because we have the \nstructure that we do.\n  I appreciate very much the opportunity to serve in the Senate in this \ngreat democracy and hope we will always be able to meet the test of the \nstrength of our Founding Fathers and always be grateful for the \nConstitution that has been so vibrant throughout the generations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe).

Madam President, while I was presiding, something \noccurred to me. I felt compelled to share it.\n  Right now, something very significant is taking place. There is a \nconference committee that is looking at the bill that we passed and the \nbill that was passed in the House of Representatives. They are going to \ncome out with a product and decide just how to change it because the \nbills are not exactly the same.\n  It is a piece of legislation that will do something very significant. \nIt is going to provide tax relief for the American people. It occurred \nto me--I will use the words ``liberal'' and ``conservative'' in a very \nfriendly way, but all too often, people do not know what you are \ntalking about when you call someone a liberal or a moderate or a \nconservative.\n  A liberal believes that Government should have a greater involvement \nin his or her life and really believes that there are more things in \nwhich the Government should be involved. I suggest to you that the more \nthings Government gets involved in, the more individual freedoms we \nlose.\n  I happen to be a conservative. I agree that Government is involved in \ntoo many things. I think that other than national defense, which we \nneed to be more involved in right now, there are many activities taking \nplace in this country that our Founding Fathers really did not think \nwere the role of the Federal Government.\n  We are in a very strange time right now. We are in a time when we \nhave surpluses. We are all very gratified for that. But the whole idea \nof tax relief is offensive to people who fall into the definition I \njust referred to of a liberal. They want to use that money. They want \nto start new programs.\n  Now we have this time of surplus. I want to applaud the President of \nthe United States, George W. Bush, because what he said he wanted to do \nwas, first of all, take everything that could be used to spend down the \ndeficit for the next 10 years and use it.\n  I have a lot of town meetings in my State of Oklahoma with very wise \npeople, but they are too busy going out to make a living and paying for \nall this fun we are having in Washington, that they do not really \nunderstand that when you have such surpluses that once you use those \nsurpluses to start new Government programs, then the Government \nprograms might work, and the problems that they are addressing might go \naway but the Government program goes on.\n  I can remember that one of the greatest speeches made during my \ncareer was one that was made many years ago by Ronald Reagan before he \neven ran for Governor of California. The speech was called ``Rendezvous \nWith Destiny.'' He said: There's nothing closer to immortality on the \nface of this Earth than a Government agency, once formed.\n  So if you don't want to increase the size and scope of Government, \nthen you need to address what the President is addressing now. \nPresident Bush said: Let's start off by taking all the money to pay \ndown the debt. Most people think, if you had $5 billion, you go up \nthere and drop it someplace and the debt would be gone. That is not \ntrue because you can't pay off something until it comes due. So what \nthis President has suggested to us is, let's pay off everything for the \nnext 10 years that can be paid off on the national debt.\n  Then let's look at Social Security. Let's make sure the fund is \nactuarially sound and the money is going to be there for the people \nwhen they reach the age that they can draw it out.\n  Incidentally, Social Security reform doesn't mean that is going to \nchange. That program would continue; the money will be there; but it \nwill give some of the new people who come into the program an option as \nto what they do with the money they pay into the system.\n  Then the President said: Let's take Medicare and do the same thing \nwith that. So he proposed actually increasing it by $153 billion over a \nperiod of 6 years--that would take care of that problem--and after \nthat, to put some money in so we can take care of a very serious \nproblem, the most serious problem the Nation is facing right now, and \nthat is the demise of the military over\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\nthe last 8 years. Let's build that back up.\n  After that has been done, all of that is behind us, then let's take \nthis surplus that remains and return it to the American people as an \noverpayment because they paid too much. It is like buying a car and you \nfind out when you get back home, you read the sticker price and think, \nwait a minute, I paid too much. You go back to the dealer and you \nexpect to get the money back. He would say: I gave it to my mother-in-\nlaw. That is kind of what happens in this case.\n  So we have the opportunity to return to those who paid it an amount \nof money. We should be looking at a much larger tax reduction than they \nare negotiating right now. What they are negotiating right now, if you \nput it in as a percentage of GDP, would be about 1 percent. Yet our \nother two major reductions in this century were far greater than that.\n  The liberals are missing a bet. If they really want to get more money \ninto the system, they should be supporting larger tax cuts because \nhistory has shown us, when you reduce the marginal rates, it has the \neffect of increasing revenues.\n  Going back to World War I, the President, after World War I, said: \nThe war effort is behind us now so we will go ahead and reduce these \nmarginal income tax rates. And they did. To their shock, they found out \nthat it didn't reduce revenues. It massively increased revenues.\n  I am a conservative Republican. I look back wistfully at the days \nwhen we had a President, a Democrat, who realized that this concept \nworks every time. It was President Kennedy in the 1960s who said, we \nneed to expand the role of Government and get into a lot of programs--\nperhaps such as the dental program the Presiding Officer discussed--and \nthe best way to do this--this is a direct quote from President \nKennedy--to increase revenues, is ``to reduce the marginal rates so \nthat the economy will expand.'' For each 1-percent expansion in the \neconomy, that produces about $46 billion in new revenue.\n  Sure enough, it happened. In fact, it almost doubled the revenue in \nthe 6 years after that massive cut. Remember how big that cut was? It \nwent from 91 percent down to 78 percent. It was a huge cut, much \ngreater than we are talking about doing today. So that worked and some \nof these programs were funded.\n\n  Then along came Ronald Reagan. The decade of the 1980s, from 1980 to \n1990, saw the largest tax reduction in the history of this Nation. \nPresident Reagan was elected and the first thing he did was sign the \ntax reduction. He took that 78-percent rate and brought it all the way \ndown to, I think, 28 percent. The result was great increases, massive \nincreases in revenues.\n  To document that, the total amount of revenue that came in from all \nmarginal rates in 1980 was $244 billion. In 1990, it was $466 billion \nafter all the reductions that had taken place, the largest reductions \nin any 10-year period in the Nation's history.\n  You hear the liberals saying: Look at all the deficits that came \nabout during that 10-year period. That wasn't a result of the \nPresident. That was a result of a very liberal, big-spending, Democrat-\ncontrolled House and Senate that increased the spending.\n  You cannot blame that on the President because he was the one who \nreduced the taxes and was responsible for doubling the revenues at that \ntime.\n  We should stand back and look at this. We had one of the financial \nadvisers to President Clinton, when he was President when he first came \nin, who made the statement that there was no relationship between the \nlevel of taxes the Nation pays and its productivity. Theoretically, \nthat means if you pay 100-percent taxes, you will be just as motivated \nto work hard and to expand the economy as if you were paying no taxes. \nObviously, that doesn't make sense.\n  It is time the American people realize what we are trying to do and \nwhat this President is trying to do and that we get the best conference \nreport out and that this can be a very historic time because sometime, \nmaybe today, that conference report will come out. It will incorporate \nsome tax reduction, not great tax reduction--the top rate may be going \ndown from 39 to 35 percent--and actually eliminating some taxes down at \nthe lower income level. I think we have an opportunity to pass this \nthing out today. This will go down as probably a great legacy, not just \nfor the President of the United States but for the House and the Senate \nwhich are working on this.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5675-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5675-S5677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            A MOMENTOUS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about some of the \nactivities that are going on right now. We have had a momentous week in \nthe Senate. We passed a tax relief bill so that every working American \nwould get relief from the burden of taxation. We passed a budget that \nis responsible stewardship of the people's money.\n  I stress people's money because one of the things I think is very \nimportant is that we remember the money people work so hard to earn is \nnot the Government's money. It is what people send to the Government to \ndo the functions of Government and that we have the responsibility to \nassure it is wisely spent and what isn't necessary for the functions of \nGovernment is sent back to the people who earn the money. We believe \nthat people can choose how to spend their money better than a big \nGovernment program can do.\n  So we have passed the budget resolution that provides for tax relief \nfor hard-working Americans. It would be $1.35 trillion over a 10-year \nperiod. It would pay down the debt to the maximum extent possible \nwithout paying a premium for early payment of outstanding Treasury \nissues. And I think that is a very important component because paying \ndown the debt frees up more money that is going to go to interest \npayments, and that is money that can either go into the spending that \nis necessary to cover the costs of Government or more can be sent back \nto the people who earn the money.\n  We also do provide in the budget that was passed at least a $500 \nbillion cushion--a rainy day fund--which we think is very important for \nmeeting the emergencies we might face in the next 10 years. It is also \nimportant for the added spending that we know we are going to face. We \nhave set a 5-percent limit on the increase in spending for the next \nyear. A 5-percent increase is more than most families are going to \nincrease their spending in the next year, so I certainly think it is \nthe most we should go beyond this year's spending of the Government \nmoney.\n  With that 5-percent increase and the $500 billion rainy day fund, we \nwill be able to spend more in the priority areas such as national \ndefense. We know we have fallen behind in the last few years in keeping \nup our strong national defense. We also know we are going to have to \nmeet some future technology tests in order to maintain our superiority \nand security. So that means we are going to be looking at the next \ngeneration of airplane, the next generation of ship, the next \ngeneration of land-based vehicle, and the next generation of missile \ndefense.\n  We must perfect our theater missile defense, so that when our troops \nare in any theater in the world, they will have the protection of a \nmissile defense system, such as the PAC 3, which is a hit-to-kill \nmissile--a missile that can hit a missile. That has been tested and it \nworks. It is going to be the most successful theater defense system we \nhave ever had in our country.\n  We are also looking at a longer range missile defense system, \npossibly a sea-based system and, later down the road, an \nintercontinental ballistic missile defense system. This is because we \nwant to make sure that our shores are totally secure from any kind of \nincoming ballistic missile and that our people, wherever they may be in \nthe world defending our interests, will also be secure. So that is \ngoing to take more money and we are going to put more money into it.\n  In addition to more defense spending, we are going to have to deal \nwith prescription drug options in Medicare and\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nprescription drug benefits for people who are facing true hardships in \nmeeting their medical needs. That will take more money. I hope we can \nreform the Medicare system so that it does meet the test that all of us \nwant it to meet for quality health care for our senior citizens, and \nthat we can add a prescription drug component. So that will be another \narea of added spending.\n  I hope we will be able to have a Social Security reform bill, and all \nof the money that is now in Social Security surplus will be held for \nSocial Security reform. It will be held for the integrity of the Social \nSecurity System that is done in the budget we have passed because we \nwant to reform Social Security to make sure it is secure, not only \ntoday and 10 years from now but in the year 2030 when it will go into \ndeficit if we don't do something to make sure it remains solid.\n  So we passed a very good budget. In that budget, we also allocated \n$1.35 trillion for tax relief. I am very proud that our conferees are \ntrying to work that out between the two Houses. The two Houses passed \nvery different bills. The Senate bill was passed this week; the House \nbill was passed earlier. They are different bills. The rate reduction \nis different in the two bills, so we are trying to reconcile those rate \nreductions. We are trying to make some of the reductions earlier in the \nprocess, over a 10-year period. Some of the rate reductions take effect \nlater in the 10-year period. We would like to bring all of the \nreduction into 2002 so that every working American would start feeling \nsome relief by January 1 of this year.\n  We are trying to give relief from the marriage penalty. When two \nsingle people are working--for instance, a policeman and a \nschoolteacher--when they get married today, they will pay approximately \n$1,400 more in taxes just because they got married. You may say, why \nwould they have to pay $1,400 more in taxes? Why would our Tax Code do \nthat? Well, it is because when they get married, they go into the next \nbracket; whereas, if they make $30,000 and $25,000, respectively, and \nthey are in the 15-percent bracket, when they get married they go into \nthe 28-percent bracket. That is a $1,400 hit. So we are going to try to \nrelieve that penalty.\n  In the Senate bill, there was very solid relief--double the standard \ndeduction, double the 15-percent bracket. That is solid relief. It will \ntake place over the 10-year period. Many of us hoped it would take \nplace sooner than the 10-year period, but at least if we can get that \nrelief on the books, we will begin to change our Tax Code so that it \ndoes not discriminate against people who get married. We want people \nnot to think of taxes as a factor when they decide to tie the knot and \nstart their family.\n  So anything in the Tax Code that will have the effect of cutting back \non the ability of people to get married and start their families, buy \ntheir first home, buy the extra car, whatever it is, we want them to be \nable to do it without regard to the Tax Code.\n  So we are looking at significant rate reductions that will affect \nevery working American. We are talking about significant marriage \npenalty relief. We are also talking about relief from the death tax. We \nare talking about trying to keep a family-owned farm or business in the \nfamily.\n  I don't want to continue to see family businesses in our country sold \nto big businesses and take away the family nature of the business which \nis important to that family and important to every employee of that \nfamily business. I want those family businesses to stay together. I \ndon't want every farm in America to be part of an international \nconglomerate. I want family farms to make it in America, and I want \nfamily ranches and family small businesses. That is the economic engine \nof this country, and it has been our tradition for over 200 years, \nvaluing family-owned businesses.\n  If we can pass them through the generations without taxing them and \ncausing them to have to be sold to pay inheritance taxes, then I think \nwe will have maintained one of the very important economic engines of \nAmerica, and we will have maintained a very strong tradition and a very \nstrong part of the entrepreneurial spirit that has helped build this \ncountry. So we address that death tax, and we eliminate it over the 11-\nyear period, and we significantly increase the exemption through the \n10-year period.\n  The fourth area of major tax reduction that we hope will come out of \nthe conference report and was a component of both the House and Senate \nbills is the child tax credit. We are trying to double the child tax \ncredit over a 10-year period. Today, it is $500. We hope to increase \nthat to $1,000.\n  So the four major parts of our tax relief bill will be a major tax \nreduction through rate reduction, marriage penalty relief, death tax \nrelief, and the $500-per-child tax credit doubles for every family.\n  There are many other important elements; there are many other \nimportant tax relief measures I would like to see pass. If we can keep \nthose four strong elements so that everyone will realize relief in a \nbig way, I will be happy.\n  Hopefully, we will lower the capital gains rate and will increase the \nIRAs and the pension capabilities. The more people can save, the better \noff our country will be and the more stability our country will have. \nThose are all worthy. I hope we can do those at a later time.\n  There are some very important education deductions in the Senate \nbill. I hope we can keep some of them. Trying to help people with their \neducation expenses is the most important thing we can do to increase \nthe number of young people who get a solid education, K-12 and college.\n  It will be a great stepping stone to go into the next year if we can \npass the tax cut bill. Right now the conference committee is working. I \nbelieve Senators are willing to stay. We thought we would be out for \nMemorial Day right now. We thought we would be gone. I thought I might \nbe home with my family last night, but I am not. I am here and so is \nevery Senator.\n  We hope to pass this tax reduction package. If we cannot do it today, \nwe are willing to stay until tomorrow. We will pass it tomorrow if we \ncan get out the tax cut package and certainly we hope we can finish \nthis business because there will be some major changes that are \ndependent on our passing that tax cut legislation.\n  There are major changes in the Senate. They are not my first choice \nfor changes, but nevertheless the decision has been made, so we ought \nto go forward and let people start making concrete plans about how the \nSenate is going to be organized. It is in everyone's best interest to \ndo that.\n  The Senate is staying in session. We are going to make every effort \nto finish this tax relief bill for the American people if we have to \nwork today, tonight, tomorrow, Sunday, Tuesday--whatever. If we can \ncome to an agreement on a tax cut bill that has the general principles \nI have outlined that were passed in the House and Senate bills, then we \nwill be in very good stead with the American people that we have done \nour job to the best of our ability in a bipartisan way, and we will \nthen come back and start the business of reorganizing the Senate and \ncontinuing to do the people's work.\n  When we come back from Memorial Day and visiting with our people at \nhome, we are going to start talking about the energy crisis. During \nMemorial Day weekend, we are going to want to start thinking about how \nwe can address the energy crisis in a meaningful way, hopefully with \nsome short-term relief but, more importantly, for the long term.\n  We have three major problems with the energy crisis in this country. \nWe have a production problem. We are importing 56 percent of the energy \nneeds of our country from foreign countries, and that is not a good, \nstable situation. We have a distribution problem in that we do not have \nenough refineries and pipelines to distribute the energy even if we \nincrease production, and we have a conservation, a consumption problem. \nWe need to encourage people in every way to conserve heating and air-\nconditioning in their homes, the gasoline they use in their cars.\n  We can encourage people to conserve. We hope they will do it anyway. \nWith incentives, people will be even more encouraged to conserve.\n  We have a three-pronged energy problem: production, distribution, and \nconsumption. That is going to be our priority when we return.\n  Senator Murkowski has been talking about the energy crisis in this \ncountry for the last 4 years. I have been privileged to work with him, \nalong with\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nSenator Breaux, Senator Landrieu, Senator Domenici, and Senator Thomas, \non this energy issue in a bipartisan way.\n  We have been saying for the last 4 years we have an energy crisis in \nthis country. We have not been able to get the rest of the Members of \nCongress to listen. They are going to listen now, and Senator \nMurkowski, myself, Senator Breaux, Senator Thomas, Senator Domenici, \nSenator Landrieu, Senator Bingaman--all of us are going to be working \non an energy package that will address the three components.\n  It must be balanced, and we must address all three components.\n  I hope we can get tax relief on the table, letting people keep more \nof the money they earn, and send it to the President. I know he is \ngoing to sign it because he asked for it. He campaigned on it. He kept \nhis promise; he asked for it and we are going to give it to him. Now we \nare going to address energy. We are going to address education reform \nand try to keep doing the people's business.\n  We have toiled in the fields. We have worked hard. We have a lot to \nshow for that work. We will finish the job the people have asked us to \ndo on tax relief and, hopefully, we will go home, turn a leaf, and \nstart addressing education and energy when we return.\n  I am proud of the job our President is doing, and I am proud of the \njob the Senate has done.\n  I end by saying on a personal note, I am very proud of our leader, \nSenator Trent Lott, the majority leader of the Senate. He has worked \nvery hard to push the President's programs he campaigned to do and was \nelected to do.\n  Senator Lott has the most unfailing sense of humor and optimism of \nanyone I have ever met. He has been hit with a few blows in the last \nfew weeks. I admire what he has been able to do, working with the \nDemocrats, saying we are going to work in a bipartisan way. Through the \nfilibuster of the tax cut bill, he kept his optimism. He never let \ndown. He let the 50 or so amendments be voted on time after time. He \nkept his good humor.\n  Now he is facing becoming the Senate Republican leader rather than \nthe Senate majority leader, and he is already reaching out to Senator \nDaschle, who will be the majority leader in the next couple of weeks. \nHe said: We are going to keep working with you, and we are going to try \nto work in a bipartisan way to assure the people's business gets done.\n  My hat is off to Senator Lott today. I have seen him up close in the \nlast few weeks, and I can tell you he is a leader who is determined to \ncontinue to do his job in the best way he can, in the most sincere way \nhe can, never with acrimony, always trying to do the right thing, \nworking with a 50-50 Senate, which has not been the easiest job he has \never been handed but one he has tried to dispatch in a most fair and \nequitable way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. STABENOW).

Madam President, last evening, the Senate of the United \nStates confirmed MG William J. Lennox, Jr., of the U.S. Army, to be the \n56th Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West \nPoint.\n  General Lennox is an extraordinary officer and gentleman. I have \nknown him for a long time. In July of 1967, we entered West Point \ntogether. He proceeded through West Point and for 30 years he has been \nan extraordinary soldier. He represents the very best of what our Army \nis all about. He is a soldier and he is a scholar, but he is a soldier \nfirst.\n  He was commissioned in field artillery and served in various \ndemanding assignments from platoon leader, battery commander, executive \nofficer of the 2d Battalion, 41st Field Artillery in Germany; Deputy \nCommanding General to the U.S. Army Field Artillery Center and School \nat Fort Sill; Chief of Staff, III Corps at Fort Hood; and Assistant \nChief Of Staff, United Nations Command for the United States Forces \nKorea. In his most recent assignment, General Lennox was the liaison \nfor the Department of the Army to Congress.\n  He has performed all of these duties in extraordinary fashion. Bill \nLennox understands our Army is composed of the greatest soldiers in the \nworld. He respects these soldiers. He has committed himself to lead \nthese magnificent men and women with the same dedication, the same \nprofessionalism, the same fidelity to duty and country that these \nsoldiers demonstrate every day.\n  He is a great soldier, but he is also a distinguished scholar. Bill \nwas assigned to the Department of English at the Military Academy after \nreceiving a master's degree from Princeton University. He accomplished \na remarkable feat while teaching English at West Point. While being \nactive as an officer and professor at the Military Academy, he also \nobtained his Ph.D. from Princeton University in English.\n  He is a rare combination of a great soldier and a real scholar. In \nfact, typical of the Army life, nothing is very easy. The day Bill was \nscheduled to take his final Ph.D. examination and present his oral \ndefense was also the day that his family was moving from West Point to \nhis next assignment. So as Bill was taking these exams, and after \nspending the week preparing not only for a demanding analysis of \nEnglish literature but also a move, fortunately, his wife and his \npartner, Anne, had to pack up the house and get them moving.\n  It illustrates something else that General Lennox brings to West \nPoint. He has an extraordinary family. His wife Anne has not only \nplayed a large part in his life, but also a large role in his career. \nTheir sons are extraordinarily talented young men. Together, Bill and \nAnne will represent to a whole generation of cadets, both male and \nfemale, the exemplar of what an Army family should be: committed, \npatriotic, and dedicated. They will ensure that cadets are conscious \nnot only of their role as a professional members of the military \nservice but also of their role as people and neighbors.\n  Bill is following a distinguished predecessor, LTG Dan Christman. The \nUnited States Military Academy today has compiled a remarkable record. \nDan has reinvigorated the Academy in terms of academic performance, \nphysical infrastructure, and commitment to basic values that make our \nMilitary Academy and our Army a very special one indeed.\n  I am confident that Bill Lennox can meet the very high standards \nestablished by Dan Christman and a whole succession of predecessors: \npeople such as William Westmoreland, Douglas MacArthur, and Robert E. \nLee. West Point has a very storied tradition and great legacy. Bill \nLennox brings to that great tradition the character of a soldier and \nsomething else: Bill understands and appreciates that he is helping to \ntrain the leaders of the army of democracy; that unlike other countries \naround the world, we do not have a separate military caste. The men and \nwomen who lead our Army, the soldiers who man our Army come from every \nwalk of life. They understand that they defend this great democracy, \nwith all its contradictions, with all its unmet, untidy, and messy \nproceedings. They do it with great faith and great fidelity, with great \ncompetency and great patriotism.\n\n  I am delighted and honored to be able to say a few words about my \nfriend and the next Superintendent of the United States Military \nAcademy. I am pleased to commend Bill Lennox for his career and to \ncelebrate his new appointment. But I am also honored to convey to my \ncolleagues not only deep respect and affection for Bill, but also the \nsense that our Army is producing and promoting an individual who \nrecognizes what we do here is very important. As Superintendent of the \nUnited States Military Academy, he will ensure that this democracy will \ncontinue.\n  Ultimately, it is not our weapons, but it is the brave men and women \nwho wear the uniform of the United States that allows this experiment \nin freedom and democracy to continue day in and day out. He will \ninstill in a generation of cadets a deep devotion to the credo and core \nvalues of the Military Academy: duty, honor, country. He will do that \nbecause he has lived his life according to that credo of duty, Army, \ncountry.\n  To Bill and Anne, good luck, Godspeed, go forward, and lead a right \ninstitution into this new century.\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, our Senate colleagues are anxiously \nawaiting the report from the conference committee that is attempting to \niron out the differences between the House-passed tax bill and the \nSenate-passed tax bill. I thought perhaps some who are waiting for this \noutcome would be interested in some thoughts with respect to what has \ngone on so far and what we might expect from the conference. In \nparticular, I will address remarks to the part of the bill in which I \nwas most involved.\n  I begin by noting that the conferees, who are the people on the Ways \nand Means and Finance Committees, are busy at work trying to iron out \nthe differences between the two bodies. Part of the success of getting \nthe bill to the conference in the first place is attributable to the \nbipartisan leadership of the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \nChuck Grassley of Iowa, and Max Baucus, the ranking Democrat from \nMontana. They worked very hard to develop a bill which wasn't all \nconservative or all liberal, all Republican or Democrat, but which \nrepresented views of a substantial part of the membership of the \ncommittee on both sides of the aisle. It represents most of what \nPresident Bush wanted, but not all, and not quite to the same degree, \nbecause by definition it is a compromise.\n  Because of that compromise, and it had support from both sides of the \naisle, over the course of the last week there were 45 different \nattempts to amend the bill. Every one of them failed. In other words, \nthe Members of this body voted time after time after time to support \nthe work of the Senate Finance Committee, understanding it represents a \ngood compromise.\n  Of course, there has to be another compromise, and that is with the \nHouse of Representatives. The bill the House passed represents a little \nmore closely the views of President Bush. Naturally, those on the \nRepublican side of the aisle are hoping there will be a compromise \nbetween the House and Senate versions that truly does reflect a meeting \nof the minds.\n  The Senate-passed bill was only a total of 10 years of $1.35 trillion \nbecause that was the compromise amount. That meant we could not grant \nrelief quite as robust as the House had done earlier. All of the \nRepublicans and 12 Democrats voted in favor of that bill.\n  From my perspective, it was not perfect; it certainly was a very good \nstep toward tax relief, providing, most importantly, marginal tax \nrelief from income tax rates and significant relief from the estate tax \nand eventual repeal, after 10 years, of the estate tax.\n  I am hopeful this conference committee will be able to reach a \nconclusion and enable the Senate to pass this bill sometime tonight or \ntomorrow, whatever might be the time.\n  I will discuss primarily the provisions relating to the phaseout and \neventual elimination of the death tax in the year 2011. The death tax \nprovisions being negotiated now, it is my understanding, are not as \nmuch as either in the House-passed bill or the Senate-passed bill. The \nreason is because there has been an effort to accommodate more Members \nwith what they wanted to include in the bill. Everything else has to \ngive. The net result is, according to my understanding, that the range \nthey are talking about now, out of a total of $1.35 trillion, is about \n$135 billion, or 10 percent.\n\n  For practical purposes, about 10 percent of the tax relief under the \nbill goes to rate reduction of the death tax and an increase in the \nexemption and eventual repeal in the 10th year. President Bush, by \ncontrast, allocated $260 billion for death tax relief. We are trying to \nget by to do more with less.\n  Probably the most important thing is there has been an understanding \nboth in the House and in the Senate reflecting the will of the American \npeople that there is something terribly unfair about a provision of the \nTax Code that literally taxes people because they die; not because they \nsold an asset; not because they saved or invested or had some other \nkind of economic transaction that they fully knew the tax consequences \nof but, rather, they are taxed because they die.\n  We have come to conclude, representing the view of the majority of \nAmericans, there is something very unfair about taxing people after \nthey die. Actually, you are not even taxing the person who died. You \nare taxing that person's heirs--the spouse, the children--at the very \nworst time of their life following this tragic event. It is not fair. \nIt doesn't represent good tax policy.\n  There is a good way to substitute the capital gains tax for the \nestate tax, so that the assets end up being taxed but being taxed the \nsame as any other assets, based upon an economic decision, if and when \nthose assets are sold, and then taxed at the capital gains rates. But a \ntax is not imposed at the time of death. Fundamentally, death should \nnot be a taxable event and that is a core principle that will come out \nof this tax bill. It is a core principle embodied in the repeal of the \nestate tax, sometimes called the death tax.\n\n  To me, the most interesting thing to come out of this debate is the \nrealization that the American people have a fundamental sense of \nfairness. When you ask them whether it is fair to tax at the rate of \nabout 25 percent, for example, they say no; we ought to get taxes down.\n  When you ask them if it is fair that death should be a taxable event, \nthey say no, even if they do not think they are ever going to benefit \npersonally from repeal of the estate tax. Fairness is what this effort \nto repeal the death tax is all about.\n  What I mostly wanted to do today is to report the results of a \nnational poll of just this week. So we are not talking about something \na long time ago--just this week, a very objective poll. So it has a \nvery low margin of error. It is a poll by the respected McLaughlin & \nAssociates of a thousand likely voters from around this country.\n  Here is one of the questions they asked. They wanted to ask the \nquestion, in effect, in the worst way possible. They said: Do you \nbelieve it is fair or unfair for Congress to impose a 40-percent or \ngreater tax on an estate worth $1 billion?\n  You could say, Do you think the death tax is unfair? I guarantee at \ntownhall meetings people say: No, the death tax is not fair. That is \nnot really putting the question in the most objective way. But when you \nask: Is it fair or unfair for Congress to impose a tax of, be specific, \n40 percent or more on estates--you don't use the death tax \nterminology--on estates of $1 billion or more, that is the loading of \nthe question. That is the part that biases it, $1 billion or more, \nshould you tax them at more than 40 percent?\n  Do you know what the answer is? By 60 percent the American people \nsay: No, it is unfair. Only half that many said it was fair. How many \nof those people do you think would benefit from a repeal of that estate \ntax? Out of 1000, I don't know, maybe one but maybe not. There are not \nmany people in this country leaving an estate of $1 billion. Yet all \nAmericans realize it is fundamentally unfair to impose a tax of more \nthan 40 percent.\n  Of course, I might add the law currently is that it is about a 60-\npercent tax rate, but the question was not biased.\n  I think what that shows is right this week the vast majority, by 2 to \n1, of Americans believe that even a tax rate\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\nof 40 percent is unfair. The reason that is significant is in the \nSenate bill we were not able to reduce the tax rate on estates of even \n$5 million, let alone $1 billion, to that 40 percent level. As a matter \nof fact, I think we got it down to 45 percent, if I am not in error. \nYes, we reduced the rate from 60 percent down to 45 percent. The House \ngot it down into the 30s. I have forgotten whether it is 37 or 39 but \nsomething like that. We ought to be working to reduce the rate below 40 \npercent before the tax is finally eliminated in the 10th year. But we \nwere not able to do that. I hope that is something the conference \ncommittee will work to do, to try to bring that rate down just as much \nas they possibly can.\n  What is interesting about this survey that shows that American people \nare fundamentally fair minded is that the results were the same across \neconomic and political classes. For example, just as many voters who \nearned under $20,000 as those earning over $100,000 said the practice \nwas unfair; exactly 61 percent in both cases. It is consistent across \nthe political spectrum, very similar. Among Republicans, 65 percent \nsaid it was unfair. Remember the baseline is 61 percent. Slightly more \nRepublicans, 65 percent, said it was unfair. Slightly fewer Democrats, \n54 percent, said it was unfair; and Independents, 62 percent, almost \nright on the button.\n  The bottom line is, whether Republican or Democrat or independent, a \nsubstantial majority believe that even a 40-percent tax on $1 billion \nestate is unfair.\n  The other interesting thing is this survey tracks all the other \nsurveys I have seen over time. I will go back just 1 year because that \nis a nice frame. But the clear and resounding message is the estate tax \nis unfair and ought to be stricken from the code. The same McLaughlin & \nAssociates conducted a poll earlier this year, in January. It found \nthen that 89 percent of the people surveyed believed it was not fair \nfor Government to tax a person's earnings while it is being earned and \nthen tax it again after the person dies--which is exactly what the \nestate tax does.\n  Mr. President, 79 percent approved the idea of abolishing the estate \ntax--79 percent. That is very consistent with other surveys as well.\n  I went back a year ago because there is an interesting Gallup Poll \nthat was done just a year ago--not quite a year ago. It found 60 \npercent of the people supported the repeal, even though about three-\nfourths of them believed they would never receive any direct benefit \nfrom that repeal.\n  Again, it goes to the notion of fairness. People believe an unfair \ntax should be repealed even if it is not going to help them at all. The \nreality is it probably would help them in terms of its indirect \nbenefits. I noted during the debate on the estate tax the economic \nbenefits to repeal, in terms of new jobs created, the infusion of \ncapital into the economy, the growth of the economy--all these things \nwould be significantly benefited from a repeal of the estate tax. Of \ncourse, that benefits all Americans.\n  As John F. Kennedy said, in a different context, with respect to tax \nrelief, ``A rising tide lifts all boats.'' So if you can help the \nAmerican economy, it helps everybody in the economy, even if you are at \nthe lower end. So the reality is, repealing the estate tax does help \nall Americans. But it obviously helps some more than others. It \nespecially helps those in two categories: First of all, those who pay \nthe tax. That is not very many people. It is maybe in the hundreds of \nthousands--maybe a million, I don't know. But if you take members of \nfamilies who are directly affected by this, clearly it is a number that \nis very much in the millions, if at all. Yet Americans fundamentally \nbelieve it is unfair to tax them.\n  The other larger group that is affected by the tax is, of course, all \nthe people, especially the small business people--family-owned farms \nand family-owned businesses--who have to spend their money to try to \nplan their estate in such a way as to minimize the estate tax \nliability. This is difficult and expensive.\n  The Women-Owned Business Association--by the way, women-owned \nbusinesses represent more than half the small business in this country. \nThey surveyed their members and found--just 2 years ago I believe it \nwas--the average small business spent $60,000 to do this expensive \nestate planning.\n  I note there was an op-ed in the Washington Post this morning by a \nvery wealthy American who testified before the Finance Committee. He \nsaid it was really a shame we were going to do away with the estate \ntax. Of course, his point was he didn't think the American people \nreally believed that way; yet I think the survey results show that they \nare. But people like this individual have the money to do the estate \nplanning. They do not suffer from the tax. It is the small businesses \nand family-owned businesses and farms that end up having to pay a lot \nof money to buy insurance, to pay lawyers and accountants and estate \nplanners to try to avoid the tax.\n  The real cost of the tax is at least as much, and probably more, in \nthe wasted money spent to avoid paying the tax than it is the revenue \nto the Federal Government in the first place. Mr. President, 2 years \nago when the tax collected about $20 billion, there is a study that \nshowed that almost exactly the same amount of money, by coincidence, \nabout $23 billion additional, was spent by people to avoid paying the \nestate tax or minimize their liability. So it is a very inefficient \ntax, as economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell said in writing a \n1992 study. They said death taxes ``have failed to achieve their \nintended purpose. They raise little revenue. They impose large excess \nburdens. They are unfair.''\n\n  I think the thing to note at this point in time in this Chamber, at \nabout 2:20 on Friday afternoon, is that the conference committee is \nworking away trying hard to bridge the gap between the House and Senate \nversions of the estate tax. I think all of us are hopeful that they \nwill conclude their work so we can vote on the bill and provide tax \nrelief to Americans.\n  This is a bill which provides relief all the way from the refundable \ntax credits, literally providing money to people who do not pay taxes, \nall the way up to those few people who, as I said, would receive relief \nfrom the estate tax. But most importantly, it would provide marginal \nrate relief for all Americans.\n  We have an opportunity now. I hope that we can drive the rates of the \nestate tax down prior to the repeal but, in any event, we will have \nstruck a blow for fairness in this country by reducing marginal rates; \nreducing, if not eliminating, the marriage penalty, which is very \nunfair; and, finally, getting rid of a tax that a majority of Americans \nbelieve is very unfair, a tax that literally requires people to pay \nmoney to the Government because they died, the estate tax.\n  Madam President, we have a wonderful opportunity. I hope the \nconferees come back soon and we will have a chance to vote on this \nlegislation.\n  Again, I commend the members of the conference and, in particular, \nthe bipartisan leadership in the Senate, Senator Grassley and Senator \nBaucus, for the fine work they have done to get it this far.\n  I just hope now we can conclude the work and send it down to the \nPresident for his signature and the benefit of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I yield myself a few minutes to talk \nabout energy this afternoon, if I may, please.\n  First, I thank my friend from Arizona for a very complete discussion \nof the tax reduction bill. Certainly, it is one of the most important \nthings we will do during this Congress, and, indeed, over the next \nnumber of years.\n  The whole question, in the broad sense, of how you do taxes is very \ninteresting. One question is, How are they fair? How do you make them \nfair among all the taxpayers? Another question is certainly the amount. \nHow do you justify taking this money from citizens and it going to the \nGovernment? And when you have more than enough, what do you do with the \nsurplus?\n  So I thank the Senator very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5679-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5679-S5681]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IMPORTANT ISSUES BEFORE THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

One, of course, is the \nbudget. I think our success in the budget is holding down spending to \nsomething somewhat below what it has been in the past. Because we have \nhad a surplus, the expenditures have gone up really more than you would \nimagine they would in terms of inflation and those kinds of things.\n  So this budget was held--I think the President asked for 5 percent--\nto a little in excess of that, but, nevertheless, a reasonable budget \nof which we can be proud.\n  The question now, of course, is staying within the budget. The budget \nis not an imposition of a limit; it is a pattern and a scheme to try to \nstay within. But it does not necessarily ensure that. That will be the \nreal challenge.\n  The second thing we have dealt with, and have not yet completed, of \ncourse, is education. For most people in this country, education is the \nfirst issue they mention when they talk about issues.\n  Again, there are some rather basic issues that really ought to be \ntalked about and decided. One issue is, What is the role of the Federal \nGovernment in elementary and secondary education? I think most of us \nwould agree--and our experience has been--that State and local \ngovernments have the principal responsibilities in education. With that \ncertainly ought to go the opportunity to make the decisions on a local \nbasis.\n  The schools in Wyoming, obviously, have different needs, and have \ndifferent uses for the dollars, than in areas of the country such as \nPittsburgh or New York. And, therefore, local decisionmakers ought to \nhave a chance to be able to use those dollars in the ways they are \nneeded.\n  Another issue in education, of course, is the basic question of, What \nis the role, in terms of expenditures, of the Federal Government? I \nthink over the past number of years the Federal Government's \ncontribution financially has been something less than 7 percent. So it \nis a relatively small contribution but a very important one and has \ncaused us to have some of the programs that, of course, are very \nessential to our young people and very essential to education.\n  The tax bill that has been talked about is probably the most \nimportant thing we will do for a very long time. Hopefully, we will \nconclude that this afternoon. We will return a substantial amount of \nthe surplus to those people who have paid it in and, at the same time, \nretain enough money to do the things that most people believe are a \nhigh priority; that is, to pay down the debt--to pay down all of the \ndebt that is available to be paid down--to do something more with \nSocial Security and pharmaceuticals, to ensure that Medicare is strong \nand continues in the future, and, of course, to have some flexibility \nso that there will be money there for increased expenditures for the \nmilitary and for security.\n\n  I think all of those areas will be covered in this proposal that is \nbefore us.\n  The next issue that has a much higher profile now than normally is \nthe question of energy. Of course, one of the reasons that it is now on \nso many people's minds is because prices have gone up substantially. \nThere is the difficulty in California, the shortages that have occurred \nthere. You can talk in many ways about why it has happened and what was \nthe cause, but, nevertheless, it is there. Certainly there are some \nfairly interesting things that have happened there that have brought \nabout the difficulties in electric energy.\n  But energy, of course, has been an issue for some time. It is not a \nbrand new idea. It isn't hard to understand that when the market \nmessages tell you that consumption is going up and production is going \ndown that you are going to have a wreck inevitably and you need to do \nsomething about it.\n  It is not hard to tell that we have put ourselves at risk when we \nfind ourselves depending nearly 60 percent on oil imported into this \ncountry as opposed to domestic production. That is an increase that has \nchanged substantially over the last several years.\n  I suppose one might also say that it is not hard to imagine that you \nhave some problems when you really have not had an energy policy for \nthe past number of years, so that whatever has been done has not been \npart of a coherent plan to provide sufficient energy.\n  So I am very pleased to applaud the President and Vice President Dick \nCheney for the effort that they have put in--and immediately put in--to \nthe energy issue. The White House energy tax force, chaired by Vice \nPresident Cheney, has produced an energy package that has now been \npresented to the public and to the Congress with some 105 proposals \nthat need to be considered, some of which can be done by administrative \nfiat within the Government. Others will have to come to the Congress, \nof course, to be acted upon.\n  I have been serving on the Energy Committee for some time and have \nbeen very interested in public lands and the interior. It has been very \ninteresting that we focused entirely on the Department of Energy which, \nin turn, has not focused much on energy but, indeed, has had most of \nits focus, over the last several years, on one of its other \nresponsibilities, which is nuclear: nuclear waste, nuclear security, \nLos Alamos. Those kinds of things have been almost the entire attention \nof the Department of Energy as opposed to energy.\n  So it is significant to me that in this work group the Vice President \nhas included not only the Secretary and the Department of Energy, as, \nof course, it should be, but also the Department of Interior, which \nmanages our public lands--which have some of the greatest energy \nreserves--and also EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency, which has \nhad a great deal to do with the production of energy and the \nregulations that have been promulgated.\n  So I think it was an excellent idea to have this collaborative \neffort, to bring several different agencies together. I hope they \ncontinue to be a part of dealing with the whole energy issue.\n  So I certainly support a program that recognizes that we have \nsignificant energy demands and one that begins to look for a solution--\na solution that also includes conservation and the protection of the \nenvironment. I think those are very key elements.\n  I come from the State of Wyoming. We have a good deal of energy \nproduction in our State. Some call it the Btu capital of the world. We \nhave probably the largest reserve of coal in the United States, as well \nas natural gas and oil. We have uranium, all those kinds of things. We \nalso have some of the most beautiful mountains and flats and prairies \nof any State in the Union. And we have, for a number of years, produced \nenergy. We intend to continue to do that. We intend to continue to do \nit in such a way that you can protect the environment at the same time \nyou have multiple uses of those lands. But there will be lands that \nwill not be used for a multiple use. They have been set aside as \nwilderness. They have been set aside as national parks, and that is as \nit should be. And so we do have to differentiate.\n  But in the policy, of course, we talk about energy and fuel \ndiversity, which I think is very important. Certainly we are going to \nhave a number of kinds of fuels that we can use, coal being one.\n  There is emphasis on clean coal technology so we continue to research \nways that coal, which now produces about 52 percent of our electric \ngeneration, can be used with less intrusion into the air. We can do \nthat. In this plan there are opportunities for that.\n  Renewables: We need to take a look at the long-term importance of \nrenewables. Certainly all of us would like to see more power generated \nfrom wind and solar. Currently only about 1 percent of our consumption \nis produced by renewables. It can be greater, and we hope it will be.\n  Hydro: Of course, we need to take a look at our opportunities for \nrenewables in hydro. Interestingly enough, some of the \nenvironmentalists who are critical of the President's plan more \nrecently were asking to tear down dams. It is sort of a paradox.\n  Nuclear has a role, certainly. We have seen over the last few years \nthat nuclear-generated power is probably the most clean power that is \navailable and can be done in a safe manner. We need to do more there. \nWe need to do something, however, about the waste storage, of course. \nThat has not yet been resolved.\n  These are some of the things that can be done, and I hope we do them. \nWe have an opportunity to set out a policy and then use a combination \nof production and conservation to protect our environment. Those are \nthe challenges we can indeed meet.\n\n[[Page S5681]]\n\n  I yield time to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5681-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5681-S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we are all waiting for the conferees to \ncome back to us with the tax bill. As we do that, I thought it might be \nappropriate for me to talk a little bit about some of the rhetoric that \nhas surrounded the issue of taxes in the time we have together.\n  If I may, I will be a little personal because I have experience with \nthe issue of marginal rates which might be of some value to this debate \nand which I would like to share.\n  As many Members of this body know, I was one of the founders of a \nbusiness that started in what the pundits have come to call the decade \nof greed; that is, the 1980s. In that period of time, that which has \nbeen most commented on and most decried by the pundits is the fact that \nthe top marginal tax rate was 28 percent.\n  We are talking now about an attempt on the part of President Bush to \nbring that tax rate down to 33. It is pretty clear from the \nconversations I have had with the conferees that that is not going to \nhappen. I think it will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 35.\n  Someone said: Why does Michael Jordan need a tax cut? Why does Ross \nPerot need a tax cut? Why does Donald Trump need a tax cut? Isn't it \nproper that they continue to pay the lion's share of the taxes in this \ncountry? And they do. The people in the top 1 percent pay most of the \ntaxes. To put it in another statistic: The top 400 taxpayers--this is \nless than 1,000 tax returns--pay more than 40 million of the taxpayers \ndown below; 400 pay more taxes in dollars received than 4 million \npeople down below.\n  Why do those 400 need a tax cut? They have plenty of money. That is \nthe argument we hear.\n  I will concede that I don't think Michael Jordan needs a tax cut; I \ndon't think Donald Trump needs a tax cut; and I don't think Ross Perot \nneeds a tax cut. But under the Constitution, we have equal protection \nof the laws, which means if you provide a tax cut for someone, for a \ngood and logical reason, someone else who happens to be in the same \nboat, even if he is rich, gets the same equal protection of the law and \ngets the same tax cut. So it is the side effect, if you will, that \nMichael Jordan gets a tax cut.\n  Here is the experience I had which I think gets ignored over and over \nand over again in the rhetoric that is thrown out with respect to tax \nrates. As I say, my associates and I started our business during the \ndecade of greed when everybody was saying it was so terrible that the \ntop marginal tax rate was 28 percent. We used, as most businesses did \nat that time and many businesses still do now, a provision of the tax \nlaw that is known as section S of the tax law. Those who use it are \nknown as S corporations as a result of their election.\n  All that means simply is that the profits of the corporation are not \ntaxed at the corporate level. They flow through, as the Tax Code \nprovides, to the individual tax returns of the shareholders.\n  We had five principal shareholders. That meant that as the \ncorporation earned money, that money flowed through to our tax returns. \nIf I can be fairly dramatic, in terms of the impact on me, I was \nearning my salary as the CEO of that company, which I and my wife \nthought was a relatively modest salary, but I filed a tax return \nshowing that I had earned more than $1 million. Why? Because my share \nof the profits of the corporation showed up on my tax return.\n  Now it made absolutely no difference whatsoever to my take-home pay, \nwhich was tied to my salary, because the corporation did not give me \nany money beyond the money necessary to pay my share of the taxes. Why \nwould we do that?\n  There are two reasons we made the S corporation. The first and \nprimary reason is that we wanted to avoid double taxation. If the \ncorporation earned $1 and paid corporate taxes on it--and let's take \nthe corporate rate at the time, which I believe was 38 percent--if the \ncorporation earned $1 and paid 38 cents of that dollar to the Federal \ntaxes and then gave the resulting money to the shareholder, the \nshareholder would then have to pay taxes a second time on the money \nthat came as a dividend. If you make an S corporation, you only pay \ntaxes once instead of twice. That is the primary reason people make the \nS choice.\n  The second reason was that if we did the S choice, we only paid 28 \npercent on that $1 earned instead of 38 percent on that $1 earned. \nNaturally, we wanted to save the extra 10 percent, 10 cents on the \ndollar.\n  Many people have the idea that when you earn money, you buy yachts \nand you take vacations and you waste the money overseas in what the \nScriptures would call ``riotous living.'' In fact, of course, when you \nare growing a business, you need every penny. It goes into inventory. \nIt goes into accounts receivable. It goes into capital investments. If \nthe business is growing--and our business was doubling every year; it \ndid that for about 6 years running--you are always behind.\n  Indeed, I say to the students in business school, when I am asked to \ntalk to them about this, the most terrifying thing you can do in a \nstart-up business is make a profit, because then you owe taxes. Uncle \nSam shows up and wants his tax money in cash.\n  You don't have it in cash because, as I say, your profits are all \ntied up in inventory, all tied up financing your growth. You end up, in \nmost instances, borrowing cash from the bank in order to pay your \ntaxes.\n  We paid a marginal rate of 28 cents out of every dollar we earned, \nand we plowed every one of the remaining 72 cents back into that \nbusiness to make it grow. Our salaries did not increase. My take-home \npay actually went down when that extra $1 million showed up on my tax \nreturn, because then I was being treated, as far as the Federal \nGovernment was concerned, as if I were a basketball star earning that \n$1 million, and that wiped out all of my deductions. That may not \nmatter much to some people, but we had six children at the time, and \nthat constituted a fairly significant amount of deductions that all of \na sudden we couldn't take because we were ``rich.''\n  My take-home pay on my W-2 pay hadn't changed. The amount of money I \nwas being paid by the corporation had not changed.\n  All that had changed was the bookkeeping entry on my tax return. \nWell, I am not complaining because the business was successful--so \nsuccessful that we could look back on it now and realize that that \nbusiness started literally in somebody's basement, with 2 employees, a \nhusband and a wife, that then doubled to 4 employees, and that is how \nmany they had when I joined them; I made No. 5. That business is now \nemploying about 4,000 people. They are paying literally millions of \ndollars in Federal taxes, both the corporation taxes, the income taxes \nof the payrolls that have been generated with those 4,000 folks, plus \nthe suppliers, plus all the rest of it. It is a fairly typical American \nsuccess story.\n  The point of all this is not to bother you with details of my \nexperience, but to point out that the difference between the top \nmarginal rate of 28 percent that we pay and the current effective rate \nof 42 percent is 50 percent of the original amount; 14 points out of \nthe 28 percent have been added on to the 28 percent. I suggest to you \nthat if we were trying to start that business today, we would not have \nbeen able to finance it.\n  Many of the people who looked at this business said to us: How are \nyou doing this? This growth is phenomenal. How are you creating these \njobs?\n  We said we did it with internally generated cash. We didn't sell \nstock; we didn't go to the bank, although we had a credit line at the \nbank, of course. But we did it because we were able to save enough of \nthe profit dollars we earned to pay for the growth of that business and \ncreate those jobs.\n  You can never say anything with certainty with respect to \nhypotheticals, but it is my conviction that if we were starting that \nbusiness today, facing an effective tax rate of 42 percent, we would \nnot succeed. We could not afford to do it. Therefore, we would not have \ncreated the 4,000 jobs that exist now.\n  The point I want to make with respect to the top marginal rate is \nthat it does not just apply to the Michael Jordans and Donald Trumps of \nthis world. That marginal rate applies to\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\nthe entrepreneurs who are trying to do the same thing my associates and \nI were lucky enough to do--start a business, create jobs, add to the \ngrowth of this country, and discover as they go along that they need to \nhang on to every penny they earn to finance that growth, and every \nadditional percentage point that we in the Congress put on the marginal \nrate hampers the opportunity of people to do that.\n  Senator Grassley, chairman of the Finance Committee, has offered the \nstatistics of how many hundreds of thousands of small businesses trying \nto become big businesses are affected, how many hundreds of thousands \nof them, with their subsequent millions of employees, would be \nbenefited by the kind of tax relief at the top brackets that President \nBush is urging us to pass.\n  We never hear that from the folks in the national media. Sometimes I \nwish that some of the people who are the talking heads on the shows on \nSunday, who pontificate with such certainty about economic matters, \nmight just take a few weeks off from their situation in front of the \ncameras and come out into the real world and try starting a business, \ntry employing people, try creating jobs, and discover that life is a \nlittle different. Some in this Chamber have that experience.\n  Comments were made by one of the more distinguished Members of this \nChamber who ran for President in 1972--the Democratic nominee, Senator \nMcGovern. He was firmly and solidly in the camp of those who insist \nthat top marginal rates should be higher and higher and Government \nshould regulate more and more. He tells the story of how, after his \npolitical career was over, he still had enough notoriety left over that \nhe could give some speeches and earn some money for those. As he was \npaid honoraria for the speeches, he accumulated some money and he \ndecided: Now is the time for me to relax a little. I will buy a \nbusiness.\n\n  He bought an inn in New England. Maybe he watched Bob Newhart's show \nand he thought that would be a nice thing for him to do--whatever. He \nhas come back and said: If I had had the experience actually running a \nbusiness in the real world before I became a Senator instead of \nafterwards, I would have been a very different kind of Senator. I would \nhave had a very different view about regulations and taxes and the way \nthe Government interferes with people's lives.\n  This came from a man who at the time was labeled the most left of all \nof the Presidential nominees put up by either party in a generation. \nComing back from the actual experience, he finds things are really \ndifferent in the real world than they are on the Sunday talk shows, and \nsometimes as they are portrayed in the Senate.\n  So while it may sound too personal for me to share this experience, I \nthink it may have some value because we need to understand, as we are \nvoting on this marginal tax rate, that we are talking about something \nfar more than just the amount of taxes Michael Jordan or Donald Trump \nor Ross Perot may pay. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of \nbusinesses in this country that have been slowed in their growth, \nslowed in their ability to create jobs by seeing a jump in the \neffective rate go from 28 percent, which it was prior to 1991, to an \neffective rate of 42 percent now. And then people are beginning to \nwonder why there are some slowdowns in the economy.\n  There is another point I want to make about this issue and the \nrhetoric that has gone around about it. We are told over and over again \nthat the primary benefits go to the top 20 percent and the folks at the \nbottom 20 percent don't get anything out of this. That is terrible, we \nare told, and we must somehow find a way to use the Tax Code to take \nthe money from the top 20 percent and make it available to the bottom \n20 percent.\n  There are several things that need to be said with respect to this \nargument. The first is the statistically obvious one. As long as you \nare dealing with 100 percent and dealing in percentages, you are \ndealing in what the mathematicians call a zero sum game; that is, you \ntake a sum from this side, it must be added to that side, and \neverything in the end, one subtracted from the other, gives you zero, \nbecause everything equals.\n  The economy is not a zero sum game. Neither is society. If you are \ntalking about the top 20 percent, you will always have a top 20 \npercent. You can't have a 100-percent scale without statistically and \nmathematically having a top 20 percent. So the top 20 percent will \nnever disappear. No matter how much you make an attempt to take money \nfrom the top 20 percent and put it in the bottom 20 percent, \nmathematically, somebody else will always show up in the top 20 \npercent.\n  The second point, however, is the more important one, and that is, in \nAmerica, more than in any other economy and any other society in the \nworld, there is fluidity all up and down the economic scale.\n  If I may be personal once again, let me demonstrate that. I have been \nin the bottom 20 percent. I am an entrepreneur. I start businesses. \nMost of the businesses I have started have failed. That is the way \nentrepreneurs live. I sat down when I got an award as entrepreneur of \nthe year and said: Am I really?\n  I did a little calculation, and up to that time I had been involved \nin 11 different businesses that would be considered startups or \nturnarounds, 11 different entrepreneurial activities. Of those 11, 4 \nfailed outright--just flat died. Four we managed to sell before there \nwas any profit or loss; we broke even and got out. Only three of those \nbusinesses survived. Of the three that survived, only two really were \nmajor successes. One of the three was a minor success that was on a \nplus, so I have to include it. So there is the track record: Out of 11, \nbasically there are 2 success stories.\n  While I was in one of the others that was not a success story, I was \nin the bottom 20 percent. Indeed, I was in the bottom of the bottom. I \nwas getting no income. I was dipping into my savings, and when the \nsavings were gone, I was going into debt. I was paying the payroll of \nthe business on my American Express card, and then my American Express \ncard got canceled because I hadn't made the payments on it.\n  Statistically, I was in the bottom 20 percent. It was not 5 years \nafter that somewhat dispiriting experience that I was in the top 20 \npercent. One of those entrepreneurial efforts hit, and when it hits, it \nhits rapidly, at least in my experience. I went through the bottom 20 \npercent, the next 20 percent, the next 20 percent, the next 20 percent, \nup to the top 20 percent pretty fast.\n  Did I get from the bottom 20 percent to the top 20 percent because \nthe Government took money from the top 20 percent and gave it to me \nwhile I was in the bottom 20 percent? No, I got there because the \nAmerican economy makes it possible for entrepreneurs to have this kind \nof success story.\n  Quite frankly, since I have been in the Senate, I have gotten out of \nthe top 20 percent. I have started coming back down again. That sort of \nfluidity happens to us all the time.\n  I have used the name of Donald Trump. Donald Trump has been from the \ntop to the bottom to the top again as his real estate ventures go good \nand go bad.\n  The problem is not the statistical one of where people are at any one \nmoment in time. I have six children. Right now some of them are doing \npretty well. I have one child who, with her husband, probably is pretty \nclose to the bottom 20 percent. He is not earning anything, and my \ndaughter is supporting him. Gee, isn't that terrible, until you find \nout he is a student at the Harvard Law School and has pretty good \nprospects of good earnings once he gets out. He is going into debt now. \nHe is in the bottom 20 percent, but when he gets his degree from the \nHarvard Law School, I believe he is going to be in fairly high demand \nwith people dangling $125,000 a year starting salaries in front of him, \nand he will move very rapidly from one to the other.\n  The problem we should be talking about is not the dry statistics of \nincome, it is the reality of skills. The income gap in this country is \nnot something that can be addressed with the Tax Code. The income gap \nin this country is a skill gap and has to be addressed through a series \nof educational initiatives, retraining initiatives, both government and \nprivate, and a recognition that the people who have the skills in the \nfreedom of the American economic and environmental system have the \nopportunity to move up. But\n\n[[Page S5683]]\n\nwhen they move up, they will always be replaced statistically with \nsomeone who is earning less than they are who ends up in the bottom 20 \npercent.\n  Interestingly enough, when we had hearings before the Banking \nCommittee on the issue of the Tax Code and tax relief, and Alan \nGreenspan was testifying before us, one of the members of the committee \nsaid to him: Mr. Chairman, with respect to the good economy we are \nenjoying, tell us who has benefited the most in terms of the economic \nstrata of the United States, which group has gotten the greatest \nbenefit out of this good economy?\n  Knowing the political orientation of the Senator who asked the \nquestion, I think he was expecting and hoping that Alan Greenspan would \nsay: Well, this economy has mainly benefited people at the top and the \npeople at the bottom have not gotten anything out of it.\n  I think the Senator was a little surprised when Alan Greenspan said: \nWithout question, the people who have benefited the most from this good \neconomy are the people at the bottom of the economic scale.\n  Then he was asked how can that be because statistically the top 20 \npercent has gotten richer than the bottom 20 percent. But Alan \nGreenspan pointed out a great truth: It probably does not make any \ndifference--I am not quoting him now; this is my summary--it probably \ndoes not make any difference whatsoever to Bill Gates whether his \nportfolio is $60 billion or $80 billion in terms of his lifestyle. He \nstill has his big house at $60 billion. He still has all of his \nopportunities at $60 billion. His life has not changed at all if it \ngoes from $60 billion to $80 billion.\n\n  However, someone who cannot get a job, who suddenly finds that he or \nshe can and become gainfully employed for the first time in his or her \nlife sees an enormous change, and that, indeed, has been the primary \nimpact of this good economy. It has virtually, at least for a period of \ntime, eliminated unemployment.\n  I can remember when we thought structural unemployment in this \ncountry was about 6 percent, and when we got down to 6 percent, we had \nfunctional full employment. We saw unemployment go down below 4 percent \nat times in the recent boom situation, and who got those jobs? People \nwho were unqualified for the jobs that were available when unemployment \nwas higher.\n  I remember visiting with employers in my State and asking them: What \nis your biggest progress in this booming economy?\n  They said: We cannot hang on to workers. We will take any warm body. \nWe need workers.\n  I said: Will you take the unskilled?\n  They said: Absolutely, we will take the unskilled and we will spend \nthe money training them; we will spend the money making them skilled \nbecause we have to have people.\n  One employer said: We have a job fair opening where we rent a room \nand ask people to come in. They come in, we make a presentation to \nthem. Say there are 30 or 40 people in the room. We make a presentation \nfor an hour. We break for coffee and only 10 of them come back \nafterwards. All 40 of them are unemployed and want a job, but 30 of the \n40 decided they did not like the way we made the presentation. And they \ncan always walk down the street and get a job someplace else.\n  That is the impact of a booming economy on the people at the bottom. \nIt gives them an opportunity that will make a more dramatic change in \ntheir lives than the change in the lives of the people at the top. That \nis what Alan Greenspan was talking about when he said in terms of the \nimpact for good on people's lives, there is no question whatsoever but \nthat the booming economy we are having has affected for good more \npeople at the bottom than it has people at the top.\n  Yet from the rhetoric we hear around this Chamber, we are told over \nand over that if we do not somehow take money away from the people at \nthe top and shift it to the people at the bottom, we are going to \ndestroy American democracy.\n  This class warfare kind of rhetoric simply does not jibe with \nreality. It does not jibe with what we have experienced in the last 10 \nyears. It does not jibe with what the economists tell us is reality, \nand it certainly does not jibe with that which the small business man \nand small business woman will tell you in terms of actual job creation.\n  Of course, the statistic we need to keep in mind is that the great \njob-creating machine in this country is not the Fortune 500. The great \njob-creating machine that is creating new jobs is not headed by Exxon, \nGeneral Motors, Ford, and DuPont. No, the jobs are being created the \nway the jobs were created in the circumstance of which I was fortunate \nenough to be a part: A company started in a basement by a husband and \na wife that within a decade has created 4,000 jobs, and in the process \nof creating those 4,000 direct jobs, among the suppliers, there are \nanother 2,000 to 3,000 to 4,000 jobs as people are hired to produce the \narticles that our company has to buy in order to provide its product to \nits customers.\n\n  As we wait for the report to come in from the conferees as to where \nthey are going to put the marginal rate, I wanted to take the time to \nmake it clear that the political rhetoric that flows around this issue \nreally has little or no connection with reality.\n  In reality, a lower marginal rate primarily helps small businesses to \ngrow. A lower marginal rate is crucial to the rate by which small \nbusinesses grow. The rate at which small businesses grow is the most \nimportant dynamic in terms of how the economy is growing, and for those \nwho get statistically hung up on the gap between the top 20 percent and \nthe bottom 20 percent, they must remember and recognize that in \nAmerica, more than any other society in the world, the freedom to move \nboth up and down the ladder is greater than anywhere else.\n  If we can understand those things, we can come to a more intelligent \ndecision with respect to where the marginal rate will be. I have no \nillusions that the conferees will bring the marginal rate in at the \nlevel that I would like, but I hope that once it comes in, in future \nCongresses we can keep all of this in mind and take another bite at the \napple at some particular point.\n  My desire would be to bring the top marginal rate back down to where \nit was during the decade of greed where, quite frankly, we sowed the \nseeds of the great economic expansion about which we are all excited \nand for which politicians of both parties have been taking credit when, \nin fact, they have had little or nothing to do with it.\n  I think the work I did at the Franklin Company before I came here had \nmore to do with creating jobs than anything I have done since I have \nbeen here. I want to get the marginal rate back down so others who are \ntrying the same kinds of things we did will have the same opportunity \nthat we did.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel).

Mr. President, I rise to speak also about the tax cut \nproposal, about the debate on how to keep the economy going. I rise in \ngreat respect for my friend from Utah, who was successful in business, \nand lays out a prospective about how to keep the economy going.\n  While I share his view that we need to be focused on a skilled \nworkforce and that is critical to keeping our economy moving, he and I \nrepresent two different views of how best to do that. That is the \ndebate going on in Washington now. I characterize it as a debate about \nwhether or not the 1980s or the 1990s worked. I argue the bill that \nwill come back--whether tonight, tomorrow, or next week--is a bill \nbased on the notion that the economic policy of the 1980s worked. I \nargue from the Michigan standpoint, and anyone in Michigan, any \nfamilies, businesses, farmers I represent, would indicate the 1980s \nwere not a good time for Michigan. We had high unemployment, high \ninterest rates. We saw massive debts both at the State and national \nlevel. It is the same kind of approach I fear will be happening today \nwith the policies being laid out.\n  No. 1 in the debate is how to give a tax cut. Is it supply side, as \nmy colleague talked about?\n  The proposal we are being asked to vote on is a very large tax cut, \ntwo-thirds to the upper income wage earners, those in the top 10 \npercent. And\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nthen we wait for it to trickle down. My folks in Michigan have been \nwaiting for the tax cut of the 1980s to trickle down and hit their \npocketbooks. Many have not seen it. We are being asked now to, once \nagain, place it there. I am supportive and have voted for tax relief \nand will continue to do that. I prefer to do tax relief that goes \ndirectly into the pockets of the majority of Americans.\n  Contrary to this tax cut, I believe we should eliminate the marriage \npenalty, not in 6 years, as in this bill, but now. Talk about unfair, \nthat is extremely unfair. We are a country that values family and \nmarriage. Yet we have a tax structure that unfairly penalizes those who \nare married. I support a proposal and did vote for a proposal to give \nrelief now to married couples by eliminating that unfair tax penalty.\n  There is a difference in approach. The approach being put forward \nsays a very large supply-side tax cut will trickle down. Coupled, in \nthe 1980s, with a very large increase in defense spending and not \ncontrolling other spending, what happened? We tripled the national \ndebt, interest rates were at the highest level ever, and employment \nwent down.\n  In the 1990s we tried something different. Tough decisions were made. \nRevenue was put aside to pay down the national debt that had been \ntripled in the 1980s. We paid it down, slowed the rate of spending. We \nwere able to make sure we were putting aside money for Social Security \nand Medicare and paying those dollars back instead of spending it on \nother programs. We were putting those dollars back and paying back \nMedicare and Social Security trust funds. We have had very tough \ndecisions made to balance the budget.\n  And we did something important in the 1990s. We focused on real \ninvestments in education, job training to get that skilled workforce, \nand in research, health research, technology research, developed the \nnew technologies that when combined with an educated workforce would \nincrease our labor productivity.\n  It is a very different approach. We focused on growing the economy by \ninvesting in education, paying down our debt, investing in research and \ntechnology development, and balancing the budget.\n\n  What happened? In the 1990s, high interest rates went down. We have \nseen home ownership up. In my State of Michigan, more and more young \npeople and older people are able to have their own home, an important \npart of the American dream. We have seen unemployment, jobs, go up in \nthe 1990s as a result of this approach to the economy. We saw budget \ndeficits go down and the Federal deficit go down.\n  This is a no-brainer. What do we want? The 1980s or 1990s? Yet what \ncomes before us in the year 2001 is a set of proposals that takes us \nback to what happened in the 1980s. We are seeing a proposal that gives \ntwo-thirds of the tax cut to those at the very top, hoping it will \ntrickle down.\n  We know as soon as this bill passes there will be requests for very \nlarge increases in defense again, and other increases will come forth. \nTo me, what is most intolerable, is the tax cut proposed spends $550 \nbillion of Medicare and Social Security to pay for it. That is not \nacceptable.\n  Over the next 10 years, we are seeing a tax cut and budget proposals \nthat spend Medicare and Social Security right before the baby boomers \nbegin retiring in 11 years. There is no time to pay it back. We are \ngoing to be facing massive debt if that is the case. I am very \nconcerned about that.\n  Right now we are seeing the financial managers in the country, in the \nprivate sector, who are beginning to see it, as well. While short-term \ninterest rates are going down, long-term high interest rates are going \nup in anticipation of the country going back into massive debt.\n  I urge Members, it is not too late to stop this train, to put some \nbrakes on it. I propose we create, as we did on this floor--we had an \namendment we tried twice to pass--a budget trigger which says if the \nphase-in of the tax cut dips into Social Security and Medicare to pay \nfor it, if we go back into debt, we will suspend that action, further \ntax cuts or spending, until the revenue comes in.\n  In Michigan, we call that common sense. Don't spend it unless you \nhave it. We believe fiscal responsibility, keeping the budget balanced, \npaying down the debt, protecting Social Security and Medicare are \ncritical and should not be compromised for any other actions no matter \nhow well intended. We have a train going down the track. My fear is \nthere will be no budget trigger to stop the train before it goes off \nthe track. That is common sense.\n  We are going to be asked at some point to vote on a final budget \nproposal that spends Medicare and Social Security moneys for the \nfuture. When we look at the fundamental unfairness, we see that those \nwho are most dependent on Social Security, most in need of Medicare \nhealth benefits, are those who receive little or nothing from the tax \ncut but their Social Security and Medicare, will help pay for it.\n  It is not fair. It is just simply not fair. We have in front of us a \nproposal that kept us moving in the same policy track as the 1990s. I \nurge we still have time to consider that. It is a proposal that gives \ntax relief but makes sure we condition it upon using none of Social \nSecurity and Medicare and that we keep our commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility and paying down our debt while we do it.\n  The proposal I support also would put aside dollars for education to \ncontinue our ability to keep labor productivity going in our country. \nWhen we asked Chairman Greenspan at the Budget Committee hearing what \nwas the one thing driving this economy, he said it was increased labor \nproductivity. So why in the world would we be creating a situation \nwhere education funds are going to have to be cut and research funds \nand technology development will have to be cut in order to pay for the \ntax cut in front of us?\n  I believe common sense would dictate we pay down the debt, we protect \nMedicare and Social Security, we give a major tax cut focused on our \nmiddle-income families and small businesses and family farmers, and \nthat we can do that and also be able to continue investments to keep \nthe economy going.\n  This is the approach that worked. It is hard to argue with success. \nThe policies in the 1990s were successful because of the hard work of \nboth the private sector and the public sector to move us out of debt, \nto balance the budget, and to make investments in education and the \neconomy.\n  I hope we will take a deep breath and reconsider what is about to be \ndone in the next few hours or the next few days. We can do better than \nthat.\n  Also, when we talk about putting money back in people's pockets, \nthere are multiple ways to do that, all which I support, which we need \nto do and can do while being fiscally responsible. No. 1 is a tax cut. \nNo. 2 is keeping interest rates down so your mortgage is down, as are \nyour car payment and your student loan--those things are low enough for \npeople to be able to afford those items for their families.\n  Finally, for the senior citizen in this country who gets up in the \nmorning and sits at the table and decides, do I eat today or get my \nmedicine, which too many seniors are doing in the greatest country in \nthe world, we can put money in their pockets by lowering the cost of \nprescription drugs. They will not see much of this tax cut, but they \ndeserve some money in their pocket, too.\n  If we do this right, if we use good old common sense, we can put \nforward a plan that keeps the economy going, puts money in people's \npockets, and supports our families in a way that allows the economy to \ngrow and prosper. We owe no less to our children.\n  We can do better. It is time to take a second look at what we are \ndoing.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the approach of \nMemorial Day, it is my privilege to call the attention of this body to \none of the greatest, yet least known, acts of sustained heroism in the \nhistory of the United States. It occurred 50 years ago in the sixth \nmonth of the Korean war.\n  In December of 1950 American forces accomplished the unbelievable \nevacuation of 100,000 Allied troops from the port city of Hungnam in \nNorth Korea, barely hours ahead of the charging forces of our two \nnewest enemies, North Korea and Communist China. At the same time our \nAmerican soldiers, sailors, and marines, managed to evacuate another \n100,000 persons, all North Korean civilian refugees who were fleeing \ntheir own harsh dictatorship and the ruthless Chinese army whose \nleaders had threatened to cut off their heads because some had been \naiding our United Nations forces.\n  One of the most heroic acts in the evacuation of Hungnam is the \nvirtually unknown story of a small American merchant marine freighter, \nthe S.S. Meredith Victory. With space for only twelve passengers, the \nship loaded and rescued 14,000 North Koreans--the innocent people of \nour enemy--old men, young mothers with their babies on their backs and \nat their breasts, children carrying children. Their rescue was \naccomplished during one danger-filled voyage of three days and three \nnights in bitter winter cold that ended in safety and freedom on \nChristmas Day. The United States Government, through its Maritime \nAdministration, has called it ``the greatest rescue operation by a \nsingle ship in the history of mankind.''\n  The Korean war has been called ``America's forgotten war,'' and the \nevacuation of Hungnam has been called ``the forgotten battle in the \nforgotten war.'' I submit, that the heroic story of the men of the S.S. \nMeredith Victory is ``the forgotten rescue.''\n  Fortunately, this story is now being brought to the attention of the \nAmerican people in a new book ``Ship of Miracles'' by Bill Gilbert, a \nformer reporter for the Washington Post who served in the U.S. Air \nForce during and after the Korean war. The foreword to his book is \nwritten by General Alexander M. Haig Jr. whose career included serving \nas White House chief of staff, NATO commander, and Secretary of State. \nAppropriately, however, General Haig served in Korea during the war and \nwas directly involved in the rescue of our troops and the refugees from \nHungnam. The book was released by Triumph Books of Chicago.\n  General Haig states in his foreword, ``The story of Hungnam and the \nMeredith Victory is a brilliant yet relatively unknown chapter in \nAmerican history that can now take its place, during this fiftieth \nanniversary of the Korean war, among such legendary names as Bunker \nHill, Midway, the Battle of the Bulge, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. This book \ndid not just deserve to be written--it needed to be written.''\n  The men of the Meredith Victory, led by their captain, Leonard LaRue \nof Philadelphia, emerge as the heroes of this amazing story. Every one \nof the 14,000 refugees aboard that ship survived, plus five babies born \nenroute to safety with no doctors to help. There was no food for the \nrefugees, no water, no sanitation facilities, no interpreters, and no \nprotection against the enemy. The men of the Meredith Victory \naccomplished their rescue while sailing through one of the heaviest-\nlaid mine fields in the history of naval warfare with no mine \ndetectors. They had no anti-aircraft guns in case of an air attack. \nRadio contact with other ships was forbidden for security reasons. To \nadd to the prolonged tension, the ship was carrying a large supply of \njet fuel.\n\n  The Meredith Victory arrived at Pusan on the southern tip of the \nKorean Peninsula on Christmas eve but was not allowed to land because \nthe port was already overflowing with refugees and rescued American \ntroops. Captain LaRue wrote later of ``these people aboard who, like \nthe Holy Family many centuries before, were themselves refugees from a \ntyrannical force.'' The ship did land safely on Christmas Day on Koje-\nDo island, fifty miles southwest of Pusan.\n  One of the Navy officers who participated in the Hungnam evacuation \nwas the late Admiral Arleigh Burke who became Chief of Naval \nOperations. He later said, ``As a result of the extraordinary efforts \nof the men of the Meredith Victory, many people are now free who \notherwise might well be under the Communist yoke. Many unknown Koreans \nowe the future freedom of their children to the efforts of these men.''\n  Larry King, the talk show host, said `` `Ship of Miracles' will make \nyou proud to be an American.''\n  The book has already won its first award. Mr. Gilbert has been \nawarded the Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D. Roosevelt Naval History \nPrize, awarded annually by the New York Council of the Navy League. The \nCouncil's president, Rear Admiral Robert A. Ravitz (USNR, ret.), said \nMr. Gilbert was selected ``because his book tells a story of American \nheroism and humanitarianism which has gone overlooked for 50 years and \nshould be told and made a shining part of our military history.''\n  Admiral Ravitz added, ``At a time when we are reading other stories \nabout what American forces did or didn't do in Korea and elsewhere, Mr. \nGilbert has made a valuable contribution to American history of \nrevealing this story of both the bravery and the goodness of America's \nmen in time of war.''\n  For these reasons, our nation owes a debt to Bill Gilbert on this \nMemorial Day for writing a book which reminds the American people of \nthat forgotten war and of an heroic incident in that war by the brave \nmen of the S.S. Meredith Victory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5685-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5685-S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of ``Older \nAmericans Month.'' Since 1963 when President Kennedy began this \nimportant tradition, each May has been designated as a time for our \ncountry to honor our older citizens for their many accomplishments and \ncontributions to our Nation. Those of us who have worked diligently in \nthe U.S. Senate to ensure that older Americans are able to live in \ndignity and independence during their later years look forward to this \nopportunity to pause and reflect on the contributions of those \nindividuals who have played such a major role in the shaping of our \ngreat Nation. We honor them for their hard work and the countless \nsacrifices they have made throughout their lifetimes, and look forward \nto their continued contributions to our country's welfare.\n  Today's older citizens have witnessed more technological advances \nthan any other generation in our Nation's history. Seniors today have \nlived through times of extreme economic depression and prosperity, \ntimes of war and peace, and incredible advancements in the fields of \nscience, medicine, transportation and communications. They have adapted \nto these changes remarkably well while continuing to make meaningful \ncontributions to this country.\n  Recent Census figures reveal that the number of Americans 85 and \nolder grew 37 percent during the 1990's while the nation's overall \npopulation increased only 13 percent. Baby boomers, who represented \none-third of all Americans in 1994, will enter the 65-years-and-older \ncategory over the next 13-34 years, substantially increasing this \nsegment of our population.\n  At the same time the number of older Americans is skyrocketing, they \nare in much better health and far less likely than their counterparts \nof previous generations to be impoverished, disabled or living in \nnursing homes. More older Americans are working and volunteer far \nbeyond the traditional retirement age to give younger generations the \nbenefit of their wisdom. These figures show that commitment to programs \nsuch as Medicare and Social Security, and investment in biomedical \nresearch and treatment are improving the quality of life for older \nAmericans. One of our national goals must be to ensure all older \nAmericans experience these improvements. We must continue to enact \nmeaningful legislation to help meet the needs of this valuable and \nconstantly expanding segment of our society.\n  By 2020, Medicare will be responsible for covering nearly 20 percent \nof the population. Yet 3 in 5 Medicare beneficiaries lack affordable, \nprescription\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\ndrug coverage. Though Medicare works, it was created in a different \ntime before the benefits of prescription medicines had become such an \nintegral part of health care. Today it is unthinkable to think of \nquality healthcare coverage without including the medicines that treat \nand prevent illnesses. I have and will continue to fight for Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. As a cosponsor of the Medicare Prescription \nDrug Coverage Act of 2001, I recognize the predicament many older \nAmericans are in as they struggle to live independently on a fixed \nincome and afford costly prescription drugs. It is imperative that we \naddress the needs of the Americans who have devoted so much of their \nlife experience and achievement to better our society.\n  The celebration of Older Americans Month provides us with the \nopportunity to highlight the importance of the Older Americans Act. As \na vigorous and consistent supporter of measures to benefit older \nAmericans, I am pleased that Congress and President Clinton \nreauthorized this important legislation last year. I commend my \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Barbara Mikulski, for her tireless \nefforts in pressing for enactment of The Older Americans Act Amendments \nof 2000. This legislation funds a dynamic network of community and \nhome-based services so critical to many of our Nation's seniors, \nincluding home care, ombudsman services for residents in long-term care \nfacilities, and subsidized employment for older workers.\n  One of the most beneficial provisions of the Act is the creation of \nthe National Family Caregiver Support Program. The Administration on \nAging estimates that each day, as many as 5 million older Americans are \nrecipients of care from more than 22 million informal caregivers. On \naverage, these caregivers will limit their professional opportunities \nand lose an average of $550,000 in total wage wealth as they care for \ntheir loved ones. Women are 50 percent more likely to be informal \ncaregivers, and as a result, they are more likely to risk their health, \nearnings and retirement security. As programs such as Medicare and \nMedicaid continue to feel the pressures of the current Federal budget \nprocess, the noble and compassionate work of these dedicated \nindividuals is particularly critical. The National Family Caregiver \nSupport Program addresses the challenges faced by informal caregivers. \nIt authorizes funding for distribution of information to caregivers \nregarding available services, caregiver training, and respite services \nto provide families temporary relief from caregiving responsibilities.\n  I have always believed strongly that this wise population contributes \ngreatly to American society. Our Nation's older generations are an \never-growing resource that deserves our attention, our gratitude, and \nour heart-felt respect. As observance of Older American Month comes to \na close, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nimplement public policies that affirm the contributions of older \nAmericans to our society and ensure that they continue to thrive with \ndignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5686-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5686]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a heinous crime that occurred November 7, \n1999 in Lawrence, KS. Two heterosexual men, one a student at Kansas \nUniversity, were walking down the street when some men directed anti-\ngay epithets at them. After responding to the remarks, the two were \nattacked by five men. One of the victims was knocked backwards on a \nconcrete planter and held down while two attackers struck his face with \ntheir fists. The other ran to call the police. This was the third such \nincident in as many months. One of the victims said that the police \ninitially told him they could not arrest the perpetrators because, ``it \nwas their word against ours.''\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5686-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5686-S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          ROLE OF THE FEDERAL OMBUDSMEN IN DISPUTE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last week the General Accounting Office, \nGAO, released a report I requested entitled ``Human Capital: The Role \nof Ombudsmen in Dispute Resolution.'' The report studies the use of \nFederal ombudsman offices as an informal alternative to existing and \nmore conventional processes to deal with personnel conflicts inside \nFederal agencies.\n  I know that traditional formal dispute resolution processes have long \nbeen criticized. To address these concerns, the Federal Government \npromotes and encourages alternative methods including the use of \nombudsmen. This has resulted in the greater use of alternative dispute \nresolution, ADR, practices, both because of legislation, specifically \nthe Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1990, ADRA, and because of \na desire to resolve workplaces conflicts quickly to the mutual benefit \nof both the employee and the agency. I wish to point out that ombudsmen \nare not themselves an alternative means of dispute resolution, but \nrather a neutral practitioner of dispute resolution practices, \nincluding ADR techniques, to handle complaints.\n  I support strong workplace protections to protect Federal employees \nfrom arbitrary agency actions and prohibited personnel practices. \nOmbudsmen provide another way to ensure a more rapid conclusion to \nworkplace problems. These offices may also provide another tool in \nassisting agencies in attracting, retaining, and motivating their \nworkforces. In fact, this report concludes that ``ombudsman offices can \noffer a useful option for agencies to consider in developing their \noverall human capital management policies and practices.'' Another plus \nis that these offices focus on identifying systemic issues and \ndeveloping conflict prevention strategies.\n  The GAO identified 22 workplace ombudsman offices in 10 agencies. \nTheir ``best practices'' report focuses for illustrative purposes on \noffices within three agencies: The National Institutes of Health, NIH, \nthe International Broadcasting Bureau, IBB, and the U.S. Secret \nService.\n  NIH has one of the most developed ombudsman offices, which was \nestablished in 1997, and now has four full time ombudsman. The IBB \noffice began as a part-time position in 1988, and now has two full-time \nofficials. The Secret Service's office, started in 1987, employs one \nfull-time staff member and nine collateral-duty people serving the \nSecret Service's field offices.\n  These ombudsmen are high-level managers with broad authority to deal \nwith almost any workplace issue, including answering questions about \nagency policies, cutting through ``red tape,'' counseling employees and \ncoaching them on how to manage situations, handling accusations about \nemployment discrimination, and workplace safety issues. Ombudsmen are a \nresource for Federal workers with workplace issues; an office which \nthey can consult that is independent, neutral, and provides \nconfidentiality.\n  The 1990 ADRA authorizes the use of ombudsman offices but does not \ndefine or set standards for an ombudsman. The Act, as amended in 1996, \nestablished the Interagency ADR Working Group. There is also a \nCoalition of Federal Ombudsmen. The NIH, IBB, and Secret Service \nombudsmen who participated in the GAO report are involved with both \nthese and outside organizations. Some of the non-Federal Government \norganizations have published or drafted standards of practice for \nombudsmen. These standards focus on the core principals of \nindependence, neutrality, and confidentiality, which requires a \ncommitment from the highest levels within an agency. This commitment is \nthe guiding force in the success of the three offices studied by the \nGAO.\n  In addition to support from senior management, an ombudsman office \nmust work closely with unions representing Federal workers. The General \nCounsel of the Federal Labor Relations Authority has issued guidance \nconcerning the establishment of ADR\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\nprograms and the Federal Service Labor-Management Relations Statute. It \nis essential that ombudsmen do not come in conflict with the role of \nunions in protecting worker rights. From the case studies examined by \nthe GAO, there appeared to be good relations between ombudsmen and \nunions in the agencies where employees are represented by unions. As \nagencies consider this and other alternatives to traditional dispute \nresolution, there must be assurances that employees' rights are \nmaintained throughout the process of implementing these practices.\n  I recommend this General Accounting Office report to my colleagues, \nand I commend Anthony P. Lofaro of the GAO for his contribution to this \nreport, along with Stephen Altman and Katherine Brentzel. It provides \nexcellent background and a best practices blueprint for Federal \nagencies as they consider employing ombudsman to assist their \nemployees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5687-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5687]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     AMERICAN INDIAN HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on American \nIndian Heritage Month, which is celebrated in Minnesota in May. It is \nfitting that we take time during this month to recall the \ncontributions, services and heritage of our fellow Native American \ncitizens, and to remember that the enormous contributions and talents \nof Native American continue to enrich our lives every day.\n  In our review of these vital contributions, we must acknowledge the \ncourage, talent, determination, leadership and vision of those men, \nwomen and children who made an impact on our Nation in the face of \nincredible obstacles. We should be mindful, as we celebrate the \nculture, heritage and spiritual contributions of the first Americans, \nthat we must re-dedicate ourselves to preserving the unique \nrelationship between Native Americans tribal governments and the \nFederal Government.\n  Many of the basic principles of our Constitution, such as freedom of \nspeech and separation of powers, were embodied in practices already in \nuse by American Indian tribal prior to our Republic. Many of our \ndeepest values, such as respect for the preservation of natural \nresources, reverence for elders, and adherence to tradition, find root \nin American Indian traditions.\n  The relationship between American Indians and the Federal Government \nis unique and finds no parallel. When the United States was organized \nas a Nation, government officials continued the practice from the Dutch \nand British of making treaty agreements with American Indian Nations \nwhenever land boundaries needed to be clarified or negotiated.\n  All of the land in Minnesota was gained by the United States through \na series of treaties with the Anishinabe and Dakota Nations. Sixteen \ntreaties and four agreements applied to American Indians of Minnesota. \nOne of the earliest treaties to affect Minnesota's American Indians was \nthe Pike Treaty of 1806, which allowed the Federal Government to claim \na small section of land near the confluence of the Minnesota and \nMississippi rivers to build a military fort, which ultimately became \nknown as Fort Snelling. The 1825 Treaty of Prairie du Chien created a \nboundary between the Dakota to the south and the Ojibwe who lived in \nthe woodland country to the north.\n  In addition to acknowledging the historical context of the \nrelationship between the Federal Government and the American Indians, \nwe should also recognize the various contemporary entities and \ncontributions of these Bands. Their efforts have helped shape the \nsocial, economic and political landscape of our region.\n  In the area of economic development, the Minnesota American Indian \nChamber of Commerce has done tremendous work in the area of advanced \ntelecommunications, and other forms of business development to expand \neconomic opportunities for American Indians on reservations as well as \nin urban areas.\n  The Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe was honored by the Harvard Project on \nAmerican Indian Innovation in 1999 for their Ojibwe Language Program. \nThis is a highly successful effort to revitalize the Band's native \nlanguage by teaching it to their younger members in innovative ways.\n  Our community also is extremely privileged to have an organization \nwith the capacity and outreach of American Indian Opportunities \nIndustrialization Center. This organization provides necessary \neducation and job training skills, serving as a bridge between public \nschool and employment or college for its students.\n  I am also proud to commend the organizations that comprise the \nMetropolitan Urban Indian Directors for their unwavering efforts to \nexamine and address many critical issues and challenges facing urban \nAmerican Indians.\n  Native Americans in my State, and indeed in all fifty States, are \njustly proud of their heritage and culture. They can be just as proud \nof their efforts today to preserve that heritage, to protect that \nculture and to make it relevant for today's Native American children, \nand it is those efforts that I honor today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5687-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5687-S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONFIRMATION OF RESERVE SERVICE CHIEFS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to mark an historic day for our \nNation's military, and specifically the reserves. Yesterday, the U.S. \nSenate honorably carried out its constitutional duty by approving the \nPresidential nominations of Reserve Service Chiefs to the rank of \nthree-star. Last year's National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \nYear 2001, H.R. 4205, required the service secretaries to increase the \nrank of the Chief of the Navy Reserve, Commander of the Marine Forces \nReserve, Chief of the Army Reserve, Chief of the Air Force Reserve, \nDirector of the Army National Guard, and the Director of the Air \nNational Guard to Vice Admiral or Lieutenant General. This mandate was \nvery significant to me and many of my colleagues, as well as those who \nserve in our reserve forces.\n  Earlier this year, I was greatly honored to be recognized by the \nReserve Officers Association in receiving their highest honor--the \nMinute Man of the Year Award. The Reserve Officers Association, \nparticularly Rear Admiral Stephen G. Yusem USNR (Retired), deserves \ngreat credit for its efforts in working with Congress to ensure that \nthis well-deserved change in promotion authority for the Reserve Chiefs \nbecame a reality.\n  It is especially important to me because of the significant changes I \nhave observed in our Total Force, active duty and Reserve Components \nsince the late-1980s to early-1990s when Senator Glenn chaired the \nPersonnel Subcommittee on the Committee on Armed Services and I was the \nranking member on the subcommittee. Back then, reservists were truly \nweekend warriors. That, however, is not the case now--they are much \nmore than that. Today, reservists work considerably more than weekends, \nand are as critical a part of the fabric of our National Military \nStrategy as active duty servicemembers.\n  The all-volunteer military has largely been a success in our country. \nHowever, an unfortunate bi-product has been the increasing chasm \nbetween those Americans who have served in the armed services and those \nwho have not. Twenty years ago, scores of elected officials in \nWashington were veterans. Today, the number of Senators and Congressmen \nwho have worn the uniform of the armed services has rapidly declined.\n  This military-civilian gap, as some have characterized it, is a \ntroubling reality that we must seek to bridge. It is increasingly \ndifficult for many of our fellow citizens to truly appreciate the \nsacrifices of those who serve in any capacity. That is another reason \nthat the reserves are so important for our national life. Our reserve \nservicemembers not only protect our liberty, but also serve as the \nindispensable link to those Americans in civilian life not ordinarily \ntouched in their daily lives by the sacrifice, honor and privilege of \nmilitary service.\n  The roles and missions of the Reserve Components have changed over \nthe past several years, as the active duty force has evolved from the \ndownsizing of our military forces during the last decade. For example, \nin March 2001, the Army National Guard 29th Infantry Division took \ncommand of the American peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. The \nsignificance of this deployment is that\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\n75 percent of the 4,000 U.S. Army soldiers on the ground will be Army \nReserve and Guard soldiers from 17 states--not just headquarters' \nstaff, but operational units as well.\n  This is just one of many such deployments that have taken place in \nrecent years, but it highlights the ever-increasing role of reservists \nin defending America's security interests around the world, and marks a \nradical departure from the past.\n  The figures are quite staggering when considered in total. Today, \nreservists and National Guardsmen are deployed under three presidential \ncall-up orders for Bosnia, Kosovo and Southwest Asia. For Bosnia, more \nthan 21,000 U.S. reservists have been called involuntarily since 1995, \nwith another 14,000 having served in a voluntary capacity. For Kosovo, \nmore than 7,100 have been called involuntarily, and these have been \njoined by more than 4,000 volunteers. For Southwest Asia, 2,800 have \nbeen called and some 11,000 have volunteered.\n  During each of the past five years, Reserve and National Guard \nservicemembers have performed between 12 and 13.5 million duty days in \nsupport of the active force. These numbers are a direct contrast to \n1990, when just one million duty days were performed, yet there were 25 \npercent more reservists.\n  Reservists also currently make up more than half of the airlift crews \nand 85 percent of the sealift personnel needed to move troops and \nequipment in either wartime or peacetime operations. In addition, \nreserve medical and construction battalions, as well as other \nspecialists, are critical to a wide range of operations. Consequently, \nefforts by the reserve components to move beyond a traditional wartime \nbackup role and to provide peacetime support to active units are \ndesirable. The Naval Reserve and Air Force Reserve components have made \nparticularly impressive progress in this direction.\n  Reservists are performing many vital tasks, from patrolling the no-\nfly zones in skies above Iraq to rebuilding schools in hurricane-\nstricken Honduras and fighting fires in our western states, from \noverseeing civil affairs in Bosnia, to augmenting aircraft carriers \nshort on active duty sailors with critical skilled enlisted ratings \nduring at-sea exercises as well as periods of deployment.\n  I believe that the civilian and uniformed leadership of our Armed \nForces and the Congress must recognize this involvement, and, at a \nminimum, provide equality in benefits for reserve component \nservicemembers when they put on the uniform and perform their weekend \ndrills as well as all other critical training evolutions. Quality of \nlife is not just an active duty obligation that Congress must provide. \nReservists, on duty, who resemble their active duty counterparts during \ntraining evolutions and are deployed at times around the world, should \nbe treated equally when the administration and Congress provide for \nquality of life benefits.\n  I am pleased to pay homage to the many wonderful reserve servicemen \nand women who serve in our armed forces, and in some small measure \nthank them for their dedicated service to our country by recognizing \nthe confirmation by the U.S. Senate of the Reserve Service Chiefs to \nthree-star rank. Congratulations to Vice Admiral John B. Totushek, \nChief of the Naval Reserve; Lieutenant General Dennis M. McCarthy, \nCommander of the Marine Forces Reserve; Lieutenant General Thomas J. \nPlewes, Chief of the Army Reserve; Lieutenant General James E. \nSherrard, III, Chief of the Air Force Reserve; and, Lieutenant General \nRoger C. Schultz, Director of the Army National Guard. I am confident \nthat our Reserve Component forces will continue to flourish under your \nleadership. All of you have already demonstrated that the key to your \nstrength as leaders is in supporting the servicemen and women who work \nvery hard in our military. I trust in your willingness and ability to \nuphold the honor of our country. Congratulations on your continued \nsacrifice and service to our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5688-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

BENNETT\n\n Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, today I take the opportunity to pay \nspecial tribute to a remarkable person, Elizabeth M. Bennett, of \nWayzata, MN. Beth has led a life of extraordinary service to the \ncommunities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Most particularly, she has \ninvested her energies with the goal of improving the quality of health \ncare in the Twin Cities. Her activism was not limited to Minnesota, \nhowever; early on, she also made her presence felt in Northern \nCalifornia, where she lived for a time, and eventually on the national \nstage, as well.\n  The extensive list of her volunteer commitments spans six decades, \nbeginning with her activism in high school, where she applied her \nspecial gifts for analysis and problem solving. Happily, these talents \nwere also crowned by the ability to lead and inspire, for, in a \ndemonstration of her early promise, she started a YWCA leadership group \nat West High School in Minneapolis. For this effort, she was awarded \nthe Harry S Truman National Leadership Award in 1947. From there, Beth \nwas well on her way.\n  As a young person, Beth dreamt of entering the medical profession, an \nambition which was never realized. Instead, she directed her passion \nfor better health care into her volunteer work, serving as a board \nmember for a variety of institutions. She volunteered to participate--\nearly, effectively, and equipped always by mastery of the subject at \nhand--in the public discussion encompassing the community's broad \nhealth care agendas. Her interests have included the uninsured, and \nhealth care research for children and seniors, always staying current \nwith the rapidly changing profile of health care needs and delivery \nsystems in our society.\n  In addition to investing her time, heart, and mind, she raised many \nmillions of dollars. For her extraordinary fund raising, she has not \nalways received sufficient recognition. But I am pleased to say that in \n1988, she was awarded the well-deserved National Association of \nFundraisers Award. Beyond the tangible, however, Beth touches others \nwith that indispensable, inimitable spirit of enthusiasm, encouraging \nthem to become involved, too. Many have found exposure to Beth's zeal \nand breadth of knowledge about a cause to be irresistible and have been \nmoved to strong support, sometimes for the first time.\n  Beth was instrumental in the creation of the new Children's Hospital \nin 1958, planning for community health care facilities and programs, \nconsideration of issues in medical education, and the relationship \nbetween the University and private community entities and served on its \nBoard for 35 years.\n  She served on the boards of Northwestern Hospital and Abbott Hospital \nin various capacities and was a major force in their merger in 1994, \nserving for over 40 years. She acted as a liaison between Abbott-\nNorthwestern and Children's (now Allina Health System) during a crucial \nearly period, planning for community health care facilities for adults \nas well as children.\n  Continuing her lifelong advocacy of quality health care for the \ncitizens of the State of Minnesota, Beth has been a member since 1990 \nof the board of directors of the University of Minnesota's Children's \nFoundation (which supports pediatric research), recently as its Chair, \nand concurrently chairs the pediatric portion of Campaign Minnesota at \nthe University of Minnesota.\n  In recognition of these numerous contributions she has made to health \ncare, Beth was recently recognized with the University of Minnesota \nDean of the Medical School Community Service Award.\n  While health care is closest to Beth's heart, she is also dedicated \nto higher education, having served on the boards of the University of \nSaint Thomas for the lasts 7 years and the Minneapolis College of Art \nand Design. In addition, she has served as a board member of WAMSO \n(Women's Association of Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra), the United \nWay, and The Bakken Library. Her love of the arts also inspired her to \nserve as a docent of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Long a member \nof the Junior League of Minneapolis, she spent 15 years on its board of \ndirectors and also chaired its Prevention of Accidental Poisoning in \nChildren Project. While residing in California in the 1950's, she \nbelonged to the board of directors of the Children's Hospital of the \nEast Bay in Oakland and volunteered at the Oakland Well Baby Clinic.\n  Those who are fortunate enough to know Beth called her a jewel. To \nlegions, she has been a champion, having created a solid legacy of \nsupport for many institutions and their constituents. While I trust \nthat Beth's vocation of service has truly been its own reward, I hope \nthat my remarks today might reflect a small measure of the goodness, \nself-giving, and strength she has long brought to us \nMinnesotans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5689-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5689-S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FLORIDA BOARD OF REGENTS\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to commend \nthe Florida Voters League for its efforts to save Florida's Board of \nRegents. Today, the Board of Regents meet for the last time as the \nchief governing body of our State university system. The individuals \nwho have served our system through the years have been distinguished \npublic servants. I want to recognize them and thank them for their \ntireless effort throughout the years to ensure our students receive a \nquality education.\n  Florida's system has faced many challenges over the years, but none \nhave been as potentially destructive as abolishing the board. At a time \nwhen Florida faces increasing strains on colleges and universities, it \nis imperative that we maintain a system that ensures our higher \neducational institutions receive adequate resources and funding beyond \npolitics. The Board of Regents was created for that very purpose. It \nhas served our State well by ensuring no State university becomes too \npowerful at the expense of the others.\n  This new system ensures that politicians will govern education, \ninstead of experts and independent voices. In the past, the word of the \nBoard of Regents was respected by legislators and was further supported \nby the Governor. It was meant to be a nonpartisan governing board. The \nwill of the Universities now, however, will be determined by local \npolitical boards and the will of the Legislature. We recently have seen \nprograms granted to universities by legislators, despite the strong \nopposition of the Board of Regents largely because legislators wanted \nto bring home ``the bacon'' to their alma mater. It was best described \nby Dean Weisenfeld of Florida Atlantic University's College of Science \nwhen he stated, we need to let ``universities be universities.'' \nInstead, the fate of our universities might now depend on the strength \nof their legislative delegations.\n  As my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Graham, has argued, \nelimination of the Board returns our State\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\nto an antiquated system under which our institutions are pitted against \neach other for State and Federal dollars. The Board of Regents, on the \nother hand, has fostered a system of cooperation between our colleges \nand universities, reduced duplication of programs, and ensured fairness \nin funding. We must continue that sprit of cooperation if we are to \nmeet the needs of our institutions and achieve our ultimate goals: \ncreating world-class programs, attracting quality faculty and students \nand ensuring our schools can compete with the nation's best for \nresearch dollars. In that spirit, I support Senator Graham's efforts to \npreserve the Board via constitutional referendum.\n  I applaud the Florida Voter League and other organizations that have \nchosen to speak out on this important issue. Insuring our State's next \ngeneration of leaders receive a quality college education is an issue \nwe can't afford to ignore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIN RECOGNITION OF SUGARBUSH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, 1ST PLACE WINNER IN THE \n           NATIONAL CHILDREN'S SET A GOOD EXAMPLE COMPETITION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to honor the students \nat Sugarbush Elementary School, in my home state of Michigan. These \nmotivated students will be honored on June 6th of this year for winning \nfirst place in the 18th Annual American Set A Good Example Competition.\n  Too often we hear about all the negative influences facing our youth. \nMuch has been made of the many problems facing our children. While we \nhear about the threats posed by drugs, violence and illiteracy, too \nlittle is made of the positive steps that our youth are making to fight \nthese terrible problems. This year, students from thousands of schools \nparticipated in the National Children's Set A Good Example Competition \nin an effort to address these problems. This competition is an \ninnovative program that takes students' ideas seriously, and encourages \nthem to develop and design projects that combat problems facing them \nevery day.\n  Everybody truly wins when children are given the chance to express \nthemselves and improve their communities, but the students at Sugarbush \nElementary School received special notice when they were awarded 1st \nplace in the National Children's Set a Good Example Competition. Their \nproject encourages children to avoid drugs, respect people and protect \nthe environment--values that people of all ages should live by.\n  Winning first place in a contest that includes over 10,000 schools is \na significant accomplishment, and the students, faculty and parents at \nSugarbush Elementary School have every reason to be proud of this \naccomplishment. I am sure that my Senate colleagues will join me in \nhonoring the students at Sugarbush Elementary School for Winning 1st \nplace in the National Children's Set a Good Example Competition, and \nmore importantly for their hard work, idealism and commitment to strong \nvalues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5690-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE LIFE OF JULIAN JAY HENDRICKS\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator \nEnsign, I rise today to pay tribute to a young Nevadan who touched the \nlives of those around him and created a sense of family in the small \none-room schoolhouse where he was a student.\n  Julian Jay Hendricks, who celebrated his 7th birthday on February 25, \n2001, became a student in the Duckwater Elementary School one-room \nschoolhouse last fall, and quickly adapted to life in the 9 student \ncommunity. Julian's contagious smile and joyful disposition became a \nwelcome presence to his Duckwater classmates and teacher.\n  Inside the classroom, Julian was an excellent math student, and \nenjoyed the task of learning how to read. On the playground, the young \nboy enthusiastically played basketball and volleyball with his friends \nand classmates. Like many adventurous boys, he loved skateboarding and \nrollerblading with his friends. Another favorite pastime of his was \nchallenging his friends to a game of checkers; a game he was almost \nalways the victor!\n  Tragically, Julian's life and the life of his grandmother, Jeanette \nLankford, were cut short in an automobile accident on March 4, 2001.\n  For too short a time, this young Nevadan brought great happiness and \nfriendship into a tiny schoolhouse in rural Duckwater, Nevada. We rise \ntoday to offer this tribute to Julian's life not only on our behalf, \nbut on behalf of his teacher, Lynn Anderson, and all his friends and \nclassmates at Duckwater Elementary School.\n  In conclusion, I submit to the Record a poem written in memory of \nJulian by his friend Amber Hoy.\n\n     I really didn't know Julian too well, but his beautiful smile \n           that stretched across his rosy chubby cheeks was quite \n           contagious to all of us.\n     I knew him just well enough to know he enjoyed his life and \n           all of the wonders in it.\n     I am just deeply disappointed that I didn't get to know him \n           as well as I would like to.\n     I find myself selfishly wishing Julian was back here with us \n           now,\n     Although we think of his death as a tragedy,\n     Julian's future is much brighter in heaven with Jesus than it \n           ever would have been here on Earth.\n     It was God's will to take Julian to a wonderful place where \n           he can live the rest of his life safe in peace.\n     Secretly I ask myself what would Julian have been like in ten \n           or maybe twenty years from now?\n     But I believe he will always be the small friendly boy, who \n           attended the small friendly Duckwater School.\n     Even though Julian's body is gone, his spirit lives on in our \n           hearts and the joyful sound of his happy laugh will \n           forever ring in our ears.\n     At first I wished that I would have gotten to say good-bye to \n           Julian, but maybe that last unforgettable smile and the \n           last slight wave of his little hand as he stepped off \n           the bus; was good-bye.\n     Good-bye, Julian. . .\n     Julian will always be in our thoughts and prayers.\n     Love always, Amber Hoy.\n\n  I add the thoughts and prayers of myself and Senator Ensign to those \nof Amber Hoy. Julian and his grandmother will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5690-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5690-S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WESTPORT VOLUNTEER EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Westport \nVolunteer Emergency Medical Service. Next week, the Westport Volunteer \nEMS will receive the EMS Magazine ``Gold Award'' in recognition of the \nextraordinary vision, professionalism, and dedication of Westport's \nvolunteer emergency medical service providers.\n  By awarding WVEMS the ``Gold Award,'' EMS Magazine is confirming what \nmany of us have long known: community spirit is alive and well in \nConnecticut and it still changes lives for the better. The men and \nwomen of the Westport Volunteer EMS are true heros--not only because \nthey save lives--but because they are willing to do the yeomen's work \nthat must be done to ensure that our communities are prepared to \nrespond when the unthinkable happens.\n  More than 120 Westport volunteers respond to more than 2,000 9-1-1 \ncalls each year. These volunteers make a huge difference in the lives \nof their fellow citizens. They respond to emergencies night and day. \nThey provide comfort and assistance to people in distress and they save \nlives. But they also make an enormous difference in less dramatic ways. \nThey teach safety and emergency preparedness classes to hundreds of \nschool-aged children and adults. They host conferences. And nearly \nevery weekend, somewhere in the community a volunteer EMS team provides \ncoverage at a local school athletic event or community gathering. This \nis the true essence of community spirit--the willingness to spend time \nworking with your neighbors to protect and service the greater good.\n  The Westport EMS was formally incorporated in 1979 and continues to \nserve the community as a division within the Westport Police \nDepartment, with on-site, standby crews 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, \n52 weeks a year. Last year, Westport's volunteers logged 26,000 hours \nof community service.\n  The entire Northeast region recently had a chance to see the Westport \nEMS at work when Westport hosted a regional disaster drill in the form \nof a simulated Amtrak train wreck at the Westport train station. More \nthan 400\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\nEMS, fire, police, railroad, and National Guard personnel were joined \nby State officials in a realistic and successful event.\n  Recently, the Westport Volunteer Emergency Medical Service program \nwas presented the ``Connecticut Treasures'' award in recognition of the \nagency's 20 years of service to the community. This same service and \ndedication are examples of one of America's greatest treasures--the \ngoodness and charity of the American people. I commend the Westport EMS \nvolunteers for their extraordinary service to their fellow citizens, \nand I congratulate them on receiving this much-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5691-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO FRED HOLT\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, a great educator and a dear \nfriend of my family died earlier this month. Fred R. Holt was a school \nsuperintendent in my hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin from 1959 to \n1978, and as the Janesville Gazette noted, his influence will echo in \nJanesville classrooms for years.\n  He oversaw the Janesville school system during one of its most \nchallenging times, when the baby boom generation was rapidly increasing \nthe school population. His gifted leadership helped to foster a climate \nthat was supportive of students and teachers alike. As Fred's secretary \nfor many years, Carol Smith, said, he cared for everyone on his staff \nas well as the students, and always did his best for them.\n  Fred was deeply committed to our schools. He attended school in \nJanesville, and was a teacher himself, in Edgerton, Wisconsin and in \nother districts before becoming Janesville's superintendent, and he \nknew how valuable a good teacher is. As a Janesville Gazette article \nrecalled, Fred would send his administrators to teacher-training \ninstitutions across the Midwest to recruit top teaching prospects. As \nproducts of Fred Holt's Janesville schools, my brother, sisters, and I \ncan attest to the success of his efforts. Thousands of Janesville \nfamilies were the beneficiaries of Fred Holt's foresight and \ninitiative.\n  I had the privilege of working with Fred after he retired when I \nserved in the Wisconsin State Senate. He was an enormously effective \nadvocate, and generously shared his time counseling troubled youth, \nheading a volunteer service bureau, and helping to renovate the \nJanesville Senior Center. In 1987, his work was recognized when he was \nnamed one of Wisconsin's 10 admired seniors.\n  Fred Holt's legacy is evident in Janesville and across the country. I \nam a part of that legacy. And so are tens of thousands of business \npeople and auto workers, physicians and police officers, artists and \nplumbers, educators, machinists, farmers, and others who have become \nwho they are in large part because of the education they received \ngrowing up in Janesville. We owe him an enormous debt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5691-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN MEMORY OF RABBI YITSCHAK MEIR KAGAN\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Today I would like to commemorate \nthe achievements of a beloved religious leader, dedicated father and \nhusband and friend from my home state of Michigan, Rabbi Yitschak Meir \nKagan. On June 3 of this year, people from around the world will be \ngathering in Southfield, MI, to honor the life and memory of Rabbi \nKagan.\n  Through hard work and an unwavering commitment to the ideals of \nChabad-Lubavitch, Rabbi Kagan's work has made an indelible mark upon \ncountless individuals. His deep faith, keen intellect, and concern for \nothers has led him to give generously of himself.\n  Born in England, Rabbi Kagan's extensive education assumed an \ninternational flavor. After early instruction in Great Britain, he \nstudied at the Lubavitch Yeshiva in Israel, the Central Lubavitch \nAcademy in New York and the Rabbinical College in Montreal where he \nreceived his ordination.\n  Central to Rabbi Kagan's life was the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. In \n1966, Rabbi Kagan joined the Michigan Chabad-Lubavitch. For thirty-five \nyears he worked tirelessly to expand the Lubavitch Foundation's \npresence in Michigan. Chabad-Lubavitch is a Hasidic sect that \noriginated in Lubavitch, Russia. Lubavitch means ``brotherly love,'' \nand Chabad is an acronym for a philosophy that pursues wisdom, \nunderstanding and knowledge of God. Rabbi Kagan's life embodied the \nideal of brotherly love as he sought ``to increase the knowledge of \nJudaism within every Jew'' by educating people about the Torah, \nproviding worship services and performing charitable acts.\n  As Associate Director of the Lubavitch Foundation, Rabbi Kagan \nexpanded the Foundation by establishing Chabad houses in Ann Arbor, \nFlint and Grand Rapids, developing ``the Campus of Living Judaism;'' \ncounseling students and tending to the spiritual development of \ncountless individuals.\n  Rabbi Kagan's work reached far beyond Michigan. The printed word \nenabled his thoughts and insights to span the globe. He published \nessays adapted from the works of Lubavitcher Rebbe that were read by a \nmultitude each month. In addition, he edited and translated the Rebbe's \nclassic text, Hayom Yom, edited philosophical texts and translated \ncommentaries on the Torah.\n  Rabbi Kagan has been a community and spiritual leader for over three \ndecades. I have been able to witness, firsthand, his enthusiastic \ncommitment to helping others in need. Rabbi Kagan touched the lives of \nall who met him. He worked with and helped immigrants, prisoners, drug \nusers, families in need and others with characteristic zeal, kindness \nand love. I know my Senate colleagues join me in commemorating the life \nof Rabbi Yitschak Meir Kagan, and in offering their condolences to \nRochel Kagan, his wife, and his extended family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5691-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5691-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5691-5", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON THE PROGRESS TOWARD ACHIEVING BENCHMARKS IN BOSNIA--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 25\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by the Levin Amendment to the 1998 Supplemental \nAppropriations and Rescissions Act (section 7(b) of Public Law 105-174) \nand section 1203(a) of the Strom Thurmond National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (Public Law 105-261), I transmit \nherewith a report on progress made toward achieving benchmarks for a \nsustainable peace process in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n  In July 2000, the fourth semiannual report was sent to the Congress \ndetailing progress towards achieving the ten benchmarks that were \nadopted by the Peace Implementation Council and the North Atlantic \nCouncil in order to evaluate implementation of the Dayton Accords.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to the approval of national \n     monuments; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, The provisions of 16 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 431, 432, \n     and 433, commonly referred to as the Antiquities Act of 1906, \n     authorize the President of the United States to designate \n     national monuments without the approval of Congress or any \n     state or local government in which the national monument is \n     located; and\n       Whereas, As part of designating a national monument \n     pursuant to those provisions, the President of the United \n     States may reserve parcels of public land to ensure the \n     appropriate care and management of the national monument, and \n     the reservation of that public land must be confined to the \n     smallest area compatible with that care and management; and\n       Whereas, The designation of a national monument is often a \n     subject of controversy because the public lands that are \n     included within the designation are withdrawn from the public \n     domain, thereby restricting activities such as mining, \n     ranching and recreation which provide an economic benefit to \n     state and local governments in which the national monument is \n     located; and\n       Whereas, Decisions concerning the use and management of \n     public lands within a state should be decided by the \n     residents of that state acting through their state and local \n     representatives; and\n       Whereas, The unilateral designation of a national monument \n     by the President of the United States does not create \n     beneficial partnerships between states and the Federal \n     Government concerning the management of public lands within \n     those states, instead, such a designation serves to create \n     enmity and to limit the ability of a state to manage its \n     water resources and the ability of state and local \n     governments to develop plans for conservation or otherwise \n     participate in managing those public lands; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Legislature of the State of Nevada hereby \n     opposes the designation of a national monument by the \n     President of the United States without obtaining the approval \n     of each state and local government in which the national \n     monument is located; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States is hereby \n     urged to refrain from designating a national monument or from \n     withdrawing public lands from the public domain to create a \n     national monument without obtaining such approval; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and each member of the Nevada Congressional \n     Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-74. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to the delegation of a National \n     Historic Trail; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 14\n\n       Whereas, The Old Spanish Trail, which ran between Santa Fe, \n     New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California, was the first non-\n     Native American trail to cross Nevada and remains the least \n     known trail; and\n       Whereas, Traders, couriers and emigrants en route between \n     Santa Fe and Los Angeles followed Indian trails in blazing \n     the Spanish Trail through Clark County; and\n       Whereas, The journey of Antonio Armijo, a trader from New \n     Mexico, through Nevada in 1829 and 1830 linked the historic \n     1776 routes of the Dominguez-Escalante expedition through \n     Utah and the Garces' exploration into Southern California and \n     used a portion of the 1826 and 1827 routes of Jedediah Smith \n     to California; and\n       Whereas, Antonio Armijo was the first to link the interior \n     of the southwest with the California coast successfully, thus \n     opening a commercial trade route, approximately 1,121 miles \n     long, that functioned between 1829 and 1848 as the main \n     artery connecting the interior to the coast which later \n     became known as the Old Spanish Trail and is so named in \n     modern literature; and\n       Whereas, Captain John C. Fremont of the United States Corps \n     of Topographic Engineers was commissioned in 1843 by the War \n     Department to find and map the Oregon Trail, an assignment \n     which he completed successfully; and\n       Whereas, After documenting the Oregon Trail, Captain \n     Fremont, in an effort to expand his government's knowledge \n     about California, pushed south through Northern Nevada into \n     California; and\n       Whereas, In 1844, Fremont sought the Spanish Trail to guide \n     his party eastward from California and followed the trail \n     through California and Nevada to his point of departure from \n     Utah Lake the previous year; and\n       Whereas, The route of the trail Fremont followed from \n     California, which he named the Spanish Trail in the report of \n     his expedition that he filed with the War Department, led him \n     across Southern Nevada from Stump Spring to the Virgin River \n     via Mountain Springs Pass, Blue Diamond, Las Vegas Springs \n     and the Muddy River; and\n       Whereas, This route was previously pioneered by traders \n     from New Mexico who spoke Spanish, a fact used by Captain \n     Fremont in designating the ``Camino de California'' or \n     ``Camino de Nuevo Mexico'' as the Spanish Trail; and\n       Whereas, Fremont's report and map were so important to the \n     plans of the United States for Western expansion that the \n     United States Senate and House of Representatives each \n     printed 10,000 copies of the report and map; and\n       Whereas, Copies of the report and map were available to \n     thousands of emigrants heading westward to California who \n     came to know the route they followed as Fremont's Spanish \n     Trail; and\n       Whereas, The pioneers who used Fremont's route became \n     familiar with the promising potential of Southern Nevada for \n     settlement which led specifically to the founding of Las \n     Vegas or ``The Meadows,'' whose name reflects its importance \n     as a major camp site along the Spanish Trail; and\n       Whereas, The Old Spanish Trail is the foundation of \n     succeeding routes of transport and travel through Southern \n     Nevada including the Mormon Road, portions of the routes of \n     the San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad and the \n     Union Pacific Railroad which succeeded it, and the Arrowhead \n     Trail Highway and its successors U.S. Highway No. 91 and \n     Interstate Highway No. 15; and\n       Whereas, This historic route for travelers facilitated \n     expansion of the boundaries of the United States to include \n     New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California; \n     and\n       Whereas, The Spanish Trail was preferred by Kit Carson when \n     carrying military dispatches in 1848 to Washington, D.C., \n     which first brought news of gold at Sutter's Fort and \n     resulted in the Gold Rush of 1849; and\n       Whereas, Information about this ancient route of trade and \n     commerce is still limited, and much more can be learned about \n     the Old Spanish Trail; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the members of\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\n     the Nevada Legislature do hereby urge the Congress of the \n     United States to adopt legislation that dedicates the Old \n     Spanish Trail and the Antonio Armijo Route of the Old Spanish \n     Trail as a National Historic Trail; and be it further\n       Resolved, That such a designation would help ensure the \n     protection and interpretation of the Old Spanish Trail in a \n     more consistent and coordinated manner, would encourage \n     tourists to visit the communities, landscape features and \n     other resources along the trail, would help visitors gain a \n     better understanding of how a journey along the trail might \n     have been more than 100 years ago, and would enhance and \n     promote knowledge concerning the early settlers and explorers \n     who emigrated and led expeditions to the Western United \n     States; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as the presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives and each member of \n     the Nevada Congressional Delegation; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-75. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to increasing federal funding \n     for special education; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975, now known as the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA), was enacted by the Congress of the \n     United States to ensure that all children with disabilities \n     have available to them a free and appropriate public \n     education; and\n       Whereas, In 1975, Congress promised state and local \n     governments that it would fund 40 percent of the costs of \n     providing special education and related services to children \n     with disabilities; and\n       Whereas, Congress has never appropriated funds equivalent \n     to the authorized level, has never exceeded the 15 percent \n     level and has usually appropriated funding at only about the \n     8 percent level; and\n       Whereas, The State of Nevada is committed to providing a \n     free and appropriate public education to children with \n     disabilities to meet their unique needs; and\n       Whereas, The costs associated with serving children with \n     disabilities continue to rise, and meeting those substantial \n     costs requires a strong partnership between local, state and \n     federal governmental agencies; and\n       Whereas, The failure of Congress to fund special education \n     programs as it promised has forced the states to utilize \n     funding from other necessary local and state programs to \n     attempt to provide these special educational services; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of Nevada, \n     Jointly, That the Nevada Legislature hereby urges the \n     President and Congress of the United States to increase \n     federal funding for special education to the 40 percent level \n     authorized by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     so that the State of Nevada and other states can fully meet \n     the needs of children with disabilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Vice President of the United States as the \n     presiding officer of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, each member of the Nevada Congressional \n     Delegation and the Superintendent of Public Instruction for \n     the State of Nevada; and be it further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-76.

A bill to amend the National Telecommunications and \nInformation Administration Organization Act to encourage deployment of \nbroadband service to rural America; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senator Daschle, \nSenator Johnson, Senator Murray, and Senator Wellstone to introduce the \nRural Broadband Enhancement Act to deploy broadband technology to rural \nAmerica. As the demand for high speed Internet access grows, numerous \ncompanies are responding in areas of dense population. While urban \nAmerica is quickly gaining high speed access, rural America is, once \nagain, being left behind. Ensuring that all Americans have the \ntechnological capability is essential in this digital age. It is not\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nonly an issue of fairness, but it is also an issue of economic \nsurvival.\n  To remedy the gap between urban and rural America, this legislation \ngives new authority to the Rural Utilities Service in consultation with \nNTIA to make low interest loans to companies that are deploying \nbroadband technology to rural America. Loans are made on a company \nneutral and a technology neutral basis so that companies that want to \nserve these areas can do so by employing technology that is best suited \nto a particular area. Without this program, market forces will pass by \nmuch of America, and that is unacceptable.\n  This issue is not a new one. When we were faced with electrifying all \nof the country, we enacted the Rural Electrification Act. When \ntelephone service was only being provided to well-populated \ncommunities, we expanded the Rural Electrification Act and created the \nRural Utilities Service to oversee rural telephone deployment. The \nequitable deployment of broadband services is only the next step in \nkeeping America connected, and our legislation would ensure that.\n  If we fail to act, rural America will be left behind once again. As \nthe economy moves further and further towards online transactions and \ncommunications, rural America must be able to participate. \nHistorically, our economy has been defined by geography, and we in \nCongress were powerless to do anything about it. Where there were \nports, towns and businesses got their start. Where there were railroad \ntracks, towns and businesses grew up around them. The highway system \nbrought the same evolution.\n  But the Internet is changing all of that. No longer must economic \ngrowth be defined by geographic fiat. Telecommunications industries and \npolicy-makers are proclaiming, ``Distance is dead!'' But, that's not \nquite right: Distance will be dead, only as long as Congress ensures \nthat broadband services are available to all parts of America, urban \nand rural.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues colleagues to pass this \nlegislation and give rural America a fair chance to survive.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND.\n  S. 967. A bill to establish the Military Readiness Investigation \nBoard, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a very important \nmatter of national security.\n  Today many thousands of Americans are spread across the globe \ndefending our national interest and those of our close friends and \nallies.\n  While risking their lives to keep America safe, American soldiers \nsailors, airmen and marines are not as ready for combat as they should \nbe.\n  History has taught us that the more prepared we are for war, the less \nlikely potential enemies will be to risk war in pursuit of their own \nnational objectives.\n  Our ability to prevail in war is, therefore, one of the most critical \nelements of our deterrence strategy.\n  That is why I rise today to introduce legislation that I believe will \nhelp us improve the combat readiness of our armed forces. Doing so will \nstrengthen America's standing and security in the world and contribute \nto global stability.\n  In recent years the topic of military readiness has received far more \nwords than deeds. In all candor, we have talked this issue to death \nwithout being able to deliver for the troops who need our help.\n  I think I know why. Words are far cheaper than the actions needed to \nrestore a sharp edge to our combat forces.\n  We know that we have problem with military readiness. It seems that \nevery time we peel back the cheery assessments and closely examine the \nissue, we find that our military readiness is worse than advertised.\n  Let me offer just a few examples.\n  Today, the readiness level of too many of our aviation combat units \nis being maintained through cannibalization. One plane is striped of \nparts to keep others flying. The only problem with that is the practice \nactually accelerates the destruction of our combat readiness. A recent \nNavy investigation stated ``current readiness levels are being achieved \nthrough extensive cannibalization and the rates are increasing in every \ncommunity we visited.''\n  In other words, we have a bunch of hangar queens that have been \nrobbed of parts and are not able to fly to provide the practice or to \ncarry out the missions for which they were intended. Because of a \nshortage in money, our fliers are going into harm's way with outdated \nelectronic intelligence files. The Navy E-2C Hawkeyes carry \nintelligence files that, in some case, are between 5 and 9 years old. \nThe electronic intelligence files aboard the EA-6B Prowler planes, our \njammers, are updated only on a 2-to-6-year cycle. The missiles we use \nto kill enemy radars are not being updated with new electronic \nintelligence parametric files.\n  The Army's Third Infantry Division based at Fort Stewart Georgia was \nrecently dropped to the second lowest readiness rating. Just over a \nyear ago, two other Army divisions, the 10th Mountain and First \nMechanized Division were briefly dropped to the lowest readiness \nrating--meaning they were unready for war. These are three of the \nArmy's ten active duty divisions.\n  The Marine Corps cannot replace its antiquated equipment because it \nhas to steal money from its modernization account to keep its combat \nedge sharp.\n  Sadly, there is an endless parade of anecdotal evidence. And too \noften, the anecdotal reports that leak to the press are far more \naccurate indictors of the true state of military readiness than the \nPentagon's own internal reporting system.\n  The evidence strongly suggests we have not kept faith with our troops \nwho risk their lives for us. And that is our top obligation--to keep up \nour part of the social compact with our servicemen and women, in \nexchange for their willingness to risk their lives we promise to equip \nand train our troops so they may quickly prevail in combat with as few \ncasualties as possible.\n  While we know all to well the problem we face, we have yet to build a \nnational consensus of the solution. And make no mistake, that is what a \nproblem of this scale requires--a national consensus.\n  To do that, we need an objective assessment of military readiness \nconducted by non-partisan, military experts. It would measure the \ncurrent state of our U.S. military readiness and also examine the \neffectiveness of the Pentagon's current readiness reporting system.\n  Much like the CIA required an outside panel of ``Team B'' experts \nduring the 1970s, I believe the Pentagon desperately needs an outside \ngroup of experts to look at the readiness books.\n  I believe that this review will help senior Pentagon officials obtain \nthe most accurate picture possible of the true state of military \nreadiness today.\n  Such a measurement will also help Congress build a baseline \nunderstanding of military readiness that we must have if we are to \nbegin funding the military's operations and maintenance accounts at a \nsufficient level.\n  Let me just say this: Secretary Rumsfeld's decision to reexamine our \nnational military strategy, force structure and procurement strategy is \nthe right thing to do. Indeed, it is long overdue and I commend the \nadministration for its commitment to this effort.\n  This is very important, but we cannot overlook combat readiness as \nthe most critical index of our Nation's ability to defend itself, our \ninterests and our allies' interests. Strategic competitors pay close \nattention to reports of deteriorating U.S. military readiness and we \nmust not embolden them by ignoring these reports ourselves.\n  Many military experts have also contended that many of the military's \nreadiness problems would disappear if the Pentagon dropped its plans to \nfight and win two major regional wars at one time. However, some say \nthat the Nation's ability to wage major wars on two fronts acts as an \nimportant deterrent to potentially hostile states like North Korea. \nSecretary Rumsfelds' review coupled with a military readiness review \npanel should enable us for once to answer effectively and address these \nissues--to come up with the right balance and solutions for our troops \nand for our Nation.\n  The readiness system is intended to pinpoint war-fighting \ndeficiencies in every unit's equipment, transportation system, \npersonnel and training. By many accounts this system is arcane\n\n[[Page S5697]]\n\nand inflexible and does not accurately depict the true state of \nreadiness. It is time we reviewed this system and developed means to \nkeep it the predictive and useful tool it was designed and intended to \nbe.\n  While we await the results of Secretary Rumsfeld's reviews, we \nalready know that we have a persistent readiness problem that \nexacerbates other problems within the U.S. military, like manpower \nlevels and morale.\n  In a monthly readiness report the defense department sent to Congress \nin March, there was a list of ``strategic concerns'' about military \nreadiness. This report indicated that despite some leveling off of \ndeclines in wartime preparedness, there is still an uphill battle to be \nfought to ensure U.S. Forces are ready for major operations. This \nreport states that aviation readiness remains challenged by ``reduced \naircraft mission-capable rates, parts shortages, and technical \nsurprises and maintenance issues.''\n  Readiness involves very many distinct issues. First, it's making sure \nthat we're providing the resources needed to maintain readiness. \nSecond, it's making sure that we are gathering the right data and \ninformation so that we've got true pictures of readiness. Third, it's \ndealing quickly and effectively with readiness issues when they're \ndetected.\n  Several weeks ago I released an article describing the legislation I \nam proposing here. As a result, I have received numerous letters from \nconstituents reiterating the need for this review board and citing \nexamples of why it should be done. One letter was sent by a women who \nhas a daughter and two friends who are serving on various Navy bases. \nIn her letter she describes a situation where there are not enough \nspare parts to go around. Nothing new--except this effects her \npersonally and causes her to worry constantly about her family and \nfriends because they are spread too thin and lack the spare parts to do \ntheir job, thereby endangering them needlessly.\n  At the end of the cold war, force structure and personnel end \nstrength were drastically cut in all the services. At the same time, \nthe Nation discovered that the post-cold war world is a complex, \ndangerous place. As a result, deployments for contingency operations, \npeacekeeping missions, humanitarian assistance, disaster relief and \ncounter-terrorism operations increased dramatically and our dependence \non the armed services for their deployments continues to grow.\n  While our military forces got smaller, they did not become more ready \nfor combat. In fact, our peak military readiness was reached \nimmediately following Desert Storm in 1991 and has slowly and steadily \ndeclined since.\n  And that is inexcusable for a superpower. We have a responsibility to \nour citizens and to countless millions around the world whose physical \nsafety and economic and political stability is guaranteed because of \nour military strength.\n  The world looks to us, and so as I review this military readiness \nproblem and search for a solution I am guided by the simple notion that \nour strength guarantees global peace. Our military strength provides \nthe foundation for the global economy and provides the economic and \npolitical stability for so many parts of the world. This understanding \nmust guide our efforts as we seek to rebuild our military to prevail in \nour next war.\n  Our own history during this century has shown us that when we try to \njudge our military by its cost-efficiency during peacetime we invite \ndisaster. This happened at the outset of the Second World War in North \nAfrica. And we saw it again when Task Force Smith was shredded by the \nNorth Koreans in 1950.\n  How may times must we relearn the lesson that the only true measure \nof military effectiveness is performance in wartime?\n  I commend to my colleagues a brilliant editorial in the Wall Street \nJournal by Mark Helprin. He writes of the myopic view of peacetime \ncivilians charged with budgeting their militaries. ``God save the \nAmerican soldier from those who believe that his life can be protected \nand his mission accomplished on the cheap,'' wrote Mr. Helprin. ``For \nwhat they perceive as extravagance is always less costly in lives and \ntreasure than the long drawn-out wars it deters or shortens with quick \nvictories.''\n  I should explain that the bill I have introduced establishes a \ncommission to be appointed by the Secretary of Defense with the \nconcurrence of the chairs and ranking members of the authorizing \nappropriations committees to look at the issues of readiness and to be \nsure that they report to the Congress and to the United States, No. 1, \non the status of readiness and, No. 2, on the reliability, or lack \nthereof, in the system set up to determine readiness.\n  I respect the great work being done by the Readiness Subcommittee of \nthe Armed Services Committee. I have spoken with the chair and ranking \nmembers. We want to be a supplement to and a sounding board, perhaps, \nto provide a louder microphone or megaphone for the information \ndetermined in that Readiness Subcommittee.\n  I hope my colleagues will look at this measure and join me in \nsponsoring it. I am pleased to ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nRoberts, be listed as a cosponsor.\n  I invite other colleagues who have an interest in this to look at it \nand join with me. I hope and trust we can have a strong bipartisan \neffort to achieve something which should be the goal and the objective \nof all of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two articles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, April 24, 2001]\n\n                           The Fire Next Time\n\n                           (By Mark Helprin)\n\n       From Alexandria in July of 1941, Randolph Churchill \n     reported to his father as the British waited for Rommel to \n     attack Egypt. In the midst of a peril that famously \n     concentrated mind and spirit, he wrote, ``You can see \n     generals wandering around GHQ looking for bits of string.''\n       Apparently these generals were not, like their prime \n     minister, devoted to Napoleon's maxim, ``Frappez la masse, et \n     le reste vient par surcroit,'' which, vis-a-vis strategic or \n     other problems, bids one to concentrate upon the essence, \n     with assurance that all else will follow in train, even bits \n     of string.\n       Those with more than a superficial view of American \n     national security, who would defend and preserve it from the \n     fire next time, have by necessity divided their forces in \n     advocacy of its various elements, but they have neglected its \n     essence. For the cardinal issue of national security is not \n     China, is not Russia, is not weapons of mass destruction, or \n     missile defense, the revolution in military affairs, \n     terrorism, training, or readiness. It is, rather, that the \n     general consensus in regard to defense since Pearl Harbor--\n     that doing too much is more prudent than doing too little--\n     has been destroyed. The last time we devoted a lesser \n     proportion of our resources to defense, we were well \n     protected by the oceans, in the midst of a depression, and \n     without major international responsibilities, and even then \n     it was a dereliction of duty.\n       The destruction is so influential that traditional \n     supporters of high defense spending, bent to the will of \n     their detractors, shrink from argument, choosing rather to \n     negotiate among themselves so as to prepare painstakingly \n     crafted instruments of surrender.\n       A leader of defense reform, whose life mission is to defend \n     the United States, writes to me: ``Please do not quote me \n     under any circumstances by name. . . . Bush has no chance of \n     winning the argument that more money must be spent on \n     defense. Very few Americans feel that more money needs to be \n     spent on defense and they are right. The amount of money \n     being spent is already more than sufficient.''\n       More than sufficient to fight China? It is hard to think of \n     anything less appealing than war with China, but if we don't \n     want that we must be able to deter China, and to deter China \n     we must have the ability to fight China. More than sufficient \n     to deal with simultaneous invasions of Kuwait, South Korea, \n     and Taiwan? More than sufficient to stop even one incoming \n     ballistic missile? Not yet, not now, and, until we spend the \n     money, not ever.\n       For someone of the all-too-common opinion that a strong \n     defense is the cause of war, a favorite trick is to advance a \n     wholesale revision of strategy, so that he may accomplish his \n     depredations while looking like a reformer. This pattern is \n     followed instinctively by the French when they are \n     in alliance and by the left when it is trapped within the \n     democratic order. But to do so one need be neither French \n     nor on the left.\n       Neville Chamberlain, who was neither, starved the army and \n     navy on the theory that the revolution in military affairs of \n     his time made the only defense feasible that a ``Fortress \n     Britain'' protected by the Royal Air Force--and then failed \n     in building up the air force. Bill Clinton, who is not \n     French, and who came into office calling for the \n     discontinuance of heavy echelons in favor of power \n     projection, simultaneously pressed for a severe reduction in \n     aircraft carriers, the sine qua non of power projection. \n     Later, he and his strategical toadies embraced the revolution \n     in military affairs not for its virtues\n\n[[Page S5698]]\n\n     but because even the Clinton-ravished military ``may be \n     unaffordable,'' and ``advanced technology offers much greater \n     military efficiency.''\n       This potential efficiency is largely unfamiliar to the \n     general public. For example, current miniaturized weapons may \n     seem elephantine after advances in extreme ultraviolet \n     lithography equip guidance and control systems with circuitry \n     not 0.25 microns but 0.007 microns wide, a 35-fold reduction \n     that will make possible the robotization of arms, from \n     terminally guided and target-identifying bullets to \n     autonomous tank killers that fly hundreds of miles, burrow \n     into the ground, and sleep like locusts until they are \n     awakened by the seismic signature of enemy armor.\n       Lead-magnesium-niobate transducers in broadband sonars are \n     likely to make the seas perfectly transparent, eliminating \n     for the first time the presumed invulnerability of submarine-\n     launched ballistic missiles, the anchor of strategic nuclear \n     stability. The steady perfection of missile guidance has long \n     made nearly everything the left says about nuclear \n     disarmament disingenuous or uninformed, and the advent of \n     metastable explosives creates the prospect of a single B-1 \n     bomber carrying the non-nuclear weapons load of 450 B-17s, \n     the equivalent of 26,800 100-pound bombs. Someday, we will \n     have these things, or, if we abstain, or potential enemies \n     will have them and we will not.\n       To field them will be more expensive then fielding less \n     miraculous weapons, which cannot simply be abandoned lest an \n     enemy exploit the transition, and which will remain as \n     indispensable as the rifleman holding his ground, because the \n     nature of war is counter-miraculous. And yet, when the \n     revolution in military affairs is still mainly academic, we \n     have cut recklessly into the staple forces.\n       God save the American soldier from those who believe that \n     his life can be protected and his mission accomplished on the \n     cheap. For what they perceive as extravagance is always less \n     costly in lives and treasure than the long drawn-out wars it \n     deters altogether or shortens with quick victories. In the \n     name of their misplaced frugality we have transformed our \n     richly competitive process of acquiring weapons into the \n     single-supplier model of the command economies that we \n     defeated in the Cold War, largely with the superior weapons \n     that the idea of free and competitive markets allowed us to \n     produce.\n       Though initially more expensive, producing half a dozen \n     different combat aircraft and seeing which are best is better \n     than decreeing that one will do the job and praying that it \n     may. Among other things, strike aircraft have many different \n     roles, and relying upon just one would be the same sort of \n     economy as having Clark Gable play both Rhett Butler and \n     Scarlett O'Hara.\n       Having relinquished or abandoned many foreign bases, the \n     United States requires its warships to go quickly from place \n     to place so as to compensate for their inadequate number, and \n     has built them light using a lot of aluminum, which, because \n     it can burn in air at 3,000 degrees Celsius, is used in \n     incendiary bombs and blast furnaces. (Join the navy and see \n     the world. You won't need to bring a toaster.)\n       And aluminum or not, there are too few ships, During the \n     EP-3 incident various pinheads furthered the impression of an \n     American naval cordon off the Chinese coast. Though in 1944 \n     the navy kept 17 major carriers in the central Pacific alone, \n     not long ago its assets were so attenuated by the destruction \n     of a few Yugos disguised as tanks that for three months \n     there was not in the vast western Pacific even a single \n     American aircraft carrier.\n       What remains of the order of battle is crippled by a lack \n     of the unglamorous, costly supports that are the first to go \n     when there isn't enough money. Consider the floating dry \n     dock. By putting ships back into action with minimal transit \n     time, floating dry docks are force preservers and \n     multipliers. In 1972, the United States had 94. Now it has \n     14. Though history is bitter and clear, this kind of mistake \n     persists.\n       Had the allies of World War II been prepared with a \n     sufficient number of so pedestrian a thing as landing craft, \n     the war might have been cheated of a year and a half and many \n     millions of lives. In 1940, the French army disposed of 530 \n     artillery pieces, 830 antitank guns, and 235 (almost half) of \n     its best tanks, because in 1940 the French did not think much \n     of the Wehrmacht--until May.\n       How shall the United States avoid similar misjudgments? Who \n     shall stand against the common wisdom when it is wrong about \n     deterrence, wrong about the causes of war, wrong about the \n     state of the world, wrong about the ambitions of ascendant \n     nations, wrong about history, and wrong about human nature?\n       In the defense of the United States, doing too much is more \n     prudent than doing too little. Though many in Congress argue \n     this and argue it well, Congress will not follow one of its \n     own. Though the president's appointees also argue it well, \n     the public will wait only upon the president himself. Only he \n     can sway a timid Congress, clear the way for his appointees, \n     and move the country toward the restoration of its military \n     power.\n       The president himself must make the argument, or all else \n     is in vain. If he is unwilling to risk his political capital \n     and his presidency to undo the damage of the past eight \n     years, then in the fire next time his name will be linked \n     with that of his predecessor, and there it will stay forever.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 20, 2001]\n\n                Rumsfield on High Wire of Defense Reform\n\n                          (By Thomas E. Ricks)\n\n       In his first four months at the Pentagon, Defense Secretary \n     Donald H. Rumsfeld has launched a score of secretive studies \n     and posed hundreds of tough questions as he has tried to \n     create a new vision for the American military, looking at \n     everything from missile defenses and global strategy to the \n     flaws of a Truman-vintage personnel system.\n       Yet, in that short span, he has also rallied an unlikely \n     collection of critics, ranging from conservative members of \n     Congress and his predecessor as defense secretary to some of \n     the generals who work for him. In dozens of interviews, those \n     people expressed deep concern that Rumsfeld has acted \n     imperiously, kept some of the top brass in the dark and \n     failed to maintain adequate communications with Capitol Hill.\n       ``He's blown off the Hill, he's blown off the senior \n     leaders in the military, and he's blown off the media,'' said \n     Thomas Donnelly, a defense expert at the conservative Project \n     for the New American Century. ``Is there a single group he's \n     reached out to?''\n       The criticism has focused on Rumsfeld's score of study \n     groups, staffed by retired generals and admirals and other \n     experts who are probing everything from weapons programs to \n     military retirement policies. In Pentagon hallways, ``the \n     Rumsfeld review,'' as the studies are collectively called, is \n     mocked by some as a martial version of Hillary Rodham \n     Clinton's health care plan, which failed spectacularly in \n     1994 when it was offered up to Congress.\n       ``It's arrogant theorists behind closed doors,'' said one \n     person offering the Clinton analogy, retired Army Lt. Col. \n     Ralph Peters, now a prominent writer on military strategy.\n       The military is already responding in significant and \n     striking ways. On Thursday, the Joint Chiefs of Staff held a \n     closed-door meeting in the ``Tank,'' their secure conference \n     room at the Pentagon, where they posed scathing questions \n     about Rumsfeld's intentions on strategy and possible cuts to \n     the Army, defense officials said. Yesterday, retired Gen. \n     Gordon Sullivan, a former Army chief of staff, delivered an \n     angry speech assailing the apparent direction of Rumsfeld's \n     reforms as ``imprudent.''\n       One point on which both Rumsfeld and his critics agree is \n     the gravity of his reform effort. Reshaping the military to \n     meet the new threats of the 21st century--and to keep the \n     U.S. armed forces by far the stongest in the world--was a key \n     campaign pledge of President Bush. To be successful, Rumsfeld \n     must not only come up with specific answers but also find \n     enough support in Congress and across the military to fund \n     them and carry them out. The job will be made all the more \n     difficult because the reforms could anger members of Congress \n     by closing bases, terminating major weapons programs and \n     shifting some spending from tanks, ships and aircraft into \n     newer areas such as space and missile defenses.\n       In an extensive interview in his Pentagon office last week, \n     Rumsfeld argued that his review has been necessary, rational \n     and inclusive, involving more than 170 meetings with 44 \n     generals and admirals. ``Everyone who wants to be briefed I \n     think has been briefed,'' he said. ``Everyone cannot be \n     involved in everything.''\n       Far from reaching concrete conclusions behind closed doors, \n     he said, he simply has been posing questions about how to \n     change the military to deal with a world where even Third \n     World nations can buy long-range missiles, terrorists have \n     attacked sites inside the United States, and the American \n     economy is increasingly reliant on vulnerable satellites. \n     ``I've got a lot of thoughts, but I don't have a lot of \n     answers,'' he said.\n       Overall, Rumsfeld swung in the interview between being \n     conciliatory toward his critics and being dismissive of them. \n     ``Is change hard for people? Yeah,'' he said sympathetically. \n     ``Is the anticipation of change even harder? Yeah.''\n       But a moment later he added: ``The people it shakes up may \n     very well be people who don't have enough to do. They're too \n     busy getting shook up. They should get out there and get to \n     work.''\n\n\n                             brusque style\n\n       Rumsfeld, a bright, impatient man who is not a schmoozer by \n     nature, spent years as an executive in the pharmaceutical \n     industry and honed a top-down management style. That approach \n     may be the only way to overhaul America's huge and \n     conservative military establishment. But his brusque manner \n     has exacerbated anxiety about change in the Pentagon and \n     could, in the end, undercut his effort.\n       Generals who have met with him report that communications \n     tend to be one way. ``He takes a lot in, but he doesn't give \n     anything back,'' one said. ``You go and brief him, and it's \n     just blank.''\n       Neither that general nor any other Pentagon official \n     critical of Rumsfeld would agree to be quoted by name. \n     Indeed, one said Rumsfeld's aides would ``have my tongue'' \n     were it known that he had talked to a reporter.\n       Many of those interviewed said they are worried that the \n     future of the institution to which they have devoted their \n     adult lives is being decided without them. One senior general \n     unfavorably compared Rumsfeld's stewardship of the Pentagon \n     with Colin L. Powell's performance as secretary of state. \n     ``Mr.\n\n[[Page S5699]]\n\n     Powell is very inclusive, and Mr. Rumsfeld is the opposite,'' \n     said the general, who knows both men. ``We've been kept out \n     of the loop.''\n       Added another senior officer: ``The fact is, he is \n     disenfranchising people.''\n       Some noted that the Bush administration came into office \n     vowing to restore the military's trust in its civilian \n     overseers. ``Everyone in the military voted for these guys, \n     and now they feel like they aren't being trusted,'' a \n     Pentagon official said.\n       The Army, which has the reputation of being the most \n     doggedly obedient of all the services, appears to be closest \n     to going into opposition against the new regime. Army \n     generals are especially alarmed by rumors that they could \n     lose one or two of their 10 active divisions under the new \n     Pacific-oriented strategy that Rumsfeld appears to be moving \n     toward but has not yet unveiled.\n       At the Joint Chiefs' ``Tank'' session on Thursday, one \n     defense official said, the Army led the charge against the \n     conclusions of a Rumsfeld study group on conventional weapons \n     that suggested big cuts in Army troops. The service chiefs \n     told their chairman, Gen. Henry H. Shelton, that they could \n     not make sense of that recommendation without knowing \n     precisely what strategy Rumsfeld wants to pursue. ``It wasn't \n     just the Army, but [Army officers] took the lead'' in the \n     criticism, the official added.\n       Retired generals often say in public what the active-duty \n     leadership is thinking but can't utter. Sullivan, the former \n     Army chief, appeared to play that role yesterday in a speech \n     to a conference of Army reservists. He said he is worried \n     that Rumsfeld would ``propose a world in which we will be \n     able to hide behind our missile defense,'' which he went on \n     to liken to the expensive but useless Maginot Line that \n     France erected against Germany after World War I.\n       In another recent talk, Sullivan referred to Rumsfeld's new \n     emphasis on space as a ``rathole'' for defense spending. He \n     also sent an e-mail criticizing Rumsfeld, and that message \n     has circulated widely inside the Army.\n\n\n                             wary generals\n\n       The military now appears so wary of Rumsfeld that officers \n     perceive slights where none may have been intended. The \n     generals are especially peeved by what they believe is a \n     pattern of moves by Rumsfeld to reallocate power from the \n     military to himself.\n       Earlier this month, for example, Rumsfeld dumped his \n     military assistant, a one-star admiral who had been picked \n     for the job just four months earlier, and replaced him with a \n     three-star admiral. ``It turned out I made a mistake, just to \n     be blunt about it, thinking that a one-star could, simply \n     because he was in the secretary's office, get the place to \n     move at the same pace that a three-star could or a two-\n     star,'' Rumsfeld explained. In other words, one flag officer \n     commented, Rumsfeld felt he needed someone who could crack \n     the whip over the top brass.\n       Rumsfeld also caused a stir in the services by bringing in \n     retired Vice Adm. Staser Holcomb, who was his military \n     assistant during his first term as secretary of defense, \n     under President Gerald R. Ford, to look over the current crop \n     of generals and admirals. Holcomb's queries may indicate that \n     Rumsfeld wants to take over the selection of top generals--\n     one of the last prerogatives left to the service chiefs. The \n     chiefs generally have little say about operational matters, \n     which are the province of the regional commanders, or \n     ``CinCs,'' and they don't have much sway over weapons \n     acquisition, which is a civilian responsibility. But they do \n     get to pick who joins the club of top generals.\n       Rumsfeld said Holcomb is working on military personnel \n     matters, especially in helping him look at who should become \n     the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff when Shelton \n     steps down later this year. Asked whether he is stepping on \n     the toes of the service chiefs by getting involved in the \n     selection of two- and three-star generals, Rumsfeld grinned \n     and laughed, but said nothing.\n       Rumsfeld has also been planning to start a new ``Crisis \n     Coordination Center'' to be overseen by his office, defense \n     officials said. They report that Rumsfeld believes that \n     communications and responsibilities during crises have been \n     handled hazily. Creating such a center--a move that has not \n     previously been reported--almost certainly would diminish the \n     power of the staff of the Joint Chiefs, which oversees \n     operations.\n       Rumsfeld's views on crisis communications may have been \n     crystallized by an undisclosed foul-up that occurred during \n     the Feb. 16 air strikes against Iraq, the Bush \n     administration's first use of military force. At the last \n     minute, military commanders moved up the timing of the \n     strikes by six hours.\n       But word somehow didn't get to Bush, said several defense \n     officials. The president had expected the bombs to begin \n     dropping as he headed home from a summit meeting in Mexico. \n     Instead, the strikes started just as he arrived for that \n     meeting, overshadowing his first foreign trip as president \n     and infuriating him, officials said.\n       Rumsfeld declined to comment on that incident. But he said \n     that, generally speaking, miscommunications are ``inevitable \n     when people are new on the job.''\n\n\n                         tensions with congress\n\n       If anything, Rumsfeld's relations with Capitol Hill have \n     been even more tumultuous. The military, after all, \n     ultimately will follow orders. But Congress expects to have a \n     big say in the orders.\n       ``There really could be a huge collision between Rumsfeld, \n     the services and Congress,'' predicted Harlan Ullman, a \n     defense analyst at the Center for Strategic and International \n     Studies. ``There's an iceberg out there, and there's a \n     Titanic.''\n       Ullman said he thinks Rumsfeld has done a fairly good job, \n     considering how understaffed the top of the Pentagon has \n     been, with only a few senior officials in place.\n       But he also said that the Bush White House has badly \n     miscalculated on the politics of defense. ``I don't think the \n     administration understands how much political capital it will \n     take to change the U.S. military,'' he said. He and others \n     warn that defense isn't a major issue on the Hill, and that \n     no clear constituency exists for military reform. At the same \n     time, there is a clear bloc against change, consisting of \n     members of Congress who worry that bases and weapons \n     plants in their districts could be closed.\n       Rumsfeld said he has devoted enormous effort to \n     congressional relations, holding about 70 meetings with 115 \n     lawmakers over the past four months. ``I am on the hill \n     frequently,'' he said. ``I frequently have breakfasts and \n     lunches down here that include members.''\n       But the view from the Hill appears to be different. ``There \n     are lots of members concerned about the lack of \n     communications,'' a Senate staffer said last week.\n       One warning sign has been a spate of ``holds'' placed on \n     Rumsfeld's nominees by angry senators. These holds, which \n     prevent a confirmation vote from taking place, aren't made \n     public. But it is striking that Republican senators appear to \n     have held up some of the nominees of a Republican \n     administration. The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott (R-\n     Miss.), controlled two of the holds--on the nominees to be \n     the Pentagon's general counsel and assistant secretary for \n     public affairs--that were lifted late Thursday.\n       Rumsfeld's predecessor as defense secretary, William S. \n     Cohen, took the unusual step last week of publicly \n     criticizing Rumsfeld's handling of Congress. ``However \n     brilliant the strategy may be, you cannot formulate a \n     strategy and mandate that Congress implement it,'' Cohen, a \n     former Republican senator, told a group of reporters.\n       ``The less they're involved in the beginning,'' Cohen \n     warned, ``the more they'll be involved in the end, and not \n     necessarily in a positive way.''\n       Rumsfeld appears to have strong backing not only from Bush \n     but also from Vice President Cheney, his former protege when \n     Rumsfeld was a White House counselor and then chief of staff \n     in the Ford administration. Earlier this month, a senior \n     White House official said: ``The vice president indicated to \n     the secretary that he would be as helpful as he could. As a \n     former defense secretary, he has a special interest in the \n     Pentagon.''\n       Where the White house stands on Rumsfeld's efforts should \n     become clearer this Friday, when Bush is scheduled to speak \n     about U.S. military strategy in a commencement address at \n     Annapolis.\n       In the following weeks, Rumsfeld will engage Congress in \n     hearings, then will begin making critical decisions on high-\n     profile weapons systems and on whether to cut the size of the \n     military to pay for new weapons. Every one of those decisions \n     could antagonize members of Congress.\n       Rumsfeld said he looks forward to working with lawmakers to \n     find the right answers. ``Hell, I know what I can do and I \n     can't do,'' he said. ``I can do some things, but I can't \n     simply stick a computer chip in my head and come out with a \n     perfect answer to big, tough important questions like that \n     for the country. Even if you could, change imposed is change \n     opposed.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON:\n  S. 968. A bill to establish Healthy and High Performance Schools \nProgram in the Department of Education and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation to help \nour schools become more energy efficient.\n  Each year, America's schools spend more on energy costs than they do \non books and computers combined.\n  As we continue to debate education spending, there is at least one \nway to save on education costs: energy efficiency measures could save \nAmerica's schools $1.5 billion. And we can reinvest those dollars into \neducational resources--like books, computers or more training for our \nteachers--that can make a real difference for our children's futures.\n  Typically, nearly one-third of the energy used in a U.S. school goes \nto waste because of outdated technology, old equipment and poor \ninsulation. The least energy-efficient schools, many of which are in \ndesperate need of upgrades and repair, use almost four times as much \nenergy per square foot as the most energy-efficient ones.\n  Over half of our the country's K-12 schools are more than 40 years \nold and in need of renovation to reach standards of efficiency and \ncomfort. And it's estimated that 6,000 new schools will be needed in \nthe next 10 years because of the growing student population.\n\n[[Page S5700]]\n\n  The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that schools could save 25 to \n30 percent of the money they spend on energy--$1.5 billion--through \nbetter building design, use of energy-efficient and renewable energy \ntechnologies and improvements to operations and maintenance.\n  Unfortunately, school districts may not be aware of the things they \ncan do to be more energy efficient, improve indoor environments, and \nsave money. That is why the legislation that I am introducing today is \nso important. The Healthy and High Performance Schools Act of 2001 \nwould create a program within the Department of Education to provide \ngrants to states to help school districts make their buildings \nhealthier and more energy efficient. It will help our schools improve \nthe indoor air quality, make smart energy efficient upgrades and take \nadvantage of new, energy efficient technology. And this will save our \nschools money.\n  There are some basic things that every school can do to reduce energy \nuse. If schools adopt energy management systems to coordinate heating, \nventilation and air conditioning they can help ensure rooms are heated \nand cooled only while being used.\n  And simply closing doors to keep heated or cooled air from escaping \ncan save money. Schools can add insulation to walls, floors, attics and \nceilings or use shades, films and screens to better secure windows. \nUsing some type of window treatment in the summer can greatly reduce \nthe need for air conditioning. Energy-efficient fixtures, bulbs and \nlamps can make a big difference too. And installing occupancy sensors \nto control lighting when rooms are empty is smart and efficient.\n  So much of the energy used by schools--approximately fifteen \npercent--is for cooking, refrigeration, and heating hot water. Simply \nmaintaining food service equipment in schools can mean large energy \nsavings.\n  Energy use by computers and office equipment is one of the fastest-\ngrowing sources of electricity consumption in schools, businesses and \nhomes. And it is expected to grow by as much as 500 percent in the next \ndecade. If schools use products with an ENERGY STAR label--the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's, EPA, label for energy efficient \nappliances--they can save as much as 50 percent in energy costs.\n  And I'm proud to report that many schools in New York are already \nleading the way.\n  The Smithtown School District on Long Island recently became the \nfirst school district in New York State to receive the Energy Star \nlabel. The District completed an extensive lighting modification \nproject using the latest energy-efficient technologies in three of its \nelementary schools. Three schools, Smithtown Elementary, Mount Pleasant \nElementary and Dogwood Elementary, will display the bronze plaque with \nthe Energy Star logo in their buildings. The district now uses more \nthan five million kilowatts less than it did in the 1970's.\n  The Kingston School District in Ulster County, New York, made drastic \nimprovements in the energy performance of all the schools in the \ndistrict by replacing many of the windows, installing new boilers, and \nmaking other energy efficient upgrades. In 2000, the school district \nsaved more than $395,000 through its energy-efficiency upgrades and in \n2001, received an Energy Star Partner of the Year Award.\n  Sachem Central School District on Long Island was awarded the Energy \nStart Partner of the Year Award in 2000. The District installed energy-\nefficient lighting fixtures and new boilers that resulted in savings of \nalmost 300,000 gallons of oil and more than 2.9 million kWh. Special \nbuilding automation system helps measure, monitor and manage energy \nuse.\n  Other New York Energy Star School Partners are Connetquot Central \nSchool District, East Rockaway Public Schools, Fordham Preparatory \nSchool, Patchogue Medford Schools, Rochester City School District, Rye \nCity School District and Wantagh Union Free School District.\n  I am pleased to join my colleague in the House of Representatives, \nMark Udall from Colorado, the sponsor of the High Performance Schools \nAct of 2001, H.R. 1129, as well as the co-sponsors, including my fellow \nNew Yorkers, Sherwood Boehlert and Maurice Hinchey.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will join me in supporting \nthis legislation, which has bipartisan support in the House, so that we \ncan provide our schools with the tools that they need to save money on \ntheir energy costs, and reinvest that money into much-needed education \nresources that can help our children reach their goals.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Healthy and High Performance \n     Schools Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) American kindergarten through grade 12 schools spend \n     over $6,000,000,000 annually on energy costs, which is more \n     than is spent on books and computers combined.\n       (2) Approximately 25,000,000 students are attending schools \n     with at least 1 unsatisfactory environmental condition.\n       (3) Educators teach and students learn best in an \n     environment that is comfortable, healthy, naturally lit where \n     possible, and in good repair, and studies have indicated that \n     student achievement is greater and attendance higher when \n     those conditions are met.\n       (4) Over half of our Nation's kindergarten through grade 12 \n     schools are more than 40 years old and in need of renovation \n     to reach such standard of efficiency and comfort, and 6,000 \n     new schools will be required over the next 10 years to \n     accommodate the growing number of students.\n       (5) Inadequate ventilation in school buildings, poor \n     lighting and acoustical quality, and uncomfortable \n     temperatures can cause poor health and diminish students' \n     capacity to concentrate and excel.\n       (6) Inefficient use of water, either in consumption or from \n     poorly maintained systems, is prevalent in older schools.\n       (7) Using a whole building approach in the design of new \n     schools and the renovation of existing schools (considering \n     how materials, systems, and products connect and overlap and \n     also how a school is integrated on its site and within the \n     surrounding community) will result in healthy and high \n     performance school buildings.\n       (8) Adoption of whole building concepts has been shown to \n     result in dramatic improvements in student and teacher \n     performance.\n       (9) Adopting a whole building approach usually results in a \n     lower life cycle cost for the school building than for a \n     conventionally designed and built building.\n       (10) Systematic use of energy conservation in school \n     construction and renovation projects can save at least one \n     quarter of current energy costs, leaving more money for \n     teachers and educational materials.\n       (11) The use of renewable energy sources such as \n     daylighting, solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass \n     power in a building already designed to be energy-efficient \n     can help meet the building's energy needs without added \n     emissions.\n       (12) Using environmentally preferable products and \n     providing for adequate supplies of fresh air will improve \n     indoor air quality and provide healthful school buildings.\n       (13) Most school districts do not have the knowledge of \n     cutting-edge design and technologies to integrate optimum \n     efficiency and environmentally healthy designs into new \n     school construction or into school renovations.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to assist local \n     educational agencies in the production of high performance \n     elementary school and secondary school buildings that are \n     healthful, productive, energy-efficient, and environmentally \n     sound.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 39 Tremont Street, Paris Hill, Maine, as the Horatio \nKing Post Office Building; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nhonor one of the great contributors to our national postal system, \nHoratio King, by naming after him the Paris Hill Post Office in Paris, \nME, the town of his birth. My colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, \njoins me in this effort.\n  Horatio King had a long career serving the public as a newspaper \npublisher and postal employee, eventually working his way through the \nranks to become Postmaster General under President Buchanan. All told, \nhe served under three Presidents.\n  His career with the Postal Service began in 1839, when he was \nappointed by then Postmaster General Kendall to a postal position that \nrequired him to leave Maine and reside in Washington, DC. In 1850, he \nbecame affiliated with the foreign mail service and was instrumental in \ndeveloping this aspect of our postal system. His efforts were \nrecognized in 1854 when he was appointed first assistant Postmaster \nGeneral, a post he would hold until becoming Postmaster General in \n1861, shortly before the outbreak of the Civil War.\n  Horatio King did not end his service, however, after reaching this \npinnacle. In 1863, President Lincoln recognized his steadfast devotion \nto the Union and, although King was of the opposite political party, \nnamed him to a commission charged with carrying out the Emancipation \nProclamation in the District of Columbia.\n  King was also a man of letters, and was well known for his literary \nevenings which did much to elevate the culture in Washington at a time \nwhen it was a much smaller and less diverse town than the one of today. \nHe would frequently publish newspaper and magazine articles and \nlectures, and even published a book of travel sketches upon returning \nfrom a tour of Europe.\n  Today, the birthplace of Horatio King remains well preserved and \ncared for by my constituents, Janice and Glenn Davis, as the lovely \nKing's Hill Inn.\n  Horatio King served Maine well by serving America well. It is \nappropriate that Congress recognize his contributions by naming the \nPost Office in the town of his birth for him and, along with Senator \nSnowe, I am delighted to have the opportunity to introduce legislation \nto accomplish this.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 971. A bill to expand the availability of oral health services by \nstrengthening the dental workforce in designated underserved areas; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing \nlegislation to improve access to oral health care by strengthening the \ndental workforce in our nation's rural and underserved communities.\n  Oral and general health are inseparable, and good dental care is \ncritical to our overall physical health and well-being. Dental health \nencompasses far more than cavities and gum disease. The recent U.S. \nSurgeon General report Oral Health in America states that ``the mouth \nacts as a mirror of health and disease'' that can help diagnose \ndisorders such as diabetes, leukemia, heart disease, or anemia.\n  While oral health in America has improved dramatically over the last \n50 years, these improvements have not occurred evenly across all \nsectors of our population, particularly among low-income individuals \nand families. Too many Americans today lack access to dental care. \nWhile there are clinically proven techniques to prevent or delay\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\nthe progression of dental health problems, an estimated 25 million \nAmericans live in areas lacking adequate dental services. As a \nconsequence, these effective treatment and prevention programs are not \navailable in too many of our communities. Astoundingly, as many as \neleven percent of our nation's rural population has never been to a \ndentist.\n  This situation is exacerbated by the fact that our dental workforce \nis graying and the overall ratio of dentists to population is \ndeclining. In Maine, for example, there currently are 393 active \ndentists, 241 of whom are 45 or older. More than 20 percent of dentists \nnationwide will retire in the next ten years, and the number of dental \ngraduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace these retirees.\n  As a consequence, Maine, like many States, is currently facing a \nserious shortage of dentists, particularly in rural areas. While there \nis one general practice dentist for every 2,286 people in the Portland \narea, the numbers drop off dramatically in western and northern Maine. \nIn Aroostook County, where I am from, there's only one dentist for \nevery 5,507 people. Moreover, at a time when tooth decay is the most \nprevalent childhood disease in America, Maine has fewer than ten \nspecialists in pediatric dentistry, and most of these are located in \nthe southern part of the state.\n  This dental workforce shortage is exacerbated by the fact that Maine \ncurrently does not have a dental school or even a dental residency \nprogram. Dental schools can provide a critical safety net for the oral \nhealth needs of a state, and dental education clinics can provide the \nsurrounding communities with care that otherwise would be unavailable \nto disadvantaged and underinsured populations. Maine is just one of a \nnumber of predominantly rural states that lacks this important \ncomponent of a dental safety net.\n  Maine, like many States, is exploring a number of innovative ideas \nfor increasing access to dental care in underserved areas. In an effort \nto supplement and encourage these efforts, we are introducing \nlegislation today to establish a new State grant program designed to \nimprove access to oral health services in rural and underserved areas. \nThe legislation authorizes $50 million over 5 years for grants to \nStates to help them develop innovative dental workforce development \nprograms specific to their individual needs.\n  States could use these grants to fund a wide variety of programs. For \nexample, they could use the funds for loan forgiveness and repayment \nprograms for dentists practicing in underserved areas. They could also \nuse them to provide grants and low- or no-interest loans to help \npractitioners to establish or expand practices in these underserved \nareas. States, like Maine, that do not have a dental school could use \nthe funds to establish a dental residency program. Other States might \nwant to use the grant funding to establish or expand community or \nschool-based dental facilities or to set up mobile or portable dental \nclinics.\n\n  To assist in their recruitment and retention efforts, States could \nalso use the funds for placement and support of dental students, \nresidents, and advanced dentistry trainees. Or, they could use the \ngrant funds for continuing dental education, including distance-based \neducation, and practice support through teledentistry.\n  Other programs that could be funded through the grants include: \ncommunity-based prevention services such as water fluoridation and \ndental sealant programs; school programs to encourage children to go \ninto oral health or science professions; the establishment or expansion \nof a State dental office to coordinate oral health and access issues; \nand any other activities that are determined to be appropriate by the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services.\n  The National Health Service Corps is helping to meet the oral health \nneeds of underserved communities by placing dentists and dental \nhygienists in some of America's most difficult-to-place inner city, \nrural, and frontier areas. Unfortunately, however, the number of \ndentists and dental hygienists with obligations to serve in the \nNational Health Service Corps falls far short of meeting the total \nidentified need. According to the Surgeon General, only about 6 percent \nof the dental need in America's rural and underserved communities is \ncurrently being met by the National Health Service Corps.\n  In my State, approximately 173,000 Mainers live in designated dental \nhealth professional shortage areas. While the National Health Service \nCorps estimates that it will take 33 dental clinicians to meet this \nneed, it currently has only three serving in my State.\n  The bill we are introducing today would make some needed improvements \nin this critically important program so that it can better respond to \nour nation's oral health needs.\n  First, it would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop and implement a plan for increasing the participation of \ndentists and dental hygienists in the National Health Service Corps \nscholarship and loan repayment programs.\n  It would also allow National Health Service Corps scholarship and \nloan repayment program recipients to fulfill their commitment on a \npart-time basis. Some small rural communities may not have sufficient \npopulations to support a full-time dentist or dental hygienist. This \nwould give the National Health Service Corps additional flexibility to \nmeet the needs of these communities. Moreover, some practitioners may \nfind part-time service more attractive to them. This particularly may \nbe the case for a retired dentist who may want to practice only part-\ntime, allowing this feasibility could in turn improve both recruitment \nand retention in these communities.\n  Last year, after a 6-year hiatus, the National Health Service Corps \nbegan a two-year pilot program to award scholarships to dental \nstudents.\n  This is a step in the right direction, however, these scholarships \nare only being awarded to students attending certain dental schools, \nnot one of which is located in New England. Moreover, the pilot project \nrequires the participating dental schools to encourage Corps dental \nscholars to practice in communities near their educational \ninstitutions. The problem is obvious. If none of these programs are in \nNew England, and yet there is a requirement that the dentists \nparticipating in these programs practice in the surrounding \ncommunities, this is of no benefit to a State such as Maine that does \nnot have a dental school and does not have a qualifying program. As a \nconsequence, this program will do nothing at all to help relieve the \ndental shortage in Maine and other areas of New England.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would address this problem \nby expanding the National Health Service Corps Pilot Scholarship \nProgram so that dental students attending any of the 55 American dental \nschools can apply and require that placements for these scholars be \nbased strictly on community need, not on whether or not they surround \nthe dental school.\n  It would also improve the process for designating dental health \nprofessional shortage areas and ensure that the criteria for making \nsuch designations provide a more accurate reflection of oral health \nneeds, particularly in our rural areas where the problem is most acute.\n  And finally, taxing the scholarships and stipends of students \nadversely affects their financial incentive to participate in the \nNational Health Service Corps and to provide health care services in \nunderserved communities. Our legislation would, therefore, exclude from \nFederal income tax the fees and related educational expenses to \nindividuals who are participating in the National Health Service Corps \nscholarship and loan repayment programs.\n  The Dental Health Improvement Act will make critically important oral \nhealth care services more accessible in our Nation's rural and \nunderserved communities. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in \nsupportin this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that letters \nendorsing my bill from the American Dental Association and the American \nDental Education Association be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  American Dental Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American Dental \n     Association and our 144,000 member dentists, I am delighted \n     to endorse\n\n[[Page S5703]]\n\n     the ``Dental Health Improvement Act,'' which you introduced \n     today. The Association is proud that the oral health of \n     Americans continues to improve, and that Americans have \n     access to the best oral health care in the world.\n       Having said that, we agree that dental care has not reached \n     every corner of American society to the extent it has reached \n     the majority of Americans. For those Americans who are unable \n     to pay for care, and those with special needs, such as \n     disabled individuals, those with congenital conditions, and \n     non-ambulatory patients, obtaining dental care can be \n     difficult.\n       Your legislation recognizes several of these problems and \n     goes a long way towards addressing them in a targeted and \n     meaningful way. The section on grant proposals offers states \n     the opportunity to be innovative in their approaches to \n     address specific geographical dental workforce issues. You \n     recognize the need to provide incentives to increase faculty \n     recruitment in accredited dental training institutions, and \n     your support for increasing loan repayment and scholarship \n     programs will provide the appropriate incentives to increase \n     the dental workforce in ``safety net'' organizations.\n       The ADA is very grateful for your leadership on these \n     issues. Thank you for introducing this legislation. We want \n     to continue to work with you on dental access issues in \n     general and on this legislation as it moves through the \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Robert M. Anderton,\n     D.D.S., J.D., LL.M., President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   American Dental\n\n\n                                        Education Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 23, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins, I am writing on behalf of the dental \n     education community to commend you for developing and \n     introducing the Dental Health Improvement Act. This \n     legislation, when enacted into law, will expand the \n     availability of oral health care services for the nation's \n     underserved populations, strengthen the dental workforce, as \n     well as maintain the ability of dental schools to produce the \n     necessary manpower to provide oral health care to all \n     Americans.\n       The American Dental Education Association (ADEA) represents \n     the nation's 55 dental schools, as well as hospital-based \n     dental and advanced dental education programs, allied dental \n     programs and schools, dental research institutions, and the \n     faculty and students at these institutions. ADEA's member \n     schools are dedicated to providing the highest quality \n     education to their students, conducting research and \n     providing oral health care services to Americans from \n     medically unserved and underserved areas, the majority of \n     whom are uninsured or who are from low-income families. \n     Recent downward trends in student enrollment and a growing \n     shortage in dental faculty have caused ADEA serious concern \n     about our ability to fully and competently address these \n     responsibilities.\n       Therefore, I was delighted to see that the Dental Health \n     Improvement Act directly responds to many of these concerns. \n     If implemented, the Act would expand access to oral health \n     care to thousands of Americans for the first time. When \n     enacted, the provisions of the bill can be instrumental in \n     helping the more than 31 million Americans living in ares \n     that lack access to adequate oral health care services. It \n     can provide much needed help to dental education institutions \n     as we seek to address faculty shortages.\n       As you know, dental education institutions face a major \n     crisis in the graying of its faculty which threatens the \n     quality of dental education, oral, dental and craniofacial \n     research, and ultimately will adversely impact the health of \n     all Americans. Currently, there are approximately 400 faculty \n     vacancies. Retirements are expected to accelerate in both \n     private practice as well as teaching faculties in the \n     nation's 55 dental schools. There is a significant decrease \n     in the number of men and women choosing careers in dentistry, \n     teaching and research. Your personal experience in Maine is a \n     perfect example.\n       Educational debt has increased, affecting both career \n     choices and practice location. Your bill will provide funds \n     to help with recruitment and retention efforts and helps \n     expand dental residency training programs to the 27 states \n     that do not currently have dental schools.\n       Also important are the incentives you have proposed to \n     expand or establish community-based dental facilities linked \n     with dental education institutions. The need for this is \n     obvious. More than two-thirds of patients visiting dental \n     school clinics are members of families whose annual income is \n     estimated to be $15,000 or below. About half of these \n     patients are on Medicare or Medicaid, while more than a third \n     have no insurance coverage or government assistance program \n     to help them pay for their dental care.\n       Dental academic institutions are committed to their patient \n     care mission, not only by improving the management and \n     efficiency of patient centered care delivery at the dental \n     school, but through increasing affiliations with and use of \n     satellite clinics. All dental schools maintain at least one \n     dental clinic on-site, and approximately 70% of U.S. dental \n     schools have school-sponsored satellite clinics. Delivering \n     patient care in diverse settings demonstrates professional \n     responsibility to the oral health of the public.\n       Dental schools and other academic dental institutions \n     provide oral health to underserved and disadvantaged \n     populations. Yet more than 11 percent of the nation's rural \n     population has never been to see a dentist. This bill can \n     have a positive impact on this population by establishing \n     access to oral health care at community-based dental \n     facilities and consolidated health centers that are linked to \n     dental schools. 100 million Americans presently do not have \n     access to fluoridated water. The bill provides for community-\n     based prevention services such as fluoride and sealants that \n     can cause a dramatic change for nearly a third of the \n     nation's population.\n       Thank you again for taking such a leadership role in the \n     area of oral health. Please be assured that ADEA looks \n     forward to working closely with you to bring the far-reaching \n     potential of the Dental Health Improvement Act to fruition.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Richard W. Valachovic,\n                               D.M.D., M.P.H., Executive Director.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Finally, Mr. President, I thank my principal cosponsor \nof this legislation, Senator Feingold of Wisconsin, for his \ncontributions to this bill. We found that Maine and Wisconsin have many \nsimilar problems in ensuring that there is an adequate supply of \ndentists in our more rural parts of our State.\n  It is our hope that this legislation will be considered and enacted \nthis year.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend from \nMaine, Senator Collins, to introduce the Dental Health Improvement Act. \nThis legislation will improve access to dental services by \nstrengthening the deal workforce in under-served areas.\n  While the scope of the dental access problem is very wide reaching, \nthis legislation takes an important step in the right direction by \nimproving the dental workforce in under-served areas.\n  According to the Surgeon General, an estimated 25 million Americans \nlive in areas lacking adequate dental care services, and as many as 11 \npercent of our Nation's rural population have never been to a dentist.\n  This problem will only get worse since more than 20 percent of \ndentists will retire in the next 10 years, and the number of dental \ngraduates by 2015 may not be enough to replace these retirees. While \ndentists have increased their productivity, they are still distribution \nproblems in specific geographic areas.\n  For too long, oral health has been overlooked and excluded from \nimportant public policy discussions of how to improve health and health \ncare around the country. Some contend that oral health care has been a \nlower priority because advances in dentistry--most notably the expanded \nuse of sealants and fluoridated water--are such that we are nearly a \n``cavity free society.'' Yet the truth is that while oral health has \ncertainly improved dramatically among those who are insured, and those \nwho have reliable access to a dentist, there is a tragic disparity in \nhealth status between the haves and the have nots.\n  This disparity between the poor and everyone else exists in general \nmedical health measures, such as infant mortality, low birth weight, \nblood lead levels and so on. But what I have learned since I first \nbecame interested in this issue is that the disparity is disturbingly \nstark in oral health.\n  Surgeon General David Satcher framed this issue well at his May 2000 \nrelease of his report, Oral Health in America, that ``Tooth decay \nremains the single most common chronic disease of childhood--five times \nmore common than asthma.''\n  While this fact is certainly true--that the prevalence of dental \ndisease remains high among children--its burden within the population \nof US children has shifted dramatically.\n  I would like to make sure that my colleagues are aware of this \nhorrifying statistic that helps to outline the scope of the problem: 80 \npercent of dental disease is found in the poorest 25 percent of \nchildren.\n  This figure helps to illustrate the broad scope of the problem. And \nwe all know that the problem is even more disturbing when we look at \nthe ways these vulnerable children suffer from lack of dental care.\n  Preschoolers living in poverty have twice the odds of having decaying \nteeth, twice the extent of decay when they have disease, and twice the \npain experience of their most affluent peers.\n  These children are already at a disadvantage in so many ways. And \njust\n\n[[Page S5704]]\n\nthe most basic dental care could make a difference in their lives. But \nour health care system allows this problem to fall through the cracks.\n  Over the past few years these and similar statistics have been \nchronicled by numerous entities including the Surgeon General, the \nGeneral Accounting Office, and the National Institutes of Health.\n  This legislation will help strengthen the dental workforce that \ndelivers vital oral health care services by improving the workforce in \nunder-served areas. By providing States and communities with sufficient \nflexibility to address the unique needs of their under-served areas, I \nbelieve that this legislation will take an effective approach to \nmeeting the needs of communities in Wisconsin and across the Nation.\n  The first part of this legislation would establish a new State-based \ngrant program to help states explore innovative ideas for increasing \naccess to dental care in under-served areas.\n  This grant program would be directed through the Health Resources and \nServices Administration at the Department of Health and Human Services \nand support the efforts of States to develop and implement innovative \nprograms to address the dental workforce shortage that are appropriate \nto their individual needs.\n  For example, States could tailor loan forgiveness and repayment \nprograms for dentists practicing in areas designated as dental health \nprofessional shortage areas by either the Federal Government or the \nState.\n  This program could also help with recruitment and retention efforts \nby providing grants or low interest loans to help practitioners in \ndesignated dental health professional shortage areas equip a dental \noffice or share in the overhead costs of an operation.\n  The second component of our legislation would increase participation \nof the dental workforce in the National Health Service Corps.\n  According to the U.S. Surgeon General, the number of dentists and \ndental hygienists with obligations to serve in the National Health \nService Corps falls far short of meeting the total identified need: \nonly about 6 percent of the dental need is currently being met by this \nprogram, and outreach and development are critical to future \nopportunities for strengthening the dental workforce in designated \nunder-served areas.\n  Our legislation would develop and implement a plan for increasing the \nparticipation of dentists and dental hygienists in the National Health \nService Corps scholarship and loan repayment programs and report back \nto Congress on their progress after three years.\n  This legislation follows a series of recommendations by the American \nDental Association and the American Dental Educators Association, who \nboth strongly support this legislation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join the Senator from Maine and me in our \nongoing efforts to increase access to dental care and promote greater \noral health.\n  We must change America's approach to oral health, especially when it \ncomes to some of the most vulnerable members of our communities--low \nincome children. These kids deserve quality dental care. Right now, too \nmany kids are suffering. It is my hope that Congress will work on a \nbipartisan basis to promote greater oral health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. \n        Jeffords):\n  S. 972. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nelectric reliability, enhance transmission infrastructure, and to \nfacilitate access to the electric transmission grid; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill add stability to the Nation's electric power grid. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senators, Breaux, Thompson, and Jeffords in this effort \nthat reflects a comprise that was reached last year by the investor \nowned and municipal electric power generators. Identical legislation \nhas been introduced in the House, H.R. 1459.\n  In the past year, there has been a great deal of controversy over the \nconcept of electric deregulation because of the chaos that has occurred \nin California. Unfortunately, California is not a useful model of a \nderegulated environment because California only deregulated the \nwholesale part of the industry while retaining price controls at the \nretail level. Coupled with the State's failure to build new generation \nin more than 10 years, the California model was bound to collapse.\n  However, I believe that the successes we have seen in deregulating \nelectricity, most notably in states like Pennsylvania, suggest that \nultimately the entire industry will be deregulated and consumers of \nelectric power will see significant benefits from such deregulation. In \norder to facilitate the day when competition comes to the industry, we \nmust update the tax laws that were written in day when electricity was \na regulated utility.\n  One of the major problems that the current tax rules create is to \nundermine the efficiency of the entire electric system in a deregulated \nenvironment because these rules effectively preclude public power \nentities from participating in State open access restructuring plans, \nwithout jeopardizing the exempt status of their bonds.\n  No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become \nretroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in \na state open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial \nmarkets and could undermine the financial stability of many \nmunicipalities.\n  Our legislation resolves this problem by allowing municipal systems \nto elect to terminate the issuance of new tax exempt bonds for \ngeneration facilities in return for grandfathering existing bonds.\n  Our bill also modifies current rules regarding the treatment of \nnuclear decommissioning costs to make certain that utilities will have \nthe resources to meet future costs and clarifies the tax treatment of \nthe funds, if a nuclear facility is sold. The bill also provides tax \nrelief for utilities that spin off or sell transmission facilities to \nindependent participants in FERC approved regional transmission \norganizations.\n  This bill will not resolve all of the tax issues surrounding the \nderegulation of the industry. One participant in the industry, the tax-\nexempt cooperatives also have tax problems associated with \nderegulation--they may not participate in wheeling power through their \nlines because of concern that they will violate the so-called 85-15 \ntest which could endanger their tax exempt status. It is my hope that \nthe coops will sit down with the other utilities and reach an accord so \nthat when we consider this legislation, the coops will be included in \nthe tax bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 973. A bill to expedite relief provided under the Magnuson-Stevens \nFishery Conservation and Management Act for commercial fishery failure \nin the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery, to improve fishery management \nand enforcement in that fishery, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by my good \nfriend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Smith, in introducing the \nPacific Coast Commercial Fishery Preservation Act of 2001.\n  The West Coast groundfish fishery is in crisis, and many fishermen \nare facing bankruptcy. This legislation will help fishermen get through \nthe crisis, and move the fishery toward a more sustainable future.\n  Sustainable management of this resource is long overdue and in \nJanuary 2000, the Secretary of Commerce declared the West Coast \ngroundfish fishery a disaster. This bill will put the right number of \nfishers out there, at the right time, catching the right number of \nfish.\n  Catching the right number of fish should mean using the fish that are \ncaught. Fish that are caught in excess of a fisher's trip limit are \ncalled ``regulatory discards'' or ``overages,'' and thousands of pounds \nof fish are wasted every year when they are thrown overboard. This bill \nauthorizes fishermen to retain those extra fish and donate them to \ncharitable organizations.\n  The right number of fishers is key to a sustainable fishery. There \nare currently too many fishers in the West Coast groundfish fishery to \nsustain the resource. This bill authorizes the Secretary to administer \nand implement a\n\n[[Page S5705]]\n\ncapacity reduction or ``buyback'' plan to ease the transition to the \nright number of fishers. In a survey distributed by the author of the \nbuyback plan, 70 percent of recipients completed and returned their \nsurvey and a majority of them were interested in participating in the \nbuyback program. A buyback plan has been developed by Oregonians, in \nconsultation with the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Pacific \nFishery Management Council, and this bill incorporates key elements of \nit.\n  This is not a Federal handout. Half the funding will come from the \nindustry and half from the Federal government. The industry portion \nwill be a government-backed loan which will be repaid by the fishers \nwho stay. The Secretary is authorized to enter into agreements in \nCalifornia, Washington and Oregon to collect the fees that will be used \nto repay the industry portion of the buyback fund.\n  Another way we seek to ease the transition away from fishing is \nthrough reform of the Capital Construction Fund. Currently, the fund \nallows fishers to put pre-tax funds aside for the construction of a new \nboat, or for upgrading their old one. It was effective in building \nAmerica's fishing fleets, but in these days of dwindling stocks and \nfisheries disasters it is crucial that the fisheries have an \nalternative use for their money, such as retirement. This bill amends \nthe Merchant Marine Act and the Internal Revenue Code to allow funds \ncurrently trapped in the Capital Construction Fund to be rolled over \ninto a retirement account without adverse consequences to either \ntaxpayers or the account holders.\n  Ultimately, sustainable fisheries are a result of government \nregulation and management. When federal management fails, the \ngovernment has a responsibility to help fishers and their families in a \ntimely fashion. It has taken 18 months for the recent fishery disaster \nfunding to hit Oregon. When you are an out-of-work groundfisher, 18 \nmonths is way too long to wait. This bill requires the Secretary of \nCommerce to recommend legislative or administrative changes to the \nexisting law that would enable disaster funding to reach fishers more \nexpeditiously.\n  This plan is supported by the West Coast Seafood Processors, the \nFishermen's Marketing Association, the Pacific Federation of Fishermen, \nthe Pacific Conservation Council, and the Pacific States Marine \nFisheries Commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 973\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pacific Coast Groundfish \n     Fishery Preservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2 PILOT PROJECT FOR CHARITABLE DONATION OF BYCATCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Commerce shall initiate a \n     pilot project under which fishermen in a commercial fishery \n     covered by the West Coast groundfish fishery are permitted to \n     donate bycatch, or regulatory discards, of fish to charitable \n     organizations rather than discard them. The pilot project \n     shall incorporate a means, through the requirement of on-\n     vessel observers or other safeguards, of ensuring that the \n     opportunity to donate such fish does not encourage or permit \n     the evasion of pre-vessel trip limits, total allowable catch \n     limits, or other fishery management plan measures.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) Initiation.--The Secretary shall notify the Senate \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, within 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act and before the \n     pilot project is implemented, of--\n       (A) the fishing season in which the pilot project will be \n     conducted; and\n       (B) the period during which the pilot project will be \n     conducted.\n       (2) Follow-up.--Within 90 days after the pilot project \n     terminates the Secretary shall submit to the Committee a \n     report containing findings with respect to the pilot project \n     and the Secretary's analysis of the ramifications of the \n     pilot project based on those findings.\n\n     SEC. 3. REPORT ON DISASTER ASSISTANCE FOR PACIFIC COAST \n                   GROUNDFISH FISHERY.\n\n       The Secretary shall report to the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation no later than 45 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act the action or actions \n     taken under section 312(a) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \n     Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1861a(a)) to \n     provide disaster relief to fishing communities affected by \n     the commercial fishery failure in the Pacific Coast \n     groundfish fishery.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of pharmacist services under part B of the \nMedicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to introduce \nlegislation, known as the Medicare Pharmacist Services Coverage Act, \nthat will provide for important patient safety and health care quality \nimprovements in the Medicare program. This legislation will reform \nMedicare by recognizing qualified pharmacists as health care providers \nwithin the Medicare program and make available to beneficiaries \nimportant drug therapy management services that these valuable health \nprofessionals can and do provide. These services, which are coordinated \nin direct collaboration with physicians and other health care \nprofessionals as authorized by State law, help patients make the best \npossible use of their medications.\n  The members of this body know very well the vital role that today's \npowerful and effective medications play in the maintenance of health \nand well-being of our nation's seniors. The substantial and important \ndiscussion now underway on how best to craft and implement a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries is an explicit \nrecognition of this vital role. But access to the medications, even at \nthe most affordable prices possible, is only one part of the equation \nin achieving the kinds of health care outcomes that patients and their \nhealth care providers desire. That is where today's pharmacists play a \npivotal role.\n  But members of this body may not be as aware of the tremendous \nchanges in pharmacy practice and education that have taken place in the \npast decade that have resulted in an expansion of pharmacists' \ncapabilities and responsibilities. Fortunately for my office Dr. Brian \nKaatz, a clinical pharmacist and faculty member of the College of \nPharmacy at South Dakota State University was able to spend 6 months \nwith us here in Washington last year as we studied and evaluated the \nmany policy issues and concerns related to a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. In the course of that time it became clear to me and to \nmembers of my staff that pharmacists are critical in assuring safer and \nmore effective medication use by our nation's seniors.\n  In addition to the important and continuing responsibility for \nassuring accurate, safe medication dispensing, compounding, and \ncounseling, pharmacists now provide a much more comprehensive range of \nclinical, consultative, and educational services. Thirty States, the \nVeterans Administration, and the Indian Health Service, among others, \nall recognize the value of collaborative drug therapy management \nservices as a way to provide optimal\n\n[[Page S5707]]\n\npatient care using the specialized education and training of \npharmacists. Unfortunately, Medicare does not.\n  Indeed, payment for prescription drugs in almost all types of health \nplans and programs focuses on payment for the product and the \nassociated costs of its distribution to patients. The logical financial \nincentive therefore is to dispense more medications, not fewer. Payment \nto the pharmacist for time spent in reducing the number of medications \nthe patient is taking or enhancing the patient's ability to understand \nand more properly use the medications they do need is provided only by \nsome forward-thinking payers and programs. Unfortunately, Medicare is \nnot among them.\n  Access to pharmacists' collaborative drug therapy management services \nis particularly important right now, while many Medicare beneficiaries \nare struggling to pay substantial out-of-pocket costs for their \nprescription medications. On average, persons aged 65 and older \ncurrently take 5 or more medications each day. These medications are \noften prescribed by several different physicians for concurrent chronic \nand acute conditions. Recently published research has indicated that \ndrug-related problems cost the U.S. health care system as much as $177 \nbillion each year, an amount equal to the ten-year cost projections for \nsome of the more modest Medicare prescription drug coverage proposals \nnow being discussed. A substantial portion of this expense is \npreventable through collaborative patient care services provided by \npharmacists working with patients and their physicians.\n  With careful examination of a patient's total drug regimen, \npharmacists can eliminate unnecessary or counterproductive treatments. \nFor example, pharmacists working closely with the health care team can \nidentify or prevent duplicate medications, drugs that cancel each other \nout, or combinations that can damage hearts or kidneys. Pharmacists may \nalso find that a newer multi-action drug may be exchanged for two older \ndrugs or a slightly more expensive drug may be substituted for a less \nexpensive alternative that causes side effects and results in the \npatient either taking additional medication or stopping their \nmedication with the result that their medical condition worsens.\n  The overuse of medications is particularly common in the elderly, who \ntend to have more chronic conditions that call for drug treatment. In \naddition, physiological changes that occur naturally in the aging \nprocess diminish the body's ability to process medications, increasing \nthe likelihood of medication-related complications.\n  The pharmacist's specialized training in drug therapy management has \nbeen demonstrated repeatedly to improve the quality of care patients \nreceive and to control health care costs associated with medication \ncomplications. As a precursor to a prescription drug benefit, it makes \nsense to take this proven initial step to improve the medication use \nprocess. This will help Medicare beneficiaries immediately by ensuring \nthat each precious dollar spent out-of-pocket is spent wisely on a \nstreamlined and effective drug therapy regimen. This is an important \nbenefit that we can deliver now while Congress works to address the \nmore difficult economic and political issues impacting a prescription \ndrug benefit.\n  In addition, the quality improvement and cost-control resulting from \nthis benefit establishes a critical infrastructure element for whatever \nMedicare prescription drug benefit is ultimately put in place. By \nsupporting pharmacists who are working to improve the efficacy and \ncost-effectiveness of medication regimens, as well as reducing \npreventable medication-related complications and adverse drug events \nthat result in unnecessary health care expenditures, we can enhance the \nprospects of achieving an affordable Medicare drug benefit that will \nbring real value to beneficiaries and taxpayers alike.\n  Recognition of qualified pharmacists as providers within the Medicare \nprogram is the logical and very affordable first step in establishing \nthe essential infrastructure of a Medicare prescription drug benefit. \nAs the Institute of Medicine report ``To Err is Human: Building a Safer \nHealth System'' stated: ``Because of the immense variety and complexity \nof medications now available, it is impossible for nurses and doctors \nto keep up with all of the information required for safe medication \nuse. The pharmacist has become an essential resource . . . and thus \naccess to his or her expertise must be possible at all times.'' This \nlegislation will empower Medicare to catch up on this important health \ncare quality issue. Pharmacists' collaborative drug therapy management \nservices can and will make a real difference in the lives of Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \ngive this proposal their serious consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Levin, \n        Mr. Specter, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 975. A bill to improve environmental policy by providing \nassistance for State and tribal land use planning, to promote improved \nquality of life, regionalism, and sustainable economic development, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Community \nCharacter Act of 2001, together with Senators Bennett, Specter, \nJeffords, Cleland, Levin, Bingaman, and Lieberman. This legislation \nprovides Federal assistance to States and Indian tribes to create or \nupdate statewide or tribal land use planning legislation. Up-to-date \nplanning legislation empowers States and local governments to spur \neconomic development, protect the environment, coordinate \ntransportation and infrastructure needs, and preserve our communities.\n  America has grown from East to West, as well as from an urban setting \nto suburban one. The Nation's sweeping growth can be attributed to many \nthings, including a strong economy and transportation and technology \nadvancements that allow people to live greater distances from work. Due \nin part to inadequate planning, strip malls and retail development \ncatering to the automobile have become the trademark of the American \nlandscape.\n  In the wake of the post-World War II building boom, my hometown of \nWarwick, RI had experienced the type of development that too often \noffends the eye and saps our economic strength. Due to a lack of \nplanning, incremental and haphazard development occurred through a \nmixture of incompatible zoning decisions. Industrial and commercial \nfacilities and residential homes were frequently and inappropriately \nsited next to each other. The local newspaper described the city as a \n``suburban nightmare''. However, we learned that proper approaches to \nplanning would help every state meet its challenges, whether it is \npreserving limited open space in the East or protecting precious \ndrinking water supplies in the West.\n  The Community Character Act will benefit each community and \nneighborhood by providing $25 million per year to States and tribes for \nthe purpose of land use planning. The bill recognizes that land use \nplanning is appropriately vested at the state and local levels, and \naccords States and tribes flexibility in using their money. \nImportantly, the legislation also recognizes that the Federal \nGovernment should play a role in financing these activities. Through \nenactment of transportation, housing, environmental, energy, and \neconomic development laws and requirements, Congress has created a \ndemand for state and local planning. In fact, the Community Character \nAct should be viewed as providing the federal payment for an unfunded \nmandate whose account is overdue.\n  The Senators who have sponsored this bill represent geographically \ndiverse states, from Rhode Island to New Mexico and from Georgia to \nUtah. This bipartisan bill represents a small investment in our \ncommunities, but one that will yield large dividends to communities in \neach corner of the nation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a summary of the \nbill, and letters of support for the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 975\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S5708]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

Up-to-\n     date statewide planning statutes and guidelines will allow \n     state and local governments to meet future growth demands \n     while preserving the economic, natural, cultural, and \n     historic resources of our communities.\n\n\n                           section by section\n\n     Section 1\n       Short Title.--the Community Character Act of 2001.\n     Section 2\n       Provides Congressional findings regarding the benefits of \n     planning at the State, local, and tribal levels.\n     Section 3\n       Provides definitions of key terms in the legislation. \n     ``Land use planning legislation'' is defined as a statute, \n     regulation, executive order or other action taken by a State \n     or tribal government to guide, regulate, or assist in the \n     planning, regulation, and management of environmental \n     resources, public works infrastructure, regional economic \n     development, and development practices and other activities \n     related to the pattern and scope of future land use.\n     Section 4\n       This section authorizes the Economic Development \n     Administration to establish a program to provide grants to \n     States and tribal governments on a competitive basis for the \n     development or revision of land use planning legislation. \n     States and tribal governments are eligible for grants if \n     their land use planning activities promotes certain elements, \n     such as environmental protection, public works \n     infrastructure, and sustainable economic development.\n       States and tribes that receive these grants may use them to \n     develop or revise land use planning legislation, conduct \n     research and development relating to land use plans, or \n     funding to local governments to carry out land use planning \n     activities consistent with state planning legislation. This \n     section also provides for local government pilot projects \n     related to land use planning.\n       The bill provides $25 million each year for fiscal years \n     2002-2006 and caps grants at $ 1 million ($1.1 million if \n     funding local pilot projects), subject to a 10 percent match. \n     Five percent of the annual authorization is set aside for \n     tribal governments to the extent that there are sufficient \n     eligible applications.\n     Section 5\n       This section authorizes the Economic Development \n     Administration to provide voluntary educational and \n     informational programs for the use of State, local, and \n     tribal land use planning and zoning officials. The bill \n     authorizes $1 million per year for five years for this \n     purpose.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Planning Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: The American Planning Association is \n     pleased to endorse the Community Character Act of 2001. APA \n     is heartened by the introduction of this legislation and the \n     assistance it would provide to the numerous states and \n     communities struggling with the consequences of change, \n     whether it be growth and development or economic decline. \n     This legislation recognizes that the federal government can, \n     and should, be a constructive partner with those communities \n     seeking innovative solutions to improving local quality of \n     life through better planning and land use. APA, with more \n     than 30,000 members, is the largest private organization \n     working to promote planning for communities that effectively \n     meets the needs of our people, now and in the future.\n       Planning is the single most effective way to deal with \n     growth issues facing states and communities. Passage of the \n     Community Character Act is among the most important and \n     beneficial things Congress could do to help promote local \n     solutions to such pressing issues as downtown revitalization, \n     traffic congestion, urban sprawl and open space protection.\n       This legislation responds to widespread citizen interest in \n     smart growth by providing critical resources to help state \n     and local political leaders, business and environmental \n     interests, and others manage change. In a recent national \n     voter survey, APA found that an overwhelming majority of \n     Americans, regardless of political affiliation, geographic \n     locale, or demographic group, believe Congress should take \n     action to support state and local smart growth initiatives. \n     Seventy-eight percent of those surveyed believe it is \n     important for the 107th Congress to help communities solve \n     problems associated with urban growth. Moreover, three-\n     quarters of voters also support providing incentives to help \n     promote smart growth and improve planning.\n       The Community Character Act provides vital assistance to \n     meet the serious challenge of reforming outdated planning \n     statutes and supporting planning as the basis for smart \n     growth. Currently, more than half the states are still \n     operating under planning statutes devised in the 1920s. And, \n     even in those states with updated planning laws, communities \n     are struggling to find and implement tools to grow smarter \n     and in ways consistent with the values and vision of the \n     citizens. Thus far in 2001, twenty-seven governors have \n     initiated some type smart growth proposals and there is \n     pending legislative or executive activity related to \n     planning, growth and land use in twenty-two states. This if \n     happening in states as diverse as Oklahoma and New York, \n     Montana and Massachusetts.\n       We believe this bill will support an array of state, \n     regional and local efforts to promote improved quality of \n     life, economic development and community livability through \n     better planning. Grants could be used to obtain technical \n     assistance and support for a state's review and \n     implementation of growth and planning laws. Activities such \n     as researching and drafting state policies, conducting \n     workshops, holding public forums, promoting regional \n     cooperation and supporting state planning initiatives would \n     qualify for federal assistance. We also believe provisions \n     allowing grants for acquiring new information technology to \n     facilitate planning, pilot projects to support innovative \n     planning at the local level and the development of technical \n     assistance programs through the Economic Development \n     Administration would provide important and needed assistance \n     for local governments and communities.\n       This legislation promotes smart growth principles and \n     encourages states to create or update the framework necessary \n     for good planning. It creates a federal partnership with \n     communities through incentives, not mandates. The bill does \n     not mandate that states implement specific changes but rather \n     seeks to support and inform that process once it is underway. \n     This program is a modest investment that will bring \n     substantial dividends in improving the livability of cities, \n     towns, and neighborhoods throughout the nation.\n       The American Planning Association applauds your outstanding \n     leadership and vision in introducing the Community Character \n     Act and urges the Senate to enact this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Bruce McClendon,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                   National Association of Realtors,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: On behalf of its more than 760,000 \n     members, the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS (NAR) \n     supports your introduction of the Community Character Act, \n     which provide grants to assist state governments in \n     developing or updating their land use planning legislation.\n       NAR supports this bill because it:\n       Recognizes that land use planning is rightfully a State and \n     local government function;\n       Provides needed assistance to states and localities to \n     better plan for inevitable growth;\n       Requires that planning performed under this Act must \n     provide for housing opportunity and choice and promote \n     affordable housing;\n       Promotes improved quality of life, sustainable economic \n     development, and protection of the environment.\n       In adopting our Smart Growth principles, NAR recognized \n     that property owners, homebuyers, and REALTORS have \n     a great deal\n\n[[Page S5710]]\n\n     at stake in the debate over livability and growth. \n     REALTORS are outspoken advocates for policies that \n     preserve housing choice and affordability while protecting \n     and improving the quality of the life of our communities.\n       It is our experience that when communities have not planned \n     for growth, they may overreact to growth pressures by \n     adopting excessive regulations that distort real estate \n     markets and make homeownership less attainable. Planning in \n     advance to accommodate growth and protect the quality of life \n     is the better approach, and the Community Character Act would \n     promote this needed planning.\n       We commend your efforts in introducing the Community \n     Character Act and we look forward to working with you toward \n     its adoption.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Lee L.

Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Chair Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk \n         Assessment, Committee on Environment and Public Works,\n     Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: I am writing to advise you of the \n     Trust for Public Land's unqualified support for the Community \n     Character Act of 2001.\n       The legislation you are introducing today will provide \n     communities across the nation with an important and adaptive \n     new tool to address the land-use challenges they face. More \n     than ever, states and localities are seeking innovative ways \n     to balance their economic development and environmental \n     protection needs. The Community Character Act will provide \n     much-needed support to the many state and local jurisdictions \n     working to craft this vital balance through their land-use \n     planning processes. This visionary bill aptly recognizes the \n     inextricable links between public infrastructure, private \n     development, and open space preservation, and its \n     competitive-grant approach will allow for appropriate \n     incentive-based federal assistance to state and local \n     planning efforts. The Trust for Public Land particularly \n     appreciates the on-the-ground successes your legislation will \n     spawn through local pilot projects; the inclusion of tribal \n     governments as eligible grant recipients, and the benefits \n     these funds will afford to Indian land management; and the \n     broader effects that enhanced land-use planning will bring to \n     the American landscape.\n       We look forward to timely enactment of the Community \n     Character Act, and to hearing from you as to how we might be \n     of assistance in your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Alan Front,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Smart Growth America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 24, 2001.\n     Hon. Lincoln Chafee,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: Smart Growth America would like to \n     commend you on the introduction of the Community Character \n     Act of 2001. We support both the bill and your efforts to \n     assist states, multi-state regions and tribal governments in \n     their efforts to revise their land use planning legislation \n     and develop comprehensive plans.\n       Planning for future growth and directing development so \n     that it strengthens existing communities while building upon \n     their physical, cultural and historical assets is integral to \n     smart growth. We applaud your foresight and willingness to \n     help these entities in their ongoing efforts to achieve smart \n     growth by coordinating transportation, housing and education \n     infrastructure investments while conserving historic, scenic \n     and natural resources.\n       The Community Character Act makes the federal government a \n     partner with states, regions and tribal governments that want \n     to plan for future growth. We thank you for your leadership \n     and look forward to working with you to pass this timely \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Don Chen,\n                                                         Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 976. A bill to provide authorization and funding for the \nenhancement of ecosystems, water supply, and water quality of the State \nof California, to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, yesterday Congressman Ken Calvert from \nRiverside, CA, and I held a press conference so each of us could \nintroduce a bill, Mr. Calvert in the House and I in the Senate.\n  This bill I am going to introduce today for reference to committee \naddresses a very complicated and complex problem in California, and \nthat is water. It is my very strong belief that the energy crisis that \nwe see taking place in California is a forerunner of what is going to \nhappen with water.\n  The only question is when. California has a population of 34 million \npeople. It is bigger than 21 other States and the District of Columbia \nput together. It is expected to grow to 50 million in 20 years.\n  Our State has the same water infrastructure that it had in 1970 when \nwe were about 16 million people, and every year California grows from \n700,000 to 1 million people. It was 800,000 this past year.\n  We are the sixth largest economy, not in the Nation, but in the \nworld. We are the No. 1 agricultural producing State in the Nation. We \nare the leading producer of dairy products, wine and grapes, \nstrawberries, almonds, lettuce, tomatoes, and the list goes on and on. \nAll of these need water.\n  We are a growing high-tech State with an increasing need for access \nto high-quality water. We have more endangered species than any other \nState except Hawaii. And, of course, California, again, has this large \npopulation. Our water needs are tremendous. So we need to get ready for \nthe future, and we need to do this in an environmentally sensitive way.\n  If there is one lesson we can learn from California's energy crisis, \nit is that the time to address a crisis is not while it is happening \nbut before it happens. California is now struggling to build more \npowerplants while also doing everything possible to reduce demand \nthrough increased efficiency and conservation. But because we started \nso late, we are likely going to have some serious problems this summer, \nand that is why it is even more important that we fix the water problem \nbefore it, too, becomes a crisis.\n  Ecosystem restoration, water conservation, and improved efficiency \ncan be combined with new environmentally responsible off-stream \nstorage. This would allow us to improve the ecosystem and store water \nfrom the wet years and use it in the dry years to benefit people, the \nenvironment, and farmers.\n  I began writing this bill last December with the aim of finding \nsomething to which all of the major stakeholders could agree--the large \nurban water users, the city of San Jose, the city of Los Angeles, San \nDiego, San Francisco, all of the agricultural water contractors, and a \nmyriad of environmental leaders.\n  I have come to the conclusion that it is impossible, after 7 years of \ntrying, to get them all on the same page, let alone the same line. So \neither we do nothing and sit back and wait for a water crisis or we try \nto do the moderate, the prudent, and the effective thing.\n  The bill I am sending to the desk for reference to committee is a 7-\nyear authorization bill. It essentially authorizes the record of \ndecision of a program known as CALFED. In California, there are two big \nwater projects. One is the Central Valley Water Project owned by the \nFederal Government. That is the Federal interest. The Federal \nGovernment built it and owns it. The other is the California Water \nProject owned by the State of California, built by Governor Pat Brown \nback in the 1960s.\n  This is, in essence, a State-Federal effort to improve the water \ninfrastructure, to clean up the ecosystems, and to begin to build an \ninfrastructure that can handle the demands of the next 50 years.\n  The bill authorizes the ecosystem restoration program, and it fully \nauthorizes all of the environmental projects listed in the record of \ndecision. This includes improving fish passages, restoring streams, \nrivers, and habitats, and improving water quality.\n\n  The bill authorizes 580,000 acre feet of water in the first year \nthrough the environmental water account, and the bill essentially \nauthorizes the first three storage projects, off-stream water storage, \nlisted in stage 1 of the record of decision: Enlarging the Los Vaqueros \nReservoir, subject to a vote of the people of Contra Costa County; \nraising Shasta Dam; and constructing the delta wetlands project which \ninvolves flooding two delta islands for storage and using the other two \nislands for ecosystem protection. The end result of these three storage \nprojects will be 2.3 million acre feet of new water storage.\n  Some reporting and financial analysis must still be completed. CALFED \nexpects these projects will have no adverse impacts, so we need to get \nstarted to make sure they can get in the line and get going.\n\n[[Page S5711]]\n\n  I do not believe we can meet all of our future water needs without \nincreased water storage, water storage that is environmentally benign, \nthat is off stream, and that provides flexibility in the system for us \nto increase water supply, improve water quality, and enhance ecosystem \nrestoration.\n  Recharging groundwater, water recycling and reuse, conservation, and \nsmarter use of the big pumps in the system are all tools we can use to \nhelp us meet our water needs.\n  I am concerned this may not even be enough. We live in an area, \nthough, where large new dams are extraordinarily controversial. So \nthere is one thing left, and that is to take water from the wet years \nand store it in an environmentally sound way to use during the dry \nyears.\n  The bill I am presenting is balanced. It says, in essence, that the \nstorage projects go ahead at the same time as the environmental \nprojects. I believe very strongly that we are not going to be able to \nsolve the problem just with environmental measures, that we need \nadditional water storage as well.\n  This is not a flash in the pan. I did not just arrive at this. A \nnative-born Californian, I have watched this for years and years, and \nfor the last 7 years in the Senate I have spent an enormous amount of \ntime--probably 50, 60 meetings--with the stakeholders on all sides of \nthis issue. It is my judgment that we must have this additional storage \nin addition to the ecosystems work.\n  It is not going to be a perfect bill. It is a big bill. It is a \nState-Federal partnership. In my view, water and energy are the two \nessentials that can keep the California economy alive and keep its \npeople flourishing. I hope it will have a favorable response in the \ncommittee and in this Chamber.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Burns, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Johnson, \n        and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 977. A bill to amend the Agricultural Market Transition Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Agriculture to make nonrecourse marketing \nassistance loans and loan deficiency payments available to producers of \ndry peas, lentils, and chickpeas; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Dry Pea, \nLentil, and Chickpea Marketing Assistance Loan Act,'' a bill to \nauthorize a marketing loan program and loan deficiency payments, or \nLDPs, for pulse crops which include peas, lentils, and chickpeas. I am \npleased that Senators Burns, Baucus, Cantwell, Conrad, Crapo, Daschle, \nDorgan, Johnson and Murray have joined as original cosponsors.\n  Pulses are grown across the northern tier of the United States. \nTraditionally pulses have been grown as a rotation crop that provides \nbenefit to the soil, by fixing nitrogen, breaking weed and disease \ncycles, and reducing the need for field burning. Dryland farmers in \nnorthern Idaho for years have rotated wheat, canola, and dry peas, \nlentils or chickpeas. As prices have dropped for all commodities, \nincluding pulses, we have seen a shift in production patterns which \nhave decreased the production of dry peas and lentils.\n  Current wheat prices are no better than dry pea prices, pound for \npound, but a banker will lend money to a grower of wheat and oilseeds \nbecause there is a loan program and LDP. The depressed markets have \nforced dryland farmers across the northen tier of the United States to \nabandon pulses in favor of traditional farm program crops like wheat, \noilseeds, and barley.\n  This bill attempts to remedy this situation by creating a loan rate \nfor dry peas, lentils, and chickpeas with support equivalent to the \nloan programs for spring wheat and canola. The bill mirrors existing \nstatutory authority for the loan programs established for other crops \nby creating floor prices based from 85 percent of a five-year Olympic \naverage. The approximate cost of the bill, and benefits to pulse \ngrowers, would be about $8.5 million annually.\n  When we passed the last farm bill, the goal was to have farmers farm \nthe land and not the programs. As prices have dropped, we are again \nseeing planting decisions made based on the programs available, which \nhas made pulse crops less attractive in a rotation. As we begin the \nprocess of reauthorizing the farm bill, we will work to make sure that \npulses are included so that farmers will be competitive with other \ncrops grown in the area.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of this \namendment to the Agricultural Market Transition Act. It would require \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to make nonrecourse marketing assistance \nloans and loan deficiency payments available to producers of dry peas, \nlentils, and chickpeas.\n  This amendment will go a long way toward giving producers of these \ncommodities an equal opportunity to obtain the same financial \nopportunities as other producers now receive.\n  We encourage our producers to grow what is often referred to as \nalternative crops. Producers have listened and they are successfully \nmarketing these crops. The actions of this bill will now provide these \ninnovative producers with the same economic benefits as producers of \nother crops. These farmers have dared to try something different and \nthe least we can do is support them for they're daring.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Allard, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, and Mr. Thomas):\n  S. 978. A bill to provide for improved management of, and increased \naccountability for, outfitted activities by which the public gains \naccess to and occupancy and use of Federal land, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today in \nconjunction with my colleagues, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Campbell, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Stevens, \nand Mr. Thomas, the Outfitter Policy Act of 2001.\n  This legislation is very similar to legislation I introduced in past \ncongresses. As that legislation did, this bill would put into law many \nof the management practices by which Federal land management agencies \nhave successfully managed the outfitter and guide industry on National \nForests, National Parks and other Federal lands over many decades.\n  The bill recognizes that many Americans want and seek out the skills \nand experience of commercial outfitters and guides to help them enjoy a \nsafe and pleasant journey.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act's primary purpose is to ensure accessibility \nto public lands by all segments of the population and maintain the \navailability of quality recreation services to the public. Outfitters \nand guides across the nation provide opportunities for outdoor \nrecreation for many families and groups who would otherwise find the \nbackcountry inaccessible.\n  Previous hearings and discussions on prior versions of this \nlegislation helped to refine the bill I am introducing today. This \nprocess provided the intended opportunity for discussion. As well as it \nallowed for the examination of the historical practices that have \noffered consistent, reliable outfitter services to the public.\n  Congress has twice addressed this issue with respect to the National \nPark System permits, originally establishing standards for Park Service \nadministration of guide/outfitter permits on their lands in 1965 and \namending that system in 1998. Therefore, it is appropriate to set \nsimilar legislative standards for other public land systems such as \nForest Service and Bureau of Land Management lands. However, these and \nother land management agencies are now without Congressional guidance, \nand instead rules, permit terms and conditions and other intricacies \nare often left to local agency personnel. The Outfitter Policy Act \nwould alleviate the discord involved in land management permitting, \nproviding consistent guidance on the administration of guide/outfitter \npermits for the other Federal land management agencies.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act provides the basic terms and conditions \nnecessary to sustain the substantial investment often needed to provide \nthe level of service demanded by the public. However, the bill provides \nthe agencies\n\n[[Page S5712]]\n\nample flexibility to adjust use, conditions, and permit terms. All of \nwhich must be consistent with agency management plans and policies for \nresource conservation. The Outfitter Policy Act strives to provide a \nstable, consistent regulatory climate which encourages qualified \nentrants to the guide/outfitting business, while giving the agencies \nand operators clear directions.\n  The Outfitter Policy Act is a measure that will facilitate access to \npublic lands by the outfitted public, while providing incentives to \noutfitters to provide the high quality services over time. It is \nnecessary to ensure that members of the public who need and rely on \nguides and outfitters for recreational access to public lands will \ncontinue to receive safe, quality services. I look forward to \nconsidering this legislation in the coming session of the 107th \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5712-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 95--DESIGNATING AUGUST 3, 2001, AS ``NATIONAL COURT \n                     REPORTING AND CAPTIONING DAY''\n\n  Mr. BREAUX submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President. Today I submit a resolution to recognize \nand support the United States Olympic Committee and the 2002 Olympic \nGames.\n  There are several reasons why I have a particular interest in the \nOlympic Movement and the U.S. Olympic Committee. I am the only Olympian \nin the United States Senate and Congressman Jim Ryan and I are the only \ntwo current Members of Congress to have been members of an Olympic \nTeam.\n  Years ago, I founded the U.S. Olympic Caucus with former Senator Bill \nBradley and former Congressman Tom McMillan. In addition, the United \nStates Olympic Committee is headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO, \nalong with the Olympic Training Center. Many athletes are currently \ntraining at that facility for future Olympic Games and especially in \npreparation for the 2002 Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, UT.\n  As I look back on the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan, I remember \nhow proud I was to be on the U.S. Olympic Team. Carrying the United \nStates flag in the closing ceremonies was one of the greatest \nexperiences of my life. I remember how proud I was to be an American \nand an Olympian. I hold that moment in my heart and relive it at each \nnew Olympic Games to this day.\n  The Olympic motto is ``Swifter, Higher, Stronger'' and with that \nideal, the Olympic Movement brings out the very best in all of us, \nathletes and spectators alike. I believe, along with the United States \nOlympic Committee, that competition and the athletes are the heart and \nsoul of the Olympic Movement. This is the reason that I offer this \nresolution today.\n  The United States Olympic Committee is to be highly commended for the \nprompt and decisive action it took after accusations of inappropriate \nsolicitations surfaced. It is also to be commended for establishing the \nfully independent, United States Anti Doping Agency, USADA, to address \nthe important issues of athlete doping detection, prevention and \neducation. USADA is also headquartered in Colorado Springs and is \nleading the way for world anti-doping measures.\n\n  I know how much good the games do for young men and women and for our \ncountry. I am convinced the United States Olympic Committee has done \neverything in its power to get to the bottom of allegations, punish \nthose who deserve it, and return the focus of the Olympic Movement back \nwhere it should be, with the athletes.\n  Most people don't realize that unlike many of the world's Olympic \nteams, the U.S. Olympic Team gets not one dime of Federal money to \nsubsidize its sports operations. Our Olympic Team is solely supported \nby the contributions of millions of Americans and American businesses \nand corporations which are dedicated to the Olympic Movement.\n  The Olympic Movement will endure and prosper only by the continued \nvigilance and the ongoing commitment of organizers and supporters, and \nby our unwavering support of the athletes who are the future of the \nmodern Olympic Games.\n  As we begin the countdown towards the 2002 Olympic Games, my \nresolution would designate June 23, 2000, as Olympic Day in recognition \nof the anniversary of the founding of the modern Olympic Movement. I \nurge my colleagues to support prompt passage of this resolution.\n\n[[Page S5714]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5713-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5713-S5714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 99--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF THE OLYMPICS\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                               S.

Con. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas on December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy and \n     Air Force attacked units of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii;\n       Whereas 2,403 members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States were killed in the attack on Pearl Harbor;\n       Whereas there are more than 12,000 members of the Pearl \n     Harbor Survivors Association;\n       Whereas the 60th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor \n     will be December 7, 2001;\n       Whereas on August 23, 1994, Public Law 103-308 was enacted, \n     designating December 7 of each year as National Pearl Harbor \n     Remembrance Day; and\n       Whereas Public Law 103-308, reenacted as section 129 of \n     title 36, United States Code, requests the President to issue \n     each year a proclamation calling on the people of the United \n     States to observe National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities, and all departments, \n     agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government, \n     and interested organizations, groups, and individuals, to fly \n     the flag of the United States at half-staff each December 7 \n     in honor of the individuals who died as a result of their \n     service at Pearl Harbor: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress, on the occasion of the 60th \n     anniversary of the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor, \n     Hawaii, pays tribute to--\n       (1) the United States citizens who died in the attack; and\n       (2) the members of the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I rise today, with my colleague \nSenator Smith of New Hampshire, to submit a concurrent resolution \nhonoring the American servicemen who were attacked by the Japanese \nImperial Forces at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Senator Smith \nsubmitted a parallel resolution last year but has allowed me to take \nthe lead on this matter this year in light of the special significance \nof Pearl Harbor remembrance day to my family.\n  My uncle, Navy Ensign Edward Webb Gosselin, was among the 1,102 \nAmerican seamen killed aboard the battleship U.S.S. Arizona on December \n7, 1941.\n  Edward had enlisted in the Navy in September of 1940 and reported to \nhis first duty station, the Arizona, in May of 1941. He was 24 years \nold when he died. Edward had just graduated from Yale University and \nwas, in fact, the first Yale graduate to die in World War II.\n  The Navy later named a destroyer escort after Edward, and it was \nnamed the U.S.S. Gosselin.\n  Fittingly, after participating in the invasion of Okinawa, the \nGosselin had the honor of being the first American warship to enter \nJapanese waters upon that nation's surrender. The Gosselin also was the \nfirst ship to bring home American prisoners of war held in Japan. Many \nyears later, Edward's father, my grandfather, recounted the tremendous \npride he felt upon hearing the ships's name mentioned during radio \nbroadcasts of the surrender.\n  The resolution that Senator Smith and I introduce today reminds \nfederal departments and agencies to fly the United States flag at half/\nmast on December 7, and pays tribute to the United States citizens who \ndied in the Japanese raid on Pearl Harbor, and to the members of the \nPearl Harbor Survivors Association. I conclude by asking all of my \ncolleagues to join me this Memorial Day in remembering and honoring the \n2,403 American sailors and soldiers who were killed at Pearl Harbor, \nand all other Americans in uniform who have died serving their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/25/senate-section/article/S5714-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n subcommittee on national parks, historic preservation, and recreation\n\n  Mr. THOMAS.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE MODIFICATIONS TO THE \n                   CHILD TAX CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) There are over 12,000,000 children in poverty in the \n     United States--about 78 percent of these children live in \n     working families.\n       (2) The child tax credit was originally designed to benefit \n     families with children in recognition of the costs associated \n     with raising children.\n       (3) There are 15,400,000 children whose families would not \n     benefit from the doubling of the child tax credit unless it \n     is made refundable and another 7,000,000 children live in \n     families who will not receive an increased benefit under the \n     bill unless the credit is made refundable.\n       (4) A person who earns the Federal minimum wage and works \n     40 hours a week for 50 weeks a year earns approximately \n     $10,300.\n       (5) The provision included in section 201 would give \n     families with children the benefit of a partially refundable \n     child tax credit based on 15 cents of their income for every \n     dollar earned above $10,000.\n       (6) For a family earning $15,000 that is an additional $750 \n     to help make ends meet.\n       (7) Doubling the child tax credit to $1,000 and making it \n     partially refundable will benefit over 37,000,000 families \n     with dependent children.\n       (8) The expansion of the child tax credit included in \n     section 201 is a meaningful and a responsible effort on the \n     part of the Senate to address the needs of low income working \n     families to promote work and such an expansion would provide \n     the benefit of a child tax credit to 10,700,000 more children \n     than the provision passed by the House of Representatives.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the ``10-15'' child tax credit provision included in \n     section 201 is a worthy start, and should be maintained as \n     part of the final package.\n\n     SEC. 203.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and their employees to reach and maintain \n     agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and working \n     conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts through \n     negotiations to settle their differences by mutual agreement \n     reached through collective bargaining or by such methods as \n     may be provided for in any applicable agreement for the \n     settlement of disputes.\n       (3) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n\n     SEC. 3.

\n     or\n       (B) otherwise discriminate against a bidder, offeror, \n     contractor, or subcontractor because such bidder, offeror, \n     contractor, or subcontractor--\n       (i) became a signatory, or otherwise adhered to, an \n     agreement with 1 or more labor organization with respect to \n     that construction project or another related construction \n     project; or\n       (ii) refused to become a signatory, or otherwise adhere to, \n     an agreement with 1 or more labor organization with respect \n     to that construction project or another related construction \n     project.\n       (2) Application of prohibition.--The provisions of this \n     section shall not apply to contracts awarded prior to the \n     date of enactment of this Act, and subcontracts awarded \n     pursuant to such contracts regardless of the date of such \n     subcontracts.\n       (3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in paragraph (1) shall \n     be construed to prohibit a contractor or subcontractor from \n     voluntarily entering into an agreement described in such \n     paragraph.\n       (b) Recipients of Grants and Other Assistance.--The head of \n     each executive agency that awards grants, provides financial \n     assistance, or enters into cooperative agreements for \n     construction projects after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, shall ensure that--\n       (1) the bid specifications, project agreements, or other \n     controlling documents for such construction projects of a \n     recipient of a grant or financial assistance, or by the \n     parties to a cooperative agreement, do not contain any of the \n     requirements or prohibitions described in subparagraph (A) or \n     (B) of subsection (a)(1); or\n       (2) the bid specifications, project agreements, or other \n     controlling documents for such construction projects of a \n     construction manager acting on behalf of a recipient or party \n     described in paragraph (1), do not contain any of the \n     requirements or prohibitions described in subparagraph (A) or \n     (B) of subsection (a)(1)\n       (c) Failure To Comply.--If an executive agency, a recipient \n     of a grant or financial assistance from an executive agency, \n     a party to a cooperative agreement with an executive agency, \n     or a construction manager acting on behalf of such an agency, \n     recipient or party, fails to comply with subsection (a) or \n     (b), the head of the executive agency awarding the contract, \n     grant, or assistance, or entering into the agreement, \n     involved shall take such action, consistent with law, as the \n     head of the agency determines to be appropriate.\n       (d) Exemptions.--\n       (1) Special circumstances.--\n       (A) In general.--The head of an executive agency may exempt \n     a particular project, contract, subcontract, grant, or \n     cooperative agreement from the requirements of 1 or more of \n     the provisions of subsections (a) and\n\n[[Page S5759]]\n\n     (b) if the head of such agency determines that special \n     circumstances exist that require an exemption in order to \n     avert an imminent threat to public health or safety or to \n     serve the national security.\n       (B) Definition.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), a \n     finding of ``special circumstances'' may not be based on the \n     possibility or existence of a labor dispute concerning \n     contractors or subcontractors that are nonsignatories to, or \n     that otherwise do not adhere to, agreements with 1 or more \n     labor organization, or labor disputes concerning employees on \n     the project who are not members of, or affiliated with, a \n     labor organization.\n       (2) Additional exemption for certain projects.--The head of \n     an executive agency, upon the application of an awarding \n     authority, a recipient of grants or financial assistance, a \n     party to a cooperative agreement, or a construction manager \n     acting on behalf of any of such entities, may exempt a \n     particular project from the requirements of any or all of the \n     provisions of subsections (a) or (c), if the agency head \n     finds--\n       (A) that the awarding authority, recipient of grants or \n     financial assistance, party to a cooperative agreement, or \n     construction manager acting on behalf of any of such entities \n     had issued or was a party to, as of the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, bid specifications, project agreements, \n     agreements with one or more labor organizations, or other \n     controlling documents, with respect to that particular \n     project, which contained any of the requirements or \n     prohibitions set forth in subsection (a)(1);

Res. 94\n\n       Whereas the House and Senate have passed measuresthat will \n     expedite the long-overdue memorial commemorating the \n     sacrifices of those who fought and died in World War II;\n       Whereas with the completion of the World War II Memorial, \n     there will be memorials in the capital of our Nation for each \n     of the major conflicts of the last century;\n       Whereas approximately 650 members of the Armed Services \n     have been killed in hostile action since the end of the \n     Vietnam War;\n       Whereas the circumstances surrounding these deaths have \n     been characterized both by large scale conflicts and a number \n     of smaller incidents and actions which have received little \n     attention;\n       Whereas the sacrifice of these men and women is held as \n     dearly by their fellow citizens as the sacrifice of those \n     claimed by earlier struggles; and\n       Whereas the loss of these men and women stands in testament \n     to the risks undertaken by all members of the Armed Services \n     each day as they carry out their duty to support and defend \n     the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to designate May 28, 2001, as a special day for \n     recognizing the sacrifice of the members of the Armed Forces \n     killed in hostile action since the end of the Vietnam War, \n     and the sacrifices of the families of the members;\n       (2) to make the designation under paragraph (1) on May 28, \n     2001, in light of the traditional Memorial Day recognition of \n     the veterans of the United States who have given their lives \n     in defense of our Nation;\n       (3) to recognize that we live in a time of international \n     unrest and that military service in such a time is inherently \n     dangerous and requires the willingness to face the most \n     extreme hazards at unexpected times and places; and\n       (4) to acknowledge that the people of the United States owe \n     a debt of gratitude to all members of the Armed Services who \n     place themselves in harm's way each day, and to their \n     families.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Republic of Korea over many \n     years has provided aid to the Korean automotive industry \n     enabling that industry to develop into the fourth largest \n     automotive industry in the world, after the United States, \n     Japan, and the European Union;\n       Whereas the domestic automotive market of the Republic of \n     Korea was completely closed to all international automotive \n     manufacturers until 1990, and not completely open to all \n     automotive manufacturers until 1999;\n       Whereas in response to complaints by the United States that \n     the Government of the Republic of Korea was practicing unfair \n     trade in the automotive sector, and that there was continuing \n     anti-import bias and increasing disparity in market access \n     for foreign motor vehicles, the Government of Korea signed \n     two Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) with the United States \n     in 1995 and 1998 in an effort to help increase foreign motor \n     vehicle access to the Korean automotive market;\n       Whereas in the 1998 MOU, the Government of the Republic of \n     Korea pledged specifically to simplify its tax regime in a \n     manner that enhanced market access for foreign motor \n     vehicles, improve the perception of foreign motor vehicles in \n     Korea, simplify and streamline Korea's type-approval system \n     procedures for foreign motor vehicles and other standards \n     issues, and establish a mortgage system for motor vehicles;\n       Whereas 3 years after signing the 1998 MOU, the Government \n     of the Republic of Korea has not substantially increased \n     market access for foreign motor vehicles and its motor \n     vehicle market still does not operate according to market \n     principles, as evidenced by the fact that the share of the \n     market held by foreign motor vehicles was lower in 2000 than \n     it was in 1998, and remains the lowest of any industrialized \n     nation;\n       Whereas 3 years after signing the 1998 MOU, the Government \n     of the Republic of Korea has not made sufficient advances in \n     simplifying its tax regime for motor vehicles or improving \n     the perception of foreign motor vehicles in Korea;\n       Whereas 3 years after signing the 1998 MOU, the Government \n     of the Republic of Korea has not taken the necessary steps to \n     implement the MOU fully and effectively, as evidenced by the \n     extraordinarily low foreign motor vehicle presence in Korea;\n       Whereas Korea is a major exporter of motor vehicles and \n     automotive parts to the United States, reaching over a total \n     value of $5,910,000,000 last year, compared to a total value \n     of $480,000,000 in United States motor vehicles and \n     automotive parts exported to Korea last year, resulting in a \n     total automotive trade deficit of $5,300,000,000;\n       Whereas the extremely low level of United States vehicle \n     sales in the Republic of Korea means that there is great \n     difficulty in selling United States made automotive \n     components, systems, and parts in Korea;\n       Whereas 1,057,620 motor vehicles were sold in the Republic \n     of Korea in 2000, only 4,414 (or 0.42 percent) were imported \n     and only 1,268 of those vehicles (or 0.12 percent) were made \n     in the United States;\n       Whereas one Korean auto maker maintains monopolistic \n     control of over 75 percent of Korea's domestic market; and\n       Whereas some Korean organizations and institutions continue \n     to support anticompetitive activities that perpetuate \n     entrenched commercial interests at the expense of free trade, \n     Korean consumers, and the overall Korean economy: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) believes strongly that an economically stable Republic \n     of Korea is in the best overall foreign policy and economic \n     interests of the United States;\n       (2) notes that past practices, such as protection from \n     international competition, preferential access to credit, low \n     interest loans, and the policy of providing assistance to \n     chaebols in general, and the automotive sector specifically, \n     contributed to the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis, \n     threatened the economic stability of the Republic of Korea \n     and undermined the relationship between the United States and \n     the Republic of Korea;\n       (3) believes that economic policies and practices \n     effectively limiting United States manufacturers' access to \n     the Korean automotive sector are inconsistent with the \n     general trend toward a market-oriented approach, and that the \n     relationship between the United States and the Republic of \n     Korea has been, and will continue to be, significantly harmed \n     by unfair treatment of imports of United States motor \n     vehicles;\n       (4) calls on the Republic of Korea to immediately end the \n     practices that have led to the disparity in market access, as \n     well as to take proactive steps to repair the damage done by \n     past policies and practices;\n       (5) calls on the Republic of Korea to meet the letter and \n     spirit of the commitments contained in the 1998 Memorandum of \n     Understanding it signed with the United States; and\n       (6) calls on the United States Trade Representative, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, and the Secretary of State to monitor \n     and report to Congress on the steps that have been taken to \n     end the disparity in market access for imported motor \n     vehicles in the Republic of Korea.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 767 (as modified)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title VIII add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Donald Cameron Findlay, of Illinois, to be Deputy \n     Secretary of Labor.\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF LORNE CRANER\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, one of the few benefits of growing old is \nwatching young people you've been privileged to know grow, both \npersonally and professionally. We would like to think that members of \nyounger generations who have become important and compassionate people \nhave done so because of us, that our wisdom has rubbed off on them, and \nthat the world is better off for it.\n  The world is better off for having Lorne Craner in it, but the credit \nis all Lorne's. I am happy that my former staff member and the \nPresident of the International Republican Institute, which I chair, now \nmoves to the State Department, where he will serve as Assistant \nSecretary for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. More importantly, \npersecuted masses around the world who are deprived of their rights and \nfreedoms, the right to choose what government represents them, the \nright to live and speak freely, and the right to organize for safe and \ndecent working conditions, have an important ally in Lorne.\n  America's foreign relations rightly reflect our belief that our most \nbasic values as a nation are universal values; and that citizens in \ndictatorships cherish these values as much as we do, despite what \ntyrannical leaders may do to subjugate them. Our values are contagious, \nwhich is why autocrats fear them so. Lorne has dedicated his career to \npromoting these values and advancing our national interest worldwide, \nto the benefit of many of its citizens.\n  Lorne served on my staff for 6 years in both the House and Senate and \nwas a wonderful asset to me. He was such a wonderful asset that \nPresident Bush and Secretary of State Baker tapped him to be Deputy \nAssistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs when they took \noffice. Lorne served with distinction in that job, and as Director for \nAsian Affairs on President Bush's National Security Council.\n  As Vice President and then President of the International Republican \nInstitute from 1993 until today, Lorne invigorated an organization \ncreated by President Reagan to shine the light of freedom upon the \ndarkest corners of the Earth. Lorne's vision and management of the \nInstitute, which operates in over 30 countries under sometimes trying \nconditions, have earned IRI the respect and gratitude of democrats from \nSerbia to South Africa, Cuba to Cambodia, and Azerbaijan to Zimbabwe. \nIn many countries, the struggle continues, while in others, ruling \ndemocrats speak glowingly of how IRI helped them set their people free. \nLorne and the IRI staff have been integral to these democratic \nadvances.\n  We have much to do yet as a country to improve human rights, labor \nrights, and political freedom overseas. As Secretary Powell's point man \non these critical issues, Lorne has his work cut out for him. But he is \nready. I am very proud of him, and I know his late father, my dear \nfriend, would be also.\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF STEPHEN BRAUER\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the nomination just confirmed, No. 145, \nStephen Brauer to be Ambassador to Belgium, is a great personal \npleasure for me. Stephen Brauer has been a terrific leader in the St. \nLouis community.
