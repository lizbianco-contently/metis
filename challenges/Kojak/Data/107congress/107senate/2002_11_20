Mr. President, let me begin by thanking you for \npresiding this morning, for your leadership in the Senate, and for the \nfriendship I think you epitomize when friendships are created, that \ngrow and take root, and that bloom in the Senate. I am proud to call \nyou a friend.\n  Let me say at the very outset that it has been an enormous privilege \nserving for the last 6 years in this great body.\n  I want to express my gratitude this morning, in the few minutes that \nI am going to take, to a number of individuals who mean a lot to me and \nmy service in the Senate.\n  I want to begin by expressing my gratitude to my wife Randi, who has \nbeen a great fellow mate, an encourager, a partner, and, most of all, \nmy best friend. I am so appreciative to have her here this morning. I \nwanted to express that.\n  I also want to thank Chaplain Ogilvie. I appreciate so much his \nprayer this morning, and his prayers every day--and more than the \nprayers that he offers for the Senate, the prayers that he offers for \nour country. But I am especially grateful for his friendship and for \nhis spiritual counsel that he offers to other Members. He is going to \nbe greatly missed in this institution, and I think the country is going \nto miss his service here.\n  While we all understand that he is making the right decision, he is \ngoing to be sorely missed. As I look back on the last 6 years, I thank \nyou, Lloyd, for the many hours that you gave to me in counsel and \nencouragement. And I am very appreciative and very grateful.\n  I also want to express my appreciation to people in the State of \nArkansas--the great State of Arkansas, all 2.7 million of them. I thank \nmy staff--not 2.7 million, but it seems like it sometimes.\n  I want to thank the people of Arkansas. I am forever grateful to them \nfor allowing me the privilege of serving them in the Senate. Of course, \nthose who are familiar with the State of Arkansas know that it is a \nvery diverse and very beautiful State from a physical standpoint, but \nit is also very different as you go to the various parts of it. I hail \nfrom northwest Arkansas. I come from the Ozark Hills--being a State \nlegislator for 8 years, representing a small district in northwest \nArkansas, being elected to Congress from the Third District, and coming \nto the Senate and serving the entire State of Arkansas has been an \nenormously gratifying experience. I have learned that not only are the \npeople wonderful and great in those hills of northwest Arkansas, but \nalso the people of the delta with their very different culture and very \ndifferent background from the Ozark Hills are wonderful people with \ntremendous values who love this country of ours as much as my native \narea in the northwest; or the opportunity to represent the one real \nurban area of Arkansas, Little Rock, our capital city. To be able to \nrepresent every area and every region of the State has been an \nenormously enriching experience--to work not only for the Ozark Hills \nbut for the Mississippi Delta, and our many vast areas.\n  I discovered the cultural diversity of my State, and I discovered \nthat there are great and wonderful people in every section of Arkansas.\n  It has been an experience that has far surpassed my wildest dreams \nand my greatest ambitions.\n  I thank the people of Arkansas for letting me walk in the footsteps \nof some great predecessors such as J.W. Fulbright, John McClellan, or \nthe individual whose portrait hangs just outside the Senate Chamber, \nJoe T. Robinson.\n  I thank the people of Arkansas.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues. What a great group--that I \nbelieve is dedicated to doing what they believe is right for America.\n  I served for 4 years in the House of Representatives. Oftentimes down \nin the House we would usually good-naturedly make fun of the Senate. So \nwhen I was elected to the Senate, I recall a number of them coming up \nand saying: We hope you enjoy your time down at the retirement home at \nthe other end of the Capitol. That was, of course, the kind of outlook \nthat we had down there; that this was the place where nothing got done, \nand everyone was a little older and a little slower down there. The \nrambunctiousness and sometimes wild passions that characterized the \ndebate in the House were not as evident in the Senate. But it is not a \nretirement home. People work immensely hard in this body.\n\n  But one of the things that has impressed me more the last 6 years is, \nin fact, the Senate works just as our Founding Fathers had planned for \nit to work; that of which Madison said, the popular passions would be \ncooled and tempered by the deliberative debates in the Senate.\n  So though sometimes we are frustrated and sometimes we call the \nSenate dysfunctional, the reality, in my mind, is, it works, and it \nworks just as it is supposed to work, and as it continues to work.\n  That is one of the great miracles of our experiment in a republican \nform of Government. It is that this bicameral legislature and our three \nbranches of Government operate just as our Founding Fathers envisioned \nthey would: to\n\n[[Page S11663]]\n\ncheck one another's power, to be a check on an over-concentration of \npower, and to ensure there would be a body such as the Senate, with \nsuch continuity that popular passions and emotions, overreactions at \ntimes, would be tempered by the debate that would take place in this \nbody.\n  But it is a very hard-working group. My colleagues work harder than \nmost people in the country ever realize. It always used to irritate me, \nduring the August recess, to go back to the State and have people ask \nme how the month-long vacation was going. So here is this image, I \nguess, that will always be there. But I know, as anybody who has gotten \nvery close to the workings of the Senate, that this is a very hard-\nworking group. Edgar Guest put it this way: ``He has found real \ngreatness--who does his task from day to day and meets whatever comes \nhis way.'' That is what I have tried to do these past 6 years. And that \nis what my colleagues do every day.\n  I found among my colleagues courage. Courage, in my mind, is facing a \nchoice in which there is a clear right and a clear wrong, and in which \nchoosing the right involves a price, involves a cost, involves \nsomething, a consequence, and the willingness to go ahead and make the \nright choice in spite of the fact there is going to be a price to pay.\n  Maybe we don't see it as often as we would always like in the Senate, \nbut I have seen over the last 6 years on numerous occasions where my \ncolleagues knew in their heart what was the right thing to do, or at \nleast as they understood to the best of God's revelation to them and \nGod's light to them what was right and wrong, and they--in spite of \nwhat might be a political risk or other risk--were willing to take a \ncourageous stand and make a courageous decision.\n  And then, I am thankful for my colleagues' friendship. The old adage \nin Washington is: If you want a friend, buy a dog. My experience in the \nSenate disproves that. My experience is, that is not really true, that \nthere are real and genuine friendships that develop and grow in this \nbody.\n  I mentioned, at the beginning of my remarks, Danny Akaka. I think \nSenator Akaka epitomizes the kinds of friendships that cross party \nlines, cross the aisle, and that are genuine on a human basis and on a \nhuman level, and that has immensely impressed me: that amidst important \ndebates about life-and-death issues, war and peace, and votes that \nimpact millions of Americans, and, indeed, impact the entire world--\nthat in the midst of those kinds of debates, there are relationships \nthat transcend, and the very personal needs of friends take precedence \nand are there. So I am grateful for those friendships that have taken \nroot and have grown and have blossomed in my own life.\n\n  And then I am very grateful, as I look back over the past 6 years, \nfor some very special staff people.\n  I remember, after President Bush was elected, I was invited to the \nfirst bill signing. It was the bill--well, the bill is not important. I \nwent over, and it was in the Roosevelt Room. A couple of things struck \nme: One was there was a handful of chairs that had been set up, so it \nwas a very humble kind of signing ceremony. The President walked into \nthe room, and he said: ``Now, the chairs are for the staff. The Members \ncan stand.'' And he kind of chuckled, and then he said: ``Because I \nknow who really does the work on legislation.''\n  He was right, recognizing that it is the staff who makes this place \noperate. It is the staff who keeps the gears and machinery of \nGovernment operating and working. It is the staff who was here late \nlast night and is back in here early this morning. And their \ncontributions, I think, are often overlooked.\n  I just want to thank my personal staff for their great work these \npast 6 years; and a few people I want to mention by name. To my right \nis my chief of staff, Todd Deatherage. I have just a handful on my \nstaff who have served with me a decade, my entire time in Washington--\nmy 4 years in the House and one term in the Senate--and Todd is one of \nthose who goes back the full 10 years.\n  He served as my district director when I was in the House, and when I \ncame to the Senate, he took his family, uprooted them, and moved them \nto Washington, and has served as my chief of staff in the Senate.\n  So how do you sum up a decade in a few sentences? You cannot. That is \nthe conclusion I came to.\n  But, Todd, I appreciate so much your loyalty. I appreciate the wisdom \nyou have brought to the office. I appreciate your hard work. And I \nappreciate, most of all, your friendship.\n  Todd is, as are most of us in the Hutchinson Senate office, a great \ndevotee and admirer of Ronald Reagan, and no one more so than my chief \nof staff because every year, on Ronald Reagan's birthday, we would have \nthis celebration in our office, celebrating Ronald Reagan's birthday.\n  But it was Todd's self-assumed role to remind us that birthday was \ncoming, and he would send out the e-mails. And Todd--I don't know if he \nactually baked the birthday cake--but he assured there was a birthday \ncake brought to the office, and we would have a little party honoring \nRonald Reagan.\n  On Ronald Reagan's last birthday, he sent the e-mail out, and with \nthe e-mails he included one of Ronald Reagan's famous speeches: ``A \nTime For Choosing.'' ``A Time For Choosing'' was the 1964 speech that \nreally was the launching pad for Ronald Reagan's national political \ncareer. Of course, Barry Goldwater was the nominee of the Republican \nparty. I was 14 years old, living in Springdale, AR, and I remember \nsitting in front of the black-and-white television in Springdale, \nwatching Ronald Reagan address the Nation in the speech ``A Time For \nChoosing,'' known to most conservatives as simply ``The Speech.'' That \nwas the speech that led to his run for the Governorship of California \nand ultimately the Presidency.\n  So Todd, in sending out the announcement about the Ronald Reagan \nbirthday, included the speech ``A Time for Choosing'' with a little \npostscript: ``You might want to read this speech because this speech \nhad a big impact on our boss's life and thinking.'' And it did.\n  Todd, as I express my appreciation to you today, one of your roles in \nour office was to be a reminder of first principles. Every office needs \nsomebody who will be the reminder of first principles, and to be a \nreminder to all of us as to why we got into this in the first place.\n  In fact, in 1984, when I first made my run for State representative, \nthat speech, that treatise, that conservative manifesto, reminding us \nof what our view of Government is, and what our view of man is, and \nwhat the relationship of our Government should be to our society--those \nfirst principles are important, and they are important to me and \nimportant for us to remember.\n  Todd, thank you for being the one to remind us of that time and time \nagain.\n  I thank my deputy chief of staff, Lisa Goeas. Lisa has been with me \nalso for 10 years. She was one of the first hires I made when I was \nelected to Congress. I hired her as a scheduler, and right out of \ncollege. Of course, the big impediment--I am sure I am going to offend \nCalifornians--but the big impediment was, as I looked at her resume, I \nsaw that she was a graduate of Berkeley.\n  I had nothing against Berkeley, but as I scanned it, she could see \nthe double take I took. I said: ``Lisa, you to know I am a \nconservative. I want you to be comfortable,'' I said. But she has been \nsuch an asset in the office. She went from scheduler to legislative \nassistant in the House, and then worked in the 1996 campaign so \ntirelessly, in the Senate race in which I became the first Republican \nthe State of Arkansas ever elected to the U.S. Senate by popular \nelection--she worked so very hard in that--and then she has become \ndeputy chief of staff. She is gifted. She is incredibly industrious. \nShe is bright. She is blessed with a great personality. And most of \nall, she is loyal, and she is a great friend.\n  Nothing, to me, speaks more about Lisa than her involvement in the \nCornerstone School in the District of Columbia. The Cornerstone School \nis a private Christian school that was started by a group of Hill \nstaffers. They looked around the District, and they said: There are \nchildren who ought to have an opportunity to go to a Christian school \nand whose parents cannot afford it, or they don't have the opportunity, \nor there is no such school. These staffers set out on their own to \nstart this school. They did so several years ago. I am not sure what \nthe enrollment is, but it has grown.\n\n[[Page S11664]]\n\n  Lisa has poured herself into that school and raising money for it, \nproviding scholarships for it, getting sponsors for the children, and \nto ensure not only their financial support, the tuition, but also to \nspend time and to be mentors, tutors for the children. I think that \nsays a lot about her heart. Beyond being bright and industrious and \nenergetic and all of the rest of the skills she brings to the office, \nshe brings a great heart as well.\n  I thank especially Nora Breidenbach, as well, for her 10 years of \nservice. She has been with me ever since I came to Congress. She has \nheaded up the entire constituent service operation. She has a kind of \nquiet efficiency. I always knew that if there was a problem that needed \nsolving, Nora was the one who could solve it. She is also a great \nmanager of people. She has gone through a lot of trials of her own \nduring the last decade, but she always knew how to draw the best, not \nonly from her own life but from those whom she was supervising. She \nbrought the best from everyone who worked with her and for her.\n  Also, I say a special thanks to Fay Ott, my office manager; Cortney \nBrown, my scheduler--every one of these staffers deserves a speech \nabout them--Kate Hull, who has done such a wonderful job as my LA and \nis now working on the subcommittee staff, who shepherded through \nlegislation that benefits thousands and thousands of nurses; Andrea \nAllen, who is my state director in Arkansas, a very wonderful human \nbeing, very great state director; Susan Carter, who has been with me \nfor years, left and came back, who heads up projects; and Jim Hirni, my \nlegislative director. I said last night, at one of our many farewell \nparties, that I think not only is he the best legislative director on \nthe Hill, but going through a tough re-election campaign, no one had a \nbetter LD, to keep the shop going, but much more than that: to be there \nfor me with encouragement, strength, and help.\n  To all of my staff I say thanks. To me they are much more than staff. \nMy DC staff consists of Nora Breidenbach, Joycelyn Belcher, Josh \nBenoit, Cortney Brown, Tim Chapman, Todd Deatherage, Jim Dohoney, Amy \nGibson, Colonel Jim Garrison, Lisa Goeas, Michael Hilburg, Jim Hirni, \nKyle Hicks, Kate Hull, Rebekah Hutton, Sally Lee-Kerns, Conan Krueger, \nDavid Manns, Chris Miller, Robbie Minnich, Tim Moore, Misty Murphey, \nD.J. O'Brien, Fay Ott, Brydon Ross, Marc Scheessele, Ben Sheldon, Brad \nTashenberg, Dan Weaver, Jennie Wingad, Michael Zehr. My state staff \nconsists of Andrea Allen, Carrie Bartholomew, Susan Carter, Jim Case, \nLaDana Emerson, Leslie Garman, Tammie Hall, Jared Haney, Ruby \nHenderson, Sarah Jones, Mitchell Lowe, Clint Reed, Julie Reynolds, \nSpencer Sessions, Jerry Sherrod, Don Travis, Kellie Wall, John \nYoungblood.\n  They are much more than just staff. They are truly friends. As my \ncolleagues have become good friends to me, so my staff are much more \nthan employees, much more than service to the people of Arkansas. They \nare very good friends to me.\n  I ran across this Henry Van Dyke quote on friendship.

Farewell, we shall meet again.\n\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to give these farewell remarks \nfrom this Senator.

Before the Senator from Arkansas leaves the floor, let me \nextend my appreciation for all of his kind deeds toward me. We have \nworked together on concurrent receipts and a number of other issues. \nThe State of Arkansas, in sending the Hutchinson brothers to \nWashington, really sent two quality people. I have worked with both of \nthem. I didn't always agree with them politically, but as far as their \nbeing temperamentally, socially, so kind and considerate, thoughtful, \nis concerned, both of them are outstanding gentlemen. I look forward to \nworking with both of them in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11664-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BOB SMITH\n\n  Mr. REID.

He, along with Senator Kerrey, led us in that most \nimportant study. I developed a great amount of knowledge of Senator \nSmith during that year.\n  Our friendship, even though it budded there at the time of the MIA-\nPOW Committee, really came to fruition when we were asked by our two \nparty leaders to lead the Ethics Committee. During those years, we \nworked on some very difficult issues. Senator Smith I found to be a \ngentleman, a scholar. He has very good staff. He has the institutional \nawareness that he is very firm, very strict, but yet very fair. That is \nwhat the Ethics Committee needs.\n  As I indicated, I developed a friendship with Bob Smith.

Mr. President, when I came to the Senate \nin 1991, we were faced with Saddam Hussein and Iraq. Actually, my first \nspeech on the floor was about Iraq and the war and the fact that we had \nto make a very difficult vote.\n  As I leave the Senate, here we are still facing--12 years later--\nSaddam Hussein and an imminent war with Iraq. So there is some irony \nthere, I guess.\n  Before I make some closing remarks about my tenure here and leaving \nthe Senate, I want to make a few remarks about something that I think \nhas been somewhat ignored over the past several years in this body and, \nindeed, in the country, and that is the future of space and how space \nwill help us to protect our national security and also not only our \nnational security but just the pure science of space and the \nfascination\n\n[[Page S11665]]\n\nwith space and what we will find as we continue the exploration of \nspace.\n  I hope the 21st century will be the one that takes us into space to \nhelp protect our Nation and, indeed, perhaps the world. I believe \nwhoever controls space will control peace here on earth.\n  I made these statements several years ago and got some negative \neditorials for it. I was called spaceman by one of the more, if you \nwill, ``prominent'' newspapers in my State. As Harry Truman said, ``If \nyou can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.'' Sometimes a price \nis to be paid for leadership. I believe if they can say about me that I \nwas one of the folks here that promoted space and the good things that \ncan come to our Nation as a result of space--if I can be remembered for \nthat--I would be very happy.\n  I want to draw my colleagues' attention to our Nation's future \nsecurity in space. In 1998, I delivered a speech at the Fletcher School \nof Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University on November 18, just 4 years \nago. In that speech, I spoke about the challenge of space power. I \nlabeled space the ``permanent frontier.'' Some say it is the ``final \nfrontier.'' It is not final, it is permanent.\n\n  That is the fascinating part about space. I remember looking at the \nstars as a kid and thinking this goes on forever. It is a permanent \nfrontier. There is no limit to how far we can go in the exploration of \nspace.\n  When I came to the House in 1985, I served on the Space Subcommittee \nof the Science and Technology Committee until my election to the Senate \nin 1990. I had the pleasure of being in Congress during the Reagan \nadministration. I remember with pride and emotion President Reagan's \nfirm leadership and his commitment to rebuilding our military after \nyears of neglect. He, too, offered a promise of space power, with his \nvisionary Strategic Defense Initiative. Despite tremendous opposition \nand ridicule, with cynics and critics calling SDI ``star wars,'' his \nvision is being fulfilled today. It was a vision.\n  The ABM Treaty is on the waste heap of history, where it belongs. \nMutual assured destruction has been exposed for the sham that it was, \nand we are moving toward deployment of a robust, multilayered ballistic \nmissile defense system and toward providing the American people the \nprotection they need from the growing and imminent threat of ballistic \nmissiles in the hands of rogue states such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, \nand others.\n  We stand now at a very uncertain time--perhaps on the brink of a \ngreatly expanded war on terrorism. And while we try to find and \neliminate terrorists and their cells, we are at risk in our cities, in \nthe heartland, of more devastating terrorist attacks. In the heartland \nof our country, never before have we felt threatened like this.\n  None of us wish to be at war. I have served in war. I don't want to \nbe in war. But we are in a state of war. I enlisted to serve in the \nNavy in Vietnam. I know what the horrors of war bring. But if this \nNation has to go to war with Iraq, or anywhere else, to ensure our \nliberty, to ensure our freedom, to ensure that our lives are free of \nthe threats of aggressive, dangerous dictators and the global terrorist \nnetwork, I will support our President and I will support our troops, \nwhether or not I am in the Senate.\n  All of my efforts in national security over my career in the House \nand Senate have been focused on ensuring that our troops--the men and \nwomen who put the uniform on and defend us every day--are well \norganized, trained, and equipped for war. Nothing less than that is \nsatisfactory. If we are going to show the world that we are strong and \nwe are prepared for war, few would choose the risky path of challenging \nus, and that is the message we must send.\n  The task of organizing, training, and equipping our forces is not a \none-time effort; it is a continuously evolving challenge that must be \nattended with the same aggressiveness and unyielding commitment that \nour warfighters apply on the battlefield. The threats we face are \nconstantly changing, as we saw on September 11, and our approach to \nwarfighting must change as well.\n  As we have so vividly demonstrated in our prosecution of the global \nwar on terrorism, we now have to protect our cities in our own \nhomeland--our own buildings, the very buildings where we are sitting \nnow.\n  My colleagues, I say to you, as I leave, that it is our job as \nleaders representing this great Nation to make sure our military is \nproperly organized, trained, and equipped to meet its future \nchallenges, and nothing we do here is more important.\n\n  In the early years of this Nation, we relied on the power of our Army \nand our Navy. In the early years of the last century, we saw the \nemergence of air power--which was also criticized when it first \nstarted--that has dominated our initial application of force in recent \nconflicts. But times are changing. The threats we face are changing.\n  GEN Chuck Horner, commander of our troops in Desert Storm, said after \nthe conflict that we have witnessed the first space war--that was in \n1991, tanks and troops navigating flawlessly through a featureless \ndesert. That was the war against Iraq in 1991. Unprecedented \nintelligence; advance warning of incoming missiles; bombs dropped \nprecisely on targets; command, control, and communications \nsynchronizing a military scattered across a vast theater of war in the \nMiddle East--all of these contributions were made possible by the use \nof space systems in 1991.\n  Had we not had those space systems and had we not had control, or had \nIraq had control, the whole outcome may have been different.\n  This was not a real space war that General Horner was referring to. \nThere were no shots fired in space. What we witnessed was an awakening \nto the enormous benefits that space systems provide our military. It is \nimportant to remember that we are not the only witnesses. The world and \nour potential adversaries watched us and learned from our prosecution \nof that war and every conflict since.\n  Like General Horner, General Krulak, former Marine Commandant, and a \nsoldier greatly respected by me and by his marines and fellow officers, \nsaid that ``between 2015 and 2025, we have an opportunity to put a \nfleet on another sea. And that sea is space.''\n  That is a very far-reaching and visionary statement, Mr. President, \nfrom a great American, Chuck Krulak.\n  Our troops deserve every advantage we can give them. We ought to lay \nup at night thinking about what advantages we can give these men and \nwomen. If we are to preserve our current space advantage, then we must \nprotect our space systems from any attack and deny our adversaries that \nsame use of space. We must maintain space control. We also must do more \nthan maintain the current status quo. Space offers our warfighters so \nmuch more; a space-based radar that tracks enemy movements behind the \nlines without risking air crews, a space plane that can project force \nanywhere on earth in 45 minutes or less, a low orbit space plane, new \nways of looking for new threats. I fought to save that space plane, and \nit was cut during the 8 years of the Clinton administration.\n  The space plane, I believe, is beginning to receive the attention it \ndeserves within the hierarchy of the Air Force Space Command.\n  The MSP, the military space plan, could access virtually all orbits \nand with specific upper-stage systems could help protect our extensive \nand vital space-based assets. This plan could provide platforms to \nsupport potential air, sea, and ground operations through its \nintelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance sensor payloads while \nalso providing potential precision long-range strike capability without \nputting men and women in uniform in harm's way--a tremendous asset to \nour arsenal. Yet it has been slowed down; it was cut. We now need to \nbring it back.\n  As we look even further into the future, visionaries see \ncapabilities--this is always what I like to talk about, what the future \nwill bring. It is fun to hear these visionaries talk, but in the future \nwe are going to see capabilities like special operations troops \ndelivered rapidly from one location to another through space and \nlasers, destroying targets instantaneously deep inside the enemy's \nterritory. When the missile is fired, we blow it up with a laser over \ntheir territory, not ours.\n  Not only do these visions offer fast and effective military action, \nthey offer the possibility of putting fewer men and women forward \ndeployed with their lives at risk.\n  We cannot forget we must invest today to develop these and all the\n\n[[Page S11666]]\n\nother capabilities if they are to be available for our future fighting \nmen and women.\n  In 1999, with the support of my colleagues, I chartered the Space \nCommission to make recommendations to reorganize Government to better \ndeliver the military space capabilities this Nation needs for the \nfuture. That Commission brought together this Nation's best defense and \nspace leaders.\n  One of them was Donald Rumsfeld. He led the group just before he \nbecame our current Secretary of Defense. I would like to believe he was \nselected in part because he did such an outstanding job with the Space \nCommission--I hope that is one of the reasons why President Bush \nselected him as Secretary of Defense--and earlier with the Ballistic \nMissile Threat Commission.\n  Secretary Rumsfeld and his fellow commissioners found that future \nspace warfare is a ``virtual certainty,'' and that we had better be \nprepared for it. The Space Commission's report warned about the ominous \npossibility of a ``space Pearl Harbor.'' It called for protecting \nsatellites essential for military operations and developing space \nweapons to deter attacks in or from space and to defend against attacks \nif they occur.\n  The U.S. is now heavily dependent upon satellites with hundreds in \norbit serving commercial as well as military uses. We are more \ndependent on space than any other nation in the world. Think about your \ncell phone. Were it not for space, you would not be using it.\n  In 1998, a Galaxy IV satellite malfunctioned. It shut down 80 percent \nof U.S. pagers and video feeds for cable and broadcast transmissions. \nIt took weeks to restore service. In 2000, the U.S. lost all \ninformation from satellites for 3 hours when computers in ground \nstations malfunctioned. These incidents served to show how critical \nspace has become to us.\n  The Space Commission recognized space weapons to deter attacks from \nspace would be essential because we cannot protect satellites \nadequately without weapons in space. Remember that. Let me repeat it: \nWe cannot protect our satellites in space without weapons in space. A \nweapon in space does not have to be an offensive weapon; it can be a \ndefensive weapon.\n  The resulting space management reorganization stemming from the work \nof the Space Commission is nearly complete. The various stakeholders \nhave decided which of the Space Commission's recommendations it will \nimplement and how. Frankly, though, I am still skeptical that the \nchanges that have been made will be effective in delivering the space \ncapabilities this Nation needs.\n\n  Over the course of the last year, we have discovered that most of our \ncurrent space programs are ``broken,'' severely underfunded, and behind \nschedule, and that is not good. I am not naive, and I do not blame the \nrecent reforms for the current problems. However, I am not convinced \nthe reforms that have been implemented are capable of making the tough \nchoices that both, A, fix the problems with our current space programs \nand, B, keep us aggressively pressing forward with developing new \ntechnologies and capabilities we need for the future.\n  When we won the war in the Persian Gulf in 1991, it was with highly \nsophisticated weapons. Somebody 20, 30 years ago had the vision to \nbuild them. They did not crawl under a rock and say: That is just too \nfar in the future; we are not going to deal with it--precision bombs \nand precision ordnance. Somebody had to think about it. Somebody had to \nput it on the drawing board. Somebody had to pay for it and build it.\n  If the Air Force cannot or will not step up to its responsibilities \nas the executive agent for military space, then Congress must do it, as \nthe space commissioners noted, and create a separate space force to \nbecome that strong advocate. I have spoken of the need for the Air \nForce to build a dedicated space warfare cadre of younger space-trained \nofficers and to stop assigning nonspace officers to lead space billets \nin space organizations. I predict that early in this 21st century, \nthere will be a space force just as there now is an Air Force. There \nwill be a space force.\n  For far too long, the Air Force's space institutions and commands \nhave been led by officers not specializing in space. That must change \nif we are to move into this space era.\n  I have been a long-time advocate for the potential of national \nsecurity space on the Hill. I know being an advocate for space is not \neasy. Believe me, I know. I have been ridiculed for it. These \ncapabilities are complex, and they are not cheap, although I believe \nspace power ultimately could be more cost-effective than some of our \nlegacy systems.\n  I have also learned that some of the needed space capabilities, such \nas the Kinetic Energy Antisatellite or KE ASAT Program, can take longer \nthan a career in Congress to deploy. Today we are only a modest amount \nof funding short of being ready to flight-test KE ASAT, one of our \nnear-term space control programs.\n  KE ASAT offers the promise of complete space control at minimal cost \nto the taxpayers and delivers the essential 4 Ds--i.e., the ability to \ndisrupt, degrade, deny, and destroy--required to deal with the enemy \nthreat.\n  The old Soviet Union built a co-orbital satellite killer that it \ntested in space at least 20 times and which was operational with Soviet \nstrategic forces for a decade. China is reportedly developing a hunter-\nkiller microsatellite that would attach itself to an adversary's \nsatellite and destroy it. Imagine the disruption that could cause us \nboth militarily and commercially. We must be ready to protect against \nthe deployment and use of such systems.\n  We cannot shy away from, nor shortchange, our commitment to transform \nour military for the future. This is our challenge.\n  I have carried the space banner through many tough fights, including \nthe line-item veto by President Clinton of our emerging space power \nprograms. Missile defense has survived, KE ASAT has survived, and the \nspace plane, too. But these programs need ongoing commitment and funds \ntoward deployment and real security for our Nation and our service men \nand women. They need to be reviewed at the highest levels of DOD, by \nthe Secretary, by Under Secretaries Aldridge and Teets, and by the \nSecretary's trusted aide who served at the Space Commission as its \nDirector, now at PA, Steve Cambone.\n\n  Some of my friends have asked why I focused on space since there is \nnot a strong space constituency in my home State of New Hampshire. I \nbeg to differ. There is a major constituency in New Hampshire that \ndemands a strong, cost-effective national defense. In fact, I would \nargue that same constituency stretches all across America--a \nconstituency that supports our military every day, not just during \ntrying times.\n  If it is the right thing to do, whether you have a constituency in \nyour State for it, we are here to lead. We are here to lead this \nNation.\n  New Hampshire also is proud of its high-tech industry. New Hampshire \nis also the State that sent astronaut Alan Shepard and Christa \nMcAuliffe to participate in the National Space Program. Christa lost \nher life aboard the Challenger in 1986. Both of them had ``the right \nstuff,'' and they created a surge of enthusiasm for space exploration.\n  As I prepare to leave the Senate, I look around and ask myself: Who \nis going to pick up the space banner I have carried? Who will advocate \ntoday for the needs of our future fighting men and women in space?\n  Forty years ago, and spurred in part by the shock of the Soviet \nsuccess with Sputnik in 1957, President Kennedy challenged the Nation \nto look into space. He criticized Republicans--the Eisenhower \nadministration--in fact, for letting the Russians get ahead in space. \nPresident Kennedy recognized even in those early days of space \nexploration the criticality of space that General Horner witnessed in \nDesert Storm.\n  President Kennedy told us the Nation that controls space will come to \ndominate the world. In a speech to Rice University in 1962, John F. \nKennedy said the following:\n\n       The exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in \n     it or not. And it is one of the great adventures of all time, \n     and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations \n     can expect to stay behind in this race for space.\n       We mean to lead it, for the eyes of the world now look into \n     space, to the moon and\n\n[[Page S11667]]\n\n     to the planets beyond; and we have vowed that we shall not \n     see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a \n     banner of freedom and peace.\n\n  That was well said by a Democrat President. He was absolutely right.\n  Who do you want to control the satellites in space? Who do you want \nto control what goes on in space: Communist China, Iraq, North Korea, \nLibya, or the United States of America?\n  The day before his assassination, President Kennedy spoke at a \ndedication of the Aerospace Medical Health Center at Brooks Air Force \nBase in Texas, and he noted:\n\n       This Nation has tossed its cap across the wall of space and \n     we have no choice but to follow it.\n\n  What a great visionary President Kennedy was on this issue. \nLeveraging space to ensure our freedom and to protect our allies is not \na partisan issue. It is our moral obligation, pure and simple, just \nlike it was to respond to the attacks of the Japanese and the Germans \nduring World War II. It was our moral obligation to stop the killing by \nthe Nazis, to stop the Bataan death marches, to stop the tyranny and \nthe aggression. It is now our moral obligation to protect this Nation \nfrom the threat from space.\n  In his now famous speech at the Citadel, candidate George W. Bush \nsaid:\n\n       We need to skip a generation of technology.\n\n  And in space,\n\n       We must be able to protect our network of satellites \n     essential to the flow of our commerce and the defense of our \n     country.\n\n  He called for a new spirit of innovation and recognized the fact that \nmany officers express impatience with the prevalent bureaucratic \nmindset that frustrates--and, I would argue, fails to reward--\ncreativity.\n  We must reward creativity. George Bush called for a culture of \ncommand where change is welcomed and rewarded, not dreaded. To do that, \nwe need to break with the past, get out of the box, put in charge \npeople who are visionaries, who are ready to fulfill the President's \nand the Secretary of Defense's vision, to fulfill Ronald Reagan's \nvision for peace using space for peace. Even President Reagan, the \nhard-core conservative, offered to provide to the Soviet Union the \ntechnology to bring peace to the world if that was what it took.\n  As we stand now on the brink of an expanded war with Iraq, I ask \nmyself whether we have provided our sons and daughters, husbands, \nwives, fathers, mothers, sisters, brothers, all the best technology \nthat this country has to help them accomplish their mission quickly and \nbring them home safely. Have we? I do not think we have, with all due \nrespect. We have the opportunity to do it if we will think about it \nnow.\n  I think we can do better. I believe this body has the vision, the \nexpertise, the knowledge, and the good people in it to ensure that we \norganize, train, and equip our military for the future, a future that \nleverages the full potential of space that we have only begun to \nrealize. But we must exercise stringent oversight. We must serve as the \ncatalyst to push a grudging--and it is a grudging--bureaucracy and \nmilitary industrial complex into fulfilling that potential.\n  Bureaucracies are not innovative. They basically exist. They do not \nlike change. We need to give them change. We need to impose it upon \nthem.\n  President Reagan, speaking to the Young Astronauts program in 1986, \ntold the participants that they were on ``the edge of our known world, \nstanding on the shores of the infinite.''\n\n  What a statement: We are standing on the edge of our known world, on \nthe shores of the infinite.\n  He called for them to touch the mystery of God's universe and to set \nsail across its waters into the most noble adventure of all. President \nReagan achieved because he dreamed, because he motivated and he \ninspired. He understood that Americans, by nature, are dynamic people. \nThey are good people. The change they bring is for the good, for the \nbest of America, and that is all he worked on--for excellence, to rise \nto the challenge, the shining city on the hill, undaunted by threats, \nand with hope and optimism. That was President Reagan, following the \nwords of President Kennedy.\n  Through enormous sacrifice, America has preserved her own freedom and \nfreed millions around the world. We go to far off countries, serve in \ncombat, die on fields in countries we have never heard of, day in and \nday out, year after year. As leaders in Congress, we are committed to \npreserving these freedoms for future generations, but to achieve that \ngoal we must reach into space with gusto for its science, for its \nmystery, for the security it can offer us.\n  Control of space is more than a new mission to consider funding, it \nis our moral legacy. Moving into space is our next manifest destiny. It \nis our chance to create sanctity and security for centuries to come. It \nis our chance to do it. As I leave the Senate, I want to inspire my \ncolleagues to pick up that cause because it is the right thing to do.\n\n\n                             Senate Service\n\n  I know there are others who wish to speak, but I am going to take a \ncouple of minutes, because I am leaving the Senate, and close on a few \npersonal thoughts. I do respect my good friend, Senator Sessions. I \nwill be only a few minutes.\n  I remember when I came down to the floor to sign the book in December \nof 1990. Senator Byrd was there, as he always is, and he watched as I \nsigned 1,794. He said: Senator Smith, you are the new Senator from New \nHampshire. You want to remember there are tens of millions of people--I \nwill never forget this--who have been part of the United States of \nAmerica since 1776, and you are 1 of only 1,794 to have served in the \nSenate.\n  I will never forget it, and I never have. Senator Byrd is one of the \nfinest people to ever walked on to this floor. I admire him greatly. It \nhas been an honor and privilege to serve with him, but it has been a \ngreat honor to serve the people of New Hampshire for 18 years, 12 in \nthe Senate and 6 in the House. It has been an extraordinary privilege \nto occupy this desk, the desk of Daniel Webster, for 9 years.\n  There is a very interesting story about this desk. Actually, Daniel \nWebster represented Massachusetts in the Senate, although he was from \nNew Hampshire. He was a New Hampshire native. So when Senator Kennedy, \nTed Kennedy, gave up the desk to take his brother John's desk, the desk \nbecame a free spirit, and Senator Norris Cotton passed a resolution in \nthe Senate that the Webster desk will forever more belong to the senior \nSenator from the State of New Hampshire. That is a long time, forever \nmore. So nobody else is going to get it.\n  I have etched my name in the drawer, from Webster coming down through \nthose great people who occupied this seat, down to where I have etched \nmy name. It is a reminder, as I sit at this desk--these desks open from \nthe top like so. There are very few desks in this Chamber that do not \nopen that way, and one is Daniel Webster's because he did not want to \npay to have it done because it cost too much money. It cost $5 to $10 \nin those days, and he said taxpayers should not have to pay for that, \nso it just has a drawer in it. Webster was a frugal person. He was also \na great orator.\n\n  Next to Webster's desk is the desk of Jefferson Davis, which is now \noccupied by Senator Cochran of Mississippi. I am reminded of the great \nspeech Jefferson Davis gave with so much emotion that he left the \nSenate to go back to his home State of Mississippi during the Civil \nWar.\n  There is so much history in this Chamber. One of the things you do \nwhen you are leaving the Senate, you take time to smell the roses a \nlittle bit and you look around. President Reagan said history is a \nribbon, always unfurling.\n  History is a journey. Every one of us, Senator Sessions, Senator \nInouye, my great friend who now occupies the chair, they are all part \nof history. It is unfurling as we stand. What we say today is a memory \ntomorrow. Life is nothing but memories. But we have a chance to make \npart of that history, to chart that course, for America, 1 of 100 \npeople to do it at any given time in American history.\n  I have learned more about friendship, patriotism, and loyalty in the \nlast 18 years while a Member of Congress, from people in my State, my \nfamily, the Senate, so many wonderful people, good friends, than I \ncould ever have imagined.\n\n[[Page S11668]]\n\n  Senator Reid indicated a few moments ago he was sorry I did not win, \nbut I am reminded of Theodore Roosevelt who won and lost his share of \nelections. This is a great quote for you young people. Think about it \nbecause you are going to be facing challenges. All the pages who are \nsitting here, you are going to win some and you are going to lose \nsome. You will have great disappointments and you will have great \nsuccesses. That is what life is. It is a heck of a lot more fun to win \nthan it is to lose. I speak from experience on that.\n\n  Teddy Roosevelt said: Far better it is to dare mighty things, even \nthough checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits \nwho neither enjoy much nor suffer much because they live in the gray \ntwilight that knows not victory or defeat.\n  You can't succeed if you are afraid to fail. You have to fight the \nfight. You have to fight for the cause. The cause will go on. People \nwill depart the stage. Webster departed; Lincoln departed; many people \nhave departed the stage of running the United States of America--or \neven the world, Churchill--but others must step up. Maybe they don't \nstep up quite at the level of the ones who are following but they step \nup.\n  That is why America must go on. I want 500 years from now the Senator \nfrom Alabama--Senator Thurmond might be here--but Senator Sessions and \nI won't--I want those two Senators from New Hampshire and Alabama to be \nhere on this floor in this great country, still the free country it is, \nhaving good debates just as we have done so many times.\n  There are so many things one gets the opportunity to do as a Senator. \nWhat I have enjoyed the most is helping people, constituent service, \nworking every day with people in the State. Somebody lost their medal \nthat they deserved from World War II or perhaps they are trying to get \na child from another country. We do these things every day. That is \nwhat I enjoy the most. That is what I will miss the most. I remember a \nyoung man who had leukemia. He was dying. He called my office and said \nhis dream was to see a space launch at Cape Canaveral. He could not \nafford to go and he was very sick. I made it happen and arranged with \nNASA to have him go and see the space launch. He came back home and \ndied. It is little things such as that. We did not ask for any press on \nit. Those are the things that I will remember.\n  When you say you are a strong conservative--and people want to lock \nyou in as somebody who does not care or who is not compassionate--I \nlike to help people who sometimes cannot help themselves. Captain \nMcVeigh, the Navy captain of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, who was wronged, \nwho eventually committed suicide because of a terrible ordeal he went \nthrough where he was unfairly blamed for the loss of his ship, we \ncleared his name, thanks to the help of Senator John Warner, the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Fighting so many issues--the POW/MIA, dealing with families of those \npeople; serving as the chairman of the Ethics Committee, in the Senate, \nchosen by all of you to have that high honor--I could go on and on--\nchairing the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I believe I came here on principle. My motto was Jimmy Stewart's in \nthe movie ``Mr. Smith Goes To Washington.'' He went to right a wrong. \nThey were going to flood some Boy Scout camp with a big dam. He came \ndown and stopped it. That kind of ambition and enthusiasm and concern \nabout your fellow man is what I brought here. I came with principle.\n  I came here to Congress under Ronald Reagan. I am a Reagan \nRepublican. I am leaving the Congress a Reagan Republican--a Republican \nwho stands on his platform, who runs on that platform, not away from \nthe platform. And, yes, that includes the right-to-life, that includes \nthe right to protect the second amendment, that includes cutting taxes \nand spending and living within your means, helping our veterans, a \nstrong national defense. That is what it means. That is our platform. I \ndon't run from it. I don't run from it here in the Senate; I never \nhave. That may be one of the reasons why I am leaving--involuntarily.\n  A friend of mine, Mel Thompson, the former Governor of New Hampshire, \nsaid you stand for something or you stand for nothing. I can proudly \nsay I have tried to stand up for what I believe in while I have been \nhere.\n  It has been a great honor, the highest honor of my life, to be here, \nto serve here, to make the friends I have made here. I will never, ever \nforget it.\n  I say thank you in closing to several members of my staff. I know \nsome have come onto the floor today since it is my last speech, unless \nI come back again--you never know. I appreciate them, and I ask \nunanimous consent that a list of my staff, both on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee and my personal staff, be printed in the Record \nto honor their service to our country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Environment and Public Works Smith Staff\n\n       David Conover, Chris Hessler, Martin Hall, Alex Johnson, \n     Melinda Cross, Chelsea Maxwell, Angelina Giancarlo, Kristy \n     Rose, Erin Hass, Genevieve Erny, Paul Jensen, Suzanne \n     Matwyshen-Gillen, Michele Nellenbach, James Qualters, Megan \n     Stanley, Nathan Richmond, Patricia Doerr, and Emma Dabson.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I single out three or four people. My \nchief of staff, Pat Petty, who is no longer my chief of staff, but who \nserved me for about 15 years, I recognize his service to the Senate, to \nthe country. My current chief of staff, Dino Carluccio, who started in \nmy office as basically an intern and went off to Europe to study in \nItaly sent me a note saying: You need me in your office. And I remember \nsaying to my current chief, my chief of staff at the time, anybody who \nhas that much self-confidence we ought to hire. We did. Now he is the \nchief of staff. He worked his way up in the true sense of the word. He \nis a great American.\n  Lisa Harrison worked for one of my opponents in my primary, the first \nprimary, the first time I won in 1984. She was working for the other \nguy, but I liked her. I thought she had a good personality, she was \nsmart, and she was one of the few people on the other campaigns who \nsaid hello to me when I walked into the room. She got a job and has \nbeen with me for 18 years and is one of the best communication \ndirectors in the Senate.\n  Ed Corrigan, my legislative director, has been with me for 10 years, \na real conservative, committed guy. He knows the rules of the Senate, \ninside and out, a great American, great patriot.\n  And Dave Conover, who is my chief of staff at the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, has done an outstanding job there. We had a \ngreat run for a year and a half. We preserved the Everglades and passed \nbrownfields and MTBE legislation and other bills to make our air, land, \nwater, and our wildlife habitat cleaner.\n  I am proud to have served with them all. I had two people in my State \nstaff, Dorothy Vatize and Marti Jones, who have served with me for 18 \nyears, all 18 years I have been here. One is retiring and the other is \nleaving to do other things.\n  It has been an honor to serve here--again, the highest honor of my \nlife. I will never forget it. I am not sure what comes next, but as has \nbeen said many times, Chaplain Lloyd Ogilvie has said it a number of \ntimes to me, God closes one door and he opens another. He did close \none, I am sure of that. The other one is not yet open, but we will find \nit.\n  Having mentioned the chaplain, there is no finer person in the entire \nworld than Lloyd Ogilvie. He is one of the most Christian men and such \nan inspiration to all of us in the Senate, a friendship I will have \nwith me forever.\n  I say thank you to all my colleagues and friends and others I have \nmade here, and thank you to the people of New Hampshire for allowing me \nthe privilege of serving you in this body and in the House of \nRepresentatives for 18 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11668-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11668-S11670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SENATOR ROBERT C. SMITH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, before Senator Smith leaves the floor, I \nwould like to say a few words about our colleague and my good friend.\n  First, I thank Senator Smith for his service to New Hampshire and to \nour\n\n[[Page S11669]]\n\ncountry and also thank him for his friendship and support over the \nyears. We have been friends. We have been supporters of each other.\n  I can remember many occasions when I was in leadership roles--which \nhe supported me for--I went to him and asked for his help and sometimes \nit was not even an issue on which it was easy for him to be supportive. \nSometimes it affected my own State. Sometimes it affected the country. \nBut I don't remember a time--when it was the right thing to do--when I \nasked for his help for our country, or even for my State, that he \ndidn't come through and stand with me. I appreciate that very much.\n  Sometimes the people who help you the most get the least credit, get \nthe least participation in the spoils, so to speak. And sometimes you \njust forget to say thank you. Sometimes I am guilty of that.\n  In the last 2 weeks, I have been in such a euphoric mood, I am \ncalling people, all the way back to my fourth grade teacher, to thank \nthem. I am in a very grateful and humble mood. I think I should say \nthat to my friend from New Hampshire, too. I haven't sidled up to him \nenough and said: You are a good Senator and you are a good friend and \nthank you for all the good work that you have done. But I believe that \nand I mean it.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. I won't ever forget it. I wish you and Mary Jo happiness \nand success. I believe you will have it. I believe you will find that \nlife after the Senate can be quite nice. In fact, I get a little \nagitated sometimes when I run into our former colleagues who are now \nambassadors and businessmen and businesswomen. They are making money. \nThey are rested and they are tanned and they have new suits and new \nties.\n  Wait a minute, why didn't you look this way when you were in the \nSenate?\n  They say: Hey, it's not too bad out there in the real world.\n  This is a tough job. There are a lot of demands, a lot of things you \nwant to do for your constituents. I know you will find a way to be a \nproductive citizen and will be able to do some things with your family \nand wife and children you didn't have the opportunity to do before. I \ncertainly hope for that. We look forward to staying in touch with you. \nWe will think about you and say a prayer for you along the way.\n  I want to particularly note your service to our country on the Armed \nServices Committee on defense issues. Once again, I know some stories \nabout Senator Bob Smith that a lot of others don't know, things that \nyou did on that committee for a weapons system or for a project. It \ndidn't necessarily affect your State, but it was right for our country. \nYou deserve credit for that.\n  You did do some good things for the environment. A lot of people say: \nOh, Republicans, you know, they are not going to do anything about \nclean air, clean water, environmental cleanup. In fact, that is not \ntrue. But we want to do it with common sense. Senator Smith did some \ngood things in that position he held on the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee as chairman--and when you were in the minority, too.\n  You have done good work for your State--an interesting State; a great \nState, I think. Sometimes they show great wisdom. Other times, you \nknow, you wonder about it--kind of like my own constituency, how they \nvote. But I think you have reflected them quite well and reflected \ncredit on them.\n  I said some things about you last Thursday night at an event that you \nweren't able to attend, but I want to respond to your comments here \ntoday. As I said for others, you can leave here and know that you \nfought the good fight, you finished the race in good fashion, and you \nhave been a good and true servant for your people and for your country.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Senator Lott, if you would yield for just \na second, I thank you for your friendship and your leadership. I am \nglad to see you back in the majority. I know you will make good use of \nit.\n  I will miss not being here to help you, but I will be rooting for you \non the outside, as you know.\n  You did mention family. I think it is important for all of us to \nreflect and understand, without my wife Mary Jo and my daughter, \nJennifer, and my sons, Bobby and Jason--without their support over the \nyears, it would not have been possible. You know how difficult this job \nis, living in a fishbowl. We all have our families to thank, so I want \nto pay a special tribute to my family for supporting me all these years \nand loving me and still loving me after all of this.\n  I thank you again, leader, for your remarks.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share with you my admiration \nfor Bob Smith. I think it was Phil Gramm who repeated recently what he \nsaid not long after Paul Coverdell's death: If you love somebody, you \nought to tell them you love them. Sometimes you are too late.\n  I love Bob Smith. I so respect what he stands for. He stood for the \nfuture. He has been an historian. He knows the past. He has called on \nour military to transform itself, to meet the new challenges in the \nworld. He has understood, with great clarity, that we do need control \nin space. That was a remarkable address that all of us ought to take to \nheart about the future this Nation has in space.\n  I remember at one of our Armed Services Committee hearings, Secretary \nRumsfeld was up for confirmation and was asked, critically: Well, you \ndon't mean we are going to have war in space, do you, Mr. Rumsfeld?\n  Without hesitation he said: We have had war on the ground, we have \nhad war on the water, we have had war in the air--and, yes, we are \ngoing to have war in space, and we need to be prepared to win it.\n  One of the great technological advances we have is the ability to \ncontrol space. That enables us to control the battlefield. Senator \nSmith has absolutely been the strongest advocate in this Senate, and \nprobably maybe in the House, for the vision that we have to prepare \nourselves to be able to maintain domination in space. He did it for one \nreason--because he cares about our men and women in uniform. He wants \nthem to be able to prevail on the battlefield. He does not want them to \nbe subject to attacks controlled by enemy space power; to have our men \nand women in uniform suffer. Everything he has done in the committee \nhas been so focused on strengthening and bettering the lives of our men \nand women in uniform.\n\n  He mentioned the POWs. He has absolutely been the strongest advocate \nin the Senate, consistently--in committee, when no public and no press \nis there--always pushing for the families and the lives of our \nprisoners of war. I think it has been a remarkable commitment in that \none area in which I have seen him lead.\n  I was on the EPW Committee when Senator Smith wrote the brownfields \nlegislation. It was good legislation and we should have passed it. I \nwas naive and I was stunned that we couldn't get that passed. I guess \nit was the trial lawyers because it eliminated all the money we are \nspending on lawsuits and focused it on cleaning up instead of \nlitigation. The litigation lobby ended up blocking the bill. I know it \nmust have been a great frustration to Senator Smith who worked so hard \non a bill that would have been tremendously beneficial to the \nenvironment.\n  My perspective here is this: There has not been a Senator who has \nmore purity of purpose, more fidelity of commitment to the values that \nmake America great. He loves this country. As an historian himself, he \nunderstands this country and its greatness. He has felt an obligation, \nwhile in this body, to do everything he can to further and strengthen \nthe country that he believes in so greatly. He has never been part of \nthe ``blame America first'' crowd. He has believed in the validity of \nthe American dream and the positive impact of America on the world. He \nwas here during the collapse of the Soviet Union, the fall of the wall, \nand I will tell you one thing: Bob Smith was on the side of freedom \nevery step of the way.\n  He recognized the ``evil empire'' was evil. He did not appreciate it. \nHe valued our values, and he fought for them. I know that must have \nbeen a special time for him and the man he admired so much, Ronald \nReagan.\n  He stood for the elimination of partial-birth abortion, a most \nhorrible\n\n[[Page S11670]]\n\nprocedure. When he first raised that here in this body, people were \noffended that he would talk about such things. But as the years went \nby, the vote grew and people began to realize just how right he was, \nand just how horrible that procedure was. We had, virtually--we had a \nsubstantial majority vote the last time we voted on it, not quite \nmaking it law, but we had a big step in that direction. That was a \ncourageous thing. Even the AMA has come around to agreement with \nSenator Smith, the American Medical Association.\n  So it is a pleasure for me to be here today to share a few words \nabout a man with whom I have worked closely, who I have admired, who \nhas the courage to stand for his convictions--but always in the way of \na gentleman, always not acting in a way that would offend, but standing \nfor what he believes in and for America. Senator Smith, we appreciate \nyour service, and God bless you.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Byrd, who will certainly \nnot be retiring.\n  I want to acknowledge the deep affection this body holds for both \nmen.

Daschle, for his exemplary \n     leadership and the cooperative and dedicated manner in which \n     he has performed his leadership responsibilities in the \n     conduct of Senate business during the second session of the \n     107th Congress.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the majority leader, \nwould it be appropriate at this point for me to perhaps respond to some \nof the resolutions and have a few remarks before I yield the floor back \nto him to do whatever he would like to do in terms of concluding his \nremarks today?\n\n[[Page S11671]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, by all means. I will probably be coming \nback to the floor because I have an engagement at 11:30. But I will be \nhappy to defer to the Republican leader for whatever remarks he would \nmake at this time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Just briefly, Mr. President, with regard to the resolutions \nwe have just passed, I want to add my specific expression of \nappreciation for our Vice President, Vice President Cheney. He is a \nlong-time friend. He understands the institution of Congress. He has \nproven to be a very active Vice President and, obviously, a good and \nvalued adviser to our President. But we all actually have a special \naffinity for this Vice President because we think he does understand \nthe Congress as an institution, and I think he has been very positive \nin the way he has dealt with us. I just wanted that to be on the \nRecord.\n  I thank Senator Byrd for his performance as our President pro \ntempore, for his making us think about the history and the traditions \nof this institution, for his sometimes unbelievable speeches about \nhistory, and for his great quotes from memory of poetry and famous \nstatements by statesmen and politicians. It is a very interesting thing \nto watch and listen to him.\n  Of course, the one and the only centenarian, Senator Strom Thurmond, \nhas done so much for his State and for his country.\n  I just want to put on the Record at this point also that in his \nservice in the Senate he has cast 16,348 votes. He was here last night \nuntil the last vote was cast.\n  We are going to celebrate his 100th birthday with several events \nDecember 1.\n  He will be one of the legends that will be long remembered in this \ninstitution and by our country.\n  Let me say to Senator Daschle, I have enjoyed working beside him \nthroughout this historic Congress and over the years. Sometimes we sit \ndown and visit more often than a lot of people would think or realize. \nWe certainly have a very strong personal relationship--one the media \nseems to miss. And that is just as well, probably, because if people \nreally knew the kind of friendship we have and what we talk about, it \nwould either hurt him or me--or both of us, or our colleagues. But that \nis as it should be. This is the Senate. We must find a way to work \ntogether.\n  As I said on the floor yesterday, how we produce legislation is quite \noften messy and not pretty, but our forefathers designed this to be a \nbody that could be moved only by unanimous consent or consensus. \nSometimes it takes days, sometimes it takes weeks, and sometimes it \ntakes months--just like last night. After all the fussing, the \nfighting, the squabbling, the amending, and positioning and all that \nwent into it, when we voted on the Homeland Security Department Bill, \nthe vote was 90 to 9. We actually scratch our heads and say, Why all \nthat thunder and lightning and then that result?\n  Well, that is a part of the process. Quite often that happens in the \nSenate, because along the way you have made changes. You have \nreconsidered other people's positions. But in the end it is quite often \nthat a bill will pass by a wide margin.\n  We have been through changes in leadership positions. The process to \nconsider the removal of President of the United States who had been \nimpeached by the other body, and now this historic 107th Congress.\n  We should not go off quietly into the night without giving some \nrecognition and some credit to what we have done in this Congress.\n  We started over with a 50-50 split--somewhat historic in its own \nright. There had been 50-50 splits before, or even splits before. I \nhave gone back and studied how those things were handled. They were \nhandled not too well a lot of times. In fact, in one Congress I think \nit took them 4 or 5 months before they ever agreed on the rules to \nproceed.\n  There was some criticism of me and our caucus, and probably of \nSenator Daschle and his caucus, with the agreement we came up with for \nthis 50-50 split. If we had to do it over again, we probably would do \nit somewhat differently, or we would have done a few more things than \nwe were actually able to agree on. But we did come to an agreement. We \ndid move the session forward, and we produced some historic results \nduring that period when we were evenly divided.\n  At the beginning of the year, Senator Daschle actually was the \nmajority leader for 17 days. He could have tried to take advantage of \nit. He could have tried some things that would have been infuriating to \nmy side, or that wouldn't have been good for the Senate or the country. \nBut he didn't do that. He did do some things, but they weren't done in \na way that was taken advantage of in that interim period. Then I became \nmajority leader again in the 107th Congress for about 5 months or so. \nThen I was back in the minority; Senator Daschle is back as majority \nleader.\n\n  We were sort of getting used to our sea legs under this new \narrangement in the latter part of June and July. We probably had not \ngotten our sea legs yet, and then came September 11. We had not planned \non that, and we were stunned by it, the institution, as individuals, \nour staffs. Not only did America come under attack in New York and the \nPentagon, and with plans to attack other places, we had the anthrax \nsituation that put Senator Daschle's staff in a very difficult, \ndangerous position. All of us were affected by that.\n  A lot of Senators rose to the occasion. The leadership, our officers \nrose to the occasion. I will talk more later about the service of our \nSergeant at Arms, General Lenhardt, and the Secretary of the Senate, \nJeri Thomson. They were under enormous pressure, and they were dealing \nwith a totally different situation than we had ever experienced. We \nwere the pilot project. We did not want to be, but we were.\n  How did we clean the Hart Building? How did Senators get their work \ndone? Well, they wound up in other Senators' offices. They wound up in \nmy office upstairs. They were all over the place. We did what we had to \ndo.\n  Also, I believe those events united this body in a way that was very \npositive, and this country in ways that we are still experiencing. But \nwe did find a way to speak with one voice, to pull up our courage, to \ncontinue to do our job.\n  Those ugly, tragic events of that day gave us a period of unity and \nproduction that I have not seen since I have been in Congress. We \npassed bill after bill after bill to deal with the tragedy--from \naviation security, to make sure our airlines did not go out of \nbusiness; the PATRIOT Act--I will not enumerate all the things we did \ndo. We did it working together across the aisle, across the Capitol, \nand with the administration in many instances.\n  I have said here on the floor before, an interesting thing happened: \nThe American people's approval of our conduct went to the highest in \nhistory. I don't know what the highest level was, but at least in the \nhigh seventies. Why was that? Because they saw us working together in a \nnonpartisan way to do what was right for our country. And when we got \nback closer to doing business as usual, those numbers sort of drifted \nback down.\n  I think maybe during this period we are going to be out we ought to \nmeditate and think a little bit about how we did in September and \nOctober and November of 2001, what we did not do sometimes in 2002, and \nsee if there is a way we can, once again, come together and work \ntogether more often.\n  So there have been bumps and potholes and there have been \ndisagreements and there have been huge battles over prescription drugs \nand energy legislation and homeland security and a lot of others, but \nmore often than not, we did get a result. We found a way to get it \ndone.\n  It takes an interminable amount of patience to be majority leader. \nSenator Daschle exhibited that patience, sometimes to the \nconsternation, I know, perhaps, of his own colleagues in his own \ncaucus. But that is the way it has to be done.\n  So now we close out this historic period. We have had an election. We \nwill be coming back in January with 11 new faces in the Senate and new \nleadership in the majority. I will have that opportunity again, God be \nwilling, that we have of swearing in on January 7. We will need to find \na way to work together again. I believe we will.\n  Senator Daschle, when he became majority leader, stood in that place \nand pledged to me, and to the Senate, that he would work with us, and \nhe\n\n[[Page S11672]]\n\nwould be fair in his dealings. I think he has kept that commitment. I \nmake the same pledge to him. I have learned some lessons being in the \nminority and being in the majority and being back and forth. It is a \nhumbling experience. I think you learn that you have to do some things \ndifferently. I hope I will do them better. And I will need his help. So \nI believe we will find a way to work together for the best interests of \nthis institution and for our country.\n  I thank the many people associated with this Chamber, too.\n  As I said to Senator Smith, it is far too often we forget to thank \nthe people who make this place work: the people who turn on the lights, \nthe policemen who work to keep us and our constituents and our staffs \nsafe, the elevator operators, the custodians, the pages. All of these \npeople who work in this Chamber and in this building are an important \npart of getting our job done. So to you all, I express my appreciation \non behalf of myself and the Senate because you do a great job.\n  With that, I would just like to conclude by wishing everyone a safe, \nhappy holiday season. We need this respite. In the end, faith and \nfamily are more important even than what happens here.\n  Now we will have a chance to spend some time thinking about those \nthings and being with the ones we love the most. I look forward to \nreturning in January. I look forward to seeing all of my colleagues as \nwe begin the work that needs to be done for a stronger and freer \nAmerica and peace in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I indicated I will return to the floor in \na short while. But while he is here, let me thank the distinguished \nRepublican leader for his generous words. He spoke for both of us in \nrecounting what we have experienced over the course of the last 2 \nyears.\n  This has been an extraordinarily eventful 107th Congress. He did not \nmention, but I know he could have gone on to include the war in \nAfghanistan, extraordinary challenges on Wall Street, amazing things on \nthe war on terror that we have confronted, breakfasts with the \nPresident as we attempted to confront these challenges one by one in a \nbipartisan way.\n  So this has been extraordinarily eventful. You have to go back a long \nways--a half a century--to find a time when power shifted within one \nCongress from one party to the other. I told him at the time--and I \nhave since reiterated to him--how impressed I was in the way with which \nin our relationship he accepted that transfer of power. I hope I can be \nequally as magnanimous, and I hope to demonstrate that that will be the \ncase beginning in January.\n  He and I have developed a relationship that is built on a great deal \nof experience. And from that experience comes trust and affection.\n  He also did not mention a great moment in both of our lives: when we \nbecame grandfathers. That has been a special treasure for both of us. \nAnd we have shared those moments about family and about grandchildren, \nas we have experienced them for the first time.\n  So I look forward to working again very closely with him in yet \nanother role. I hope that it can be even more productive. I hope that \nwe both can learn lessons from this experience. I hope that we both can \nsend a message to the American people that we mean to govern well, and, \nas I tell people sometimes, it is difficult to legislate, recognizing \nthat with 240 million people in the same room, we have to reach a \nconsensus about issues as challenging as homeland security. We will \ncontinue to do that with our colleagues, and with the best intentions, \nrecognizing the expectations of the American people.\n  So I thank him again for his courtesies, his friendship, and the \nleadership he has shown, and express to him, in the most heartfelt way, \nhow much I look forward to working with him again.\n  Mr. President, I have one final resolution, and that is the \nadjournment resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11672-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11672]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PROVIDING FOR THE SINE DIE ADJOURNMENT OF THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTH \n                        CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 160) was agreed to, as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con.

Mr. President, I oppose this adjournment resolution. \nWhile I am eager to return home to Maine, there is critical unfinished \nbusiness here in Washington. We should not adjourn prior to passing a \nprescription drug benefit for our seniors as well as legislation to \nremedy inadequate Medicare reimbursements that are jeopardizing the \nviability of our home health agencies, rural hospitals, and nursing \nhomes. Cuts in Medicare are also discouraging physicians from accepting \nMedicare patients.\n  These health care problems should be solved now, not delayed until \nnext year. Medicare reimbursements must be adequate to cover the costs \nborne by health care providers in caring for our seniors and disabled \ncitizens. And our elderly have already waited too long for prescription \ndrug coverage.\n  Finally, we should have given final approval to legislation authored \nby Senators Nelson, Smith, Rockefeller, and myself to increate Medicaid \nrates to provide fiscal relief to the States and to prevent cuts in \nhealth care for low-income families.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I have come to the Chamber this morning to \naddress an issue, which is familiar to many Americans but one on which \nthey may not know the details, the important life-or-death information.\n  Yesterday, a Federal court in Birmingham, AL, found for four \nplaintiffs and against a company known as Metabolife International of \nSan Diego and awarded the four plaintiffs $4.1 million for strokes, \nheart attacks suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of ephedra diet \npills. These diet pills and Metabolife are pretty well known across \nAmerica. You can hardly go into a drugstore, gas station or a \nconvenience store and not run into this little familiar container, \nMetabolife 356, ``an herbal formula to enhance your diet and provide \nenergy.'' Unfortunately, this apparently innocent looking product has \ncaused a great deal of physical injury and death.\n  I received today from my State of Illinois, near my hometown of \nSpringfield, a report from the Logan County coroner, Chuck Fricke, a \nreport on the sad death of a young man named Sean Riggins, a 16-year-\nold who died on September 3 of this year. Sean Riggins was the picture \nof health, a high school football player and wrestler. He was the apple \nof his parents' eye. He was\n\n[[Page S11673]]\n\njust an all-around good kid. But he wanted to get ready for the game, \nand he wanted to be prepared. He wanted to do his best.\n  Someone told Sean Riggins that one of the best ways to be a better \nathlete was to go down to the local convenience store or the local gas \nstation and buy a product known as Yellow Jacket--I hold it in my hand, \nan herbal dietary supplement for extreme energy--so he would be ready \nfor the big game. He took that herbal supplement called Yellow Jacket \nthat contained the same ephedra as Metabolife's product. His heart \nstarted racing, and he died.\n  The coroner did an autopsy, which I will ask be included in the \nRecord. He said he was an otherwise very healthy young man, just a \nyoung boy, 16 years old, healthy, an athlete. He took this herbal \nsupplement, and he died.\n  Let's just pause a moment to raise some questions many Americans may \nnot even consider. When you go into a drugstore, or any store, and you \nsee for sale an over-the-counter drug or something like an herbal \ndietary supplement, do you assume that the Federal Government has \ninvestigated this drug, that they have taken a look at it to decide \nwhether it is safe and effective as advertised? Most people would \nassume that.\n  Frankly, throughout history--at least for since 1938--we have created \nstandards in America where the Food and Drug Administration basically \nrequires companies that want to sell drugs over the counter or by \nprescription to prove that the drugs are safe and to prove that they \nare effective. If you can't prove that in clinical trials, you can't \nsell that drug in America.\n  That is pretty simple. It is something we take for granted, but it is \nsomething we should not take for granted.\n  In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education \nAct, which changed the law when it came to certain products. It said \nwhen it came to dietary supplements, nutritional supplements, they did \nnot have to meet that same test of safety and efficacy before going to \nmarket. Instead, they could claim what they wanted to. They could put \nthe product on the market, and the law was rather unclear as to what \nobligation they had beyond that.\n  Frankly, the Food and Drug Administration and the Government of the \nUnited States have failed American families, have failed American \nconsumers when it comes to nutrition supplements and dietary \nsupplements because, as we have found with these supplements containing \nephedra, deadly combinations of chemicals are being sold to children \nand to unsuspecting adults across America without any Government \nintervention.\n\n  Rarely does our Government step in. The Federal Trade Commission will \nstep in when they believe the advertised claims for some of the \nproducts are not true. They will bring an action. Occasionally, the \nFood and Drug Administration, when prodded by Congress, will go after \nthe manufacturer of these Yellow Jacket because they are marketed as \n``an alternative street drug.'' But when it comes to the basic \nresponsibility of our Government to American consumers, the system \nfails for ordinary consumers. We expect consumers to be a chemist, to \nhave a degree in biology, to understand the impact of a drug on their \nbody, because we are not going to take on that responsibility for them \nas a government to make sure only safe products are sold.\n  In this case, when it comes to dietary supplements and nutritional \nsupplements, our Government is absent without leave. We are in a \nsituation where people across America, unsuspecting, believe they are \nhelping themselves to reduce their weight, to avoid obesity, to be \nhealthier individuals by taking dietary supplements which are, in \nstead, dangerous to their health.\n  Let me make one thing very clear: I got up this morning and took my \nvitamin. I do that every day. I don't believe I should have a \nprescription or need one to fill a vitamin. That is a basic choice I \nhave made. A multivitamin, vitamin C--whatever it happens to be--that \nis my decision. And it should be. But when it comes to these \ncombinations of drugs and dietary supplements, we are talking about \nsomething more complicated and more potentially dangerous than vitamin \nC or a multivitamin. We are talking about a combination of chemicals \nbeing sold to the American people which is dangerous and can possibly \nkill.\n  How can I say that these are dangerous? Because these ephedra \ncompounds contain caffeine and other stimulants. Why is that important? \nBecause ephedra, in and of itself, gets your body moving faster and \nyour heart pumping, and caffeine does the same thing. Sean Riggins died \nbecause of that--a 16-year-old boy died because he took this Yellow \nJacket pill and washed it down with Mountain Dew, a soft drink \ncontaining caffeine. Put all that together, and this poor young man's \nlife was snuffed out by a product that was sold over the counter.\n  Incidentally, are there warning labels on the Yellow Jackets for \nthose high school kids who want to consider the danger that might be \nassociated with taking these pills? Yes. You have to strip the label \noff the bottle, and you will find it written in faded print on the \nback. I am sure that 15- and 16-year-old kids are not stopping to read \nthis fine print to decide whether or not it is a danger.\n  Just this last week, I drove from Chicago to Springfield. I stopped \nat a gasoline station halfway to fill up in Pontiac. I went in and, lo \nand behold, Yellow Jackets were for sale right there in front. And you \ndon't have to buy a big bottle. You can buy them for a buck and a half \nand get three or four of them.\n  I went to a junior high school in my hometown of Springfield, and I \nasked the students there: Has anybody ever heard of Yellow Jackets, \nephedra? Yes. Over half the kids did. These were eighth graders.\n  So I would say to parents across America who think, as I do, that \ndrugs are a serious problem, here is a drug for sale that can kill your \nson or daughter. They know about it, and you don't.\n  We know now that it is dangerous. We have to do something about it.\n  Let me tell you what I have done. I have had two hearings as chairman \nof the Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement to look into this particular issue. To my knowledge, it is \nthe first public hearing held on so-called dietary supplements and \nnutrition supplements since it was passed. The information which came \nout is startling. Take a look at this chart. Ephedra is far more deadly \nand dangerous than most dietary supplements. Of all the adverse events \nreported to FDA for dietary supplements, 60 percent of the deaths were \nfor ephedra products; 81 percent of the strokes were for ephedra \nproducts; 68 percent of the myocardial infarctions, heart attacks were \nfor ephedra products. These are serious consequences from an over-the-\ncounter drug unregulated by the Government, such as Metabolife.\n  Dietary supplements adverse events are disproportionately for \nephedra. Ephedra adverse events occur when people get sick after taking \none of these supplements and they call the company and say: What \nhappened? There is something wrong here.\n  Look at this. In terms of the percentage that are directly related to \nephedra, over 40 percent in the year 2001. Then we asked the company. \nFirst Metabolife said: We really haven't received many adverse events \nthat are worth noting. And then we started pushing them a little \nharder, saying we want to get all the information, to find out what \nthey have received. Because of a case filed in court, they disclosed \nover 14,000 adverse event reports--something they kind of overlooked. \nYesterday, they said, yes, we skipped another 1,400 or 1,500 or so. We \nwill send those to you as well. What do we find in the adverse reports \non Metabolife and other companies that are being gathered on ephedra?\n\n  Here I have an example of one of their adverse event reports. It \nlooks like a doodle pad. This is not a formal report, where you would \nnote that a product for sale in America has caused adverse events, \nserious health problems for American citizens. If you go through this \nwhole thing that was disclosed by Metabolife, at the bottom it says \n``mild stroke.'' This person said: I took your pill and had a mild \nstroke. What is wrong with your product?\n  They are not even disclosing these things until they are forced to go \nto\n\n[[Page S11674]]\n\ncourt. Here we have a 25-year-old person who had a stroke as a result \nof taking ephedra diet supplements. The information is very clear. That \ninformation was so compelling that this court yesterday in Alabama did \nwhat our Federal Government hasn't done. This court in Alabama, and a \njury, listened to the evidence on these dietary supplements and said \nthat this company is guilty of selling a dangerous product, endangering \nthe lives of individuals, and entered a verdict of $4 million against \nMetabolife.\n  There are people on the floor--you will hear this for the next \nseveral months--who will argue we should be closing the courthouse \ndoors to this type of lawsuit, that we should not allow people to go to \ncourt to recover against companies that are literally endangering their \nlives. They will talk about plaintiff trial lawyers, and contingency \nfees, and so forth. But the fact is, were it not for the court system \nand the attorneys going into court representing people like these four \nin Alabama, nothing would be done to stop these companies like \nMetabolife from selling deadly products.\n  Something else you might find interesting. The two-week trial, \naccording to this press report, was notable for one bizarre twist--\nMetabolife's president and cofounder, Michael Ellis, refused to have \nhis deposition taken or to answer questions posed by the plaintiff's \nattorneys, asserting his fifth amendment right. The judge allowed the \nplaintiff's attorneys to question an empty chair. The attorneys asked \nquestion after damaging question to which the judge replied on Ellis' \nbehalf that Ellis, president of Metabolife, was asserting his fifth \namendment right not to incriminate himself.\n  According to the attorney, it made a damning impression. The guy \ndidn't even have the gumption to defend his product and he took the \nfifth on the safety of the product. What product? This one, Metabolife \n356, which you can find for sale all over America.\n  Now, what we have to do is acknowledge there is a Government \nresponsibility here with the Department of Health and Human Services, \nas well as the FDA. I contacted Secretary Tommy Thompson after these \nhearings and after it became clear these dangerous products are being \nsold across America, endangering the lives of children and unsuspecting \npeople all across America, and that the Federal Government and the FDA \nfailed miserably in their responsibility to protect American consumers.\n  I wrote Secretary Thompson on August 6 and I said to him in the \nopening sentence:\n       The danger associated with dietary supplements containing \n     ephedra has become well documented. I believe our Government \n     has a special responsibility to make an immediate \n     determination on whether they pose a hazard to the American \n     consumers. It is within your authority to take the step and \n     suspend the sales of these supplements until their safety is \n     clearly and scientifically established.\n\n  I have spoken to Secretary Thompson about this on three separate \noccasions. We have exchanged correspondence. I have been in contact \nwith people in his agency and in the FDA, and I stand to report today \nthat nothing has been done, short of raiding the offices of the company \nthat makes Yellow Jackets, to find out if they violated the law. The \nSecretary and FDA have refused to acknowledge the danger of this \nproduct, refused to take action to protect American consumers. I am \ncalling on Secretary Thompson today, and I will continue to call on him \nto take the action necessary to protect American consumers. There is \nabsolutely no other recourse we can consider.\n  Is this a radical suggestion, that we would ban the sale of products \ncontaining ephedra? No, it is not. Let me be more specific. On January \n9 of this year, Canada--the Canadian health authority, known as Health \nCanada--banned the sale of many of these products in Canada. Why? When \nwe elicited testimony from them, from the consumer group in Canada, \nthey said the evidence was compelling and overwhelming that these \ndrugs, when sold as nutrition supplements, were killing Canadian \ncitizens. So in January they banned the sale of the product, like \nMetabolife, in Canada.\n  Within weeks, the American Medical Association sent an appeal to the \nFDA to do exactly the same thing in the United States--ban the sale of \nthese products to protect Americans. But nothing has been done.\n  Let me tell you something else that is curious. I don't know that \nthis has ever happened in the history of this country. Over 20 \ndifferent States have enacted their own State laws restricting the sale \nof products containing ephedra.\n  Think about that for a second. It is usually the Federal Government \nthat shows the leadership when it comes to protecting people against \ndangerous drugs and substances sold. In this case, exactly the opposite \nis the case; the States have seen the adverse consequences, the States \nunderstand the danger, and the States are moving ahead of the Federal \nGovernment. How bad is this, that our States are leading when it comes \nto national health standards, and the Federal Government is silent? And \nwhy?\n  I think there are two reasons. First, this industry--the dietary \nsupplementary industry--is a big political player. When I called for \nthis hearing on ephedra products, and particularly Metabolife, to \ninvestigate these adverse event reports and the cases that were showing \nup in court, I will tell you this: In 20 years of service on Capitol \nHill, I have never faced more political pressure in my life. I have \ntaken on the big tobacco companies and other pretty big players. On \nthis one, all of a sudden, my colleagues were saying: Dick, are you \nsure you want to have a hearing about Metabolife? Do you realize what a \nbig political player they are and this industry is? Do you realize how \ngood they have been to our party? Do you realize this person and that \nperson is associated with them?\n  I thought to myself, what in the world have I gotten into here? What \nI thought was a common investigation has become a big political deal. I \nwent ahead with it, and I am glad I did. Frankly, the evidence that \ncame out of there was overwhelming.\n\n  Do you know that in exchanges at military bases across America, the \nArmed Services have banned the sale of these same products that are \nbeing sold in convenience stores, gas stations, and drugstores across \nAmerica to children and unsuspecting people? There is a ban on military \nbases because they know that service men and women using them for \nenergy, or to lose weight, have had terrible health consequences.\n  The evidence continues to mount. Incidentally, these are the same \nproducts that have been banned by major sports organizations. Athletes \ncannot take these products containing ephedra, legally, if they want to \nparticipate in the Olympics, or professional football or collegiate \nathletics.\n  So you have the accumulated evidence about the danger of this \nproduct, and our Government fails to act. Why? It is because of the \npolitical clout of this industry and, secondly, the bureaucracy. The \nbureaucracy in this town moves so slowly that, frankly, the American \npeople should stand up and object in the most strenuous terms. To think \nwe have waited some 8 years for regulations to come out of the FDA \nabout dietary and nutritional supplements. To think that the people who \nwant to sell Metabolife, or want to sell these Yellow Jackets, can put \ningredients on the back of these bottles that, frankly, don't mean a \nthing to anybody--even a chemist, unless you are really into herbal \nmedicine. Cola nut extract? What will that do? I guess it is loaded \nwith caffeine, which with ephedra, is going to cause danger. And here \nis ginseng, so forth and so on. You can read these and you might say \nthe average consumer would not have a clue as to what they are putting \ninto their body.\n  Did I mention that in 1983 the FDA banned the sale of any combination \nof ephedrine and caffeine? You cannot buy an over-the-counter drug \nlegally that contains ephedrine and caffeine. That has been the case \nfor 19 years.\n  But do not worry you can still go out to the gas station and buy them \nas a dietary supplement such as Yellow Jackets or Metabolife. They have \nit all in there. How is that possible? We ban the sale of the product \nin drug stores, and yet we let it be sold to children in gas stations \nas dietary supplements. And that is a fact.\n  If you take a look at the number of organizations that have banned \nthis, not just Canada, and not just the recommendation of the American \nMedical\n\n[[Page S11675]]\n\nAssociation, and not just over 20 States that have restricted its \nsales, but major sports organizations, you come to the inescapable \nconclusion that this is a dangerous product, and yet it is sold to \nAmericans. The Food and Drug Administration sits on its hands doing \nvery little.\n  What is at issue, I am afraid, is now a growing philosophy that we \nhear from this administration of ``let the market work this out.'' The \nmarket worked it out for Sean Riggins, a 16-year-old high school \nfootball player, who lost his life because the marketplace would not \nrestrict the sale of the product.\n  Recently, I attended a high school reunion. I will not put on the \nrecord which one it was, but believe me, I am getting up there. I ran \ninto a friend of mine who sells products in gas stations in California. \nI talked to him about these Yellow Jackets and ephedra. He said that is \nthe biggest moneymaker in gas stations. It has a 100-percent markup.\n  He said: There is nothing else I sell in the gas station that is as \nprofitable as these Yellow Jackets. There is nothing like it. This is a \nbig winner. That is why we put it at the cash register.\n  I said: Are you worried about the impact this will have on kids?\n  He said: If this was dangerous, the Government would take it off the \nmarket.\n  We know it is dangerous, and this Government, under the Clinton \nadministration, as well as under the Bush administration, has failed to \ntake the necessary action to regulate the sale of this product to make \ncertain this product is safe and effective for American consumers and \nif unsafe to take it off the market.\n  I call on Secretary Thompson today--and I will continue to--to take \naction to protect Americans. Do not allow another boy to die in another \ntown in America. Do not let some unsuspecting 12, 13, 14 or 15-year-old \nlose his or her life because we failed to act, because we are cowered \nby the political muscle of groups like Metabolife because we are afraid \nwe would somehow be meddling in the marketplace if we came in and told \nthe consumers the truth about the danger of this drug and the fact it \nis not safe.\n  It is time for Secretary Thompson and the Food and Drug \nAdministration to accept their responsibility. To do less is to \nendanger the lives of unsuspecting Americans. I call on those who are \nin the business of running drugstores, gas stations, and convenience \nstores to have a conscience. Take these products from the front of the \ncash register and at least put them on the back counter, if not take \nthem out completely. Make certain that kids cannot get their hands on \nthem and misuse them; so they cannot get a buzz on them with the beer \nthey managed to get their hands on or a caffeinated soda or cannot take \nthem before a football game and end up dead like this poor young man in \nLincoln, IL.\n  This is, I believe, a moral imperative. I am hopeful that those \nacross America who understand how valuable the lives of our children \nare and how important it is for our Government to stand up and protect \nAmerican citizens will do something and do it quickly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the material to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         Logan County Coroner,\n\n                                     Lincoln, IL, October 9, 2002.\n     Hon.

Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to a great \nAmerican and friend, Senator Jesse Helms. I speak with mixed emotions. \nI am happy to see that after a long and distinguished career, he will \nhave more time with his wife Dot, his beloved wife of 60 years, as well \nas enjoying time with his children and grandchildren, but I know a man \nof this nature and capacity is impossible to replace.\n  In the words of the Weekly Standard, Executive Editor Fred Barnes \nwrote not too long ago:\n\n       His unflinching devotion to conservative principles has \n     made him a powerful figure. He is oblivious to the buzz, the \n     chatter, the gossip of the press and polls and the permanent \n     establishment. He is totally inner directed. He cares little \n     for details or process, but when someone clashes with his \n     conservative views, he steps up no matter how unpopular that \n     makes him. He wins some, he loses some, but he is always a \n     player who can be reckoned with even when he is acting alone.\n\n  I remember one such occasion when Senator Helms was acting alone in \nhis outspoken criticism of the United Nations. He refused to approve \npayment of U.N. dues until their lavish, bloated, and unwieldy \nbureaucracy--actually corrupt bureaucracy--was reformed. It went on for \nsome time.\n  They said he wanted to destroy the United Nations, and he said he \nwanted reform. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he was \nable to hold that legislation up, and he stayed firm. The mainstream \nmedia and activists chastised him. They tried to mock him, but he knew \nthere were great problems at the U.N., and he would not give in until \nit was improved. It should be told that in the end, the United Nations \ngave in. Reforms that will make the United Nations a better, more \nhonest, effective, and viable organization were passed, and the money \nwas released.\n\n  I do not want to attempt to catalog Senator Helms' accomplishments. \nHis record speaks well to that. It is quite clear others have spoken of \nthem in the last few days. People on both sides of the aisle have \ntalked about his remarkable service in this Senate. It does seem to me \nthat he has an unusual tenacity, an unusual commitment to principle.\n  Even when it might appear that he loses, sometimes he wins. For \nexample, even though he was unable to block the Chemical Weapons \nConvention, which he did oppose, he did win 28 of the 33 concessions or \namendments or changes in that treaty that he had asked for, making it a \nmuch better treaty in the end.\n  Senator Helms' career, of course, should not be focused entirely on \nforeign policy, although he was a leader in that area. As an Eagle \nScout myself, I really appreciated him standing up for the Boy Scouts. \nHe was quite eloquent in these issues that came up several years ago.\n  In the article I mentioned earlier by Fred Barnes, it concludes by \nasking if Jesse Helms can be replaced. Barnes' conclusion is similar to \nmine: That is a task that is ``probably more than we can hope for.''\n  I have tried to think about what makes him special, and here are a \nfew thoughts of mine. Others may disagree. Maybe this Senator would \ndisagree, but I believe his leaving this body is a significant event, \nand perhaps we should think about what has made him unique in his \nservice.\n  First, I believe Senator Helms is a provincial patriot. He really \nadmired Margaret Thatcher. I have heard him talk about her. It was \nremarked that Margaret Thatcher was a provincial, that she was a \ndaughter of a shop owner, and she had inculcated in her youth all the \nclassical values of England. That is what we have in Jesse\n\n[[Page S11676]]\n\nHelms. He has never been a part of the urbane crowd, the radical sheik \ncrowd. He knows it, and they know it. It galled them that he could not \nbe intimidated by an editorial in the New York Times or the Washington \nPost or some such event.\n  He is a man of faith, a Baptist. He comes from the soil of North \nCarolina, and he is proud of it. He prefers the affection and \ncommendation of those in his province over those in the great salons \nwhere the masters of the universe operate. In fact, he respects the \npeople of his beloved State and deeply shares their values. That is \nwhat he fought for every day.\n  The cynical, rootless left, the politically correct, those without \nprinciples, those who do not believe in truth, those who do not \ncomprehend the greatness of America were not for him.\n  Indeed, he saw them as the problem. And, at their core, these folks \nunderstood that, too. They knew his disagreement with their actions was \ndeep and honest. Try as they might, it would not go away.\n  I think some may have hated him for it, but Jesse Helms did not hate. \nHe absolutely does not hate. He only wants to do the right thing for \nAmerica because he values America over politics and because he is \ncourageous in his stand for principle, and he often would not be moved. \nThe left never understood it. Some thought he hated them, but he does \nnot. He loved them. He loves America. He wants a better life for all \nAmericans.\n  The truth is that Senator Helms is the most kind and considerate \nperson. His soft-spoken ways are known by all. His modesty and \nunassuming manner are plain for all to see. His wonderful wife Dot \nshares those same qualities and is loved by all who know her. He is a \ntrue Christian gentleman in the southern style--courtly, gracious, \nquick of wit, and firm in friendships. He is a most remarkable person, \nexceedingly intelligent, well read. No one here can turn a phrase \nbetter than Jesse Helms.\n  When he has been wrong or slow to understand, he has admitted it. His \nconversion to advocacy for a much stronger role of the United States in \nthe fight against AIDS in Africa is a very recent example. He even \napologized for being slow to understand the moral significance of that \ntragedy in Africa.\n  Finally, the career of Senator Helms cannot be discussed without \nremarking on the critical role he played in enabling the focus of \ndemocracy, free enterprise, and faith to triumph over the godless \ntotalitarian forces of communism. He was a constant cold warrior. He \nsaw the evil in the ``evil empire,'' and his drive to overcome it never \nslackened. He was relentless, even when undergoing attacks from the so-\ncalled opinion leaders of America. It certainly was not those opinion \nleaders and pundits who won the cold war. They blew hot and cold--\nmostly cold--on U.S. policies. But the people in the provinces knew. \nThey knew there could be no compromise with freedom and communism, and \nfortunately those people had a strong, able, and true voice in Jesse \nHelms. He stayed the course. The Soviet Union collapsed.\n  There were many close calls in that struggle and many highlights in \nthe battle of the cold war. One of those critical moments came when \nSenator Helms came to believe in Ronald Reagan and his view of the role \nof the United States in this struggle. Jesse worked hard, at a critical \npoint in Reagan's campaign, to produce a great victory in North \nCarolina that gave him the nomination and went on to allow him to be \nPresident. I have heard him speak about that moment.\n  Together, they persevered. The ``evil empire'' collapsed, and the \nvictory was won. That was a partnership of no small note. It was a \npartnership of historic importance.\n  Senator Helms, we appreciate you. You played a critical role in the \nstruggle for freedom. We thank you for your courage and consistency. \nAmerican freedom is in your debt, and we are obliged for your service.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11676-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11676-S11677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I rise today to say a simple thank you \nto a number of my retiring colleagues, good people who have done good \nthings to serve the citizens of their States but, more importantly, \nserve our Nation.\n  I particularly mention Max Cleland and Jean Carnahan, who are \nexceptional and special people. They are heroic in their own way, as \nthe term is truly defined. The courage and optimism they have shown in \ntheir lives strengthened mine. The grace they brought to their service \nin the Senate, to their States and the Nation, is truly remarkable.\n  Max Cleland does not need extensive description to know that he is a \npatriot, one who cares about America, worked hard to voice support for \nveterans and supports working people across this country.\n  I worked with him closely on the economic plans we thought would \nstimulate the economy. He is a remarkable winner. He came into New \nJersey and helped me as I was a fledgling, aspiring Senator. He took me \ninto worlds I had not known, and I truly will miss him, as will all of \nus in the Senate.\n  Jean Carnahan is my desk mate on my right, No. 96 out of 100, me \nbeing 97. We sat together, laughed together, worked together, learned \ntogether. She showed me how to be a little bit better at being a \nSenator than I might otherwise be. She is an inspiration. In her own \nlife, she dealt with tragedy and turned it into opportunity. A \nremarkable woman who truly cared about the people of Missouri and this \nNation, she brought great grace to everything she did.\n  Max Cleland and Jean Carnahan are an inspiration to the lives of all \nof us now and as we go forward. So I congratulate them in their service \nand celebrate their lives.\n  From a different perspective, less personal because I have worked \nless frequently with them and certainly have a different partisan \nperspective, but I commend their service and respectfully congratulate \nStrom Thurmond, Bob Smith, Jesse Helms, and Tim Hutchinson. They are \nremarkable people in their own right. Certainly, Strom Thurmond is \nsomeone with whom it is an honor to be in the Senate, to see the \ncourage he brought every day to his service in the Senate while I was \nhere, but to the Nation in general.\n  For years, Bob Smith, his great leadership on the environment I saw \nfirsthand as a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  I thank Jesse Helms and Tim Hutchinson for their service. Each has \nbeen a major contributor to America's political life and the \ndeliberations in this great body.\n  So, again, a simple thank you.\n  Finally, maybe most importantly, I want to say a few words about my \ncolleague, my political mentor and my friend, Bob Torricelli. Let me \nbegin by saying most certainly that, like Senator Torricelli himself, I \nwas deeply disappointed in his admitted errors of judgment. The \nsubsequent reprimand by the Ethics Committee was a most unfortunate \nblemish on a career and life of extraordinary service, certainly to the \npeople of New Jersey and I believe to the Nation.\n  In the fullness of time, we all are judged not always by one event in \nour lives; we are judged by the complete contribution we make or we do \nnot make. Senator Torricelli is one who has made many contributions to \nindividuals, to my State, and to the Nation. It is remarkable, frankly, \nthat his whole adult life has been dedicated to public service, \nstretching 20 years in elected office and probably 25, 26 years from \nhis early days in college.\n  He was a part of the political environment and public service, \nstarting as a deputy legislative counsel for New Jersey's Gov. Brendan \nByrne--I think that actually means he was his driver--but he was an \nimportant part of one of the most successful administrations and \nleadership of the State of New Jersey. A great man, Governor Byrne, \ngave Senator Torricelli his start.\n  Then he worked in the Carter White House with Vice President Mondale \nas a senior staff person, one who was close to many of the important \nissues in foreign affairs and domestic policy on which the Vice \nPresident worked.\n  In 1982, he was elected to the House of Representatives and served \nthere for 14 years, a strong, constant voice, a representative of New \nJersey. He worked on matters relating to transportation systems, \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S11677]]\n\nissues, concerns about our educational system, public housing, all \nthose things that make a big difference to the most densely populated \nState in the Nation--in the most densely populated county in our \nNation.\n  Senator Torricelli built an unimpeachable career in the House of \nRepresentatives and used that as a platform to be elected to the Senate \nin 1996--always, always a tough fighter, tough elections, tough fighter \nfor the issues he believed in, and particularly a tough fighter for New \nJersey.\n  Together we have been able to have a very positive and constructive \ndialog with the White House, with five judges appointed to district \ncourts, all as a package. This is a very important contribution to our \njudicial system, one where high-quality people agree to work. We were \npleased to work together to respond to the tragedy of September 11 and \nthe 691 families in New Jersey who lost a loved one, with regard to \nworking on the funds, to assure tax deductibility for families was \nallowed, making sure the New York-New Jersey metropolitan region was \nproperly or appropriately supported with financial resources. Bob \nTorricelli was a fighter for that.\n  He was a fighter for making sure we resisted domestic violence in the \nhome, provided more housing for battered women, pushed to take guns \naway from wife beaters and child abusers, fought for middle-class tax \nrelief.\n  Senator Torricelli and I did not always agree on some of the \nproposals. Some, we did. He certainly made a major contribution in our \nmost recent tax relief proposal that the President and the Senate and \nothers came to include, the college tuition tax deductibility, which he \nfought for, which was included, expanding deductions for student loans, \na tax credit for lifetime loan. All these are major contributions that \nwill live long beyond a term in the Senate.\n  He was a strong advocate for those suffering from Lou Gehrig's \ndisease, eliminating restrictive Medicare rules with regard to that. On \nforeign relations issues, he was a constant and ever-present voice to \nmake sure American foreign policy was broadly attentive to human rights \nand making sure America's interests were represented not only in \nmeaningful defense terms but that we were involved in carrying a strong \nposture with regard to the values in which we believe in the Nation.\n  Finally, we cannot talk about Senator Torricelli's efforts without \nhis strong political advocacy and representation of the need to make \nsure we have a strong two-party system in this country, with a voice, \nthat ideas are openly debated, and the public has a choice. He \ncertainly was most effective in leading the Democratic Senatorial \nCampaign Committee, but most importantly, in representing the view that \nwe need to have a debate about ideas.\n  It is with a sad sense, from my perspective as a close friend and \nsomeone who cares about another human being, that I congratulate him on \nservice and thank him for all he has done personally. But most \nimportantly, for the people of New Jersey, the people of this country, \nI thank him for his service to all for those 27 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I say to my colleague from New Jersey, \nthat is the most appropriate way to speak with regard to our party \ncolleagues, those two magical words understood by every American: Thank \nyou. If I may, I take that as my keynote and, likewise, make a few \ncomments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11677-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT--H.R. 695\n\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Madam President, this is a moment we look upon with mixed \nemotions: Yes, thank you for the service of these wonderful men and \nwomen and sadness of their departure; but to have the opportunity to \nsay a word or two about the legacy they leave.\n  This is the most extraordinary legislative body in the entire world. \nPeople have often asked me, When did you decide you were going to \nbecome a U.S. Senator or try for the Senate? I suppose I have never \nbeen able to give an adequate answer. But it is a privilege that few \nhave. For those who do succeed, what a rich reward this service is. It \nhas been for me, and I am now concluding my 24th year. In January, I \nwill start a quarter of a century of service in the Senate. That hardly \ncompares with my distinguished colleague from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, \nwho has been here these many years, but a quarter of a century is a \ngood start. I am privileged now that my State has reelected me for a \nfifth term.\n  But it has been with the help of my family, my immediate family. I \nshared breakfast with my eldest daughter. We talked about the years I \nhave been in public service and the opportunity I now have to continue \nin that public service. It has been a burden at times on the family but \none which any family would do, as every family here of those privileged \nto serve in this Chamber look upon that as a great reward.\n  I start with those colleagues who have served with me on the Senate \nArmed Services Committee and with my dear friend, Senator Thurmond. I \nremember so well when I was Secretary of the Navy and I would come up \nbefore the Armed Services Committee at various times, of course, in \nconnection with budget requests, but at other times I was called on the \ncarpet pretty thoroughly by Senator Thurmond during the war in Vietnam. \nI served 5 years and 4 months as the Navy Secretary. He used to \nquestion me. As the hearing ended, he would pull me over and say: Why \ndon't you think about coming to the Senate someday? I owe Senator \nThurmond a debt of gratitude for instilling in me the thoughts that \neventually led to my election to the Senate.\n  Senator Thurmond has touched every life with whom he has served in \nthis Chamber these many years. He has touched mine very deeply. He was \nsort of like the older brother I never had. There is not a Senator here \nwho, from time to time, does not quietly go and talk to the elder \nstatesmen in the Senate about problems they have. I have certainly \nshared many conversations with Senator Thurmond.\n  Both sides of the aisle, Senator John Stennis, Senator Scoop Jackson, \nSenator Barry Goldwater--he sat right over here--Senator John Tower. It \nhas been an enormous benefit to me to serve with, really, these giants \nof the Senate and those who served on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I was ranking on the committee for many years, and then, in a very \ncourteous manner, Senator Thurmond came to me one day and said he \nreally wanted to cap off his career serving as the head of the Armed \nServices Committee. So he succeeded me as ranking and then eventually \nbecame chairman of the committee.\n  Even though he had the title and I had stepped down as ranking and so \nforth, I worked with him very closely and learned a great deal. And \nstill, this last moment, last night, after he delivered his memorable \nfew final remarks to this body, we visited quietly together in the \nhallway.\n  Yes, Strom Thurmond, I thank you. I thank you for all you have done \nfor me and for all you have done for America.\n  Tom Brokaw has written about the greatest generation, those who \nserved in World War II. Strom Thurmond has had the most extraordinary \nof service. I remember one time he called me up and he said: John, the \nPresident has invited me to go with him to the D-Day beaches. It was \nthe 40th anniversary. It was the thinking of President Reagan at that \ntime, very wisely, that many of those veterans would not live to see \nthe 50th anniversary. So Strom embarked for the beaches of Normandy on \nthe 40th.\n  Howard Cannon, Democrat from Nevada, went with us. Howard Cannon had \ngone in on D-Day in a glider.\n  Lowell Weicker went with us. I remember his father had been Chief of \nthe Air Force Intelligence, 8th Air Force, Army Air Corps. So there \nwere just the four of us who went.\n  Strom Thurmond was assigned a helicopter right behind the President's\n\n[[Page S11678]]\n\nhelicopter and perhaps one with the Secret Service. We traveled up and \ndown the Normandy beaches for 2 days, visiting almost every single site \nwhere our troops were involved. I just remember it so well. I remember \none Member of the House of Representatives who joined us, beckoned to \nSenator Thurmond to come over, a Congressman from Florida. I will put \nhis name in the Record.\n  He said: Look, Strom, I can see the indentation where I dug my \nfoxhole.\n  Sure enough, there was the beach and an indentation was there. He was \nconsumed with emotion; Strom likewise. I remember these two men \nembraced on that spot.\n  There were other veterans, many of them there, who had participated \nin D-Day. I always respectfully kept a distance, a pace or two behind \nStrom Thurmond, who was a Major General in the National Guard, as he \nwas greeted warmly, and likewise shared moments, deep thought with \nthose veterans who had been there on that historic moment in American \nhistory. How well I remember that trip.\n  How well I always remember Strom Thurmond and what he has done for \nAmerica and what he did for this humble Senator. I served at the very \nend of World War II in the Navy, just in the training command, getting \nready for our overseas assignments when, God bless America, the war \nended. I was privileged to be a very minor part of the generation of \nStrom Thurmond.\n  Also on our committee was Tim Hutchinson. Tim was a fighter then. He \nis a fighter now. He stood over there on the floor last night, and we \ntalked a bit together. His spirits are high. He lost in a tough, \ncompetitive race. But he reflected on those achievements he was able to \nprovide for the men and women of the Armed Forces as the chairman of \nthe personnel subcommittee, when I was chairman of the committee, and \nthen as ranking.\n\n  Concurrent receipts is a very difficult issue, one that had to be \naddressed by the Congress. The distinguished Senator from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, and Senator Hutchinson, Senator Smith, Bob Smith, also a \nMember of the Armed Services Committee--I will speak about him \nmomentarily. Senator Levin and I joined that triumvirate and finally we \nhad what I call a measure of success on that issue.\n  It seemed to be irresolvable, irresolvable for many years that the \ncommittee addressed this issue. But finally we established a beachhead \nand, while it is not satisfactory to all, it is nevertheless a \nbeachhead for the first time in the history of the doctrine of \nconcurrent receipts, which goes back 100 years. It is not easy to set \naside 100 years of history to establish the beachhead we did.\n  Tim was in the forefront in that. He also joined in the leadership \nwhen we put TRICARE For Life through. Those who serve in the Armed \nForces of the United States always remember some of the circumstances \nwhen they came in and all the promises that were made when putting on \nthat uniform. Particularly those who became careerists and spent 20-\nplus years in, they always felt they were entitled to assisted care and \nmedical care and treatment for themselves and their families, which \nthey were, in large measure, promised through the years.\n  Put aside all of the legalities, nevertheless, to me it was a moral \ncommitment of this country, to provide that care. Tim Hutchinson joined \nme. I was then chairman. We were able to put that into law such that \nthat care now and for the indefinite future--so long as I am here, I \nwill fight to preserve it--will be made available to those career \nindividuals.\n  Pay raises--all types of things the personnel committee is \nresponsible for; again, the GI bill and other things. But I conclude \nwith Tim on one remark. The Commandant of the Marine Corps approached \nme the other day just to give me a little update. The retention, \nparticularly in the officer corps of the United States Marine Corps, is \nat the highest it has ever been in living memory. That comes about \nthrough many factors but the principal factor is the knowledge and the \nfeeling--whether it is in the Marine Corps, the Navy, the Army or the \nAir Force--that the Congress of the United States stands there to help \nthese individuals, and just to treat them fairly with regard to their \npay and benefits and the needs of their families.\n  Tim Hutchinson, I salute you. You did a marvelous job to care for the \nmen and women of the Armed Forces.\n  We also had Jean Carnahan serving on the committee. I remember so \nwell that she fought hard for the FA-18, a modern naval aircraft. Here \nis this really extraordinary figure who bore the brunt of such tragedy, \nto quickly come to the Senate of the United States and assume not only \nthe mantle of a Senator with the burdens of the office, under those \ntragic circumstances--I would say on her committee she performed very \nwell. We were proud to have her.\n  She was very gentle, a bit soft-spoken, but tenacious. So I wish that \nmember of our committee well as she departs.\n  Max Cleland: Max also was on the personnel committee, chairman and \nranking. Max was a fighter. Max bears the scars of war and those are \nthe scars of really a tenacious fighter. He carried that same measure \nof courage and tenacity here to his duties in the Senate. He fought \nhard for the GI bill. He fought hard for the F-22. That is our modern \nhigh altitude fighter. It has gone through a lot of trials and tough \ntimes, but it looks as if it is going to make it. In the next 20 to 25 \nyears, that aircraft, at those high altitudes, with the ability to \ninterdict any aircraft comparable in the world and have distinct \ntechnological advantages, and hopefully pilot advantages--it can \nprovide the security of the airspace for the other elements of our \nmilitary below that airspace, whether they be on land or on the sea.\n  Those familiar with warfare know if you do not have the space secure, \nthose beneath the airspace are in constant peril.\n  Thank you, Max, for the GI bill, for end-strength adjustments. He \nrecognized the stress being put on the men and women of the Armed \nForces today and their families and deployment. He fought hard to see \nthat those end strengths were in law, written such that the appropriate \nChiefs of Staff and the other civilians in the Pentagon could make the \nadjustments necessary to better care for the men and women of the Armed \nForces.\n  Max also has a very special place in my heart because, as I mentioned \nearlier, I was privileged to be Under Secretary and Secretary of the \nNavy for 5 years during Vietnam. I visited Vietnam a number of times. I \nvisited the aid stations where the wounded were brought straight from \nthe field of battle.\n  It is hard for people to realize, but those of us who were in the \nPentagon in charge of the military service during that period would sit \ndown each week and write some weeks 50, 60, and some weeks hundreds of \nletters to the families who lost their loved ones in the battles of \nVietnam. You don't forget that.\n  Each day that I was privileged to see this fine, strong American \nveteran brought back those memories for me in that period of history. \nAs I look back on it now, it was a period where perhaps we should have \nseen earlier on in that conflict a different way to proceed to try to \npreserve the integrity of the Government of South Vietnam before it \nfell. But that I will save for another day.\n  Max, I wish you well.\n  Of course, Max did another thing to this old Senator from Virginia. \nHe announced last night that he was going to get married. I think that \nleaves me now as the only bachelor in the Senate. Fred Thompson, of \nwhom I will speak now, bailed out on me. And now Max has bailed out on \nme. I am all alone in that category.\n  Fred Thompson: I remember there was a very successful advertisement \nyears ago. I can't remember it clearly, but it sort of characterizes \nFred Thompson. When he speaks, people listen. This is a man who has a \nremarkable presence--not only a commanding physical presence but an \nequally commanding strength of mind. And when he spoke, we listened, \nwhether it was here on the floor or within our caucuses or listening to \nhis speeches or when presiding over the Government Operations \nCommittee. People listened reverently as Senator Thompson spoke.\n  He also had a remarkable sense of humility. Those who have traveled \nthrough the Hollywood scene--some of which I have known in my \nlifetime--\n\n[[Page S11679]]\n\noften do not have a sense of humility. But Fred has. His capstone, I \nsuppose, was last night when I believe the vote was 90 to 7 for the \nhomeland defense bill about which he felt very strongly.\n  I think America will look back, and hopefully will look at a \nsuccessful piece of legislation to add to the bastion of defenses with \nwhich we must now defend this Nation.\n  Fred, we thank you for your work on that and wish you well with your \nyoung bride.\n  Phil Gramm: Few people realize it, but when we passed new highway \ntrust fund legislation some years ago in 1996, I was privileged at that \ntime to be chairman of the subcommittee of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee that was charged with the principal responsibility of \ndrafting the provisions of that historic piece of legislation which \nenabled each and every State to get a minimum of 90 cents return on \nthose tax dollars paid by citizens of those States and visitors when \nthey pumped a gallon of gas.\n\n  We had a very inequitable and unfair system of donor States and donee \nStates. The State of Virginia was a donor in that we only got 78 or 79 \ncents back, and the remainder of the Virginia drivers' Federal taxes \nwent to other States. There were some other States such as \nMassachusetts that got over a dollar, for what reason I have never been \nclear on. But Phil went back and examined the tax structures supporting \nthe highway trust fund.\n  President Clinton had put another 5-cent tax on and split it between \nthe highway trust fund and the general trust fund. Phil, as a member of \nthe Finance Committee, got that reversed. All 5 cents went to the \nhighway trust fund. Otherwise, the 50 States--I emphasize that--50 \nStates could not have gotten a substantial increase in those dollars \nnecessary for roads and bridges and other infrastructure measures to \nfacilitate transportation.\n  That, to me, is one of Phil's most significant accomplishments. He \nworked with us on the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \ntransportation committees of the House and Senate to ensure that \nAmerica got an equal and fair distribution of those highway trust fund \nmoneys.\n  Of course, Phil will always be remembered for his wit and for his \nwisdom--brilliant in both but equally controllable in both of those \nattributes. I say they are attributes. He is ever quick with the turn \nof a phrase, or a very insightful path to take to resolve a problem. \nMany times he stood up in our caucus to say this is a piece of \nlegislation which I believe should take this course, and our leadership \noften followed that advice.\n  We will miss you, Phil. But we will remember you, and we will \nremember you, as you say, with love and affection. Those are the words \nthat he used so often. Of course, he, along with Fred Thompson, was one \nof the principal architects of the homeland defense bill. And I am \nconfident that will in due course be a landmark piece of legislation \nthat will serve this country well.\n  Lastly, I speak of my colleague Bob Smith. Bob and I are friends \nbased on our loyalty and indebtedness to the U.S. Navy. Bob's father \nwas a very distinguished Naval officer in World War II. He fought in \nthe Navy, and he fought through a number of combat situations in the \nPacific to come home. And then his extraordinary capabilities in \naviation enabled him to become a test pilot. That is sort of the \nultimate desire of aviators--to become a test pilot to begin to push \nthe frontiers of aviation and develop those aircraft for successive \ngenerations to combat the enemies that are lurking against this \ncountry.\n  Bob's father had not been home from World War II but a few months \nwhen he was testing a plane that malfunctioned and he lost his life. \nBob was robbed of his father at a very early age. He carried that \nthought with him--as he does today--with complete reverence to what his \nfather did in the Navy. Bob served in the Navy himself during Vietnam. \nSo the Navy has a very strong bond between us.\n  I remember when he fought so hard right here on the floor--\noriginally, I didn't think it was a good idea, but I eventually decided \nto join him in going back to reexamine the circumstances of the USS \nIndianapolis. That was a remarkable chapter in Naval history. It was a \nmagnificent heavy cruiser. It was the last ship sunk by enemy action. I \ncould be wrong on some minor vessels, but the last capital ship sunk by \nan enemy action. A Japanese submarine sank that ship as it was making \nits way back to the Pacific theater to take up its position once again. \nIt had been out there earlier in the Pacific. This was another tour, \npositioned with our fleet, when, in moonlight--the captain was asleep--\nthat ship took a torpedo and went down.\n\n  A great many of the crew were lost when she went down. But a number \nsurvived and floated aimlessly in the oceans, suffering from the \ndeprivation of water and intense sunlight. Sharks actually came in and \nphysically devoured and maimed a number of those crewmen.\n  The Navy search for that ship will always be one of controversy, but \neventually a destroyer came alongside and found them.\n  I remember very well an officer on that destroyer was a proud \nVirginian, Graham Claytor, who eventually became Secretary of the Navy. \nHe followed me by a few years in the Navy secretariat. And he told me, \nfirsthand, about the appalling sight of those men who had been at sea \nsome several days, suffering extraordinary deprivation.\n  The captain was held accountable, court-martialed, and although it \ndwindled off in a certain way--it pretty well drummed up--Bob felt that \nthe captain had not received the full measure of justice to which he \nwas entitled. He fought on the floor of the Senate, and eventually the \nSenate voted to, in large measure, restore--although the captain was \nlong since dead--the equities, the recognition that he is entitled to \nfor his heroism on that ship.\n  So to this sailor, to this Vietnam veteran, who is so proud of the \nNavy, and who fought so hard when he was chairman of the Strategic \nSubcommittee in the Senate on missile defense--Bob, to this day, feels \nvery strongly, as do I, to have this Nation have a workable, early \ndeployable, limited missile defense system. Bob fought hard for that.\n  Every Senator cherishes the opportunity to provide for their State's \nNational Park Systems.\n  Frank, I thank you for helping me, over your many years in the \nSenate, to make additions to Virginia's Park System.\n  In particular, those initiatives, some of first legal impression, to \nmake private land available for viewing and study by the ever growing \nnumber of visitors interested in the civil war.\n  Thank you, Frank, for also being a ``Paul Revere'' on the need for a \nnational energy policy and the increasing need to free America from the \nbondage of reliance on imported energy.\n  We wish you and your wife good fortune as you are ``elevated'' to the \nGovernorship of Alaska.\n  So I again summarize simply by saying to my colleagues, thank you for \nall you did for this humble Member of the Senate. I wish each of you \nwell in your next chapter of distinguished careers. We shall remember \nyou here, one and all, in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I know that there is another Senator here, \nthe Senator from North Dakota, who wishes to get recognition. I was \ntold the Senator from Maine wished to get recognition, Senator Collins. \nShe is not here?\n  I will not detain my colleague from North Dakota long. And I did not \nsay I would, but I certainly meant to--I think of gentlemen as being \nvery special people, and I intended, as a gentleman, to yield to the \nlady from Maine first.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11679-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11679-S11683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          WISHING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD A HAPPY 85TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me observe, if no one has, as of \nyet, it is the 85th birthday today of our colleague from West Virginia, \nSenator Byrd.\n  I gave him a note a few moments ago, not only wishing him a happy \nbirthday but, on this last day of this Congress, saying to him how much \nall of us appreciate the fact he has given so many years of public \nservice to our country.\n\n[[Page S11680]]\n\n  I pointed out--if I might just continue for a moment--in a note to \nhim that as I read the book about John Adams by David McCullough, John \nAdams seemed, as they were trying to create this country, to write to \nAbigail, plaintively asking: Where will the leadership come from? Who \nwill emerge as the leaders of our great country?\n  As they put this country together, of course, the leaders were there. \nJohn Adams said: There is only us--George Washington, Mason, Madison, \nBen Franklin, and so on.\n  For over 2 centuries, the question before this democracy has been: \nWhere will the leadership come from? Where will the leadership emerge? \nThis country has been enormously blessed by having leaders emerge \nthroughout its history. A significant part of that history here in the \nSenate has been blessed with the leadership of one Senator Robert Byrd. \nSo today, on his 85th birthday, let me join his colleagues in wishing \nhim, on behalf of a grateful Nation, a hearty, happy 85th birthday, and \nmany more.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, will the Senator yield so I can join in \nthose well-deserved accolades?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague.\n  Madam President, I am very heartened by that news of the Senator's \n85th birthday. I proudly have attained 75, and I am hopeful I can \nsomeday stand here at 85, to not just stand but pursue my duties as a \nSenator, if that case may be, with just half the vigor and strength of \nmind as displayed by our esteemed colleague from West Virginia, for \nwhom I share the greatest affection, as he well knows.\n  We have adjoining States. There is a little line drawn between \ncertain areas which at one time was all Virginia. Nevertheless, we have \npeople so much alike in their needs. I often work with my colleague to \nmeet those needs. I thank him very much for this opportunity.\n  I thank my colleague and wish him well, he and his lovely wife.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I deeply thank my colleague from North \nDakota for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I thank \nmy friend from Virginia for what he has just said.\n  With respect to my birthday, I shall have more to say about that \nlater. But let me say, at this moment, I have listened to the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia extol the virtues of Senators who \nare leaving.\n  The Senator from Virginia is a gentleman. I have always felt that of \nhim. Being from the State of Virginia, he certainly exemplifies that \ntitle: A gentleman. I have always thought that about most men from \nVirginia.\n  Let me say, with reference to something that the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia said a moment ago--he spoke, I believe, about his \ndaughter. He spoke glowingly about his daughter. That struck a note in \nmy memory.\n  It was on July 11, 1804, that a duel took place at Weehawken, NJ--a \nmost fateful duel at a time in our history when many fateful duels were \nfought.\n  On this occasion, Alexander Hamilton, who was only 30 years of age at \nthe time of the Philadelphia Convention--the Constitutional Convention, \nin which he, Alexander Hamilton, took part--he was only 30 at that \ntime. Madison was 36. Franklin was 81. Jonathan Dayton, whose relative, \nwhose kinsman, sits from time to time in that chair before the Senate--\nthe kinsman of whom I am thinking is named Mark Dayton, a Senator from \nthe State of Minnesota--that kinsman of Mark Dayton was named Jonathan \nDayton. He was the youngest man at the Convention, 26 years of age. \nCharles Pinckney of South Carolina was 28 or 29. But Dayton was the \nyoungest man at the Convention. Hamilton was 30.\n\n  Hamilton sat at that Convention. Hamilton went on to fight this \nterrible duel, and he was mortally wounded in that duel on July 11, one \nweek following July 4. In that day and time there were no anaesthetics; \nthe marvels of medicine had not come along as we know them. Of course, \nHarvey, that great Englishman, had discovered the circulation of the \nblood. He had discovered how the blood circulates through the veins and \narteries. That was his theory.\n  But now back to this awful night of July 11. There with his seven \nchildren about his bed and his weeping wife, the little children \nweeping throughout that awful night of pain when the blood from the \nwound gathered in his stomach. There he lay. The next day, that great \nman Hamilton died, on July 12.\n  The man who was the Vice President of the United States, Aaron Burr, \nwas the man who won that duel--Aaron Burr, Vice President of the United \nStates. I have often referred to him as the great enigma, Aaron Burr.\n  I remember he said when he left the Senate, when he walked out of the \ndoor of the Old Senate Chamber, down the hall here, for the last time, \nhe said to his fellow Senators: This house is a sanctuary, a citadel of \nlaw, of order, and of liberty. And it is here, it is here, here if \nanywhere, in this exalted refuge will resistance be made to the storms \nof political frenzy and the silent arts of corruption. And if the \nConstitution be destined ever to be at the sacrilegious hands of the \ndemagogue or the usurper, it will be witnessed on this floor--meaning \nthe death of the Constitution--if it be destined ever to succumb to the \nsacrilegious hands of the demagogue or the usurper, may God avert, its \nexpiring agonies will be witnessed on this floor.\n  Now, why do I refer to Aaron Burr at this moment? Aaron Burr had a \ndaughter. And the Virginia Senator's words about his daughter brought \nthis to my mind. Aaron Burr had a daughter. Aaron Burr went on to go \nover to West Virginia to connive with an Irishman over there who lived \nin the area of Parkersburg. The Irishman's name was Blennerhassett. \nThere is an island over there named Blennerhassett Island. And Aaron \nBurr talked with Blennerhassett, this wealthy Irishman, about setting \nup an empire in the Southwest.\n  In any event, Aaron Burr was arrested and brought to trial. And \nThomas Jefferson, his mortal enemy, had a great deal to do with that \ntrial. But that is a bit here and a bit there.\n  What I am remembering especially about Aaron Burr is he had a \ndaughter. Here was this man who had killed Alexander Hamilton. He was a \nmurderer. He intended to kill; no doubt in anybody's mind, he meant to \nkill Hamilton. Hamilton did not intend to shoot to kill in that duel. \nHamilton intended, it is widely believed, to fire into the air, not to \nkill Burr. But Burr intended to kill, and Burr did kill Alexander \nHamilton.\n  We look at that dark side of Aaron Burr, this enigmatic brilliant \nman, Vice President of the United States, that dark side of this \nmysterious man. But there was a good side to this man. He fairly \nworshipped this daughter, Theodosia. And she loved her father very \ndeeply. And upon this particular occasion, she left Georgia in a boat \nor a ship, and there was Aaron Burr, expecting her to arrive, looking \nforward to her arrival, loving this daughter as he did. She never \narrived.\n  The ship encountered a storm and was never heard of again. And so \ndied Theodosia, the daughter of Aaron Burr. And Aaron Burr, after that \ndreadful happening, this man who had killed Alexander Hamilton, one of \nthe great founders of this country, Aaron Burr for years would go down \nto the seashore and stand for hours looking out upon the sad and solemn \nsea, seemingly to be looking for that ship that never came in, the ship \nthat was carrying his daughter. He stood and looked out on the sea. \nWhen Aaron Burr came to his last days on this Earth, he, while lying in \nhis bed, positioned himself so that he could see there on the wall in \nfront of him a picture of that daughter, Theodosia.\n\n  When the streams of early sunlight first entered into his room, there \nwas Theodosia in front of Aaron Burr, that loving father. When the \nshades of night had fallen and night, with her sabled robes, had closed \nthe light of day for the last moment, he could see in the dim light the \npicture of that daughter, Theodosia.\n  Well, that was a side of Aaron Burr that not many people know about. \nA good many years ago, I went to the Library of Congress and went to \nthe rare books section and sought out this bit of material because I \nwas researching the life of Aaron Burr. I had intended to put such a \nchapter into my ``History of the Senate, 1789-1989.'' I intended to put \na chapter on Aaron Burr, the great enigma, in that book.\n\n[[Page S11681]]\n\n  There were two chapters I wrote that I never put into the book. That \nwas one. The other was about two great West Virginia Senators, Senator \nJohn Kenna--it is a very interesting story about John Kenna and what he \nhad to do with the location of the Capitol in Charleston. I will not \ntell that today. The other great Senator from West Virginia I wrote \nabout was Henry Hatfield, a Republican. So I wrote about one Democrat \nand one Republican.\n  In writing those chapters, I went into the rare books section of the \nLibrary of Congress, and among those tomes I fished out this story, and \nmany more, about Aaron Burr. It was there that I discovered that this \nman with such an evil, mean spirit, with the lust to kill Alexander \nHamilton, because he hated Hamilton--he challenged this man whom he \nhated to a duel, and Hamilton, being a man of honor, charged Burr with \nhaving said things concerning the honor and patriotism of Burr. In \nthose days, they fought duels about honor.\n  How many men in this Chamber would die today for honor? Well, in \nthose days they did.\n  The thing I want to say again is, here was this man, this evil \nspirit. I can envision his lying awake at night thinking of how he \nwould like to kill Alexander Hamilton--and he did kill him. But there \nwas another side to Burr--a very tender, loving side. He loved his \ndaughter Theodosia.\n  So the Senator from Virginia, when he spoke of his daughter--I have \ntwo daughters also, but when he spoke of his daughter, it reminded me \nof Aaron Burr, that great enigma, and how he, too, had a daughter he \nloved and treasured.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I enjoyed that story. I have a great and abiding love for \nmy eldest daughter. I think at that point, I depart from the background \nof Aaron Burr and his other features, but I would not suggest in any \nway that you were drawing an analogy. I found the story fascinating.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, that is a given. What the Senator talked \nabout the love for his daughter, that is a given. I wasn't attempting \nto connect the Senator from Virginia with Aaron Burr in that respect. \nThe Senator spoke of his daughter, and it awakened memories in my own \nmind. Burr was a great man, a brilliant man, Vice President of the \nUnited States. He killed one of the Founders of this Republic of ours--\nnot this democracy, but this Republic. And he meant to kill him. In \nthose days, they fought duels to kill.\n  Well, enough about dueling.\n  (Mr. Barkley assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from West Virginia yield for a moment?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was watching the monitor in my office \nand noted that Senator Byrd was speaking. Senator Reid and I noted as \nwe were watching on television that while the Senator from West \nVirginia celebrates his 85th birthday, he looks today like a man 25 \nyears younger than 85. He looks youthful, vibrant, and rested. We all \nremarked as to how it would be possible for him to look as good as he \ndoes after the weeks he has had, the hours he has spent on this floor. \nHe has regaled us with yet another story and has reminded us that, \nwhile on birthdays it is commonplace in our country and traditional to \ngive gifts to those who are celebrating, it is another reminder of what \na gift he is to us. He is a treasure, and we love him for so many \nreasons, but we especially acknowledge that treasure on this day, given \nhis physical appearance, his eloquence, and his lessons from history. I \nthank him for that.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am grateful indeed for these encomiums \nbeing said by my colleagues. I deeply appreciate what the distinguished \nmajority leader has just said. I appreciate his friendship on this day \nand the friendship of so many of my colleagues. I shall always treasure \nthe words he has spoken on this day.\n  Oh, to be 70 again. The Lord has blessed me. I see his blessing in \neach of us. He has blessed me extraordinarily. Plato thanked the gods \nfor his being a man. He also thanked the gods for his being a Greek. \nAnd he thanked the gods for having permitted him to live in the age of \nSophocles. Well, I thank God on this day for what he has given to me. \nAnd I don't deserve it. I don't deserve the things God has given to me.\n  But for God, but for Him and his gracious mercy, I could have been in \na penitentiary today; I could have been dead today many times over. It \nwas a mother's wish that I be given to the wonderful couple who raised \nme. That mother died on the night of Armistice Day, November 11, 1918. \nI was just a week short of being a year old.\n  To go on, I thank God for a wife of more than 65 years. I am trying \nto think of a great Greek. The name starts with an A. He was a great \norator. It was not Aristides. It was a very common name in ancient \nhistory, but when he in a speech could not think of the right word, he \npaused until the right word came to his mind. He paused.\n  He was not like today's speakers, many of whom when they cannot think \nof a right word they say: You know, you know, you know. That is a mind \nthat is not in sync with the tongue--you know, you know, you know. Not \nthis man, a great--Alcibiades. No. Anyhow, I thank God for having \nspared my life on many occasions and for giving me the opportunity to \nserve in this body.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator in the Chair, who has been here \nonly a few days and who will be with us but a few days more, I could go \nhome today, and I could write a letter to the Disbursing Office and say \nI am retiring tomorrow. I doubt that I would know the difference in my \ncheck that I get every month, twice a month. I doubt that I would know \nthe difference between that check after I had gone home and sat down \nwith my wife of 65 years, who is probably worrying, and in some manner \nof thinking that is where I ought to be, but I would get practically \nthe same amount of money I would receive as a Senator. So I am not here \ntoday for my payroll, and I probably could earn much more money not \nbeing Senator or go on some board or be a lobbyist, if I ever deign to \nbe one. I could probably get a lot more money. I do have grandchildren, \nand my wife and I have great-grandchildren. I probably ought to try to \nleave them as much money as I can leave them. But that has never been \nmy desire. Wealth has never been a goal of mine.\n  My only goal is to serve this country, and I have been here 50 years \ncome this January 3. Having studied the history of the Romans, the \nGreeks, the Persians, the people of the British Isles, and our own \ncolonial forebears, my roots of love and admiration and respect for \nthis country's Constitution, this country's history, colonial history, \nour forebears is so deep with me. That is why I am here.\n  I want to say that in the vote last evening, of which we had nine \nvotes--who saw the same thing as I saw at the end--I saw on TV this \nmorning that four of those nine were the oldest in seniority Members of \nthe Senate: Byrd, Kennedy, Hollings, and Inouye, the four oldest and \nsenior. Paul Sarbanes, our dear friend from Maryland among the nine, \nbut these are the four senior Democrats, and they voted as I did.\n  Do you think we collaborated about that? Does the Chair think--I am \nnot asking for an answer; the Chair cannot respond--but does the Chair \nfor a moment think that these nine Senators talked ahead of the vote \nand said: Will you vote this way? I am going to vote this way. I hope \nyou will vote this way. How are you going to vote? Never a word. I \nnever knew who those Senators were going to be and did not know who \nthey were until after the vote.\n  I say that to say this: I serve here because I want to serve here and \nbecause the people of West Virginia want me to serve. They do not all \nagree with me. I do not seek to curry favor at home or here. But I do \nwhat I think best, and I like that Constitution. I want to compliment, \nI want to express my deep appreciation to those other eight Senators on \nthis side of the aisle, one of them an Independent, Jim Jeffords of \nVermont. These men gave up something when they did that. They are going \nto meet that vote down the road probably one day when they run for \nreelection.\n\n  Did it deter them? No, not for a moment. Nor did they do it because I \nasked them to do it. I would not have had the temerity to ask them to \ndo it. I would have no business asking them\n\n[[Page S11682]]\n\nto do that. I spoke my mind, they spoke theirs, and they voted their \nway.\n  Some of the Senators came to me afterward and while the vote was \ngoing on and said: Senator, I have been with you down to this point, \nbut I am going to vote for this bill. They were kind enough--they did \nnot have to do that. They did not have to come to me and tell me they \nwere going to vote that way.\n  I had them come right here to me and say: Senator, I am going to \nleave you on this one. I have been with you thus far, but looking at \nthe overall picture, I am going to vote the other way.\n  It was nice of them to do that. I thought it showed a tremendous \nrespect for my viewpoint, and they did it on their own. They did not \nowe me anything. They did not need to tell me how they were going to \nvote. But how good of them to come to me and say: I am going to vote \nthe other way.\n  Does the Senator from North Dakota wish to speak again? I will be \nhappy to yield. I have said about everything I want to say.\n  I am going to yield the floor now, but I just want to pay homage to \nthese other eight Senators. I am sure it was more difficult for any one \nof them to vote against the homeland security bill than it was for me \nbecause I cut this out in the beginning. I saw where it was going. I \nwas determined not to be for this kind of thing because it was shifting \npower from the legislative branch to the executive branch. I am not for \nthat. I was not at the beginning when I first said we ought to have a \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  That was the course I took. If it meant standing alone, that was all \nright. I did not mind being the only vote against it. But I never did \nit with any thought that my speeches would change anybody's mind. That \nwas not it.\n  Why did I speak that way, knowing that this was almost a foregone \nconclusion? Not because I was trying to convince any of my colleagues \nor believing that my speeches would. I spoke for my grandchildren, for \nmy grandchildren's grandchildren, and for future Senators who will be \nin this body. The record that was made will be a record until the crack \nof doom, be it 1,000 years, 10,000 years, or a million. If this \nRepublic still exists, those words will be there. That is not my words \nso much that count, but these were words in support of the Constitution \nof the United States and of the institution of the Senate. That was my \ntotal feeling.\n  I was well rewarded, exceedingly well rewarded, with the supporting \nvotes of eight other Senators, and the supporting thoughts and words of \nSenators on this side even beyond that. So I was well paid. I pay \nhomage to these Senators who stood on their feet and reached this \nconclusion themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I know the able Senator from North \nDakota has been waiting, but I want to take a moment, with his \nindulgence.\n  I take this opportunity to wish the very able and distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia, and my good friend, Robert C. Byrd, a very \nhappy birthday. There is no doubt that this institution is a better and \nstronger place because of not only his presence but his leadership and \ninfluence in helping to shape the Senate over decades. We are all \nenormously appreciative and grateful to him for that.\n  He carries the Constitution in his pocket. He understands the \nconstitutional structure of our Nation and the role of the Senate \nwithin that constitutional structure. I have always greatly admired the \nfact that he is what I would call a constitutionalist. He understands \nthat we have to have strong institutions in order to make \nrepresentative democracy work. Without those strong institutions, we \nare in great danger of losing our liberties and the balance that has \nserved this Republic so well for more than two centuries. I join my \ncolleagues and pay respect to him today on his birthday.\n  In today's New York Times, there is a wonderful story about the \ndistinguished Senator. I ask unanimous consent that the article be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is headlined: ``Byrd, at 85, Fills the Forum With \nRomans and Wrath.''\n  They should have gone on and added one other thing. They should have \nsaid ``and wisdom,'' because that is exactly what he has provided to \nall of us. We are appreciative to him for it, and we wish him a happy \nbirthday, and many more.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the distinguished Democratic whip \nspeaks, I feel I must say this, and I must say it now, right at this \npoint. Here is a true son of Athens. This is a true son of Sophocles, \nand Socrates and Plato and, yes, one more. I had it on my tongue just a \nmoment ago. Not Alcibiades, but a man whose name I was trying to think \nof earlier. It came to me while the Senator was speaking. I am sorry \nbecause this really is ruined by what I wanted to say. That great Greek \nwho left Athens and who went to the--what was that other part of Greece \nthat had the emphasis always on----\n  Mr. REID. Sparta?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, went to Sparta. He went to Sparta. But anyhow, I just \nwanted to make reference to that and how this man who has been here--we \nhave worked together so long, and now he said these things. I keep \nbeing bothered in what I am saying. I am trying to come up with the \nname. It will come to me.\n  Mr. REID. Make one up. We would not know the difference anyway.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. REID. I asked the Senator to yield because I wanted to, through \nthe Chair, mention a word about you.\n  Mr. BYRD. The name that keeps bothering me is Aristides. But this was \nAlcibiades. He was a great speaker, and when he could not think of a \nword, he paused. He just stopped. He did not say, ``you know, you \nknow,'' or, ``ah, oh, ah, you know, ah, you know.'' He paused.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland very much.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Through the Chair, I wish Senator Byrd happy birthday. But \nI also want to say the Senator from Maryland, as we all know, is a \nRhodes scholar. Being a Rhodes scholar is a tremendous distinction. \nThose of us who work with the Senator from Maryland know he deserved \nthat academic opportunity, and certainly he has fulfilled anything that \nthey thought could be done or should be done, and he is still doing \nsuch great things.\n  I am not a Rhodes scholar. I am a Byrd scholar. I have been trained \nfor 20 years being a Byrd scholar. I have so far to go. I do not know \nmany of the Greek names. I have listened intently to the speeches given \non this Senate floor on the fall of the Roman Empire. As my \ndistinguished friend knows, a professor who has since retired taught a \ncourse at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas on the Byrd speeches \ndealing with the Roman Empire. I have picked up a few traits from the \nSenator from West Virginia. I have my Constitution with me every day.\n  I have had a wonderful life, but this life has been made so much more \nfull as a result of having become a Byrd scholar.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 20, 2002]\n\n           Byrd, at 85, Fills the Forum With Romans and Wrath\n\n                           (By John Tierney)\n\n       Washington, Nov. 19.--As his colleagues hurriedly tried to \n     give the president a domestic security bill, Senator Robert \n     C. Byrd took the floor this morning to tell them of a ``truly \n     great'' senator from the first century A.D. named Helvidius \n     Priscus. One day this Roman was met outside the senate by the \n     emperor Vespasian, who threatened to execute him if he spoke \n     too freely.\n       ``And so both did their parts,'' Mr. Byrd said. ``Helvidius \n     Priscus spoke his mind; the emperor Vespasian killed him. In \n     this effeminate age it is instructive to read of courage. \n     There are members of the U.S. Senate and House who are \n     terrified apparently if the president of the United States \n     tells them, urges them, to vote a certain way that may be \n     against their belief.''\n       Mr Byrd, of course, is not one of those timid souls, and \n     his recent speeches have been extraordinary even for the \n     maestro of senatorial rhetoric, who turns 85 on Wednesday. \n     While his colleagues have debated the fine points of the \n     domestic security bill, he has been virtually alone in asking \n     the larger question: Why is this new department suddenly so \n     necessary? What will the largest and hastiest reorganization \n     of the federal government in half a century do besides allow \n     politicians to claim instant credit for fighting terrorism?\n       ``This mon-stros-ity,'' Mr. Byrd has been calling the bill, \n     repeatedly lifting its 484 pages above his head with \n     trembling hands\n\n[[Page S11683]]\n\n     and flinging them down on his desk with the fury of Moses \n     smashing the tablets. Mr. Byrd used to be known less for his \n     distaste of federal bureaucracy than for his love of federal \n     aid--he once vowed to be West Virginia's ``billion-dollar \n     industry,'' while his critics crowned him the ``prince of \n     pork.'' But now he is riffing against big government.\n       ``Osama bin Laden is still alive and plotting more attacks \n     while we play bureaucratic shuffle-board,'' Mr. Byrd told the \n     Senate. ``With a battle plan like the Bush administration is \n     proposing, instead of crossing the Delaware River to capture \n     the Hessian soldiers on Christmas Day, George Washington \n     would have stayed on his side of the river and built a \n     bureaucracy.'' Mr. Byrd imagined Nathan Hall declaring, ``I \n     have but one life to lose for my bureaucracy,'' and Commodore \n     Oliver Perry hoisting a flag on his ship with the rallying \n     cry, ``Don't give up the bureaucracy!''\n       It would not be strictly accurate to say that Mr. Byrd's \n     speeches have fallen on deaf ears in the Senate, since the \n     chamber was mostly empty when he spoke. But thanks to C-\n     Span, his recent oratory has won this traditional Democrat \n     new allies across the political spectrum--from Barbra \n     Streisand to Phyllis Schlafly, according to the letters \n     his office has received. While liberals have hailed his \n     opposition to the president on Iraq, which generated more \n     than 50,000 letters, conservatives have joined him in \n     warning of a threat to privacy from the domestic security \n     bill.\n       As he was waiting to speak on the floor yet again this \n     afternoon, Mr. Byrd sat in his office and marveled at the \n     rush to pass the bill.\n       ``That Department of Homeland Security will not add one \n     whit of security in the near future to the American people,'' \n     he said. ``In the meantime, the terrorists are going to be \n     very busy. I'm concerned that in our drive to focus on the \n     war in Iraq and the Department of Homeland Security, we're \n     going to be taking our eyes off what the terrorists may do to \n     us.''\n       Mr. Byrd advocated slowly creating the department, with \n     Congress overseeing the process, and he pulled out the ever-\n     present copy of the Constitution from his breast pocket to \n     make his point. ``We're being recreant in turning over to \n     this president the power shift that is included in that \n     bill,'' he said.\n       One Democrat senator who voted for the domestic security \n     department said he and his colleagues were exasperated by Mr. \n     Byrd's delaying tactics on this and other measures.\n       ``More and more of our members feel he's dragging it on and \n     on ad infinitum, which is not necessary,'' that senator said. \n     ``Make your point. Have a vote. And move on. He's not willing \n     to do that. He's from a different school. At some point you \n     have to say, `Enough is enough.' ''\n       That senator, acknowledging that Mr. Byrd is a powerful \n     colleague, declined to be named publicly, saying, ``I'll get \n     killed.''\n       Mr. Byrd's long speeches have irritated some of his \n     colleagues anxious to adjourn, but he has his defenders even \n     across the aisle.\n       ``I don't happen to agree with Senator Byrd's position on \n     homeland security, but he deserves to be heard,'' said \n     Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska. ``Some senators \n     think we ought to be on a bus schedule, but I don't have any \n     sympathy for people whining about being delayed. This is our \n     job. I agree with Senator Byrd that we sometimes need to \n     spend more time considering issues as important as this.''\n       Mr. Byrd, who will celebrate his 50th anniversary in \n     Congress in January, said he had no illusions that his \n     oratory was going to change the outcome of the final vote. So \n     why was he on the floor day after day? What was he \n     accomplishing?\n       ``To me, that question misses the point, with all due \n     respect to you for asking it,'' he said. ``To me, that matter \n     is there for a thousand years in the record. I stood for the \n     Constitution. I stood for the institution. If it isn't heard \n     today, there'll be some future member who will come through \n     and will comb these tomes.''\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11685-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S11685]]\n                        House of Representatives\n\nThe House was not in session today.

Mr. President, I come to offer a few remarks today about \nthe end of this legislative session. But of course, as is always the \ncase when I have an opportunity to sit in this Chamber and listen to my \ncolleague, Senator Byrd, I learn a great deal, and it is always a joy \nto do so.\n  I am going to be very brief. I have to make a speech to a convention \nat a hotel near the Capitol in a few minutes, but I did want to say at \nthe end of this session, and especially after the election of this \nyear, something about what I believe is ahead of us.\n  We have just gone through an election. That is the exercise that the \nlate Claude Pepper used to describe as the miracle in the U.S. \nConstitution. He said every second year our Constitution provides that \nthe American people are able to grab the steering wheel of this country \nand decide which way to nudge our country, which direction to provide \nAmerica. So that is what the elections are about.\n  This election is described by some in the press as dispiriting and \ndisquieting to those of us on the Democratic side of the aisle. To me, \nit is not dispiriting or disquieting. I wish the election had gone \ndifferently, but over two cen-\nNOTICE\n\nIf the 107th Congress, 2d Session, adjourns sine die on or before \nNovember 22, 2002, a final issue of the Congressional Record for \nthe 107th Congress, 2d Session, will be published on Monday, \nDecember 16, 2002, in order to permit Members to revise and extend \ntheir remarks.\nAll material for insertion must be signed by the Member and \ndelivered to the respective offices of the Official Reporters of \nDebates (Room HT-60 or S-123 of the Capitol), Monday through \nFriday, between the hours of 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. through \nFriday, December 13.

The election described a government by \nthe American people as a government that is very divided. The House of \nRepresentatives they chose is about 51 percent Republican, 49 percent \nDemocrat. The Senate they have chosen is about 51 Republican, 49 \nDemocrat. Of course, there is a special election in Louisiana in \nDecember that may alter that.\n  The point is the American people have chosen a very closely divided \ngovernment. That is not dispiriting to me at all.\n\n  We are able, those who come to this passion and this public calling, \nto look ahead to great challenges in our country and understand with \nthe President and with the cooperation of Democrats and Republicans, we \nhave to work together to meet these challenges. The change in the \nSenate from a Democratic majority to a Republican majority is not much \nof a change, after all, because it simply moves a couple of seats \naround. It is now 51 to 49 instead of 50 to 49 to 1.\n  The fact is, in order to get things done to meet the challenges we \nface in America, we must find ways to work together. The art of this \ndemocracy working is through compromise. There are some who come here \nand decide to say, here is what I believe and I will not move from that \npoint in the compass. I will not accept anything less than that which I \nbelieve today, on Wednesday.\n  That is not the way to get things done. We will be best served as we \nmeet significant challenges ahead if we, the President and all in the \nSenate, understand we serve the same master; that is, the American \npeople. And we want for this country the same thing: To do well, to \ngrow, to prosper, to be safe, to be secure.\n  Much of the agenda we work on, especially on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle, is an agenda that is almost timeless, the things people sit \nat the supper table in the evening and talk about, as they have supper \ntogether as a family. These are the things we have worked on for \ndecades. Questions that a family asks: Do I have a good job? Does dad \nor mom have a good job? Does it pay well? Does it offer job security? \nDo grandpa and grandma have access to decent health care now they have \nreached their declining income years? Are we sending our children to \nschools we are proud of? Are our children entering a schoolroom door \nthat is the best we can make it? Do we live in a safe neighborhood, \nfree from crime? Is our country safe? Is the security of America safe? \nThese are issues the families care about and are issues we work on in \nthe Congress and the Senate.\n  There are some who come to public service with a very critical \nmessage of our country; it is the easiest thing in the world. It takes \nno talent at all. I could demonstrate it in 2 minutes. The easiest \nthing in the world is to take a flaw in our system and hold it to the \nlight and say, look at this, isn't this ugly? Look at this \nimperfection, isn't it ugly? Yes, it is a flaw and an imperfection and \nthere are many in our great country.\n  But that is not the norm in America. We have industries that spring \nup looking at our imperfections. We have television programs that \nentertain the American people with other people's dysfunctional \nbehavior, and they get great ratings. But it is not the main of what \nAmerica is about. It is so easy to give the negative side. I am tempted \nbut I will not; in 2 minutes I can recite the awful things about our \ncountry. We have people who are professionals doing it on radio and \ntelevision and in politics every day: Look how awful this place is.\n  It is not awful at all. This country is a country born of the courage \nand blood of patriots. It is a country that survived the Civil War. It \nhas overcome a depression; beat back the forces of Hitler, Nazism. It \nis a country that has done what no other country has done. It has built \nthe strongest economic engine for growth and opportunity for people in \nthe world. It has split the atom, spliced genes, cloned animals, \ninventions too numerous to mention. It is a country that had people \nbuild airplanes and learn to fly them, had people build rockets and go \nto the moon and walk on the moon. Along the way, it cured smallpox and \npolio, invented the telephone, the television, the computer.\n\n  It is a strong country with a resilient people, people who live in \ncommunities and help each other, who care about their kids, care about \ntheir future. Gregg Easterbrook wrote ``America the OK.'' I like the \ntitle--and the book. I like the title because it describes a different \nattitude about America, ``America the OK.'' That book came out some \nwhile ago but came out at a time when, as is usually the case, there \nwere so many voices talking how awful things were in America.\n  There is not a better place on Earth to live. We are lucky to be \nAmericans. We are lucky to be alive now.\n  When I mention the challenges ahead, first and foremost is a national \nsecurity challenge. That is an awesome challenge. There is no question \nthat the September 11 tragedy that befell our country and killed so \nmany innocent American citizens reminds all this is a big, troubled \nworld in many respects and national security is very important, as is \nhomeland security. We must find ways to work together in a big, free, \nand open country, to provide some assurance of security for the \nAmerican people. We must do that without diminishing the basic civil \nliberties that exist in our Constitution for the American people.\n  This discussion about a national identification card, about a \ndatabase in which they will data mine all the information about \npeople's lives to find out if there is somebody doing something \nuntoward, that is not the way to approach providing security for our \ncountry, by diminishing the basic civil rights in our country.\n  We face this very significant threat from Osama bin Laden, who \napparently still lives. I might say, in the early part of this year I \nwas in Afghanistan, I flew from Tajikistan-Uzbekistan to Baghram \nAirbase in Afghanistan, myself, Senator Daschle and others. Flying over \nthe mountains of Afghanistan, preparing to land at Baghram, I looked \ndown at the hills and understood deep in those caves were terrorists \nled by Osama bin Laden plotting the murder of innocent Americans by \ncrashing airplanes into the World Trade Center. You understand \nespecially more than ever when you look on the mountains that we cannot \never be oblivious to what is going on in the rest of the world. We do \nso at our peril. What happens in other parts of the world is of \nsignificant interest to us.\n  So national security is very important. I don't think there is any \ndivision, any partisanship, on that issue. We care about this country. \nWe care about its security. We care about the men and women who wear \nits uniform proudly in the armed services.\n  In addition, the issue of national security, another part of security \nthat is important is economic security for our country because all we \ncan become in this country relates to having the economic engine that \nprovides people opportunities so people can work, have jobs that pay \nwell, with security, to build the good schools, send your kids to good \nschools, and provide health care for grandma and grandpa and do the \nthings that make this a great place in which to live. That economic \nsecurity and all of the attendant issues dealing with this economy are \nalso very important.\n  I am proud to be part of a caucus in the Senate that says, here are \nthe things we think we need to do to strengthen our country and provide \nopportunity to people in this country. Not handouts, opportunities.\n  There are times when people are down and out and have a tougher time \nwith it, when it is important for a country to say, let us help you up. \nBut the most important element of what we are about is to provide \nopportunity. There is no social program in America as important as a \ngood job that pays well. That is what represents the basis for \nproviding for a family and providing opportunity in the future.\n  This is a big old world, with 6 billion people; about half of them \nhave never made a telephone call; 2.5 billion live on less than $2 a \nday; 150 million children are not in school.\n  It is a big, difficult, challenged world in many ways, and we are \nenormously blessed to live here, right here, in this great democracy. \nWe come from different parts of our country, different backgrounds, \ndifferent philosophies, to\n\n[[Page S11687]]\n\narrive here amidst 100 seats in the Senate. None of us owns a seat \nhere. We are here as a matter of privilege--privileged to represent \nthose who sent us here from our home States.\n  When we come to this Senate and in public policy engage in debate, \nthere are some who look at that debate and say: Look, isn't that awful. \nDebate has broke out in the Senate.\n  I remember one day reading the Washington Post and one of the critics \nsome number of years ago said--talking about some very aggressive \ndebate in public policy here in the Senate:\n\n       This has just degenerated into a dispute about principle.\n\n  I thought to myself: Well, I hope so. That's why I came here--about \nprinciple.\n  Debate is what best serves the American people. The old saying: When \neveryone in the room is thinking the same thing, no one is thinking \nvery much--that is a very important thing for us to remember here in \nthe Senate. We will best serve the cause of our country's future and \nbest serve the American people by continuing to be aggressive about \nthat which we believe for the future of this country; by standing here, \noffering ideas that represent the approaches we believe will advance \nAmerica's interests.\n  The next session of Congress, both because of national security and \nalso economic security issues, will be a very difficult Congress. There \nis no question about that. But it will not be made more difficult by me \nwanting to see the other side lose. I want America to win. And this \ncountry wins when we best serve this country's interests by not wishing \nothers to lose, but offering the best ideas we have and hoping that \nthey will engage us in a way that selects the best of all the ideas \noffered in the Senate to advance this country's interests.\n  My fervent hope is that the next couple of years will be years of \naccomplishment in which all of us together can think we have done a \ngood job in a troubled time for this country; in the face of threats--\nterrorist threats, national security threats--we have still advanced \nthe interests of this country, even while keeping this country safe; \nadvanced the interests of people who work for a living and want \neducation, good schools, they want health care. They want the things \nthat make this a good life, as well, here at home. If we do that, at \nthe end of 2 years I think we will have accomplished something very \nsignificant for this great country of ours.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his indulgence as well. I \nsaw by his papers he is intending, perhaps, to visit with us today a \nbit about Thanksgiving, and what a perfect, appropriate subject, the \nweek prior to Thanksgiving.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to just take off on a word that the \nSenator spoke, the Senator from North Dakota. I will not detain him. I \nknow he has to be somewhere, but he spoke about privilege, that we \nought to be thankful; that this is a privilege. He referred to a \nprivilege. I want to tee off that word, ``privilege.''\n  Also, I must say before the Senator leaves that I still have not come \nup with the right word when I am thinking about that Greek--it was not \nAristides, it was not Alcibiades, but I will come up with it. But it \nwas another word. It will come to me. I am still worrying about it.\n  But on this word ``privilege,'' let us think, if I may suggest for a \nlittle while, about what a privilege it is--what a privilege it is to \nbe an American, a person born in this country of whatever background, \nor a person who has emigrated to this country and been accepted as an \nAmerican citizen--what a privilege that is.\n  I am not thinking about Afro-Americans or Italian-Americans or Greek-\nAmericans or Anglo-Saxon Americans or anything--we have too much of \nthese hyphenations. I am not much on hyphenations. I don't go around \ntalking about my being an Anglo-Saxon American--but I am proud of it. I \nknow other individuals in this country are proud of their heritage, and \nthey should be. They should be proud that their ancestors came from \nAfrica or their ancestors came from England or their ancestors came \nfrom Germany or their ancestors came from Ireland or from Poland or the \nMiddle East or wherever. They ought to be proud of that. But I don't go \naround saying I am an Anglo-Saxon-American. I am proud of being a \ndescendant of an Englishman who came to this country in 1657--but I am \nan American, that's the thing--of whatever lineage it may be.\n  It may be from the subcontinent of Asia. It may be a Persian. It may \nbe an Iranian. It may be an Iraqi. Or it may be an Indian from India, \nwhere they have that beautiful Taj Mahal, at Agra.\n  But I am an American. What a privilege that is. Do you remember what \nPaul said? Paul, who was earlier Saul, but he persecuted the Christians \nand he came to be named Paul, the great Apostle. He and Silas--I \nbelieve it was Silas--they were arrested and they were beaten. But when \nthe Roman centurion or the Roman officer heard that Paul was a Roman, \nhe sent word: Don't--don't strike that man anymore. He is a Roman.\n  Being a Roman was something, in those days of Biblical history. It \nmeant something very special, being a Roman. Don't strike him. Don't \nflog him anymore, he is a Roman, a Roman citizen.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Dakota who just addressed the \nSenate has a deep appreciation for the privilege of being an American. \nAnd, on this day when we are about to adjourn the Senate, and in \nthinking of a day that is coming soon, Thanksgiving Day, we should be \ngrateful and prayerfully grateful, for being an American; grateful for \nthis land of ours; grateful, privileged to be an American--privileged.\n  Let me now refer to the Mayflower Compact. The Mayflower Compact, \nadopted on November 11--ha. What is that day in our time? The old \nArmistice Day, the day on which my mother, my angel mother was buried. \nShe died of the influenza the night before Armistice Day.\n  My mother--and may I say to my brother, who is 90 years old and \nliving in Wilkes County, NC, today, I would almost imagine that he is \nlistening to the Senate--``debate.'' He is listening to us on the \nSenate floor today. That's my brother. I don't know that he is, but I \nwould wager he is. He is 90 years old. He listens to the Senate \ndebates.\n  May I say, if he is listening: Our mother died on November 11, the \nnight preceding. I don't know whether it was before midnight or after \non that night. Just as I don't remember whether Caesar crossed the \nRubicon before midnight or after midnight on January 11, in the year 49 \nB.C. I don't remember that. But in any event, isn't it interesting that \nthe Mayflower Compact was drawn up on November 11, 1620, and Governor \nBradford makes this reference to the circumstances under which the \nCompact was drawn up and signed--this is William Bradford. He said \nthis:\n\n       This day, before we came to harbour, observing some not \n     well affected to unity and concord, but gave some appearance \n     of faction, it was thought good there should be an \n     association and agreement, that we should combine together in \n     one body, and to submit to such government and governors as \n     we should by common consent agree to make and choose, and set \n     our hands to this that follows, word for word.\n       In The Name of God, Amen,\n       In The Name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, \n     the Loyal Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James, by \n     the Grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, \n     King, Defender of the faith . . . Having undertaken for the \n     Glory of God.\n\n  Are you listening?\n\n       Having undertaken for the Glory of God.\n\n  Do I hear that a judge in this land has said to take that monument to \nthe Ten Commandments out of your Statehouse? Read it. It is in today's \npapers--or yesterday's--where a judge who wears his robes of justice, \nsaid remove it.\n  He should visit my office and see the words of the Ten Commandants \nall over the walls there in that public place--the Ten Commandants.\n  How could we come to a place like this in America, this wonderful \nland of ours, this land in which it is a privilege to be born, or to \nbecome a citizen, to live, to serve, to die in this land of ours, where \nwe can be privileged, how could that judge--how could any judge--say: \nRemove those words, the Ten Commandants? Was that the kind of judge, \nwas that the kind of interpretation of the Constitution--I wonder if \nGovernor Bradford had that in mind. I\n\n[[Page S11688]]\n\nwonder what he was thinking about when he referred to God.\n  Let us hear it again. This is what the Mayflower Compact said:\n\n       In The Name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, \n     the Loyal Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord King James.\n\n  King James was King of England from the year 1603 until the year \n1624, I believe.\n  By the way, that Bible, the King James Version, was authorized at \nHampton Court in 1604, and it was first published in 1611--the King \nJames Version of the Holy Bible.\n  Let me say it again. This is what the Mayflower Compact said. This is \nnot what some misguided judge may have said about the Ten Commandments. \nThis is not some misguided judge who has misinterpreted the \nConstitution, in my judgment. But who am I? But I am a citizen--not a \nRoman citizen. I am an American, ``privileged,'' in the words of \nSenator Dorgan, to serve in this land, to work in this land, and to \nlive in this land.\n  Here is what the Mayflower Compact said.\n  Hear me. Hear me now. This is the Mayflower Compact.\n\n       In The Name of God.\n\n  I am going to go out to meet Him soon. Abraham lived to be 170. Isaac \nwas 180. Jacob lived to be 147. Joseph lived to be 110. Strom Thurmond \nis going to be 100 in just a few days. I am 85 today. But we can't be \nhere always. I am going out to meet God.\n  Here is what the Mayflower Compact said. It was drawn up by those \nrugged, brave people on that ship as they prepared to get off that ship \nand step on the stormy shores--the rockbound coast of Massachusetts.\n\n       In the name of God--\n\n  Let us listen today as we prepare for Thanksgiving in this Year of \nour Lord, 2002.\n\n       In The Name of God, Amen. We, whose names are underwritten, \n     the Loyal Subjects of our dread Sovereign Lord, King James, \n     by the Grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, \n     King, Defender of the Faith, [et cetera] Having undertaken \n     for the Glory of God, and Advancement of the Christian Faith, \n     in the Honor of our King and Country, a Voyage to plant the \n     first colony in the northern Parts of Virginia; Do by these \n     Presents, solemnly and mutually in the Presence of God and \n     one another . . .\n\n  I think it means and of one another--\n\n     . . . covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil \n     Body Politick, for our better Ordering and Preservation, and \n     Furtherance of the Ends aforesaid; And by Virtue hereof do \n     enact, constitute, and frame, such just and equal Laws, \n     Ordinances, Acts, Constitutions, and Offices, from time to \n     time, as shall be thought most meet and convenient for the \n     general Good of the Colony; unto which we promise all due \n     Submission and Obedience. In WITNESS whereof we have hereunto \n     subscribed our names at Cape Cod this eleventh day of \n     November, in the year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord King \n     James of England, France, and Ireland, the eighteenth and of \n     Scotland, the fifty-fourth. Anno Domini, 1620.\n\n  There it is. That is the Mayflower Compact.\n  Today, on Thanksgiving, let us be thankful to the same God referenced \nin this Mayflower Compact. Let us be thankful we are Americans, that we \nlive in America, that we live in the land of the free and the home of \nthe brave, that we live in this land which has been so wonderfully \nblessed by the God of Hosts, the Creator. Let us be thankful to Him.\n  Great God, our king.\n  And the names that followed were: Mr. John Carver, Mr. William \nBradford, Mr. Edward Winslow, Mr. William Brewster, Isaac Allerton, \nMyles Standish, John Alden, John Turner, Francis Eaton, James Chilton, \nJohn Craxton, John Billington, Joses Fletcher, John Goodman, Mr. Samuel \nFuller, Mr. Christopher Martin, Mr. William Mullins, Mr. William White, \nMr. Richard Warren, John Howland, Mr. Steven Hopkins, Digery Priest, \nThomas Williams, Gilbert Winslow, Edmund Margesson, Peter Brown, \nRichard Britteridge, George Soule, Edward Tilly, John Tilly, Francis \nCooke, Thomas Rogers, Thomas Tinker, John Ridgdale, Edward Fuller, \nRichard Clark, Richard Gardiner, Mr. John Allerton, Thomas English, \nEdward Doten, Edward Liester.\n  There you have it, the Mayflower Compact and all the names of the \nsignatories.\n  Then there was Thanksgiving Day, an annual national holiday in the \nUnited States, celebrating the harvest and other blessings of the past \nyear. It originated in the autumn of 1621 when Plymouth Gov. William \nBradford invited neighboring Indians to join the Pilgrims for a 3-day \nfestival of recreation and feasting in gratitude for the bounty of the \nseason. By the end of the 19th century, Thanksgiving Day had become an \ninstitution throughout New England and was officially proclaimed as a \nnational holiday by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. The traditional \nfeast of turkey and pumpkin pie has since become an indigenous part of \nthe national culture. Traditionally celebrated on the last Thursday in \nNovember, it was changed by act of Congress in 1941 to the fourth \nThursday of that month. Canada first adopted Thanksgiving as a national \nholiday in November 1879, and it is now celebrated annually on the \nsecond Monday in October.\n  That has reference to Thanksgiving Day, again, referring to Plymouth \nGov. William Bradford who, in the autumn of 1621, invited the \nneighboring Indians to join the Pilgrims for a 3-day festival of \nrecreation and feasting in gratitude for the bounteous season.\n  So on Thanksgiving Day let us remember those colonial forbears of \nours, let us remember Plymouth Gov. William Bradford, who recognized \nthat day of thanksgiving and whose name I referenced earlier in regard \nto the Mayflower Compact.\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. BYRD. So, Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes just being \nthankful. The change in party control is but a small shift in the wind \ncompared to the gale forces that have blown in the past. It does not \ncompare to war, to acts of terror, the upheavals in the strategic \nbalance of power. I will live through that again, if I live, if the \nGood Lord so blesses me.\n  Today, as the Senate attempts to conclude its work for this session, \none can almost smell the turkey roasting.\n  Tomorrow, if the Good Lord willing--in the Book of James it says: \nDon't say you will go here or there tomorrow, and you will buy this and \nthat, or you will visit this city or that tomorrow; but say: If the \nLord wills.\n  The Book of James.\n  So tomorrow, if the Lord wills, my wife and I hope to visit the Giant \nstore over in McLean. And I can see the lines in the grocery stores. \nThey are long. And the carts are full, as families prepare for the \nfeast, for the feast to come next week: Plump turkeys, deep red \ncranberries--my wife is the best when it comes to fixing that cherry \npie and the cranberry dressing, and all these things--rich pumpkin pie \nfilling, sweet whipped cream, crisp green beans, flour and spices for \nbaking--all are fond reminders of the season of Thanksgiving.\n\n  This year, travel is expected to rebound, after the scares of last \nyear, as families reconnect more strongly. The Thanksgiving feast, the \nepitome of family tradition, is back, more precious, more appreciated \nthan ever.\n  The Nation, too, feels stronger. Our economy may be weaker, but we \nare more aware of ourselves as a nation of Americans, as citizens of \none land, rather than an eclectic mix of communities with little \nconnection to each other.\n  As a nation, we feared the sniper who stalked the National Capital \nArea just a few weeks ago. As a nation, we pulled for those coal \nminers.\n  I know the Presiding Officer of the Senate today, the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, whose ancestry goes back to the \ngreat country of Poland, does not go around saying: I am a Polish \nAmerican. He says: I am an American. He is proud of his ancestry. I \nhave talked with him about it. But he does not remind me every day that \nhe is a Polish American. He is an American, just, as I said a little \nearlier, I am an Anglo Saxon American. But I do not go around talking \nabout it. These hyphenated Americans, I am not too high on using the \nhyphen in that respect. We are all Americans.\n  In any event, as a nation, we feared that sniper. And as a nation, \nthen, we pulled for those miners. And the Senator from Illinois knows \nabout the coal miners of that State, as I know about the coal miners of \nWest Virginia.\n  As a nation, we pulled for the miners who were trapped underground in \nPennsylvania. As a nation, we followed the hunt for terrorists. We \nmourned for the victims of terrorist acts committed around the world.\n  We now know the feeling of wearing a target on our backs by virtue of \nthe\n\n[[Page S11689]]\n\npassport we carry. It is a new feeling for many Americans; not exactly \na pleasant one, but if it is a burden of our citizenship, we wear it \nwith pride.\n  The flags that have flown in yards nationwide since September 11, \n2001, are still flying in our minds and in our memories, in our hearts.\n  Our military, with the National Guard and Reserve forces, is more \nunified this Thanksgiving. All are under the strain of extended callups \nand deployments but all are working together. They are not weekend \nwarriors, they are not sunshine patriots versus regulars, but they are \nfull-time professionals, operating under the shadow of war, pushing \nhard to extend security across the globe. I am thankful for their \neffort.\n  I am reminded of the words of Thomas Paine, who wrote, on December \n23, 1776:\n\n       These are the times that try men's souls. The summer \n     soldier and the sunshine patriot will, in this crisis, shrink \n     from the service of his country; but he that stands in NOW, \n     deserves the love and thanks of man and woman.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, as I share my turkey and dressing with my dear \nErma and with my daughters and sons in law, grandchildren and great \ngrandchildren, I will offer a prayer to each of the Nation's men and \nwomen in uniform and their families. As we dine, they are flying, they \nare steaming, driving, and standing guard over our Nation's liberty. \nThey are on the front lines of the war against terrorism.\n  Their families are gathering around tables that are not as full as \nthey should be. Some of the chairs will be vacant. The circle of \nsmiling faces will be incomplete.\n  This year especially we ought to remember and be thankful to them and \nto God for their effort. We should remember and give thanks for the \nefforts of our Nation's veterans. They and their families have also \nsacrificed for our Nation. Their families have sacrificed. Their wives \nhave sacrificed. Their children have sacrificed. Their parents have \nsacrificed. Their brothers, their sisters, their kinsmen have \nsacrificed.\n  In this year even more than ever, we will remember the firemen, the \npolicemen, the lifesaving crews who have performed so heroically during \nthe crises of the past year and more. As terrorism struck our homeland, \nas anthrax filled our Federal buildings, as a sniper took aim at \ninnocent people going about their everyday business, these first \nresponders rose to the challenge. People are alive today because of \ntheir efforts.\n  In addition to their everyday duties, the local and State police, the \nfire departments, the public health departments, the hospitals, the \nambulance crews, all are planning how they might best respond to a \nmajor terrorist attack, whether it comes in the form of conventional \nexplosives or chemical, biological, or even nuclear weapons. Their \ndiligence at this task may make the difference for all of us in the \nfuture. They, too, will have my prayers this Thanksgiving.\n  Those of us in the Senate family should remember in our prayers the \nmen and women who gave their lives on September 11, who gave their \nlives for us. There was a fourth plane, and some noble men and women on \nthat fourth plane decided among themselves that they were going to die, \nbut they decided that that plane, while it would carry them to their \ndeath, that plane would never complete its mission. Its mission, we \nunderstand, was this Capitol.\n  So we Members of this body, the members of the Senate family, the \npages, the security people here, the Chaplain and his staff, our \nstaffs, may all give thanks on that day for those brave men and women \nwho knew they were going to die, who took phones and called their loved \nones and said, for the last time: I love you. But they concluded among \nthemselves: We will die that others won't die. If one could write the \nchapter, if one could have been there, they gave their lives and \nbrought forth their sacrifices. Who knows? Who knows? Those eagles up \nthere that from time to time must scream would not be there today.\n  That plane, that fourth plane, went down in Pennsylvania, the State \nin which that Philadelphia Convention was held, out of which came the \nConstitution and this great constitutional system that we know about.\n  So it is a daunting task when we think about the settlers who thanked \nProvidence for seeing them through a difficult first year. It is a \ndaunting task to carve a homestead out of the wilderness thousands of \nmiles from anything familiar. One could not drive to the hardware store \nto purchase lumber and nails and shingles and windowpanes. You could \nnot plug in or charge up labor-saving tools such as power saws and nail \nguns. No, each log had to be cut with an axe, dragged to the site and \nlifted by hand--not by an electric crane--and placed.\n  Each shingle for the roof had to be planed for more wood; each stone \nfor the foundation and the chimney had to be dug up and hauled to the \nsite. And while the home building was going on, the fields had to be \ncleared. The fields had to be planted; the fields had to be tended. \nGame had to be hunted and cured, or there would be no food for winter, \nlet alone for a Thanksgiving feast.\n  So in this year of our Lord 2002, we gather in warm houses with our \nloved ones, each house a glowing lamp of civilization in an \nincreasingly hostile world. It is a different kind of wilderness that \nsurrounds us now, a forest of threats from unfamiliar places with \nunfamiliar names that press in from all sides. But for a day we can \neasily push our nagging fears aside and find comfort in the warm bonds \nof family affection.\n  As we work together, polishing the silver, setting the table, and \npreparing and serving the delicious food and talking to the little \nones, the little grandchildren, and to little puppies, like Trouble \nover at my house and Danny over at my daughter's home, and washing the \ndishes, we share in life's greatest gift--our families.\n  I would like to close with a poem. I am still looking for that Greek \nname. It has slipped my mind.\n  The poem is ``Home, Sweet Home\":\n     'Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam,\n     Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home;\n     A charm from the sky seem to hallow us there,\n     Which, seek through the world, is ne'er met elsewhere,\n     Home, home, sweet, sweet home!\n     There's no place like home, oh, there's no place like home!\n\n     An exile from home, splendor dazzles in vain;\n     Oh, give me my lowly thatched cottage again!\n     The birds singing gaily, that came at my call--\n     Give me them--and the peace of mind, dearer than all!\n     Home, home, sweet, sweet home!\n     There's no place like home, oh, there's no place like home!\n\n     I gaze on the moon as I tread the drear wild,\n     And feel that my mother now thinks of her child,\n     As she looks on that moon from our own cottage door\n     Thro' the woodbine, whose fragrance shall cheer me no more.\n     There's no place like home, oh, there's no place like home!\n\n     How sweet `tis to sit `neath a fond father's smile,\n     And the caress of a mother to soothe and beguile!\n     Let others delight 'mid new pleasure to roam,\n     But give me, oh, give me, the pleasures of home.\n     Home, home, sweet, sweet home!\n     There's no place like home, oh, there's no place like home!\n\n     To thee I'll return, overburdened with care;\n     The heart's dearest solace will smile on me there;\n     No more from that cottage again will I roam;\n     Be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.\n     Home, home, sweet, sweet home!\n     There's no place like home, oh, there's no place like home!\n  God bless our homes, and God bless the sweet land of liberty, \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, God bless America, and God \nbless Senator Byrd and what he has meant to this institution, and for \nserving in this institution, the Congress of the United States, for \nover a half century.\n  We have had the privilege of again having one of the great insights \ninto American history as seen through the prism of Senator Byrd's \nobservation after a half century of American politics and American \nhistory.\n  When I was a Member of the other body, the House of Representatives, \none of the great delights I had was to\n\n[[Page S11690]]\n\nsit at the knee of Congressman Claude Pepper, a former Senator. He was \na walking political history book. And along with that delightful \npersonality, you could learn so much just listening. Of course, he was \nalways a great delight. The Senator who presides and I both had the \npleasure of being with Claude Pepper. So often I would hear when he \nwould take what he would call his ``boys''--those members of the Rules \nCommittee--on a trip and those younger Members of Congress--younger by \none-half and sometimes two-thirds the age of the venerable Claude \nPepper--could not keep up with the energetic pace he kept on those \ncongressional delegation trips.\n  And so, likewise, it has been such a privilege for me that I have now \nhad the opportunity to come here to the Senate and sometimes to sit at \nthe knee and learn from the senior Senator from West Virginia.\n  For what you have given to all of us--the particular interests and \naffection you have shown to the new Members of the Senate in the 107th \nCongress--we are all so very appreciative to you.\n  Again, thank you for your words today in commemorating this time of \nThanksgiving that so many of us in our own way will say a little prayer \nof gratefulness for this blessed land of which we have the privilege of \nbeing citizens.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to again give another one of my speeches \nabout my favorite little agency, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the distinguished Senator proceeds, \nif he would allow me to interrupt him for a comment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I yield to the Senator for that purpose.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nkind words of praise. But let me say some good words about him. That is \nwhy I have sought to interrupt him. The Senator has come to the Senate \nand brings with him a marvelous background of knowledge--knowledge of \nspace, space flight, and our explorations into space. He is not by any \nmeans as long in his experience in this great country as I am. I can \nremember when Lindbergh flew across the ocean in 1927, I believe on May \n9. When he launched that flight in the Spirit of St. Louis, the New \nYork Times had a headline, if I remember, that said Lindbergh flew \nacross New York City--or perhaps it was Nova Scotia--at the \n``tremendous'' speed of 100 miles an hour. That man, when he flew \nacross the ocean--sometimes 10 feet above the water, sometimes probably \n10,000 feet above the water--he had a payload of about 5,500 pounds; he \nhad about five sandwiches, and he ate a half of one on his way across \nthe water. That was a lonely man.\n  But now this man from Florida, who graces this Chamber, flew in space \nat the tremendous speed, I would imagine, of about 18,000 miles an \nhour. So as we in high school used to talk about that flivver--there \nwere not many flivvers in that day. A few automobiles were owned by \nhigh-ranking officials in the coal mining community, and they spoke of \nthat automobile coming down Sofia Mountain at the speed of a mile a \nminute. Here is this man who has come to us and has flown at the \ntremendous speed of 18,000 miles an hour. He has also brought with him \na deep respect of the Constitution of the country, a deep respect for \nthis institution.\n  I thank God, as we near Thanksgiving Day, for pioneers like this man, \nSenator Nelson of Florida. He is a pioneer in space. We have \nthankfulness to him and other men like him, such as the Presiding \nOfficer who comes from Illinois; they both came over from the other \nbody. So many of us came from the other body, and so many of us, I am \nsorry to say--especially those who have come lately--seem to think this \nbody should be another House of Representatives. I should not get \nstarted on that.\n  But I thank the distinguished Senator, my dear friend, for his kind \nreferences to me and the context in which he made those references. I \nhope I can live up to his faith and his accomplishments. I thank him \nfor the Senator he is and the American that he is as we near \nThanksgiving Day in a land for which we have so much to be grateful.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his \nkind words. Whenever he is so gracious to me, as he just has been, I \nthink myself undeserving of those kind words.\n  I look around this Chamber and see the places that people who have \nreally shown courage and devotion to duty and to country sit, a place \nlike over there, Senator Inouye, a winner of the Congressional Medal of \nHonor; a place like over there, Senator McCain, a prisoner of war who \nwithstood those horrors for over 6 years; a place like over there for \nSenator Chuck Hagel, a distinguished veteran of Vietnam; a place like \nover here, the seat of Senator John Kerry, the holder of the Silver \nStar from Vietnam; or that seat right there, the occupant of which will \nbe leaving us at the end of this Congress, a triple amputee from \nVietnam, Senator Max Cleland, who has overcome so much and yet who has \nthe greatest attitude of any Senator in this body. These are the \nheroes, and there are many more, both men and women, in daily acts of \ncourage. I feel very privileged to be a part.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11690-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11690-S11693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NASA'S FISCAL YEAR 2003 BUDGET AMENDMENT AND A NONPARTISAN NASA\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I have been making a series of \nspeeches about NASA, and I rise again today to speak about this little \nagency. It is a favorite agency of mine, the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration.\n  Last week, the White House submitted a budget amendment to its 2003 \nbudget request for NASA. The budget amendment, which also retools \nNASA's 5-year budget plan, amounts to a watershed point for NASA.\n  In this budget amendment, the administration has requested a \nsignificant change in its 2003 NASA priorities. Instead of funding a \nprogram to replace the space shuttle, this amendment seeks to scale \nback funding for the space launch initiative to a more realistic \ndevelopment time line.\n  This budget amendment, in my opinion, signals a revamping of NASA's \nintegrated space transportation plan. The new plan incorporates the \nspace shuttle, a new orbital space plane, and technology for future \nreusable launch vehicles into one comprehensive plan to provide for the \nadvancement of human space flight. It is about time we had such a plan, \nand I applaud the administration's efforts to move in this direction.\n  The new plan includes an increased shuttle launch rate to better meet \nthe research needs of the space station. Under this new budget plan, \nboth the shuttle and the station programs will be funded on a much more \nsustainable and long-term level, while also seeking to develop a new \norbital space plane. This new spacecraft would be used to provide \nastronauts regular access to the international space station without \nalways needing to rely on the aging space shuttle fleet.\n  The new budget plan provides for a much-needed infusion of cash to \nstart to provide for space shuttle safety upgrades and infrastructure \nrepairs and modernization. These repairs and improvements will help us \nfly the shuttle much more safely through the middle of the next decade \nand possibly even longer.\n\n  This funding is a welcome reprieve for the neglected and decaying \nhuman space flight infrastructure that is literally falling apart at \nNASA centers around the country.\n  The new budget plan also responds to the concerns of a new study. \nThis study, called the ReMAP study, concluded that the space station in \nits currently planned form would not be able to conduct even a minimum \nlevel of science research to call it a science program.\n  NASA's 2003 budget amendment seeks to fix some of these concerns by \nproviding additional funding to increase the research capabilities \nonboard the space station. I welcome this decision. I have been into \nthe mockup of the space station at the Johnson Space Center, and the \ncapability for science, for research, is there if we can have the crew \nmembers who can be dedicated to the research while in orbit.\n  With this budget amendment, I am pleased with the administration's \nrestructuring of NASA's budgetary priorities for fiscal year 2003, and \nI congratulate administrator Sean O'Keefe. In this budget amendment, \nthe administration, with Administrator O'Keefe,\n\n[[Page S11691]]\n\nand his deputy administrator Fred Gregory, have provided more funding \nfor the shuttle program, including an increased flight rate and more \nfunds dedicated to safety and supportability upgrades, as well as \nimprovements to the ground-based infrastructure.\n  These areas are in dire need of additional financial support. The \nspace shuttle simply cannot continue to fly safely if NASA does not \ndedicate additional resources to the orbital fleet.\n  The one missing piece from this plan is the formal cooperation with \nthe departments dealing with the Nation's defense. NASA's new plans to \nupgrade the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle--everything has an \nacronym at NASA--or the EELV--to meet the human-rated requirements may \nalso yield great efficiencies and reliabilities for defense launch \nneeds. An orbital space plan could also meet some of our defense needs, \nand the Air Force has also had on the books for many years plans to \ndevelop such a vehicle.\n  The defense establishment should be part of this effort. DOD, NASA, \nand other agencies need to pool their resources to develop these high-\nrisk, expensive technology programs. NASA cannot be expected to do this \nalone. Our country will be better served by jointly developing the \ntechnology needed for exploration and use of space.\n  I congratulate the agency and its leadership on what I think is a \nbudgetary watershed point and one that is a shift in the right \ndirection, and I encourage the defense-related agencies to start \ncooperating with NASA to develop these new technologies.\n  Mr. President, there is another area in which I have concern and I \nwant to express it. NASA has a proud history of staying outside the \npartisan nature of our political arena. As one of the largest \nindependent agencies, NASA has a unique role in the structure of our \nexecutive branch. Its leader does not assume a Cabinet-level position, \nand yet its policies and practices have a significant impact on the \nstrength and future of our Nation's science and technology programs and \nsector.\n  No other independent agency has as much influence on our country's \ninnovation capabilities in science and technology, outside of the \nmedical field. Yet unlike the Departments of Commerce or the Department \nof Education, NASA does not usually get brought into partisan battles \nor political struggles of Congress. Rather, NASA's nonpartisan approach \nis more akin to the nonpartisan style of the Department of State and \nthe Department of Defense. There are clearly occasionally disagreements \nwithin these Halls about the future of this little agency, but never \nhave the differences come down to simply a question of to which party a \nMember belongs.\n  The Nation's space program is not a partisan program. It is an \nAmerican program, and that is the way the Senators of this body treat \nit.\n  In recent weeks, constituents, newspaper columns, editorials, and \nNASA employees have brought to my attention at least two incidents of \npartisan political activity on the part of the agency's head, who may \nhave been acting at the direction of the White House itself.\n  In October, NASA's Administrator made a decision that could stand to \nchallenge this agency's traditional bipartisan and nonpolitical status. \nAdministrator Sean O'Keefe flew to Alabama to campaign for a candidate \nfor Governor, and then he publicly announced his plans to travel to \nFlorida to hold a space townhall meeting for a nonincumbent \ncongressional candidate. He also participated in a fundraiser in \nAlabama.\n  Now, in this last announced trip, were it not for a mechanical \nproblem that delayed his flight beyond the candidate's reasonable \ntimeframe, Administrator O'Keefe would have been on the ground in \nFlorida conducting political campaign events.\n  I am troubled about the implications of this public decision. At \npresent, I have the good fortune of cooperating on space policy issues \nwith dozens of my colleagues in both parties. Senators who share my \nlove and enthusiasm for space exploration include Senators Trent Lott, \nDon Nickles, Orrin Hatch, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Conrad Burns, George \nAllen, Richard Shelby, Barbara Mikulski, John Breaux, Mary Landrieu, \nand Bob Graham.\n  When it comes to supporting our favorite little agency, we agree \nwholeheartedly and together happily roll up our sleeves and work on \nfurthering the Nation's space-faring capabilities, despite what other \nissues might separate us, or despite the partisanship in which we \nsometimes engage in this body.\n  In the other Chamber, NASA's supporters come from both sides of the \naisle. Representatives Tom DeLay, Dana Rohrabacher, Ken Calvert, Dave \nWeldon, Nick Lampson, Ralph Hall, Bart Gordon, and Bud Cramer are but a \nfew who have repeatedly gone out on a limb for NASA.\n  By announcing his plans to participate, being perceived as acting in \nhis official capacity as the head of NASA, Administrator O'Keefe \ndiminished the spirit of bipartisanship. Well, thank goodness for an \nairline mechanical problem on that last occasion.\n  So I rise to make a public request of our Administrator, which \nfollows the private request I made of him prior to his scheduled trips, \nand that was a private one before the fact. My request now publicly is \ndo not ruin the spirit of bipartisanship and bipartisan cooperation \nthat NASA and its supporters enjoy.\n  When it comes to political campaigns, just stay out of them \naltogether and keep the long-standing tradition that NASA \nAdministrators stay out of partisan politics.\n  This is a speech in which for the first two-thirds I praised the \nAdministrator of NASA for the change in direction that I think is a \ngood change, and I think shows his good leadership, but it is a speech \nalso with a heavy heart that since he would not take my advice, or that \nof many others privately, it needs to be stated publicly that there is \na great and long-standing tradition that NASA Administrators stay out \nof partisan politics.\n  I ask unanimous consent that supporting documentation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Florida Today, Oct. 23, 2002]\n\n                  NASA Head Stumps for GOP Candidates\n\n                    (By John Kelly and Kelly Young)\n\n       Sean O'Keefe is taking time off from his day job, as \n     administrator of NASA, to campaign for Republican political \n     candidates in two states with high-profile NASA centers.\n       O'Keefe took time off Monday and went to Huntsville, Ala., \n     to endorse the Republicans' candidate for governor at a space \n     museum near Marshall Space Flight Center. Monday, he will be \n     at the Cocoa Beach Hilton with Tom Feeney, the GOP nominee in \n     the 24th Congressional District that includes Kennedy Space \n     Center.\n       NASA is not paying for the trips and O'Keefe is not doing \n     official business, agency spokesman Glenn Mahone said. He is \n     not flying on NASA planes or taking government aides along. \n     O'Keefe and the candidates are paying any costs, Mahone and \n     the GOP campaigns' officials said.\n       High-ranking presidential appointees often hit the campaign \n     trail for party candidates. A search of news archives and \n     interviews with longtime NASA watchers yielded no examples of \n     former administrator Daniel Goldin politicking so openly or \n     endorsing specific candidates. If Goldin ever did make such \n     an appearance, ``I'm reasonably sure he would have been the \n     first,'' said Howard McCurdy, an American University public \n     affairs professor.\n       McCurdy, who has written books about NASA, said the \n     practice is becoming more common. Goldin could not be reached \n     for comment.\n       ``It's certainly expanding in the federal government as a \n     whole,'' McCurdy said. ``It's not unusual to see the head of \n     the parks services doing the same thing.''\n       There are no rules against it as long as government \n     resources are not used and O'Keefe carefully distinguishes \n     his appearances as personal rather than official.\n       ``As long as he's not trying to say four out of five \n     astronauts agree, and I assume he's not, then he's OK,'' said \n     John Pike, a defense and space policy analyst with Virginia-\n     based globalsecurity.org. ``Now if I was a partisan Democrat \n     with an interest in these races, I wouldn't have to work very \n     hard to come up with a cheap shot.''\n       Mahone said everyone knows O'Keefe is a Republican, and he \n     has rights as an individual to support candidates like anyone \n     else.\n       ``He did not endorse them as the NASA administrator, but as \n     Sean O'Keefe, a Republican and a member of the \n     administration,'' Mahone said. ``He is Sean Q. Citizen.\n       Apparently, that's not how U.S. Rep. Bob Riley saw it. His \n     campaign material clearly identified ``NASA Administrator \n     Sean O'Keefe'' among the people who've endorsed him.\n       ``Bob Riley is an enlightened leader who understands the \n     critical nature of research investment, and Alabama's economy \n     will prosper under Bob Riley's leadership,'' O'Keefe said at \n     the event, according to a\n\n[[Page S11692]]\n\n     campaign news release. ``Bob Riley is the right man with the \n     right plan for Alabama.''\n       The release quoted Riley: ``Having NASA's administrator fly \n     down from Washington to endorse my campaign for governor \n     illustrates the viability of my plan to build a new high-tech \n     research-based economy in Alabama. Administrator O'Keefe's \n     strong endorsement highlights his confidence that Alabama can \n     become a vital part of the new economy if given the right \n     leadership.''\n       Riley campaign spokesman Dave Acbell said O'Keefe in \n     interested in Riley's plan to develop Alabama's economy like \n     North Carolina's Research Triangle.\n       The Hunstville Times quoted O'Keefe in Tuesday's edition \n     saying his two appearances were not about bipartisanship but \n     leadership ability. The paper reported that when asked if he \n     would endorse Democrats with similar leadership abilities, \n     O'Keefe said, ``These are the only two opportunities I had to \n     be involved with.''\n       Feeney's campaign is stressing that O'Keefe is appearing in \n     an ``unofficial capacity.'' But the campaign is billing the \n     event as a ``Space Town Hall Meeting'' at which space \n     industry officials selected by the campaign will get to ask \n     the men about NASA and other space issues.\n       In debates and other space-related appearances in the \n     district, which includes Kennedy Space Center, Feeney has \n     said his close relationship with O'Keefe and President Bush \n     will help the area.\n       His press secretary, Kim Stone, made the same case Tuesday. \n     Harry Jacobs, the Democrat candidate running against Feeney, \n     is not invited. Questions asked of Feeney and O'Keefe will be \n     screened by the campaign, she said.\n       Jacobs' spokeswoman Azalea Candelaria said such events are \n     not unusual and President Bush's aides and appointees have \n     been helping Feeney from the start. She said she hoped \n     O'Keefe and NASA were equally willing to provide the Democrat \n     candidate with access to tours and to face-to-face \n     discussions with the administrator.\n       ``Harry Jacobs has lots more support than the Republicans \n     expected so Tom Feeney rang the alarm and a series of \n     dignitaries are coming down to campaign for him,'' she said. \n     ``When the president of the United States is a Republican and \n     you're not, you can't get that campaign help.''\n       Neither Mahone nor Feeney's spokeswoman said they knew \n     whether O'Keefe will endorse Feeney.\n       O'Keefe has long served Republican administrations, \n     including that of President Bush's father. The younger Bush \n     moved O'Keefe over from the Office of Management and Budget \n     to head NASA on orders to clean up the agency's money woes.\n       Pike said previous NASA administrators have been ``space \n     cadets'' who were at NASA because it was their dream job. \n     O'Keefe is more of a career political appointee, so it's not \n     surprising he is politically active, Pike said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Orlando Sentinel, Oct. 23, 2002]\n\n   NASA Chief O'Keefe To Join Feeney at Campaign Stop in Cocoa Beach\n\n                (By Gwyneth K. Shaw and Sean Mussenden)\n\n       NASA chief Sean O'Keefe will campaign with House Speaker \n     Tom Feeney in Cocoa Beach next week--a highly unusual foray \n     into politics for the head of an agency that has tried hard \n     for its 44 years to stay above the partisan fray.\n       O'Keefe's appearance will occur eight days before voters \n     decide whether to send Feeney or opponent Harry Jacobs to \n     Congress.\n       District 24, a new district essentially hand-drawn for \n     Feeney, includes parts of Volusia, Orange and Seminole \n     counties. It also encompasses much of northern Brevard \n     County--including Kennedy Space Center, one of NASA's \n     highest-profile sites and the workplace of thousands of \n     constituents.\n       The Feeney campaign and officials with the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration insist the visit Monday \n     is simply a gesture of friendship from O'Keefe and that he is \n     appearing with Feeney as a private citizen, not as the \n     nation's top space policy-maker. They also say the trip will \n     not cost taxpayers: O'Keefe is taking the day off, and the \n     campaign is paying for his commercial airline ticket.\n\n\n                        O'Keefe is a Republican\n\n       Glenn Mahone, NASA's associate administrator for Public \n     Affairs, pointed out that O'Keefe is a Republican as well as \n     a political appointee named by a Republican president.\n       ``He was invited by Speaker Feeney to come down and attend \n     an event on his own time, and he graciously accepted,'' \n     Mahone said. ``He is going not as NASA administrator, but as \n     a friend of Speaker Feeney.''\n       On Monday, O'Keefe traveled to Huntsville, Ala.--home of \n     NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center--to endorse U.S. Rep. Bob \n     Riley, R-Ala., who is running for governor.\n       O'Keefe could not be reached for comment.\n       Alex Roland, Duke University professor and former NASA \n     historian, called O'Keefe's political visits unprecedented in \n     the annals of the agency. NASA administrators, who often \n     complain about interference from Capitol Hill, typically do \n     not get involved in elections, he said.\n       Roland said it's ironic that O'Keefe has chosen to step in.\n       ``It's one thing to be politicized, in the sense that the \n     agency represents a set of policies with which some elected \n     official may or may not be in agreement. But it's entirely \n     different to be partisan, because those members of Congress \n     that decide about this can be of either party,'' he said, \n     ``This is a member of a federal agency saying a \n     representative of one party is better able to serve NASA's \n     interests than the representative of another party. That's \n     just none of their business--how the elected \n     representatives get there.''\n       Bill Allison of the Center for Public Integrity, a \n     Washington-based nonpartisan ethical watchdog group, said the \n     situation is clearly more than just a friendly gathering. \n     ``It's obviously a favor being done to elect a member, a \n     Republican, to Congress,'' he said. ``This is somebody trying \n     to use the prestige of his position to further the political \n     interests of a candidate.\n       Mahone said that if O'Keefe were invited by other \n     Republicans he knows to campaign with them between now and \n     the elections, he would be open to it if his schedule would \n     allow it.\n       ``Is it unusual for a NASA administrator? Well, we have a \n     new NASA administrator, and this NASA administrator has \n     decided this is something that he wants to do,'' Mahone said.\n       Jacobs, the Altamonte Springs lawyer challenging Feeney in \n     the Nov. 5 election, said if he wins, O'Keefe's decision to \n     help Feeney would not make it more difficult for him to work \n     with the agency.\n       ``NASA is not Sean O'Keefe and Sean O'Keefe is not NASA,'' \n     Jacobs said. ``NASA will be there before or after Sean \n     O'Keefe.''\n       Asked whether he thought it was improper of O'Keefe to \n     break with the neutral tradition of his predecessors, Jacobs \n     said, ``That's a question for Sean O'Keefe.''\n\n\n                           District split-up\n\n       When Feeney's top lieutenants in the Legislature were \n     carving out District 24, they swiped Kennedy Space Center \n     from a Brevard-based seat now held by U.S. Rep. Dave Weldon, \n     R-Palm Bay. Weldon was able to keep the adjacent Cape \n     Canaveral Air Force Station, site of the military's space \n     operations.\n       The split, Feeney and others have said, ensured that \n     Central Florida would have two sets of eyes in Washington \n     focused on space.\n       O'Keefe's visit Monday is Feeney's latest attempt to court \n     the votes of the area's space workers--something he has done \n     with promises to funnel more money into developing the \n     region's space industry and his tours of key public- and \n     private-sector facilities.\n       Feeney also frequently mentions that his wife, Ellen, works \n     at KSC--reminders that are exceeded only by his frequent \n     descriptions of his ``close'' ties with President Bush and \n     O'Keefe, two people with extraordinary power over NASA's \n     budget. The implication is that Jacobs does not have the \n     connections needed to bring the bacon back to Brevard.\n       Jacobs, in response, has said that Democratic leaders in \n     Congress have promised him a seat on the committee that \n     oversees NASA's budget.\n       But Feeney's partisan ties have granted him access that \n     Jacobs has not enjoyed. Although KSC officials invited Jacobs \n     on a tour of NASA facilities, Feeney was a guest of O'Keefe \n     at a shuttle launch earlier this month. Jacobs was invited to \n     the same launch by U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., but was \n     unable to attend, a Jacobs spokeswoman said.\n       Ralph Gonzales, Feeney's campaign manager, said the town \n     hall meeting at the Hilton Oceanfront in Cocoa Beach is ``not \n     really a political event.''\n       The 90-minute meeting, which begins at 4 p.m., is by \n     invitation only, campaign spokeswoman Kim Stone said, with a \n     a host of Republicans and about 100 people from the space \n     community, including Democrats, Republicans and independents, \n     on the list.\n       Allison said it has become fairly common in recent years to \n     use administration officials, from the President on down, to \n     lend a hand to candidates.\n       And Feeney has been a beneficiary several times over: In \n     August, Vice President Dick Cheney raised an estimated \n     $250,000 at an Orlando cocktail party. Last month, Veterans \n     Affairs Secretary Anthony Principi and Commerce Secretary \n     Donald Evans campaigned with Feeney.\n       But O'Keefe's visits do stand out, Allison said.\n       ``It definitely muddies the water,'' he said. ``A NASA \n     administrator is supposed to be running NASA. He's not \n     supposed to be intervening in politics.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Florida Today, Oct. 29, 2002]\n\n                Plane Trouble Cancels NASA Town Meeting\n\n                            (By Kelly Young)\n\n       Cape Canaveral.--NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe canceled \n     plans to attend a Space Coast event with Republican \n     Congressional candidate Tom Feeney after airplane problems in \n     Washington on Monday.\n       The administrator took some personal time off from his \n     normal duties to fly down to Florida to appear with Feeney, \n     who is running for a District 24 seat in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives. The joint event was billed as a town hall \n     meeting where space industry officials could ask O'Keefe and \n     Feeney questions about NASA.\n       After O'Keefe was delayed at the airport for about an hour, \n     Feeney's office decided to cancel the event when they \n     realized he would not make it to the Cocoa Beach Hilton by \n     the scheduled start time at 4 p.m.\n       The cockpit door wouldn't close, said Feeney spokeswoman \n     Kim Stone.

O'Keefe stayed in Washington, said NASA spokesman \n     Glenn Mahone.\n       O'Keefe probably will not make it back to the Space Coast \n     before elections next Tuesday, but Mahone said a later visit \n     was not unreasonable.\n       ``If invited and if time permits, he'll be more than happy \n     to go down because he thinks very highly of Speaker Feeney,'' \n     Mahone said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n         [From Aviation Week & Space Technology, Oct. 28, 2002]\n\n                       Mr. O'Keefe, Stick to NASA\n\n       Breaking with a long-standing tradition that NASA \n     administrators do not directly participate in partisan \n     politics, Sean O'Keefe has taken to the hustings for \n     Republican candidates and participated in a state party fund-\n     raiser. Last week he turned up in Huntsville to endorse U.S. \n     Rep. Bob Riley in his bid to become governor of Alabama. This \n     week, O'Keefe is scheduled to appear at a political event in \n     Cocoa Beach with Tom Feeney, the speaker of the Florida House \n     of Representatives, who is running in the congressional \n     district that includes Cape Canaveral. O'Keefe will insist he \n     is making these efforts purely as a private citizen. But that \n     is a thin reed to grasp--and one not recognized by the \n     candidates. In a press release, Riley gushed about ``having \n     NASA's administrator fly down from Washington to endorse my \n     campaign for governor.''\n       Even more disturbing than running out onto the campaign \n     trail, O'Keefe participated in an Alabama Republican party \n     fund-raising dinner in Huntsville in February. It was billed \n     as a tribute to the aerospace and defense industry, but at \n     $250-a-plate, the dinner might more honestly have been \n     labeled an occasion for the Grand Old Party to extract \n     tribute from NASA contractors. Want some face time with Sean? \n     Fork over your check.\n       Lest anyone accuse us of being naive or disingenuous, we \n     are not ``shocked, shocked'' to learn that O'Keefe is a \n     staunch Republican. Nor do we think there is anything illegal \n     or immoral about a presidential appointee taking part in \n     party affairs, provided it is done on his own time and does \n     not involve government resources.\n       But that doesn't make these campaign swings and party fund-\n     raisings a good idea. Throughout its history, NASA has \n     depended on bipartisan support. It's support that some have \n     characterized as a mile wide but only an inch deep, so \n     O'Keefe should be careful not to drain much off this \n     reservoir of goodwill. In politics, what goes around comes \n     around. And while none of the Democrats running against the \n     candidates O'Keefe is endorsing is likely to turn against \n     NASA should they win, the administrator should not be \n     surprised if Democrats seek a payback and, in so doing, \n     disrupt his plans for this storied government agency.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I wish all of the Senate, all of our \ncolleagues in Congress, as well as the American people, Happy \nThanksgiving.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11693-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO SENATORS BOB SMITH AND FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one of the privileges we have of serving \nin this body is we get to work with a lot of outstanding men and women. \nI wish to mention a couple of those who are very good friends of mine, \nwho will be leaving the service of the Senate, one of which is Bob \nSmith. Bob Smith has served in the Senate for 12 years. I had the \npleasure of working with him. He is a respected veteran. He served in \nVietnam. I have had the pleasure of knowing Bob Smith and his wife Mary \nJo and their kids. Actually, their kids went to the same school as my \nchildren did.\n  Bob was a high school teacher and a coach from the great State of New \nHampshire. He was elected to Congress in 1984, but I did not really get \nto know Bob Smith until he was elected to the Senate in 1990. He was \nreelected in 1996. He served on the Armed Services Committee and was \nwhat I would call a very strong defender of our Nation's freedom, a \nvery strong national patriot.\n  He was always interested in improving our national defense and he did \nan outstanding job. He was a leader in trying to find out what happened \nto the men and women serving in the Army, Navy, and Air Force who were \nmissing in action in Vietnam. He showed great courage on a lot of \nissues that were not popular. He led the fight in trying to ban \npartial-birth abortion, and my guess is we will pass that in the next \nCongress, and it will be because of the leadership of Bob Smith and his \ncourageous effort in initiating that.\n  On behalf of countless unborn children, on behalf of the men and \nwomen serving in the military, on behalf of a nation that is very \ngrateful for patriots who have led the fight in Congress to make our \ncountry free, they have always had a friend in Senator Bob Smith. I \ncongratulate him on his years of service in Congress, both in the House \nand the Senate, and I wish him and Mary Jo every best wish for their \nfuture.\n  I also wish to make a couple of comments about our soon retiring \ncolleague, Senator Fred Thompson. Senator Thompson's career was shorter \nthan many of us had hoped. He only served 8 years in the Senate. He was \nelected in a special election in the State of Tennessee 8 years ago, \nand then was reelected. He has served this body very ably and very \nnobly well.\n  Senator Thompson had remarkable achievements in his very short Senate \ncareer. After he was in the Senate for only 2 years, he was selected \nand elected chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, a \nremarkable accomplishment. He served as chairman of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee at a very interesting time. I was on that committee \nfor a couple of years during the investigation of campaign abuses, \nprimarily focused on the Clinton administration. Chairman Thompson \nconducted those hearings and investigations in a way that deserves \ngreat credit. It would have been quite easy to have the hearings evolve \ninto nothing but a partisan allegation, and he did not do that. He \nconducted the hearings very nobly, in a very respected manner. I was \nproud to serve with him on that committee. It was an enormous \nresponsibility to be investigating the sitting President. I believe \nSenator Thompson conducted those hearings very well.\n\n  He also, in a very short period of time, was made a Member of the \nSenate Finance Committee. I had the pleasure of serving with him on the \nSenate Finance Committee, again, a committee where we were able to make \nsome positive changes for the country regarding tax cuts. Senator \nThompson has proven to be a real friend of taxpayers in enacting \nprobably one of the largest tax cuts in our Nation's history, certainly \nin the last couple of decades.\n  He always provided common sense, a sense of humor, as well. Certainly \nSenator Fred Thompson will be missed in the Senate. He is my friend \nfrom Tennessee. I wish Senator Fred Thompson and his lovely wife, Geri, \nevery success in the future. No doubt he will have many.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11693-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11693-S11694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BRINGING SOUTH DAKOTA'S COMPASSION TO AFRICA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in August, I had the good fortune to be \nable to travel with several Senate colleagues to South Africa, Kenya, \nBotswana, and Nigeria. We wanted to get a clear look at the development \nchallenges in Africa, including health crises, U.S. investment and \ntrade, micro-enterprise development, education and agriculture.\n  Even before we left, we got a sense of the common cause between the \npeople of the United States and the people of Africa. Working with the \nSouth Dakota Red Cross and Hope Worldwide, citizens from Sioux Falls \ndonated more than 1000 pounds of clothes and toys to South African \nchildren who have been affected by the AIDS pandemic. I want to \npublicly acknowledge the great work of Stephanie Koster, director of \nHIV/AIDS Services for the Sioux Empire Chapter of the American Red \nCross, on this effort.\n  I was overjoyed to be able to deliver, on behalf of South Dakotans, \nsome glimmer of hope to children who have suffered either because one \nor both of their parents contracted HIV or because they themselves \ncontracted it. In Soweto we met a young girl, Mary, who gave me an \nindication of the price children are paying as a result of HIV.\n  Mary is 12 and the eldest of five children. She recently lost both of \nher parents due to complications with AIDS.\n\n[[Page S11694]]\n\nNot yet a teenager, she is left to fend for herself and her four \nsiblings. Despite this challenge, Mary rose to greet our delegation and \nrecited a poem she had recently written to her parents entitled, \n``Parents yesterday, parents today, parents tomorrow.''\n  I left for that trip convinced that these challenges facing Africa--\nchief among them the AIDS pandemic--were tragic humanitarian crises. \nAfter this trip, I am convinced Africa's challenges, if left \nunaddressed, could soon become America's national security threats. \nFailure to more energetically engage this troubled continent, \nespecially in the post-September 11 world, poses risks to both the \nlives of millions of Africans and our own national security.\n  That is why I was especially disappointed to learn last Friday \nmorning that the House chose to adjourn without passing two important \npieces of legislation that could have energized our efforts in Africa.\n  S. 3032, a bipartisan bill to expand U.S. efforts to support micro-\nenterprise and which passed the Senate unanimously, was a casualty of \nthe House's rush to leave town. We all know that micro-enterprises are \na lifeline for the poorest of the poor--and have proven to be a pivotal \ntool that has allowed women, especially, to provide for their families. \nAcross Africa, we saw women fighting for their families and raising \ntheir children on money they earned at small shops. But for every woman \nwho was able to make ends meet because of her micro-enterprise, there \nare thousands of others who need a helping hand to get started. And by \nhelping hand I don't mean a costly program. The typical micro-\nenterprise loan is $50. By failing to pass S. 3032, the House missed \nthe opportunity to provide that helping hand and opportunity.\n  The House also left town without passing a Global HIV/AIDS bill. In \nJuly, the Senate unanimously passed H.R. 2069, which authorized the \nresources that we all know will be required in the battle against HIV/\nAIDS. We were told by the House that the price tag on that bill was too \nhigh, and that they would pass it if we reduced the funding level. So \nwe made clear to the House that we were ready to cut back the amounts \nauthorized for this battle--vastly if they insisted--to remove the \nobstacles to some form of progress on this vital issue. Apparently, any \namount at all was too much for the House leadership, because the House \njust could not get to yes on this vital issue.\n  I am particularly disappointed because the House's refusal to act \nends any hope of enacting the Family Partnership Survival Act. This \nprogram is very simple. It authorizes $75 million over the next 2 years \nto treat HIV-positive mothers and their partners. By keeping mothers \nand fathers alive so that they can help raise their children, it is, in \neffect, an orphan-prevention program.\n  I remember vividly arriving at an HIV Voluntary Counseling and \nTesting Center in Kibera, the largest slum in Nairobi, Kenya. We were \ngreeted by mothers, each of whom was HIV-positive. Yet they greeted us, \ndancing and singing a song whose lyrics were:\n\n       We are so blessed, because we know our status.\n\n  They felt blessed to have learned they were HIV-positive because, by \nknowing their status, they could take steps to protect their partners. \nAnd they could receive counseling and nutritional supplements to keep \nthemselves healthy in the face of this insidious virus.\n  It will be an even more joyful day when these women will feel blessed \nnot only because they know their status, but also because they have \naccess to treatment and drugs that will keep them alive. The House \ncould have hastened that day. It did not. And so, Mr. President, I will \ncome back at this issue until it is law.\n  The President is scheduled to travel to Africa in January. As I was \nable to carry with me on my trip--to young Mary and others--some of the \ncompassion of South Dakota, I wish the President could have been able \nto bring with him two new laws expressing the compassion of the United \nStates.\n  As our dear colleague Paul Wellstone used to say, ``time is not \nneutral.'' We can no longer afford to ignore Africa's challenges, \nbecause before long they will become our challenges. The House missed \nits chance to help confront those challenges in the 107th Congress. I \nhope it will help us address them in the next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11694-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11694-S11696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE RETIRING SENATORS OF THE 107TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, one of the advantages of a lame duck \nsession is it gives us a little longer before we have to say good-bye \nto departing colleagues. Quite a few members of our Senate family will \nnot be with us when the 108th Congress begins in January.\n  From the moment we first step foot on this floor, most of us are \npowerfully aware that we are links in an extraordinary chain of \nhistory. When we open our desks, we see carved or penned in them the \nnames of those who served in this body before us.\n  Over in the historic Old Senate Chamber, we can almost hear the \nvoices Daniel Webster, Henry Clay and John Calhoun. Here in this \nChamber, we walk in the footsteps on such leaders as leaders like \nLyndon Johnson, Mike Mansfield and Howard Baker.\n  Once you have served here, you never leave here entirely. Every \nSenator who has ever served here remains here in some form.\n  That connection is not only carved in our desks. It is carried in \nthose with whom we serve.\n  Think about this: Senator Thurmond entered the Senate in 1954.\n  He served with Walter George, who entered in 1922. Walter George \nserved with Henry Cabot Lodge, who entered in 1893, who served with \nJohn Sherman, who entered in 1861, who served with Hannibal Hamlin, who \nentered in 1848, who served with William King, who entered in 1819, who \nserved with Rufus King, who re-entered in 1813, who served with Joseph \nAnderson, who entered in 1797, who served with John Brown, who entered \nin 1792, who served with Robert Morris.\n  Robert Morris entered in 1789--and signed both the United States \nConstitution and the Declaration of Independence.\n  Through just ten people, we are directly connected to the two \ndocuments that this Nation is founded upon--two documents that all of \nthese departing Members have advanced and defended throughout their \ncareers.\n  We are able to see those linkages because of the masterful historical \nwork of another of our colleagues, Senator Byrd, whose birthday, we \nhave noted, is today.\n  Every departing Senator has added pages to the history of this Senate \nand this Nation. Some have provided whole chapters. And, in a couple of \ncases, whole volumes of history.\n  I would like to take a moment and acknowledge our departing Senators.\n  Strom Thurmond is the longest serving Senator in our Nation's \nhistory. His career has spanned the arc of the last century, and his \nservice has helped usher in this one.\n  He has gone from Democrat, to Dixiecrat, to Republican. His party \naffiliation may have changed, and his position on some issues may have \nchanged, but his service to the people of South Carolina has been \nunwavering. He is truly the Cal Ripken of the Senate.\n  Jesse Helms began his first term in the Senate in January 1973. \nSenator Helms is a giant--not only on the Senate stage, but also on the \nworld stage. And, with his budding friendship with the rock star, Bono, \nin retirement we may yet see him on a concert stage. It has been said \nthat leaders face a choice between being loved or feared--Senator Helms \nis both.\n  Jesse and Dot have been indispensable members of the Senate family, \nand we will miss them.\n  Phil Gramm has been at the center of every major economic and \ndomestic policy battle in my time here. And even though I have \nfrequently disagreed with him, I have always learned from him. \nVirtually singlehandely, he has changed America's economic policy--\ntwice. Like all things Texan, he is larger than life, and he leaves \nsome big shoes to fill.\n  Frank Murkowski is departing the Senate not because the people of \nAlaska don't want him in Washington, but because they do want him \ncloser to home. That makes sense, because he has been a tireless \nadvocate for his State. I have no doubt that he will continue to be, \nwhether it is shaping policy at home, or twisting the arms of his \nformer colleagues here. Congratulations, Governor.\n\n[[Page S11695]]\n\n  Bob Smith once said, ``I hope that they'll put in my obituary that I \nwas a good legislator--that I did my job for the people of New \nHampshire. I hope they put that whole picture in.''\n  Well, we don't have time to capture the whole picture--and I know \nthat there are more chapters to be written in Bob Smith's political \nlife--but for nearly 20 years in the Congress, he has been a good \nlegislator, and he has certainly done his job for the people of New \nHampshire.\n  We may not be seeing Fred Thompson on C-SPAN anymore, but we will \ncertainly be seeing him on TV. And should he ever take a role that \ninvolves combating government fraud, waste, and mismanagement, it will \nbe a case of life imitating art--because that is just one of them many \nthings he has done so well here in the Senate.\n  From the Arkansas State house, to the House, to the Senate, Tim \nHutchinson has brought his keen understanding of both education and \nsmall business to bear for the people of Arkansas--and that is \nsomething I am certain he will continue to do in the days and years \nahead.\n  Let me also say a word to Senator Barkley. I recently saw an \ninterview in which Senator Barkely said he would bring some bottled \nwater from Minnesota so as not to catch Potomac Fever. I think you \nprobably need a slightly longer exposure to catch it--but we thank him \nfor his service at this time of transition for Minnesota and for the \nSenate.\n  I also want to say a few words about the departing members of the \nDemocratic Caucus:\n  There is no tougher fighter for this party or its values than Bob \nTorricelli. There is no more loyal ally, there is no more passionate \nSenator. He has lived a life devoted to public service.\n  I have often heard Senator Torricelli talk about how, growing up in \nhis house, ``a person's value was measured by what they did for other \npeople.'' By that measure--or by any measure--Bob Torricelli has been \nan invaluable member of the Senate.\n  Bob Torricelli has always put others first. He helped recruit and \nelect the Senators who would ultimately put Democrats in the majority--\nembracing a thankless task, and excelling beyond all expectations. In \nan act of political courage, he stepped down when he felt his own \ncandidacy would threaten that majority he worked so hard to build.\n  In the legislative arena, he has worked to protect Americans from gun \nviolence--to protect women's rights--and workers' rights--and civil \nrights--and he has sought to provide tax relief for working families.\n  And in the wake of the tragic events of 9/11, Bob Torricelli took on \nthe cause of rebuilding--helping New York rebuild--helping the region \nrebuild--and helping the victims and the survivors begin the process of \nrebuilding their lives.\n  I will miss Bob Torricelli's eloquent, passionate, articulate voice--\nand I thank him for his service.\n  I am sure these last few weeks have been bittersweet for Max Cleland. \nHe lost an election--but he did get engaged the next day.\n  It shows he has his priorities straight.\n  But then, he always has had his priorities right. After Vietnam, just \nabout anyone else would have said: I've given enough for this country. \nNot Max Cleland. When some of the people whose job it was to care for \nhim lost hope, saying that the very act of putting on a shirt would \ntire him for the whole day--Max willed himself to health. And then he \nset out to help others.\n  In 1970, at age 28, he became Georgia's youngest State Senator ever. \nIn 1977, he became President Carter's outspoken chief of Veterans \nAffairs. After that, he served for 13 years as Georgia's Secretary of \nState.\n  In every job, he worked to make life better for Georgians, for \nveterans, and for those who needed the government to work for them.\n  And then--as if he hadn't given enough of his time and energy to \nothers--he volunteered for another tour of duty--this time as a U.S. \nSenator.\n  In the Senate, Max's personal experience gave him a voice in the \nissues of war and peace, the preparedness of our armed forces, and the \nway in which we treat those whose service is done.\n  Though Max knows the sacrifices service sometimes demands, he didn't \nlimit his focus to those who have sacrificed. He dedicated himself to \nthe creation of an America worthy of that sacrifice: a society of \njustice, freedom, compassion and strength.\n  In the wake of September 11, and the anthrax attacks here on my \noffice, Max was instrumental in passing the legislation that better \nsecures our ports and airports, better prepares our armed forces, and \nbetter equips the CDC to confront the new challenges of bioterrorism.\n  The things he has done may have been important for Georgia, but they \nwere vital for America--and history will bear that out.\n  From his service in Vietnam, to the VA, to the U.S. Senate, Max has \nexhibited a rare, almost singular kind of patriotism. He has taken his \nservice seriously, but--as anyone who has been a subject of one of his \njokes, or has witnessed him telling jokes about himself can tell you--\nhe has never taken himself too seriously.\n  It has been reported that nearly every day, someone calls Max's \noffice, just to thank him for being Max--for overcoming what he has \novercome to become a leader.\n  Today, I want to thank Max Cleland for being Max--for being a great \nSenator, a personal inspiration, and a dear friend, one who I will miss \ntremendously here in the Senate.\n  Tragedy carried Jean Carnahan into the Senate, but she refused to let \nit define her once she arrived here.\n  I saw that most vividly last October 16, the first anniversary of the \nplane crash that killed her husband, her son Randy, and their aid Chris \nSifford.\n  Jean had visited their graves over the weekend--and then returned to \nWashington so she could debate and vote on a foreign operations bill \nthat strengthened our efforts to track terrorists, to strengthen the \ncoalition against terrorism, and to feed and shelter Afghanistan's \nrefugees.\n  That was the same day a letter containing anthrax was opened in my \noffice, forcing her to continue her work--as a freshman Senator--\nwithout an office.\n  Compared to the adversity she has overcome, that was nothing. From \nthe day she arrived, Jean Carnahan brought with her to the Senate the \nhopes and concerns of millions of Missouri's families. She has a unique \nability to find compromise, but there was one thing she never \ncompromised--she never compromised the interests of hardworking \nMissourians.\n  Whether it was working for tax relief, prescription drug coverage, a \nNational Patients' Bill of Rights that would be as strong as \nMissouri's, or help for laid-off workers--her elegant words and depth \nof understanding commanded attention, and more often than not, got \nsomething done.\n  Jean sits in Harry Truman's seat--and I think that is fitting, \nbecause she occupied it with strength, dignity, plain-spoken \nindependence.\n  She may not have served long, but she served this Nation and the \npeople of Missouri well, and she served at one of the most turbulent \nand historic times in the life of our Nation.\n  I remember once hearing Government Carnahan say, ``Most of the time, \nyou just get to sit in the boat, but every now and then you get to row \nthe boat and direct it.''\n  In a short time, Jean Carnahan demonstrated that she belongs at the \nhelm, and I, for one, am going to miss having her there.\n  I sometime think Max Cleland and Jean Carnahan possess as much \ninternal strength and grace as the rest of the Senate combined. They \nare extraordinary people, exceptional public servants. Each in his or \nher way, is an inspiration.\n  They served their Nation faithfully, and at great personal cost.\n  I must say, it was disturbing and disheartening to see how their \nrecords and characters were misrepresented in this campaign. They \ndeserved far better. Voters in Georgia and Missouri deserved far \nbetter.\n  I hope that through the clarity of history, the people of their \nStates see these two great patriots for what they are, and how well \nthey served.\n  Finally, let me mention a colleague who left us too soon--Paul \nWellstone. It was a joy and an honor to have him in the Senate.\n  Paul said that he came here to rattle some cages--and sometimes he \nrattled\n\n[[Page S11696]]\n\nmine. But he always told the truth. And he always remembered who he was \nspeaking for. As I have said before, he was the soul of the Senate. He \nhad that rarest and most difficult kind of bravery: moral courage. He \nalways stood for what he believed in, even if it meant standing alone. \nAnd he fought in a way that ennobled his causes and inspired us all. \nAnd I will miss him dearly.\n  To hear each of these leaders call me ``leader'' has been one of the \ngreatest honors of my life--and I will be forever grateful to you.\n  In 1998, Senator Lott inaugurated the ``Leader's Lecture Series,'' \nfeaturing speakers who had ``enrich[ed] the memory of the Senate by \nsharing with us the wisdom and insights that can be gained only by a \nlifetime of service.''\n  Without exception, every speaker--including those who went on to \nserve as Vice President, even President of the United States--has \nrecalled his years in the Senate as the best and happiest of his \ncareer.\n  Given the historic events that shaped this Congress, I don't know \nthat any of us will look back on these 2 years as the happiest of our \ncareers--although there have been moments of great joy for all of us.\n  But I hope we will look back on these 2 years and remember times when \nwe were able to work together to help lead America through one of our \nNation's darkest chapters.\n  The private times we have all shared together over those months have \nforged bonds that make us more than just colleagues. In keeping with \nthe Senate's best traditions, we have become friends, and family.\n  I regret that we weren't always able to maintain that unity--\nespecially this year--that I had hoped we might have. I hope we can \nrecapture it in the days ahead.\n  To all of my departing colleagues, it is an honor to be connected to \nhistory--that short thread that ties us to the Founders of this great \nNation. But as a much of an honor as it is to be connected to history, \nit has been a privilege to be connected to each of you.\n\n\n                             thanking staff\n\n  Senators may be the most visible people here, but there are also many \npeople who make the Senate work.\n  I want to thank all of those who make the Senate run: our staff here \non the floor, the reporters, the doorkeepers, the police officers, the \npages, the tour guides, the librarians, the employees of the Architect \nof the Capitol, our Chaplain and his staff--and the list goes on.\n  Our clerks, those who are with us today, our Parliamentarian--to all \nof them, to each of them, let me express my heartfelt thank you.\n  They deserve our thanks, but there are two people in particular who I \nalso want to thank: Jeri Thomson, the Secretary of the Senate, and Al \nLenhardt, our Sergeant at Arms--both of whom I had the privilege, as \nmajority leader, to nominate.\n  I have heard them called our 101st and 102nd Senators, and they truly \nhave been indispensable to me, and to the Senate family.\n  For Al Lenhardt, the fact that he was in place in this job 6 days \nbefore September 11 is further proof for me that God watches over this \nbody. Through 9/11, anthrax, he helped the Senate to handle \nunprecedented challenges, and prepare for a new generation of threats.\n  For Jeri Thomson, no challenge was too big, no detail too small, the \nconsummate professional, unflappable. She kept the Senate functioning \nin the aftermath of anthrax. Without her, we would not have broken \nground on the Visitors Center. She made the Senate work better--not \nonly for the Senators, but for the people we serve.\n  She has been by my side my entire time as leader. She has become a \ndear personal friend. And I will miss her, as we all will.\n  This has been an historic Congress. Between September 11 and anthrax, \nwe have lived through two of the greatest crises the Capitol has not \nseen since Civil War soldiers were camped out in this Chamber 140 years \nago.\n  The dedication and professionalism of Jeri Thomson, Al Lenhardt, and \nall of those who work here helped us not only survive those who work \nhere helped us not only survive those crises, but to work through them, \nand to continue to serve the American people.\n  I thank them, the Senate thanks them, and I feel confident that \nhistory will record them as able servants who deserve our thanks for \ngenerations to come. And that, too, is a part of the recognition they \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Baucus). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11696-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11696-S11698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE SENATE AND TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about the conclusion of our Senate session. We finished our \nlast vote late last night, and after today's session, we will be in \nadjournment until January.\n  The Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, is a continuous \nbody. Only one-third of our number stands for election each year, \nunlike the House of Representatives, where there is a new House elected \nevery two years. So we are continuous.\n  The Senate has been called the world's greatest deliberative body. \nSometimes I doubt that acclamation, but sometimes we measure up to it, \nand I think we did yesterday in passing homeland security and the \nterrorism insurance bill.\n  There is an air of collegiality and an air of civility, which is the \nbackbone of the Senate. There are only 100 of us. We get to know each \nother very well. We do that in our committee meetings. We do that in \nour travels. We do that on the floor of the Senate. A good occasion for \nthat is when we have consecutive votes, back to back to back to back, \nas we had last night, four votes. This gives us a chance to avoid \nplaying telephone tag, which occurs frequently, and to see our \ncolleagues on the floor and to talk to them.\n  We will be missing some really outstanding Senators as we conclude \nthe 107th Congress. There is a great deal that could be said about each \nof them from my own personal experiences.\n  Senator Thurmond is truly a living legend. When I first saw him chair \nthe Judiciary Committee, he asked a nominee if the nominee promised to \nbe courteous. I questioned whether that was a very good inquiry. What \nelse could the nominee say? The nominee said, ``Yes.'' Then, Senator \nThurmond said, ``the more power the person has, the more courteous a \nperson should be.''\n  Senator Helms finished six terms in the Senate, elected in 1972. One \nof my fondest recollections of Senator Helms is relative to the \npornography bill, which he wrote, and which was declared \nunconstitutional. After being consulted by him, I gave him a hand in \nwriting a bill which was constitutional.\n  In order of seniority on our departing colleagues, Frank Murkowski \ncame to the Senate with 15 other Senators, a total of 16. They called \nus the ``Sweet 16,'' elected in 1980. Now there are but three: Senator \nGrassley, Senator Nickles, and myself.\n  Senator Murkowski goes on to be Governor of Alaska, where he can \nmaintain his own schedule and be an executive without relying on 50 \nother Senators to carry the day.\n  Phil Gramm is truly an extraordinary Senator. Nobody in the Senate is \nsmarter than Phil Gramm. Perhaps nobody in the history of the Senate \nwas smarter than Phil Gramm. One of his memorable moments was when we \nwere debating how to proceed on the impeachment proceedings of \nPresident Clinton. There was a lot of disagreement. Suddenly, like a \nbolt of lightning, Phil Gramm and Ted Kennedy agreed. What were the \nother 98 of us to do? If those two men could agree, it must be an \nappropriate solution.\n\n  Bob Smith, with distinguished service in the House and distinguished \nservice in the Senate, was perhaps a little too candid sometimes as he \ntook the floor in his quest for the Republican nomination. A little \ncritical of the party, but he was always courageous and always \nstraightforward. I learned a lot from Senator Smith in our caucuses on \nimpeachment. I had not known the depth of his knowledge as a high \nschool teacher, but he was an extraordinary Senator and made a great \ncontribution.\n  Senator Fred Thompson, a super star. When he came to the Senate, he \ntook over the chairmanship of a major committee in record time and \npresided\n\n[[Page S11697]]\n\nover very important hearings on campaign finance reform. What is not \nreally known about Fred is that he is as lighthearted and as good at \nrepartee as he is at the law, which is a very high degree.\n  Tim Hutchinson served on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs with me, \nvery devoted, very serious, very sincere. He had the misfortune to lose \nan election or else, I think, he would have had a very long and \nillustrious career in the Senate. Yet, he may have a long, illustrious \ncareer in the Senate. He will live to fight another day.\n  Bob Torricelli, always on top of the issues, very important to the \nJudiciary Committee where we served together. He was the ranking \nDemocrat when I chaired the Subcommittee on Department of Justice \nOversight; always judicious, always fair and always a great \ncontributor.\n  Max Cleland, a real hero, a man of great courage. To see Max function \nin the Senate or in life, with the tremendous injuries he suffered in \nVietnam when he fell on a hand grenade, is truly inspirational. We will \nall miss Max Cleland.\n  Jean Carnahan. Senator Jean Carnahan picked up the mantle of her \nhusband, Governor Mel Carnahan, and made a real contribution in her two \nyears in the Senate.\n  Paul Wellstone has been the subject of tribute and a man who will be \ntruly missed. His work on mental health parity with physical ailments \nwill be Paul Wellstone's real legacy. I had an opportunity to travel to \nMinneapolis to pay tribute to the Wellstones' two sons. The tragedy \nwith Paul and Sheila and their daughter is truly the saddest occasion \nof the past Congress.\n  Beyond those who will no longer be with us in the 108th Congress, \njust a moment to pay tribute to two of our colleagues who are having \nbirthdays today. Senator Byrd, I know his age but I shall not repeat \nit. That is up to him to say, however, he finishes his 50th year in the \nCongress of the United States. He was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1952 and the Senate in 1958. I am glad to be able to \nhave a few minutes on the floor of the Senate to make a few comments. \nIt is a little hard to be recognized when Senator Byrd is in the \nChamber.\n  I heard on National Public Radio, so the world knows, that Joe Biden \nis 60 today. He was just elected to a sixth term, which is really \nremarkable.\n  It is a great privilege to be a Member of the Senate and to have had \nthe opportunity to work with these men and women and to work for the \npeople of Pennsylvania, my State, and for the people of the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Pennsylvania and \nother colleagues who have recently been on the floor today, first in \nexpressing happy birthday wishes to our esteemed colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Robert Byrd. I just expressed those birthday wishes \nto him personally a few moments ago on this, as I told him, the 35th \nanniversary of his 50th birthday. Because in so many ways Senator Byrd \nhas been a real pillar of strength in the Senate, standing up for the \nrights and privileges of the Senate, standing up for the demarcation \nset down by our Founding Fathers between the legislative branch and the \nexecutive branch of the Government.\n  When I say 35th anniversary of his 50th birthday, I mean that \nbecause, quite frankly, Senator Byrd does not appear in any way to be \none day over the age of 50. So I wish him the best on his birthday and \nwish him to maintain strength and good health to continue the \nleadership he has shown in the Senate for the last almost 30 some \nyears.\n  I also pay my respects to Senators who are leaving: Senator Thurmond, \nSenator Helms, Senator Bob Smith, Senator Fred Thompson, Senator Tim \nHutchinson on the Republican side. Especially I pay my respects to \nSenator Hutchinson for his great work on the farm bill. We got a really \ngood farm bill out this year. He was a very diligent and good member of \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee, and we worked very hard together in a \nbipartisan fashion to report out a very good farm bill for farmers and \nfor rural America. I especially thank Senator Hutchinson for his \nefforts in getting that farm bill through.\n  I also pay my respects to Senator Helms. Senator Helms was the \nchairman of the Agriculture Committee when I first came to the Senate. \nWe formed a friendship at that time that has endured, although I am \nsure it is clear to anyone watching or listening that Senator Helms and \nI have probably not agreed too much on too many things, but \nnonetheless, we have maintained a very close friendship and respect for \none another through all the years. I wish him the best in his \nretirement, and many happy years ahead for our distinguished colleague, \nSenator Helms.\n  For those Senators on this side, Senator Bob Torricelli, again, I \nthank him for all the work he has done, first as the Chair of our \nDemocratic Senate Campaign Committee that ensured we had the \nwherewithal in the election before last to win many elections and \nmaintain our strength in the Senate. I wish Bob the best in his future \nendeavors.\n  For Senator Jean Carnahan, again, I thank her for her 2 years of \nservice here under very trying circumstances. I was a close friend of \nher deceased husband, Governor Mel Carnahan, who, as we know, was lost \nin a tragic plane crash a little over 2 years ago, right before the \nelection, along with her son Randy. Senator Carnahan did a remarkably \ngood job for Missouri and the Nation during these 2 years. She was \ndiligent, hard working, and fought very hard for Missouri and her \nconstituents. Again, I wish her the best in her future endeavors, and \nher family, to her son Tom and daughter Robin whom I have worked with \nin the past.\n  I also pay my respects to Senator Max Cleland. Max and I do go back a \nlong way. I first met Max when he was here in the Senate on the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. He became President Carter's Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs when I was in the House of Representatives. Being a \nveteran and being a member of the veterans sort of group we had in the \nHouse of Representatives at that time, we couldn't have asked for a \nbetter champion for veterans issues at that time in the late 1970s than \nwe had in Max Cleland. It was Senator Cleland who, as Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs, set up the vets centers around the United States. \nThere are now more than 200 of them.\n  In every case I have been privileged to see a vets center, they are \njust sort of the heart and soul of outreach and a place for veterans to \nget help, if they need it, and a place where veterans can make sure \nthey have access to the outlets of the Federal Government for job \ntraining and that type of thing, for education.\n  That is his lasting legacy all over the United States. Of course, it \nhas been repeated time and again about his great heroism in the Vietnam \nwar, for which he received a Silver Star. I will miss him as a very \nclose friend for all these years, and the country has lost the service \nof a truly remarkable, courageous, compassionate, brave American, Max \nCleland.\n  Senator Dean Barkley, our second Independent, came here from \nMinnesota under trying circumstances. I had not known him before, but \nover the last couple of weeks I got to know him, and I have a great \ndeal of respect for him for what he has done here. Very few people \nserve for only a couple of weeks in the Senate and actually get a bill \npassed. Senator Barkley got his bill through, and I congratulate him \nfor that. I thank him for his service here and, again, wish him the \nbest and hope he will stay involved in public affairs, both in \nMinnesota and nationally.\n\n\n                   Tribute to Senator Paul Wellstone\n\n  Lastly, I want to pay my respects to our departed friend, Senator \nPaul Wellstone. I did not want this session to end without saying \nsomething for the Record about the large gap left in the Senate by the \nuntimely death of Paul Wellstone.\n  Paul was my closest friend in the Senate. But in truth, Paul \nWellstone was one of those rare souls who so many saw as their best \nfriend. He had a powerful authenticity that made a miner on the Iron \nRange know that he was as important to Paul as the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Paul never had to proclaim his decency; it shone forth every day in \ngreat acts of political courage and small acts\n\n[[Page S11698]]\n\nof human kindness. He never had to ever say he cared. It just showed in \nhow he greeted the elevator operators and the policemen outside. \nSometimes we would walk over to the Hart Building and talked to workers \non the ground. Everyone was a friend of Paul's and he always had a \nsmile and a handshake for everyone.\n  We saw this in him every day, in dozens of ways, from that hand over \nthere at his desk relentlessly chopping the air as he stood on the \nfloor speaking for those who otherwise had no voice, to the countless \npeople he reached out to help across his State and across the Nation.\n  The hard-working folks he cared about most didn't have lobbyists or \ninfluence, but they had Paul Wellstone, and he truly was their best \nfriend. Everyone called him Paul--not just his colleagues but staff and \ncitizens alike. He would not have it any other way. No one ever wore \nthe title of ``Senator'' better--or used it less.\n  In the days since that terrible tragedy, we have seen an outpouring \nof grief and admiration every bit as authentic as Paul was himself. It \nis a tribute to him and to the yearning I believe in this country for a \npolitics that can truly be the noble profession of putting principle \nabove the latest polls. Paul truly was the soul of the Senate. \nSometimes he cast votes that even some of his friends disagreed with--\non war or on welfare. But when he did, he was the mirror in which we, \nhis colleagues, looked at ourselves and searched our own hearts to ask \nwhether or not we were doing the right thing.\n  So we say thank you to the political science professor whose measure \nof truth was never in political theory, but the impact that his \ndecisions and ours had on real people.\n  Since he left us, Paul's friends and admirers have focused on Paul \nWellstone as the lone man in the arena fighting a battle against \ninjustice. Paul Wellstone was that. But he was also a doer who left \nbehind a real record of accomplishment in the Senate.\n\n  Paul was one of the Senate's leading voices for education, pushing \nfor investments in early education, for class size reduction, and for \nstudent financial aid so working and middle-class families could afford \nto send their kids through college. And we worked together tirelessly \nto increase the Federal Government's investment in special education, \nso students with disabilities could get the education that is their \nright.\n  Paul Wellstone worked alongside Senator DeWine to pass sweeping \nreforms of our Nation's job training, adult education, and vocational \nrehabilitation programs. By streamlining often confusing and \noverlapping programs and paperwork, Paul Wellstone's efforts are \nhelping ensure that America's workers get the training and help they \nneed to stay on the job or to find new employment.\n  As a warrior for peace, Paul understood this Nation's duty to the men \nand women who bear the scars of war. Paul authored, fought for, and \nhelped enact legislation to improve the living conditions of hundreds \nof thousands of American veterans. This law ensures that homeless \nveterans who suffer with alcoholism and drug addiction have ready \naccess to the treatment and care they need and deserve.\n  Paul also made a courageous push for a policy whose time had passed \nand should be done now, and that is mental health parity. Along with \nSenator Domenici, Paul authored the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996, a \ngroundbreaking proposal ensuring health care coverage of mental \nillnesses be provided on par with coverage of other medical illnesses. \nIn the final year of his life, he continued to push for the expansion \nof mental health coverage, again teaming with Senator Domenici to \nintroduce the bipartisan Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act, which \ncould expand parity for mental health insurance.\n  I hope that in the next Congress, the Senate and the House will enact \nwhat I hope will be deemed the Paul Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act, \nto finally put mental health on the same plain, the same level as all \nother medical illnesses.\n  Paul once said, ``Politics is about what we create by what we do, \nwhat we hope for, and what we dare to imagine.''\n  Paul didn't just dare to imagine a better America--he helped to build \nit. Sure, he was willing to fight the lonely fight when he thought it \nwas right and proper, but he also knew how to turn idealism and ideas, \nideas into action to improve people's lives--investing in education, \nexpanding health care, fighting killer diseases such as Parkinson's, \nhelping homeless veterans, and veterans exposed to radiation.\n  Because of what he did, family farmers will have a better future. \nBecause of what he demanded, mental illness will be soon treated \nequally in our health care system. Because of who he married--his wife \nSheila--and because of her passionate charge, more women and children \nwill find safe harbor from the scourge of domestic violence.\n  Paul Wellstone left us at a time when America needs him the most. He \nbelieved, as his champion and mentor Hubert Humphrey once said, that \n``the moral test of Government is how that Government treats those who \nare in the dawn of life, the children, those who are in the twilight of \nlife, the elderly, and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, \nthe disabled, and the needy.''\n  Those words, as much as anything else, form the focus of my public \nlife and, I hope, the true path of my political party. It is a course \nin conscience that Paul Wellstone tried to set for his party and his \ncountry.\n  But it now falls to each of us, those in the land of the living, to \ncontinue Paul Wellstone's journey for justice, to continue to speak \nout, to stand up and fight the good fight, and to lead our Nation with \ncourage and conviction. The times demand it. In the coming days, may we \nall have the courage of our friend, Paul Wellstone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11698-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11698-S11699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         WORKING WITH SENATORS DON NICKLES AND MITCH McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I first was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives, I knew a man by the name of Cliff Young who had also \nserved in the House of Representatives for two or three terms, ran for \nthe Senate, was defeated, and then served for many years in the Nevada \nState Senate, and then served in the supreme court, where he became the \nchief justice of the Nevada Supreme Court--that is also an elective \njob. At the end of this year, he will retire. He is a wonderful man, a \nRepublican, who rendered great service to the State of Nevada and to \nthe country. The reason I mention his name, however, is that he said: \nHarry, you are going to Washington to serve in the House. Make sure you \ndo a couple of things. One is use the gym. You need to get some \nexercise. Also, make sure you do nothing to change the seniority \nsystem. The seniority system is the only thing that gives that body, \nthe House of Representatives, stability.\n  He certainly spoke volumes when he said that because it is absolutely \ntrue. The seniority system in the House has some faults, but at least \nit gives that body stability. One of the things the Gingrich-led \nCongress did to hurt the House was change the seniority system.\n  I mention that because there is going to be a change in the Senate. \nMitch McConnell is going to take over for Don Nickles as the assistant \nRepublican leader, their whip. That is being brought about as a result \nof the fact that they do not follow the seniority system there and have \nterm limits on their jobs, except for the leader of the Republicans. \nThat is a rule they have, and even though I think it is wrong and I \nthink they are making a mistake doing it, that is the way it is.\n  Having said that, I want to acknowledge publicly how I have enjoyed \nserving with Don Nickles as my counterpart on the minority side. Don \nNickles and I have worked together since I came to the Senate. We were \non the Appropriations Committee together. We served as chairman and \nranking member on the Legislative Branch. We\n\n[[Page S11699]]\n\ndid a lot of work together on the Interior Appropriations Committee. I \nalways found him to be easy to work with, someone who is very set in \nhis views but would tell you how he felt. That has not changed in all \nof the years I have known him.\n  The reason I admire and respect Don Nickles is I do not agree with a \nnumber of things he wants to do politically and tries to do \npolitically, but he believes in those things. These are ideological \nfeelings he has, and I have great respect for people who do things \nbased on ideology. So I am going to miss Don Nickles in this capacity, \nand I want him to know that I have great admiration and respect for \nhim, and I consider the friendship we have developed over the years as \nsomething that is very important to me.\n  I say to Mitch McConnell, who is going to take his place, that I \nwelcome him. He will be assistant to the Republican leader, Senator \nLott, and will do a good job for him, but also for the Republicans \ngenerally. I have told him this personally and I say publicly, anything \nI can do to help the transition to make it more smooth, I will be happy \nto do that.\n  Mitch McConnell is someone whom I have gotten to know. Mitch \nMcConnell has held different leadership positions on the other side, \nincluding having been the campaign chairman, where he did an excellent \njob. He served in other capacities with the Republicans. A lot of times \nI disagree with what Mitch McConnell does politically, but he never \nhides his feelings from anybody. Campaign finance reform: There was a \ntrain moving down the track, and he was the only one brave enough to \nstand in front of it, and he never left. I have admiration for his \nstand on that issue, even though I disagree with what he wanted to try \nto do.\n\n  So I will miss Don Nickles. I welcome Senator McConnell. I have great \nrespect for his abilities and look forward to working with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11699-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to make one final \nplea with regard to unemployment compensation. It is important to \nremember what the Senate has done as we reflect back over the last many \nmonths in our efforts to deal with this issue.\n  We offered an amendment that was sponsored by our departed, \ndistinguished Senator Paul Wellstone. That legislation was the same as \nlegislation that Congress passed when the first President Bush was in \noffice in the early 1990s. We tried to pass it. Unfortunately, it was \nblocked by our Republican colleagues on eight different occasions.\n  Again, let me repeat. That was what we had in place when the first \nBush administration was in office. Unemployment benefits that were \nactually extended three times when President Bush Sr. was in office.\n  The Senate then took up a bipartisan compromise to extend benefits \nfor just 3 months. Republicans and Democrats got together. On the 14th \nof November we passed a simple extension for 3 months. Once again, the \nHouse refused to act.\n  So we took what was originally acceptable to the senior Bush \nadministration, and that didn't work with the House. Then we passed \nwhat worked on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate for a simple \n3-month extension, and that too didn't work for the House.\n  Over the course of the last 48 hours, we have been involved with \nHouse leadership, asking if there was any possible compromise, any way \nthat we could extend it for 2 months, 1 month, any way that somehow we \ncould send a message to the almost one million people who will lose \ntheir benefits on the 28th of December and to the 95,000 people who \nwill lose them each week following the 28th of December. Hundreds of \nthousands of people, ironically, right over the Christmas holidays will \nlose any opportunity to provide for their familiar with unemployment \ninsurance.\n  I must say I am disappointed to announce to my colleagues that once \nagain our House Republicans said no.\n  I have to say that I think it is a story right out of Charles \nDickens. I can't imagine that under these circumstances, even for a \nmonth, they couldn't see fit to act. Ebenezer Scrooge had a last-minute \nconversion. I hope that our Republican colleagues in the House will do \nso.\n  They are coming back on Friday and the Senate's bipartisan 3-month \nextension is waiting. I would urge the President--I ask President \nBush--to call on the House Republican leadership to recognize the \nconsequences of their inaction and pass our bipartisan unemployment \nextension.\n  We were, as I said, prepared to take whatever action necessary. We \nwould have stayed in session if we had to to accommodate something that \nthe House could have done to extend those benefits for a couple of \nmonths, which would have allowed us to work out something for a longer \nperiod of time.\n  That is my plea, my hope, recognizing, as I say, that hundreds of \nthousands of people will be affected at the worst possible time of the \nyear.\n  I again renew that request. I urge the President to act. I urge our \nHouse colleagues to reconsider.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I want to call upon the House to act \non the unemployment insurance compensation relief that we have passed \nin this body. I have been a cosponsor with other Members on this side \nof the aisle, as well as Senators Clinton and Sarbanes on the \nDemocratic side.\n  I think we need to pass the legislation over in the House which has \nalready cleared this body. If we do not, benefits are going to fall off \nthe cliff on December 28, as the majority leader stated. I hope the \nHouse will take up that important legislation and at least extend the \nbenefits until we can come back and deal in the new year with this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11699-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11699-S11703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       PRESIDENTIAL AUTHORITY TO INTRODUCE ARMED FORCES INTO IRAQ\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, earlier this year, I wrote to a number of \nconstitutional scholars advising them that I was concerned about \nreports that our Nation was coming closer to war with Iraq. I asked a \nnumber of esteemed academics their opinion as to whether they believed \nthat the Bush administration had the authority, consistent with the \nU.S. Constitution, to introduce U.S. Armed Forces into Iraq to remove \nSaddam Hussein from power.\n  All of the scholars I consulted responded by stating that, under \ncurrent circumstances, the President did not have such authority. \nSeveral of the professors I consulted, namely Peter Raven-Hansen of \nGeorge Washington University Law School, and Philip Trimble, Professor \nEmeritus of the UCLA School of Law, were kind enough to call and \ndiscuss their views on this subject with my office. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to thank them for taking the time to provide me \nwith their thoughts on this matter.\n  While those professors contacted me by phone, others provided written \nresponses. I have previously submitted for the Record the responses of \nprofessors Michael Glennon of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy \nat Tufts, Jane Stromseth of Georgetown University Law Center, Laurence \nTribe of Harvard Law School, and William Van Alstyne of the Duke \nUniversity School of Law.\n  Now, I would like to submit four additional responses I received on \nthis same subject from professors Jules Lobel of the University of \nPittsburgh School of Law, Thomas M. Franck of the New York University \nSchool of Law, Bruce Ackerman of Yale Law School, and Larry Sabato of \nthe University of Virginia. I found their analyses of this important \nissue to be exceptionally learned and informative. For this reason, I \nask unanimous consent that their responses be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11700]]\n\n                                          University of Pittsburgh\n\n\n                                                 School of Law\n\n                         Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, August 2, 2002.\n     Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate, Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Thank you for your letter of July 22, \n     2002 requesting my analysis of President Bush's \n     constitutional and/or legislative authority to introduce U.S. \n     Armed Forces into Iraq for the purpose of removing Saddam \n     Hussein from power. I too, am deeply concerned that the Bush \n     Administration is moving toward war with Iraq, and doing so \n     without congressional authorization. I only received your \n     letter Thursday, August 1 and unfortunately leave for \n     vacation on Saturday August 3rd. Because of the importance of \n     this issue, I intend to send you my opinion analysis today by \n     FAX.\n\n                I. President's Constitutional Authority\n\n       As you correctly state, Article I, Section 8 of the \n     Constitution provides Congress the power to, among other \n     things, declare war. (It also provides an important power \n     which is omitted from your letter, but which I and other \n     scholars have argued was designed to prevent the President \n     from unilaterally engaging in reprisals, or limited wars--the \n     power to issue letters of marque and reprisal.)\n       The meaning of the power to declare war is course, \n     contested, with Presidents at times asserting the power to \n     engage U.S. troops abroad in various limited actions. I, \n     along with many other constitutional scholars believe that \n     the Constitution requires congressional authorization for all \n     non-defensive, non-emergency deployment of U.S. forces in \n     combat against another country.\\1\\ Nonetheless, proponents of \n     Executive power argue that the President can initiate minor \n     uses of force without obtaining congressional approval. \n     Despite this dispute, virtually all scholars agree with Judge \n     Greene's interpretation of the war powers clause in the case \n     of Dellums v. Bush: where ``the forces involved are of such \n     magnitude and significance as to present no serious claim \n     that a war would not ensue if they became engaged in \n     combat,'' Congress has the authority under the Constitution \n     to decide upon whether to go to war. 752 F. Supp. 1141, \n     (D.D.C. 1990). In Dellums, Judge Greene held that in the \n     context of the U.S. threat of war against Iraq over its \n     invasion of Kuwait, ``the Court has no hesitation in \n     concluding that an offensive entry into Iraq by several \n     hundred thousand United States servicemen . . . could be \n     described as a `war' within the meaning of Article I, Section \n     8, Clause II of the Constitution'' To put it another way: the \n     Court is not prepared to read out of the Constitution the \n     clause granting to the Congress, and to it alone, the \n     authority ``to declare war.'' 752 F. Supp., supra at 1146.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Jules Lobel, Little Wars and the Constitution, 50 Miami \n     L. Rev. 61 (1995).

The courts, scholars \n     and even past Administrations have recognized that offensive \n     action involving significant numbers of U.S. troops facing a \n     substantial enemy requires congressional approval. See, e.g., \n     Mitchell v. Laird, 488 F.2d 611, 613-14 (D.C. Cir. 1973); \n     Berk v.

Rev. 180, 252 (1998) (``Certainly the initiation of \n     significant offensive hostilities in such a policy decision, \n     which under our constitutional system of government should \n     not be made without the approval of Congress.'') See also \n     Letter of Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger, \n     September 27, 1994, reprinted at 89 Am. J. Int'l 122, 126 \n     (1995) (recognizing that where U.S. forces attacked another \n     country without the consent of the recognized government, \n     leading to prolonged hostilities, inflicting substantial \n     casualties on the enemy, and involving such ``extreme'' uses \n     of force as sustained air ``bombardment,'' the United States \n     was engaged in ``war'' for constitutional purposes requiring \n     congressional authorization).\n       William P. Rogers, when he was President Nixon's Secretary \n     of State, argued that Congress' power to declare war is not \n     ``purely symbolic'':\n       ``While the legislative form in which the power is \n     exercised may change, nevertheless the constitutional \n     imperative remains: if the nation is to be taken into war, \n     the critical decisions must be made only after the most \n     searching examination and on the basis of a national \n     consensus, and they must be truly representative of the will \n     of the people. For this reason, we must ensure that such \n     decisions reflect the effective exercise by the Congress and \n     the President of their respective constitutional \n     responsibilities.''\n     William Rogers, Congress, the President and War Powers, 59 \n     Cal. L. Rev. 1194, 1212 (1971). Therefore, I conclude that \n     any invasion of Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein would involve \n     such significant forces and significant casualties so as to \n     be inescapably categorized as a war which under Article I, \n     Section 8 must be authorized by Congress.\n\n                       II. War Powers Resolution\n\n       The War Powers Resolution clearly would apply to any U.S. \n     effort to attack Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein, since such an \n     effort would introduce U.S. Armed Forces into imminent or \n     actual hostilities. Therefore Section 4(b)'s limitation on \n     such action to 60 (or 90) days would apply, as would the \n     reporting or consulting provisions of the Resolution. I would \n     also argue that the Resolution was not intended to, nor can \n     it override the Constitution's clear proscription that only \n     Congress can decide to engage the U.S. in an offensive attack \n     on another country. Therefore, prior to any such invasion, \n     congressional authorization must be sought and obtained by \n     the President.\n\n       III. Potential Legislative Authority for War Against Iraq\n\n       You also ask about two potential legislative sources of \n     authority for a Presidential decision to use force against \n     Iraq. Public Law No. 107-40 does not provide authorization \n     for the President to attack Iraq. The language of Section 2 \n     of the Act authorizes the President to use force against \n     nations he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided \n     the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or \n     harbored organizations or individuals who planned those \n     attacks, in order to prevent any future acts of international \n     terrorism by such organizations. To date, the Executive \n     Branch has offered no evidence that Iraq planned, aided or \n     harbored Al Qaeda in connection with the September 11 \n     attacks. The statute is clear that the authorization is \n     limited to using force in connection with responding to \n     nations, organizations and individuals connected with the \n     September 11 attack, and did not authorize any broad based \n     response to all forms of international terrorism. Indeed, the \n     original bill that the President submitted for authorization \n     was so broad as to plausibly authorize an attack on Iraq. \n     Congress refused to enact the President's proposed bill; \n     instead agreeing on the much narrower language currently \n     contained in Section 2 of Pub. L. No. 107-40.\n       Nor does Pub. L. No. 102-1, authorizing the President to \n     use force in 1991 to reverse Iraq's illegal invasion of \n     Kuwait, provide any authorization for a current assault to \n     remove Saddam Hussein. I understand the Administration's \n     argument to be that since Iraq has not complied with the \n     cease fire resolution 687 ending the 1991 war, Resolution 678 \n     is revived, and thus both the Security Council's and \n     Congress' authorization of force against Iraq pursuant to \n     Resolution 678 are revived. This position is clearly \n     erroneous and has been continuously rejected by the Security \n     Council. Michael Ratner and I wrote a lengthy article \n     published in the American Journal of International Law, 93 \n     Am. J. Int'l Law 124 (1999), refuting this position which had \n     been articulated by the Clinton Administration. To summarize \n     our general view:\n       (1) Permanent cease fires such as occurred after the 1991 \n     war generally terminate any U.N. authorization of force and \n     such authorizations are not revived by any purported material \n     breach by one side to the conflict.\n       (2) Article 34 of Resolution 687 is quite explicit that the \n     Security Council, and not individual states, has the \n     authority to determine whether Iraq has violated Resolution \n     687 and also what ``further steps,'' including presumably the \n     use of force, to take in order to implement that Resolution.\n       (3) The history of Resolution 687 also supports the \n     conclusion that it terminated the authorization of force \n     contained in Resolution 678. After the suspension of \n     hostilities in 1991, a provisional cease fire, Resolution 686 \n     was adopted. Resolution 686 explicitly refers to Resolution \n     678 and ``recognizes'' that it ``remain[s] valid'' during the \n     period required for Iraq to comply with the provisional cease \n     fire's terms. The Security Council dropped that language in \n     Resolution 687 which, unlike 686 does not recognize that \n     Resolution 687 remains valid. Of all the detailed provisions \n     in the cease-fire, only paragraph 4 guaranteeing the \n     inviolability of the Iraq-Kuwait border contains language \n     authorizing the use of force, and then only by the Security \n     Council and not by individual states. That the Council \n     decided to guarantee Kuwait's boundary by force if \n     necessary--a guarantee that is central to both Article 2(4) \n     of the Charter and the 1991 Persian Gulf war--excludes an \n     interpretation of Resolution 687 as continuing the Resolution \n     687 authorization so as to allow individual nations to use \n     force to rectify other, presumably less central \n     violations. It would be illogical for Resolution 687 to \n     require Security Council action to authorize force against \n     threatened boundary violations, yet dispense with such \n     action if Iraq violated another provision of the \n     resolution.\n\n[[Page S11701]]\n\n       (4) The subsequent history of the efforts to enforce \n     Resolution 687 demonstrates that only the Security Council \n     could authorize the use of force to enforce that Resolution's \n     terms. Resolution 1154 adopted on March 2, 1998 clarified the \n     view of a majority of the Council that its explicit \n     authorization was required to renew the use of force. As the \n     Russian delegate noted, ``No one can ignore the resolution \n     adopted today and attempt to act by bypassing the Security \n     Council.'' Similarly, France stated that the resolution was \n     designed ``to underscore the prerogatives of the Security \n     Council in a way that excludes any question of automaticity . \n     . . It is the Security Council that must evaluate the \n     behavior of a country, if necessary to determine any possible \n     violations, and to take the appropriate decisions.'' Other \n     members of the Security Council concurred.\n       Moreover, even if the Administration is correct and as a \n     matter of international law Resolution 678 is still in effect \n     and constitutes a U.N. authorization of force, the \n     congressional authorization of force in Pub. L. No. 102-1 is \n     significantly narrower than Resolution 678. Prior \n     Administrations have pointed out that Resolution 678 not only \n     authorized force to enforce the exant Security Council \n     Resolutions, but also to ``restore international peace and \n     security in the area,'' which could conceivably be read to \n     authorize removing Saddam Hussein from power. However, Pub. \n     L. No. 102-1 contains no equivalent language. The \n     congressional authorization only permits the President to use \n     force pursuant to Resolution 678 ``in order to achieve \n     implementation of Security Council Resolutions 600, 661, 662, \n     664, 665, 666, 667, 669, 670, 674 and 677. Since those \n     resolutions have now all been implemented and are not now at \n     issue (Resolution 687 is of course not mentioned in Pub. L. \n     No. 102-1), that law can not by any conceivable argument be \n     interpreted to authorize the use of force in the current \n     situation.\n       The Administration will undoubtedly argue that it has been \n     using force against Iraq for the past decade, enforcing the \n     no fly zones, and occasionally bombing Iraq, such as the \n     December 1998 four days of air strikes. Those uses of force \n     in my opinion and the opinion of many experts, and majority \n     of the Security Council have been illegal and \n     unconstitutional. That Congress may have for political \n     reasons acquiesced in or not strongly opposed such actions \n     does not, in my opinion, make them constitutional.\n       Moreover, whatever the constitutional and international \n     legality of those relatively minor uses of force, what the \n     Administration now proposes is of a totally different \n     character--both in magnitude and purpose. The scale, \n     magnitude and significant of an invasion of Iraq to remove \n     Saddam Hussein can not conceivably be covered by enforcing \n     the no-fly zone and intermittent bombing precedent. What is \n     clearly required in the present situation is an open \n     congressional debate and new authorization of force.\n       I have been involved in constitutional War Powers issues \n     for many years, both as a scholar and as a litagtor. As a \n     litigator, I have been bipartisan in opposing presidential \n     uses of force without congressional authority. I was lead \n     counsel for 57 democratic legislators who challenged the \n     elder President Bush's plan to go to war to drive Iraq from \n     Kuwait without receiving congressional authorization. I was \n     also lead counsel for a group of predominantly Republican \n     members of Congress led by Congressman Campbell who \n     challenged President Clinton's bombing of Yugoslavia in \n     response to the Kosovo crisis. I have also written on issues \n     involving constitutional war powers, with articles in the \n     Harvard International Law Journal, University of Pennsylvania \n     Law Review, University of Miami Law Review, American Journal \n     of International Law and other journals.\n       I apologize for this rushed answer to your letter, but I \n     wanted to get you a response before leaving on vacation. As \n     you can see, I, like you, have a deep concern about these \n     constitutional issues, and would be happy to assist you or \n     other legislators in any manner to ensure that these \n     questions are properly debated and voted on by Congress. I \n     will be out of my office for several weeks, but will call in \n     for messages and would be available for any consultation you \n     might wish. My office number is 412-648-1375 and my FAX \n     number is 412-648-2649.\n           Yours truly,\n     Jules Lobel.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          University of Pittsburgh\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                  Pittsburgh, PA, October 3, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     c/o Kathleen Hatfield.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Article 2(4) of the UN Charter prohibits \n     preemptive attacks on other nations. The Charter only allows \n     a nation to use force (1) in self-defense where it has either \n     been attacked or faces eminent attack, or (2) when the \n     Security Council authorizes such use of force. Article 6 of \n     the U.S. Constitution makes treaty provisions such as Article \n     2(4) of the UN Charter part of the ``supreme law of the \n     land.''\n       For Congress to authorize a preemptive attack on Iraq \n     without imposing a condition that the UN Security Council \n     first approve such force would therefore violate both the \n     Charter and our own supreme law. The general assumption has \n     been that Congress should not and cannot authorize aggressive \n     war. Indeed, the prohibition on aggression is considered a \n     fundamental, peremptory norm of international law and the \n     D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has suggested that Congress \n     does not have the Constitutional authority to authorize \n     actions that violate such norms. CUSCLIN v. Reagan, 859 F2d \n     929, 941 (D.C.Cir. 1988).\n       Therefore, if Congress wants to act legally, it must at \n     minimum include in any authorization a requirement that the \n     Security Council first approve the use of force before the \n     President launches such attack. Including such a condition \n     will also hopefully force Congress to discuss and debate the \n     legality of preemptive strikes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jules Lobel,\n     Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               New York University\n\n\n                                                School of Law,\n\n                                  New York, NY, September 4, 2002.\n     Senator Robert C. Byrd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: I regret that my absence, until \n     yesterday, has delayed my response to your letter of July 22, \n     2002. The issues as to which you have asked me to comment are \n     ones of great importance to the constitutional structure that \n     underpins our freedoms as Americans. I have therefore drafted \n     a bare-bones response for the sake of timeliness, but would \n     be glad to provide further comment and sources as to any part \n     of this submission.\n       (1) The War Powers Resolution. Because of its \n     unsatisfactory drafting, the President's obligations towards \n     Congress are quite limited. Under Section 5(b) the President \n     has broad authority to conduct hostilities before Congress' \n     approval is required. Since the provision of Section 5(c) has \n     been rendered migratory by decision of the Supreme Court \n     declaring the ``legislative veto'' essentially \n     unconstitutional, the Act now has more force in validating, \n     rather than invalidating, presidential war-making.\n       (2) Pub. L. No. 107-40 (9/18/01). This wildly overbroad \n     authorization for presidential war-making--more recently \n     egregiously echoed in legislation authorizing presidential \n     use of force in connection with Americans who may be \n     surrendered to the International Criminal Court by foreign \n     governments--allows the President broad latitude to use force \n     against any nation ``he determines'' to have ``planned, \n     authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that \n     occurred on September 11, 2001.'' And it even specifies that \n     this broad delegation constitutes authorization under Section \n     5(b) of the War Powers Resolution. ``He determines'' seems to \n     convey unlimited discretion It can be argued, however, that \n     such ``he determines'' language has been defined by courts in \n     reviewing other examples of delegates executive/\n     administrative authority as implying that the authority must \n     be exercised reasonably and justifiably. It can be further \n     argued, accordingly, that the President must justify the \n     reasonableness of his determination to the Congress. It is \n     not, however, a very powerful argument and, in the end, it \n     still leaves broad discretion with the President. It can also \n     be argued that the delegation was meant to be tied to the \n     events of September 11 and that the President's authority \n     therefore does not extend to the use of force when there is \n     no demonstrable connection to those events.\n       (3) Pub. L. No. 102-1 (1/14/91). This provision is \n     interpreted by the Executive as authorizing the use of force \n     against Iraq for an indefinite period of time. Congress, \n     however, wisely tied the authorization to the use of force \n     ``pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 678 \n     (1990).'' The force of argument that this authorization \n     continues to be in effect therefore depends on whether the \n     Security Council Resolution 678 remains effective. That \n     question compels consideration of international law: \n     particularly, Security Council Resolution 687 of 3 April \n     1991, which established a cease-fire but imposed on Iraq a \n     weapons monitoring regime as to which it is now clearly in \n     violation. It is unclear from the text of Resolution 687 \n     whether this meant to continue, suspend, or terminate \n     Resolution 678. Two considerations are relevant. One is that \n     para. 33 of S/Res/687 declares that, on the acceptance of the \n     conditions set by the Council, ``a formal ceasefire is \n     effective'' between Iraq and its opponents and that (para. \n     34) the council declares itself ``to remain seized of the \n     matter'' and retains for itself the power ``to take such \n     further steps as may be required for the implementation of \n     the present resolution and to secure peace and security in \n     the area.'' This does not seem to authorize states to use \n     force whenever they deem Resolution 687 to have been \n     violated, but, rather, makes such action conditional on \n     specific new Security Council authorization. (Note that, even \n     were such new authorization forthcoming, it would not \n     automatically revive the authority Congress gave the \n     President under Pub. L. No. 102-1.) The other consideration \n     is that the Council has never passed a resolution objecting \n     to the many instances in which the U.S. and its allies have \n     acted on their own (for example, by establishing and \n     enforcing ``no-fly zones''). This omission by the Security \n     Council is better understood, however, in terms of the \n     realities of the ``veto'' in the Council, and its deterrent \n     effect, than as evidence of Council acquiescence in such use \n     of force.\n       In sum:\n       (1) The war Powers Resolution does not help Congress, and \n     this may further illustrate the need for its repeal.\n       (2) Congress gave away far too much of its power in \n     enacting Pub. L. No. 107-40 and\n\n[[Page S11702]]\n\n     should avoid such extremely broad authorizations--in futuro \n     and extending to uncertain circumstances--of war-making \n     authority. Nevertheless, it can be argued that the authority \n     must be read to include a ``reasonably justified'' standard \n     for its exercise.\n       (3) Pub. L. No. 102-1 does not authorize the use of force \n     against Iraq because it is limited to war-making under the \n     aegis of Security Council Resolution 678, which was suspended \n     by Security Council Resolution 687.\n       I hope this will be of some assistance.

Even when the \n     president receives his plans from the military, he lacks the \n     authority to execute them. The Constitution makes him \n     commander in chief, but only Congress can declare war.\n       We have been here before.\n       Two days after the congressional elections of 1990, the \n     first President Bush ordered a massive increase of American \n     troops for an offensive against Iraq. Dick Cheney, then \n     Defense secretary, publicly announced that the president did \n     not ``require any additional authorization from the Congress \n     before committing U.S. forces to achieve our objectives.''\n       Fifty-four members of Congress responded by going to court \n     and demanding an injunction against military action until \n     both houses gave their explicit approval. The administration \n     was unimpressed by the lawsuit. It told the court to stay out \n     and treat the matter as a ``political question.''\n       The case speedily came to trial in federal district court, \n     where Judge Harold Greene roundly rejected the president's \n     claims.\n       While handing Congress a victory on the merits, Greene was \n     more cautious when it came to a remedy. In his view, the time \n     was not yet ripe for decisive judicial intervention. As far \n     as he could tell, a peaceful settlement with Iraq was still \n     possible, and it wasn't clear whether a majority of Congress \n     would oppose the war if negotiations broke down. So why \n     intervene when the whole issue might dissolve and make \n     judicial intrusion unnecessary?\n       The next move was up to the elder President Bush: He might \n     press on unilaterally and challenge Congress to return to \n     Greene's court for an injunction once war was clearly in the \n     cards. Or he could call a halt to the escalating \n     institutional battle and ask both houses explicitly to \n     authorize the war.\n       This was an easy choice for the public: Polls showed that \n     more than 70% favored explicit congressional authorization.\n       After mulling over the matter, the president bowed to the \n     combination of law and public opinion. In January 1991, he \n     dropped his unilateralist claim and formally requested both \n     houses to approve the attack against Saddam Hussein.\n       The first shot was fired only after Congress gave its \n     consent.\n       The argument for legislative authorization is more \n     compelling the second time around. In 1991, the country was \n     responding to a clear act of aggression. Nobody could doubt \n     that Iraq had invaded Kuwait. And a lengthy congressional \n     debate might have cost American lives because Hussein's \n     soldiers would have had more time to prepare for the \n     invasion.\n       The second President Bush can't take advantage of either \n     extenuating factor.\n       Rather than pointing to a clear boundary-crossing, he will \n     be offering circumstantial evidence of Iraq's atomic and \n     biological weapons program. If this evidence is truly \n     persuasive, he should have no trouble convincing a majority \n     of Congress. But if the president attempts to skirt Congress, \n     it will cast doubt on whether his claims can survive a fair \n     test in the court of public opinion.\n       Nor is time of the essence. We aren't dealing with a \n     situation where Iraqi troops can dig in while Congress \n     dithers.\n       A second American invasion would, at most, prevent a future \n     threat to national security. Nobody seriously suggests that a \n     debate of a week or a month would cause permanent damage.\n       There is no good reason for Bush to deviate from the \n     precedent set by his father in 1991.\n       But aren't we already embarked on a ``war against \n     terrorism''? In invading Iraq, isn't the president simply \n     opening another front in an ongoing struggle? This might \n     serve as a TV sound bite, but it is nonsense as a matter of \n     law.\n       Up until now, Congress authorized ``necessary and \n     appropriate force'' only against those who ``aided the \n     terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11.'' The Bush \n     administration has failed to implicate Hussein in those \n     attacks. If a second invasion of Iraq is justified, it is \n     because of a future threat.\n       The real question is how the administration meets its \n     constitutional responsibilities. The first President Bush did \n     not abandon unilateralism without a fight. Will his son also \n     escalate the institutional confrontation at home as he \n     accelerates war preparations abroad?\n       This is no time for constitutional brinkmanship. The \n     president should take the first opportunity to say that he \n     respects the constitutional precedents established during the \n     Gulf War. It will be tough enough to confront the prospect of \n     a major war soberly without attempting an end run around the \n     people's representatives.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Center for Politics,\n\n                             Charlottesville, VA, August 28, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert C. Byrd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Byrd: Thank you for requesting my views on the \n     U.S. constitutional and political questions surrounding \n     presidential war-making authority, especially as they apply \n     to the current situation with Iraq. I am happy to offer them, \n     for whatever they may be worth, and I will attempt to do so \n     in un-professorial fashion, by being relatively brief.\n       It is clear that the Founders fully trusted neither the \n     Executive nor the Legislature with war powers, and so they \n     divided them--making the President the commander-in-chief and \n     giving to the Congress the right to declare war. A reasonable \n     inference, then, is that the Founders expected the two \n     elective branches to share war powers, and to check and \n     balance one another in this life-and-death arena, as in so \n     many other areas of governmental authority. Neither the 20th \n     Century history of executive usurpation of congressional war \n     powers, nor the various interpretations and applications of \n     the War Powers Resolution since 1973, can change this \n     fundamental truth. Simply put, the executive usurpation in \n     the last century was constitutionally flawed. Moreover, the \n     unquestioned legislative goal of the War Powers Resolution \n     was to return to the Founders' original intent--that the \n     Congress should be thoroughly involved, and not just informed \n     or `consulted' after the fact, in this nation's acts of war. \n     Unilateral presidential action in Iraq based on S.J.Res.23 \n     (enacted after September 11, 2001) or the Congress' ``Iraq \n     Resolution'' of 1991 would be a real stretch, a result-\n     oriented rationalization that would be unwise and \n     constitutionally suspect.\n       Given the constitutional imperatives of war-making, it is \n     difficult to understand how any President could argue that \n     Congress does not have a co-equal role to play in an act of \n     war by this country against another sovereign state. This is \n     especially true in a case such as Iraq, where immediate \n     attack is not required, and where planning and build-up for \n     war will take many weeks. Let's note, too, that these \n     preparations will hardly be a secret, and that they will be \n     reported in some detail to the American people, and indeed \n     the entire world, including the enemy state.\n       My own academic specially is politics, and here the case \n     for full congressional consultation is overwhelming. A \n     President who undertakes a risky foreign war without the \n     expressed support of the American people is courting \n     disaster. Since (blessedly) we do not have any process for \n     national referendum, and since our system of government is \n     representative democracy, the logical institution to provide \n     both careful, elite review and broad, popular mandate for any \n     proposed war is the Congress. Presidents have often unwisely \n     tried to avoid this step, preferring complete executive \n     branch control. But surely a lingering, invaluable lesson \n     from the United States' tragic involvement in Vietnam is the \n     necessity to bring along the congress, and through it, the \n     American people, in a united commitment to succeed whenever \n     the lives of our soldiers and our national treasure are on \n     the line.\n       While initially reluctant to seek congressional \n     authorization for the Persian Gulf War in 1990-91, President \n     George H.W. Bush correctly asked for and received the support \n     of the Congress after a healthy, high-toned, and memorable \n     debate. At the time, no one knew for sure that the war with \n     Saddam Hussein could be won so quickly and easily. If the \n     fortunes of war had not been so favorable to our country, and \n     the Persian gulf conflict had taken many months to win, \n     President Bush would have been especially grateful for that \n     congressional vote to proceed. It would have provided a firm \n     basis for sustaining support and prosecuting the war until \n     victory was complete. So it will be in 2002-03 in any new war \n     with Iraq. Saddam Hussein may or may not fall quickly, and \n     the post-war turmoil may or may not engulf the Middle East \n     and entangle the United States for months or years. But come \n     what may, a congressional vote of authorization would provide \n     President George W. Bush with the political support to ask \n     for patience and sacrifice, should they be needed, over a \n     lengthy period of time. Our elected leaders in both \n     representatives branches would have given proper \n     constitutional consent, and as a nation, we would all be in \n     it together, to do what it take to win for as long as it \n     takes to win.\n       And what if the Congress, in its wisdom, should choose not \n     to authorize a war with Iraq at this time? Then our political \n     system would have worked equally well. For if one or both \n     houses of Congress should choose to say no, it would mean \n     that Congress sees that a war with Iraq has consequences too \n     serious to risk, or that such a war would not have the \n     requisite support of the American people. With the failure of \n     Vietnam as well as the success of the Persian Gulf War in \n     mind, the Congress might decide that this war could be closer \n     to the former than the later. And should Congress so decide, \n     and make this case convincingly to the citizenry, then surely \n     the nation would be grateful\n\n[[Page S11703]]\n\n     since one Vietnam is enough for all of American history.\n       Senator, I hope this analysis has been of some assistance \n     to you. Please let me know if I can help in any other way. \n     And please also accept my warm wishes and genuine admiration \n     for your work on our behalf.\n           Yours sincerely,\n\n                                              Larry J. Sabato,\n\n                            Director, U. VA. Center for Politics &\n                                 University Professor of Politics.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to address the fact that by the \nend of the year more than 2 million Americans will have exhausted their \nunemployment insurance.\n  There is no more pressing issue facing our Nation's workforce, and \nyet Congress has chosen to put partisanship ahead of what nearly \neveryone agrees is smart policy.\n  By passing widely divergent bills, the House and the Senate have \nvirtually ensured that on December 28 of this year thousands of workers \nwill be in the impossible position of trying to feed, clothe, and house \ntheir families with no work and no benefits.\n  I strongly support the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of \n2002, a bipartisan compromise bill which was introduced in the Senate \nin late September.\n  This bill, introduced by Senators Wellstone, Clinton, and Kennedy, \nwith the support of 33 Senators, extends unemployment benefits \nnationwide for 13 weeks, and provides 20 weeks of extended benefits for \nCalifornia and other high unemployment States.\n  It provides crucial temporary assistance to those who have been \nhardest hit by the current economic downturn, and provides them a \nchance to support themselves and their families while they look for \nwork.\n  Although the compromise bill passed by the Senate does not include \nthe 20-week extension that is vital to States such as California, which \nsuffer from a higher unemployment rate than the national average, it \nprovides a meaningful extension that could help American families, \nespecially during the Christmas holiday.\n  Let me stress that this bill is the product of bipartisan compromise, \nand is supported by Senator Nickles and other Republicans who have been \nvocal on this issue.\n  At the moment, millions of Americans have lost their job and are \nunable to find another, despite their efforts to reenter the labor \nforce. The number of Americans unable to find employment has increased \nfrom 5.7 million at the end of 2000 to more than 8.2 million today.\n  Even more disturbing, due to continued economic weakness, the number \nof Americans who have been out of work for over 6 months has almost \ndoubled from 900,000 to 1.5 million in the past year.\n  Between May and July of this year, approximately 900,000 workers \nexhausted the benefits made available through the extension that was \npassed in March.\n  By the end of this year, that number will increase to 2.1 million \nindividuals. Those are the individuals at greatest risk for falling \nthrough the social safety net we have provided for them.\n  This illustrates the critical need for an extension of unemployment \ninsurance that makes sense.\n  When the national economy was booming 2 years ago, California was \nparticularly blessed. California's economy grew at double-digit rates, \nand California become the fifth-largest economy in the world.\n  Billions of dollars of investment flowed into our State, and \nthousands of talented workers moved to California to take advantages of \nopportunities in Silicon Valley and other growth engines of the New \nEconomy. Now that picture is dramatically different.\n  A recent report by a group of economists at UCLA predicted that \nCalifornia's unemployment rate will rise to 6.5 percent next year, and \nthat nonfarm jobs in the San Francisco Bay area contracted by an annual \nrate of 4.6 percent between April and June of this year. After dropping \nto a decade-long low of 4.7 percent in December of 2000, the \nunemployment rate is back up to 6.4 percent as of the end of October. \nThe number of Californians receiving unemployment benefits has \nincreased to 470,000 from 430,000 1 year ago.\n  During this period of great economic hardship, we have a duty to give \npeople the chance to get back onto their feet. This is an obligation \nthat we have met in the past, most recently when faced with an economic \ndownturn during the first Bush administration.\n  The Senate voted in 1991 to extend temporary unemployment insurance \non five separate occasions. Each time such extensions were approved by \noverwhelming bipartisan majorities.\n  Therefore, I call on the House and Senate leadership to ensure that \nan extension of unemployment benefits for a full 13 weeks be the first \nitem considered during the 108th Congress. Although that will not \nprevent the expiration of benefits for many Americans, it will provide \na fairly rapid restoration of benefits to those who will be cut off at \nthe end of the year.\n  With that goal in mind, I have sent a letter to Speaker Hastert and \nSenator Lott with the signatures of more than 40 of my colleagues in \nthe Senate, asking them to bring up an extension of unemployment \ninsurance immediately upon reconvening next year.\n  Let me be clear: by ducking this issue we seem to be hoping that this \nproblem will disappear.\n  It will not, and if we do not address it now, we will not be living \nup to our obligation to the families of this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11703-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11703-S11704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNIZING STAFF INVOLVED IN HOMELAND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, putting the homeland security bill together \nhas been a difficult almost herculean task. Many Senators have played \nimportant roles in this legislation, but it could not have been done \nwithout the contributions of our staff. Without the aid of these \nindividuals, the work of this institution would be impossible to \naccomplish. I would like to recognize the hard work and dedication of \nthose staff members whose contributions to this legislation have been \ncritical and without whom we would not have been able to pass this \nbill.\n  On the Democrat side of the aisle, I want to recognize the \ncontributions of Senator Lieberman's staff--especially his staff \ndirector, Joyce Rechtschaffen, as well as Laurie Rubenstein, Mike \nAlexander, Kiersten Coon, Holly Idelson, Kevin Landy, Larry Novey, and \nSusan Propper. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of \nSarah Walter of Senator Breaux's staff, David Culver of Senator Ben \nNelson's staff, and Alex Albert of Senator Miller's staff.\n  On the Republican side, I would especially like to thank Richard \nHertling, Senator Thompson's Staff Director who, along with Rohit Kumar \nof my staff, was integral in the drafting of the bill that we are \nsending to the President. I would also like to compliment the rest of \nSenator Thompson's staff--Libby Wood Jarvis, Ellen Brown, Bill Outhier, \nMason Alinger, Alison Bean, John Daggett, Johanna Hardy, Stephanie \nHenning, Morgan Muchnick, Jayson Roehl, Jana Sinclair, Elizabeth \nVanDersarl and Allen Lomax--all of whom played an important role in \ncrafting this legislation. Senator Gramm's Legislative Director, Mike \nSolon, and David Morgenstern of Senator Chafee's staff also played very \nimportant roles in the process.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of those individuals \nfrom the other body and from the White House, all of whom dedicated \nsignificant time and effort to this bill. From the House of \nRepresentatives, the efforts of the House Select Committee staff--in \nparticular Hugh Halpern, Paul Morrell and especially Margaret \nPeterlin--were absolutely essential to drafting the compromise \nlanguage.\n  From the White House, I would like to thank Ziad Ojakli, Christine \nCiconne, Heather Wingate of the Legislative Affairs Office, Wendy \nGrubbs, Michael Allen, Richard Falkenrath, Sally Canfield and \nespecially Lucy Clark from Governor Ridge's Office of Homeland \nSecurity, Christine Burgeson from the Office of Management and Budget, \nBrad Berenson from the White House Counsel's office, and Joel Kaplan \nfrom Chief of Staff Andy Card's office for their assistance in putting \ntogether this legislation. Without their efforts and cooperation, this \nbill could not have come to pass.\n  These staff members have worked diligently and largely in anonymity. \nGiven all that they have done in service to their country, I think it \nis appropriate to recognize their work publicly, so that the rest of \nthe country knows,\n\n[[Page S11704]]\n\nas we all know, how well we are served by our staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11704-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11704-S11708]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DEPARTING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to our colleagues who \nare leaving the Senate. What many Americans do not realize is that the \nSenate is a place where many of us become friends. It is true that the \n100 men and women who serve in this wonderful body arrive here with \ndifferent backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We hold different \nphilosophies and ideas, represent states with different and at times \ncompeting interests and needs, and we pursue different goals. But we \nall share a lot in common by virtue of being here, and in the course of \nworking together on matters of national importance, we develop respect \nand admiration for our colleagues, and often genuine friendships are \nestablished. And so it is with the remarkable group of Senators who are \ncompleting their service as the 107th Congress draws to a close.\n\n\n                             Jean Carnahan\n\n  I want to speak first about Jean Carnahan, who has accomplished many \nfirsts in her lifetime, including being the first woman to represent \nMissouri in the United States Senate. She was also the first person in \nher family to graduate from college, in fact the first to graduate from \nhigh school.\n  Senator Carnahan has served the people of Missouri so well over so \nmany years, including her outstanding work during her time here in the \nSenate. We rightfully identify her with Missouri, but actually she grew \nup in Washington, DC, attending Anacostia High School and then George \nWashington University.\n  Her return to Washington 2 years ago should have been a happy \nhomecoming, but instead followed a calamity. Jean Carnahan arrived in \nthe Senate having suffered a seemingly unbearable tragedy, the death of \nher husband Mel and her oldest son Randy in a plane crash. She not only \nhad little time to grieve but also was immediately thrust into the \npublic arena.\n  Mel Carnahan had a distinguished 40-year career in Missouri politics \nserving as a judge, state representative, state treasurer, lieutenant \ngovernor, and for 8 years as a popular and respected governor and was a \nstrong candidate for the United States Senate at the time of his death.\n  Just days after the funerals for her husband and son, she was asked \nif she would serve in the Senate in Mel's place. It was a difficult \ndecision, and one she had to make amid shock and sorrow. Jean Carnahan \nwas not a politician, but she was her husband's political partner and \ntrusted adviser for many years, starting soon after their marriage. She \ncard-catalogued the names of every potential supporter and donor during \nher husband's career, wrote many of his speeches and wrote and \ndelivered many of her own.\n  Fortunately for Missouri and for us, she volunteered to serve, \nmotivated by a desire to further the work that Mel and she had done \ntogether to help the people of Missouri.\n  Talk about severe stress! Loss of her beloved husband, her high \nschool sweetheart, lifelong companion, loss of her son, moving to a new \nhome, changing jobs . . . all with people watching closely, openly \nquestioning her abilities and wondering if she would succeed.\n  Senator Carnahan has demonstrated remarkable composure and grace \nwhile proving that she was indeed up to the challenges of the Senate. \nShe had to learn the intricacies of legislation and policy quickly, and \nI am sure she would have been even more effective if given the \nopportunity to serve longer.\n  But she succeeded by seeking commonsense solutions to complex \nproblems and helping to forge compromises. She didn't seek attention or \ncredit for her accomplishments but worked hard and made a difference.\n  Senator Carnahan's accomplishments include helping protect the jobs \nof more than 12,000 airline employees during the merger negotiations \nbetween TWA and American Airlines. She also worked hard to help local \nschool districts hire teaching specialists and deal with disruptive \nstudents. Her Quality Classrooms provisions were included in the \nlandmark education bill we passed last year.\n  Senator Carnahan supported efforts to bolster our national security \nand win the war on terrorism. She was a member of the first bipartisan \ncongressional delegation to travel to Afghanistan to visit the troops \nand meet with regional leaders.\n  And I am especially grateful for her strong opposition to the \nAdministration's plan to ship nuclear waste across the country to Yucca \nMountain. Many people thought this plan would harm only Nevada, but she \nunderstood that storing nuclear waste in Nevada would require tens of \nthousands of shipments of highly dangerous substances across highways \nand railroads in Missouri and almost every other state. And she could \nnot accept this risk of potential harm to the children and families and \nenvironment of our great country.\n  So Jean Carnahan deserves our admiration, respect and gratitude for \nall she has done. She has occupied Harry Truman's seat in the United \nStates Senate and worked at his old desk. Missouri should be proud of \nhow she has continued Harry Truman's legacy and her husband's legacy \nand been an advocate for the working families of Missouri.\n  By a narrow margin she was unable to overcome a well-funded opponent \nwhose campaign benefitted from the popularity of the President this \nyear. She might have come up short in this election, but she \nunderstands that a political defeat is not the most significant loss \none can suffer.\n  Her time here has been all too brief, but Senator Jean Carnahan has \nmade a difference and I will miss her very much.\n  Jean will enjoy spending time on her family farm in Rolla, Missouri, \nvisiting with her children and grandchildren. And I expect her to \ncontinue writing books, giving speeches and advice. She has much to \nsay, and we would do well to hear and read her words.\n\n\n                              Max Cleland\n\n  I also wish to pay tribute to Max Cleland, Georgia's senior senator \nand a true American hero.\n  While his story is familiar to those of us fortunate enough to know \nhim and have served with him, I encourage Americans looking for \ninspiration to read his book Strong at the Broken Places, which \ndescribes his experiences overcoming tremendous adversity and reveals \nhis remarkable character.\n  He is a native Georgian who is proud of his state and has served it \nso well for so long, but Max Cleland personifies qualities that the \npeople of Nevada and all Americans appreciate: patriotism, courage, and \nfortitude.\n  Max Cleland was awarded the Bronze Star and a Silver Star for \nmeritorious service in Vietnam.\n  During college he joined the Army ROTC program and after graduation \nhe took a Second Lieutenant's commission in the Army. Max Cleland \nvolunteered for duty in Vietnam in 1967 and the following year he was \npromoted to the rank of Captain.\n  Just one month prior to the end of his tour of duty, he was seriously \nwounded in a grenade explosion. As a result he lost both legs and his \nright arm.\n  His body broken, he spent the next year and a half recovering from \nhis injuries in various Army and Veterans Administration hospitals. \nDespite his enormous sacrifice, he refused to let his injuries break \nhis spirit. And he did not dwell on his own experiences but rather \nsought to help others.\n  He described the difficulties veterans were experiencing returning \nhome from Vietnam in testimony before the United States Senate Veterans \nAffairs Committee in 1969.\n  The next year, he was elected to the Georgia State Senate, thus \nbeginning a career in public service that has continued for more than \n30 years. As the youngest member of the Georgia Senate at the age of \n28, he wrote the state law making public facilities in the state \naccessible to the disabled.\n  Max was hired to work for the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee in \n1975 and two years later, President Jimmy Carter appointed him to head \nthe U.S. Veterans Administration. He became the youngest VA \nadministrator in history and the first Vietnam veteran to head the \nagency. In this position, he instituted the revolutionary ``Vets Center \nprogram'' which for the first time offered psychological counseling to \ncombat veterans in order to heal their emotional wounds as well as \ntheir physical wounds. There are now more than 200 Vets Centers across \nthe country offering support to combat and\n\n[[Page S11705]]\n\nnon-combat veterans and their families.\n  Continuing to set precedents, he became the youngest Secretary of \nState in Georgia's history when he won election in 1982. He was so \neffective and so popular that he won reelection by large margins three \ntimes. He resigned as Secretary of State in 1995 to run for the U.S. \nSenate seat being vacated by Sam Nunn. Although he was outspent three \nto one, Max Cleland overcame this obstacle as he has done throughout \nhis life, and he won.\n  Over the past 6 years, Senator Cleland has made important \ncontributions to the people of Georgia, the people of Nevada and all \nAmericans, helping to safeguard our homeland, keep our military strong \nand treat our veterans fairly.\n  As the Chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Cleland has fought to improve the quality of life of \nour nation's active duty, reserve and retired military personnel. He \nhas lobbied to improve health care, education and retirement benefits.\n  While Max Cleland will be leaving the Senate, I know that he will \ncontinue serving the people of this country he loves so much. He also \nwill marry his fiancee Nancy, and I wish them much happiness.\n\n\n                           Robert Torricelli\n\n  Robert Torricelli has devoted his entire adult life to public \nservice, including the past 20 years in Congress. He was elected at the \nage of 31 to the House of Representatives in 1982, the same year I was, \nand I enjoyed serving with him in the House and more recently in the \nSenate.\n  Bob Torricelli has served his constituents in New Jersey so well as a \ntough fighter, an articulate debater and an effective legislator.\n  He has also been so good to Nevada as a great friend and advocate for \nthe gaming industry, an important part of our state's economy. And he \njoined with us in opposing the Administration's plan to transport the \nnation's nuclear waste for storage at Yucca Mountain.\n  Bob also was highly successful as the chairman of the Democratic \nSenate Campaign Committee during the 1999-2000 election cycle, \nrecruiting strong candidates and raising money to allow them to get \ntheir message out and be competitive. He targeted weak opponents and \nhelped Democratic candidates defeat the largest number of Republican \nincumbents in many years. These surprising results enabled our party to \nreach a 50-50 split in the Senate and positioned us to become the \nmajority party subsequently.\n  There has been no finer advocate in the Senate than Senator \nTorricelli. He has been articulate, knowledgeable and experienced.\n  Senator Torricelli's departure from this body is a sad time. I know \nhow passionately he cares about politics and how devoted he has been to \npublic service.\n  I will miss Bob. Nevada will miss Bob. Our country will miss Bob. But \none thing I will not miss is his friendship; we have bonded, and our \nfriendship is forever.\n\n\n                             Strom Thurmond\n\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in recognizing the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina and his years of service in \nthe United States Senate.\n  Strom Thurmond has lived almost one century, his 100th birthday will \nbe December 5th, and he has been a Senator for almost half of that \ntime. He is now finishing his eighth full term, making him the longest-\nserving Senator and the oldest member of Congress.\n  But Senator Thurmond is known, and will long be remembered, for much \nmore than his longevity.\n  He has had a remarkable life and career of service to South Carolina \nand the United States, having served as a school superintendent, state \nsenator, judge and as the Palmetto State's Governor.\n  He entered the nation's military when he was 21 years old and almost \n20 years later volunteered to serve in World War II. He was among the \nbrave American troops who landed in Normandy on D-day with 82nd \nAirborne Division, and he received numerous awards for his military \nservice including the Bronze Star for Valor and a Purple Heart.\n  Senator Thurmond has fought no less fiercely in the political arena. \nHe has used his gifts, experience, the power and respect he has earned \nand knowledge of Senate rules and procedures to advocate on behalf of \nhis causes.\n  Although he has switched political parties during his career, serving \nfirst as a Democrat, running for President as a ``States Rights'' third \nparty candidate in 1948, and becoming a Republican in 1964, he has \nconsistently adhered to his political ideology.\n  I am glad that we have an opportunity to acknowledge his \ncontributions and to reflect on the considerable impact he has had on \nthis body, his party, and the nation.\n  Senator Thurmond is a living monument, but just to make sure his \nservice is recognized, the people of South Carolina, whom he has \nrepresented for so long, have honored him by erecting a monument for \nhim and naming dozens of facilities for him.\n  Senator Thurmond will certainly be missed around here. I bid him \nfarewell and extend my best wishes to him and his family.\n\n\n                              Jesse Helms\n\n  Jesse Helms is retiring after serving five terms in the Senate. \nDuring this time, he has become a legend. He has been a powerful \nlegislator and wielded significant influence on issues within the \nSenate and events around the world.\n  While he and I do not share the same philosophy of government and \nhave not always agreed on policies, I have no doubt that he believes \nsincerely in his causes, and I admire the passion with which he has \nfought for what he believes is right.\n  As I have noted previously, the Senate is a place where many \nfriendships are forged, even among people who seem unlikely to get \nalong. But what many people don't understand is that it is possible to \ndisagree without being disagreeable.\n  Senator Helms has succeeded in charming and befriending many people, \nranging from fellow Senators to internationally known rock stars, who \nstrongly disagree with much of what he advocates.\n  Certainly, the Senate will be different without Jesse Helms, and I \nwish him the best.\n\n\n                            Frank Murkowski\n\n  As the people of Nevada know all too well, Frank Murkowski can be a \ntough opponent. He has led the effort in the Senate to push through the \nAdministration's plan to transport tens of thousands of tons of nuclear \nwaste through most of the Lower 48 for storage at Yucca Mountain, and \ntherefore he and I have often been on opposing sides.\n  But I recognize that his motives are not personal; he has a different \nvision of what our priorities should be and what policy is the best \ncourse of action. He has been a forceful advocate for Alaska here in \nthe Senate since 1980, and he will continue to be one after he leaves \nto serve as Alaska's next Governor.\n\n\n                               Phil Gramm\n\n  Phil Gramm has been an influential politician and has had an \ninteresting life. Although he flunked third, seventh and ninth grades, \nhe received a Ph.D. in economics. This education instilled in him a \nstrong belief in free markets, and he brought that understanding to \nWashington, along with his speeches about a Texas print shop owner \nnamed Dicky Flatt who has been cited as a representative American \nresistant to government spending.\n  Phil was elected to the House of Representatives first as a Democrat \nand then again after he became a Republican. He was elected to the \nSenate in 1984 and has authored major pieces of legislation during his \ncareer, perhaps most notably the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings effort to reduce \nthe federal budget deficit.\n  On this issue, as on so many others, Senator Gramm has been \nrelentless. You always knew where he stood and always heard what he \nsaid. He will be missed.\n\n\n                               Bob Smith\n\n  I have the greatest affection for the departing Senator from New \nHampshire Bob Smith. He and I worked together for one difficult year \nwhen he was the co-chairman of the MIA/POW Committee along with Senator \nKerry. They led us as we completed that most important study, and I \nlearned a lot about Senator Smith in the process.\n\n[[Page S11706]]\n\n  He served in the Navy in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War, \nso he was very interested in the issue of missing soldiers. And he is a \nreal patriot, committed to making sure America's military is strong. \nBob Smith loves this country.\n  Our friendship was cemented when we were asked to lead the Ethics \nCommittee and had to resolve very difficult issues. He impressed me \nwith his institutional awareness, intelligence and historical \nknowledge, and I found him to be a true gentleman. In addressing the \nissues before the Ethics Committee he was firm and strict but fair, \nwhich is what leadership of that group requires.\n  Senator Smith and I also served together on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, including a time when he was Chairman and I was \nRanking Member. He might have surprised a lot of people with his \nconcern for the environment, but I am proud that we were able to work \ntogether to protect this nation's air and water, to defend wildlife and \npreserve the environment.\n  Bob Smith is a friend. I was disappointed with the results of the \nelections in the Granite State, and I am going to miss him.\n\n\n                             Fred Thompson\n\n  Fred Thompson leaves the Senate after 8 years of service. It seems \nlike he has been here much longer perhaps because he has been so highly \nvisible both in public service and as an entertainer.\n  Fred Thompson not only has been a Senator; he also has played one on \nTV. His other acting roles include leader of the CIA, the FBI, and \nWhite House Chief of Staff.\n  Many Americans first noticed Fred Thompson during the Watergate \ncrisis. He was a young lawyer serving as minority counsel to the Senate \nWatergate Committee in 1973, and he played a role in the public \ndisclosure of the tapes President Nixon recorded in the Oval Office. Of \ncourse the scandal led to the President's resignation.\n  And since that introduction, we have come to know Fred Thompson well \nand know we can rely on his intelligence, judgment, wit, and insight.\n  He has been a skillful negotiator in the Senate, a popular colleague \nand someone people look up to.\n  While he will be missed around here, I take comfort knowing I will be \nable to see him frequently on TV and in the movies.\n\n\n                             Tim Hutchinson\n\n  Senator Tim Hutchinson grew up on a farm in rural Arkansas and \ngraduated from Bob Jones University. So he and I have had different \nexperiences and are guided by different beliefs. Not surprisingly, we \nhave often voted differently. But I do not question how dearly he holds \nhis convictions, and I recognize that he has been a dedicated advocate \nfor the people of Arkansas throughout his 10 years in Washington--4 \nyears in the House of Representatives and 6 here in the Senate.\n  Tim Hutchinson is part of a family that has had a significant impact \non politics in the state of Arkansas: when Tim ran for the Senate, his \nbrother Asa ran for and won the seat Tim had held in the House. Asa has \nsince gone on to become the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement \nAgency. I have worked with both Tim and Asa, and I understand Tim's son \nis now a state legislator so I might have the opportunity one day to \nwork with him too.\n  Before he leaves, let me extend my appreciation to Senator Hutchinson \nfor all his kind deeds toward me. Despite our differences, we have had \na good relationship. We have worked together on my concurrent receipt \nlegislation to secure retirement benefits for disabled military \nretirees and on a number of other issues. He and his brother are both \nconsiderate, thoughtful gentlemen. I wish him well in whatever comes \nnext.\n\n\n                              Dean Barkley\n\n  In contrast to longest-serving Senator in history, Dean Barkley wraps \nup one of the shortest terms ever, having taken his oath of office just \nlast week. Of course, we all recognize the sad and special \ncircumstances which led to his being here: the tragic death of our dear \nfriend and colleague Paul Wellstone. I have already spoken of Paul \nWellstone, how much he accomplished here in the Senate, what his role \nwas and his legacy will be, and what I remember of our personal \ninteraction. I said that Paul Wellstone is irreplaceable. Nobody, \nwhether they serve 2 weeks or 2 decades, will fill his shoes. To his \ncredit, Dean Barkley understood that and he realized what his role \nduring his brief time in the Senate should be. I spoke with him shortly \nafter his appointment. He had a lot of pressure on him to align with \none side or the other and he could have created a lot of problems. \nFortunately, he decided it would be best for the people of Minnesota \nnot to change the balance in the Senate, and he stuck to the \nindependence streak for which he is known. Dean Barkley was not here \nlong, but he has taken his position seriously, and I am sure he has had \nan unforgettable experience. I thank him for his service and wish him \nwell.\n\n\n                               Bob Smith\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Bob Smith loved serving the people of New \nHampshire. I have witnessed Bob's high regard for the office he has \nheld here in the U.S. Senate; he has taken his job seriously, both in \nWashington and at home. He is a man of strong family values and hearty \nresolve, two fundamental characteristics of our State. Bob is not a \nprogrammed politician. In fact, he is the opposite. He has always been \ndriven by his independence and conservative ideas.\n  When Bob and Mary Jo Smith first moved to New Hampshire, they did not \nwaste any time getting involved in the Lakes Region community. Bob \nbecame a high school history and government teacher and helped coach \nthe football and baseball teams. He also got involved in local politics \nby joining the school board. Fourteen years after settling in New \nHampshire, Bob was elected into the U.S. House of Representatives, \nwhere he served until he was elected to the Senate.\n  Here in the Senate, Bob has been an advocate and representative for \nthe interests of New Hampshire, taking strong stands on the issues he \ncares about. Regardless of political bias, it can never be said that \nBob Smith did not stand up for what he believed in, a fact that is \nknown and respected in New Hampshire.\n  He became chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nproviding leadership and a voice for New Hampshire on environmental \nissues. He has continued to speak out for the concerns of States like \nNew Hampshire.\n  On the Armed Services Committee, Bob has championed the cause of \naccounting for American prisoners of war and those service men and \nwomen who are reported missing in action. As a veteran of the Navy and \nthe Vietnam War, Bob has long advocated for a strong military and \nunderstands the importance of government support and assistance for \nbrave members of our armed services.\n  During the past 18 years, Bob has shown grace and strength. He has \nserved New Hampshire with honor and I admire his courage in standing up \nfor what he believes in time and time again. Bob, his wife Mary Jo, and \ntheir three children have spent the past eighteen years achieving well \nthe difficult balance of raising a family while simultaneously handling \nthe constant demands of public office. I want to take this opportunity \nto congratulate my colleague on his distinguished career and thank him \nfor his service to New Hampshire.\n\n\n                             fred thompson\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, at the conclusion of this year, we will \nbid farewell to a Senator who is larger than life, both literally and \nfiguratively.\n  Fred Thompson, may chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nand my food friend, will be leaving the Senate after 8 years of \ndistinguished service.\n  While there is no question that the people of Tennessee would have \nreturned him to the Senate for another term had he chosen to seek it, \nFred decided that there is life after the Senate--and if the past is \nprologue, we can be sure that it will be an interesting life.\n  Fred came to this body after a varied and distinguished career. He \nhad been a prominent public servant--most notably as an assistant U.S. \nattorney and as the Republican counsel to the Watergate committee--as \nwell as a skilled lawyer and a gifted actor. From his days with \nSenators Howard Baker and Sam Ervin in the Watergate hearings, to his \nrole in exposing the sale of pardons in the State of Tennessee, to his\n\n[[Page S11707]]\n\nacting in 18 films, Fred brought a keen intellect, a great sense of \nhumor, and an exceptional capacity for hard work to every task. And \nthose are the very characteristics that have marked his Senate service.\n  Fred has been a leader in the Senate on a wide variety of critical \nissues, including intelligence reform and oversight, reducing the \nthreat posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and \nreducing the tax burden on American families. He was among the first to \njoin Senators McCain and Feingold in the quest for campaign finance \nreform and fairly and effectively chaired extensive hearings to expose \nthe abuses in the financing of the 1996 Presidential campaign.\n  As chairman and later ranking Republican on the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, his efforts have led to management and regulatory reforms as \nwell as the passage of the legislation to create the new Department of \nHomeland Security.\n  In the 6 years that I have worked closely with Fred, I have never \nknown him to be unprepared. I have never known him to be undisciplined. \nAnd I have never known him to be anything less than eloquent--although, \nas a Yankee, I may not always appreciate the subtlety of his colloquial \nexpressions. Two examples that I recall with special fondness are: \n``Don't load up the wagon unless you're willing to pay the freight,''--\nwhich is, I believe, a reference to spending proclivities--and then, my \npersonal favorite: ``It's like teaching a pig to dance. It wastes your \ntime, and it irritates the pig.\n  Of course, Fred is much more than just quotable. Fred is a truly \ncourageous leader. He actually relishes being in the minority, even a \ntiny minority, when one of his basic principles, such as States rights \nand the 10th amendment, is at issue. He always votes his convictions--\neven when the current polls suggest that public sentiment is on the \nother side. His good judgment and his careful consideration of every \nissue are a model for all of us. Fred's fearless leadership is one of \nmany reasons why his constituents, even those who may disagree with \nhim, hold him in such high regard. They know that Fred Thompson will \nspeak the truth and do with it right, that he will make the hard \nchoices, and that the well being of his constituents and our country \nguides his every decision.\n  No one can be certain what the future will hold for Fred. We know \nthat he has already drawn on two of his previous careers--the law and \nacting--by signing on to play the avuncular district attorney on the \npopular television show, ``Law and Order.'' It also seems very likely \nthat he will have future responsibilities in Government, since I \nanticipate that this President will seek to use his extraordinary \ntalents.\n  But no matter what Fred Thompson's post-Senate career may entail, one \nconclusion can be stated with confidence. He has graced this \ninstitution and served his Nation well. I feel so fortunate to have \nserved with him during these past 6 years, and I shall miss him.\n  Godspeed, my friend.\n\n\n                             TIM hutchinson\n\n  Mr. President, I rise this morning to pay tribute to my colleague and \ngood friend from Arkansas, Senator Tim Hutchinson.\n  I have particularly enjoyed working with Tim on the Senate HELP \nCommittee. We have literally worked ``shoulder to shoulder'' both in \ncommittee and on the Senate floor on many issues of tremendous \nimportance to the health and well-being of all Americans--the Patients' \nBill of Rights, legislation to increase access to more affordable \nprescription drugs, home health care, increased funding for diabetes \nresearch, and legislation to increase access to health care in the \nrural and underserved areas of our country.\n  Tim demonstrated his ability to reach across the aisle and work on a \nbipartisan basis when he joined with Senator Mikulski in developing \nlegislation to address our Nation's growing shortage of registered \nnurses. I was pleased to join as an original cosponsor of the Nurse \nReinvestment Act, which has been signed into law, and which will \naddress this problem by providing incentives for individuals to enter \nthe nursing profession, providing continuing education and \nopportunities for advancement within the profession, and increasing the \nnumber of nurse faculty to teach at our nursing schools.\n  Senator Hutchinson has also been a leader and an advocate for our men \nand women in uniform, and I have been honored to serve with him on the \nSenate Armed Forces Committee. As the ranking member on the personnel \nsubcommittee, he has seen to the needs of the soldiers, sailors, \nairmen, and marines time and time again. He has fought to ensure that \nthe men and women serving our country receive adequate pay and \ncompensation, and this year he went to the mat to support our military \nretirees on concurrent receipt/special compensation.\n  In January 2000, I traveled with Senator Hutchinson to Japan, South \nKorea, and Taiwan where we got an update on the region and had an \nopportunity to meet with many troops there. In particular, Senator \nHutchinson spent a lot of time speaking with our troops who were \nserving proudly on the front line of the DMZ. In Korea, it was the dead \nof winter, and the meeting rooms in South Korea actually straddled the \nDMZ line.\n  On that trip we also visited the U.S.S. Kitty Hawk in Japan, where I \nfound that Senator Hutchinson had a special place in his heart for our \nnaval forces. We also made history when we met with the first \ndemocratic president of Taiwan--President Lee.\n  Senator Hutchinson has always taken the time to listen to our troops \nand military leaders, as he was always looking for ways that he could \nmake a positive difference for these young men and women proudly \nserving our country. Senator Hutchinson will be greatly missed, but his \nlegacy and accomplishments will remain in our history forever.\n\n\n                             Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a friend \nand colleague who is retiring from the Senate after eight years of \nprincipled and distinguished service. The Senate will lose an extremely \ndedicated public servant and also a good bit of star power when Fred \nThompson leaves us at the end of the 107th Congress.\n  I had the pleasure of serving on the Governmental Affairs Committee \nheaded by Senator Thompson from 1997 until June 2001. I appreciate \nSenator Thompson's determination in pursuing fiscal accountability and \nrelentlessly seeking a smaller and more efficient Federal Government. \nSenator Thompson's leadership on issues such as the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction and missile technologies has made an \nenduring contribution to our national security, and I have enjoyed \nworking closely with him on matters related to our national \nlaboratories. I would like to thank Senator Thompson for his tireless \nwork more recently on the monumental task of creating a Department of \nHomeland Security. I submit that his industry and integrity in this \nhistoric undertaking will leave him a legacy of which he should be \nproud.\n  The people of Tennessee first elected Senator Thompson to the Senate \nin 1994, to fill an unexpired two-year term. When he was reelected in \n1996, he made history by garnering more votes than any previous \ncandidate for any office in Tennessee. A native of Lawrenceburg, TN, \nThompson worked his way through school to earn an undergraduate degree \nin philosophy and political science from Memphis State University, and \na law degree from Vanderbilt University. Only two years after law \nschool, Thompson was named an Assistant United States Attorney. \nThompson was then appointed at the age of 30 as minority counsel to the \nSenate Watergate Committee, where he served in 1973 and 1974. Before he \nwas elected to the Senate, Fred Thompson operated successful law \npractices in Nashville and Washington and served as Special Counsel to \nthe Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  While many know that Senator Thompson is embarking on a new role as \ndistrict attorney in the television series Law & Order, his talents for \nlaw and acting first came together in the film Marie, in which he \nportrayed himself after taking on a case in 1977 that uncovered a cash-\nfor-clemency scandal that unseated Tennessee's Governor. Fred Thompson \nhas subsequently acted in 18 motion pictures, including In the Line of \nFire, Die Hard II and The Hunt\n\n[[Page S11708]]\n\nfor Red October, as well as four television series.\n  Some might characterize Fred Thompson's uncommonly successful career \nin show business as a natural complement to the daily business of the \nSenate. What I know is that whether on the big screen or on the floor \nof the Senate, Fred Thompson's larger-than-life presence has touched \nthe lives of a great many Americans, and he will be sorely missed by \nhis colleagues in the Senate. I thank my colleague for his eight years \nof distinguished service in which he has enlivened the Senate and \nserved his country with uncommon resolve. I wish Senator Thompson the \nvery best in his retirement and all his future endeavors.\n\n\n                            frank murkowski\n\n  Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of my distinguished \ncolleagues, a Senator from the class of 1980. From our seats on the \nsame side of the aisle, I have been able to serve 22 years with my \nlong-time friend, and colleague, Senator Murkowski.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Murkowski for his \ndistinguished career of service both to our Nation and his home State \nof Alaska, and to congratulate him. Senator Murkowski has been a great \nadvocate of his State, which has been demonstrated by his winning 75 \npercent of the vote in 1998, and the gubernatorial race in this last \nelection. As the Senator moves onto a new challenge, I wish him well \nwith his efforts to continually serve the people of Alaska.\n  As I look at the past seven years, and all that the Senator has \naccomplished during his time as chairman of the Energy Committee, I \nknow that these will be big shoes to fill. Throughout his career, the \nSenator has held steadfast to his ideals, while fighting for improved \nveterans' health care, and the search for American POW/MIAs, as \nChairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. While on the Finance \nCommittee, the Senator from Alaska played a pivotal role in passing the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Senator Murkowski, his professional manner, and his willingness to \nwork have made him an asset to our Senate. We, in the Senate, will be \nat a loss without his unrelenting will-power, and determination.\n  Senator Murkowski has been a friend and servant to the citizens of \nAlaska, earning a reputation for unbeatable service to his \nconstituents. We have always had a lot in common, fighting for the \ninterest of our predominantly rural States. I have always been \nimpressed with his capability to keep the diversified interests of his \nState in mind, while developing bills to improve and preserve the \ntradition, and way of life, for Alaskan citizens. Alaska will be lucky \nto have him as their Governor.\n  Today I join my colleagues in offering a goodbye, and good luck, to \nSenator Murkowski, a tenacious man of high-integrity, for his years of \ndedicated service. I will certainly miss my friend, and wish him the \nbest as he enters his new career as Governor of Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11708-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11708-S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                      Phil Gramm and Fred Thompson\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the time has come--as it does at the \nconclusion of every Congress--to honor those members who will be \ndeparting from this body. This is a task not easily done. The Senate is \none of the highest pinnacles in public service to our nation. Those who \nserve here have often dedicated their lives--and with great success--to \nchanging America for better.\n  Today I wish to honor two Senators who have indeed changed America \nfor the better--Phil Gramm and my fellow Tennessean and partner in the \nSenate for the last eight years, Fred Thompson.\n  Senator Gramm began his service in Congress as a House Democrat in \n1978. Five years later he switched parties. But rather than serve out \nhis term as a Republican, he resigned his seat and let the people of \nhis district choose whether they wanted to be represented by a \nRepublican. Well, they did, and Phil Gramm became not only the first \nRepublican in history to represent the 6th district of Texas, but the \nonly member of Congress in the 20th century to resign and then win re-\nelection as a member of another party.\n  Phil and I share the same commitment to being a citizen legislator . \n. . to bringing professional expertise to public service. In Phil's \ncase, he's an economist, a college professor, and a public health \nexpert, and his legislative accomplishments reflect that experience. \nHe's been a staunch proponent of tax relief, economic growth, and a \nbalanced budget. And the Gramm-Rudman Act stands as one of the most \ngroundbreaking pieces of budget legislation in the second half of the \n20th century.\n  Fred Thompson has been a dear friend for many years and great partner \nwith whom to work on behalf of the people of Tennessee in the United \nStates Senate. Fred was elected in 1994 to fill 2 years of an unexpired \nterm. He was then reelected in 1996. And just as he did in Hollywood, \nhe rapidly rose to become a star in the Senate.\n  In 1997, Fred was elected chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, making him one of the most junior Senators in history to \nserve as chairman of a major Senate committee. As chairman, he held \nhearings on issues such as improving the federal regulatory process; \nreforming the IRS; exploring ways to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse \nin government; and a number of national security issues, including the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile technologies.\n  Senator Thompson has also been a member of the Finance Committee--one \nof the most influential committees in the Senate. From that position, \nhe has focused on reducing taxes, reforming the tax code to make it \nsimpler and fairer, and restoring the Social Security and Medicare \nprograms to long-term solvency. Though Fred has served eight years in \nthe Senate, the scale and number of his accomplishments would lead one \nthink he has spent an entire career in this chamber.\n  Phil Gramm and Fred Thompson will be missed by each and every one of \ntheir Senate colleagues. For me it has been an honor, a privilege and a \npleasure to work with them both. They have brought to the Senate a rare \ncombination of intellect, charisma, political skill and, above all, a \nsteadfast commitment to principle. And for that they will also be \nmissed by the American people.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the Members of the \nSenate who will be leaving us at the end of this Congress. They will \nnot be here in this Chamber next year, but each will leave an indelible \nimprint on this body, and on the lives of the American people.\n  First, I wish to say a few words about my colleague, my compatriot on \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, and my friend, Fred \nThompson, who has served the people of Tennessee and the people of \nAmerica ably and nobly for the past 8 years.\n  The man the Screen Actors Guild knows as Fred Dalton Thompson acts--\nand acts quite well, I should add--but the man we know as Senator Fred \nThompson has never read off of anyone's script. Again and again, he has \ndone what he in his heart believed was right for the nation. I will \nalways admire his clarity, integrity, and intellectual curiosity.\n  Since his joining the Senate in 1994, I have known Senator Thompson \nas a dogged investigator who is always willing to go wherever the \nevidence may lead, and as an independent-minded legislator who sticks \nto and stands on principle. Senator Thompson was the first Republican \nafter John McCain to support campaign finance reform--an act that \nspeaks volumes about who he is and for what he stands.\n  On the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson and I worked \nclosely together on probing the evidence and then issuing a report on \nthe government's highly suspect investigation into the alleged \nwrongdoing of Wen Ho Lee. Senator Thompson brought a singular focus to \ndissecting and fixing the government's computer security problems. And \nhe has and spared no energy working to ferret out waste, mismanagement, \ncorruption, and abuse in the federal government. Senator Thompson \nunderstands that the people's Government must do justice to the \npeople's values--not just in the pronouncements it makes, but in the \nway it does business every day.\n  Every Member of this body respects the quality of Senator Thompson's \nreasoning and the strength of his voice. Whether it's on defense, \nintelligence,\n\n[[Page S11709]]\n\nfree trade, or a wide range of other issues, Senator Thompson's words \nare cogent and clear, and his deeds are consistent with those words.\n  In addition to his career as a Senator, he has practiced law, written \na book, acted in 18 motion pictures and a television show, posted his \nmother's recipe for fresh coconut cake on his website, and--in the \nmidst of it all--managed to find a lovely women to marry. I am in awe \nof his energy and vitality.\n  We know each other as colleagues, as partners, and often as \nintellectual opponents. But we also know each other as human beings. \nAnd at every point and in every context, Senator Thompson has brought \nwisdom, decency, and a great sense of humor to this Congress. When he \nserved as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, he treated me \nwith great consideration and respect, and I hope in my time as Chairman \nI have afforded him the same courtesies.\n  I am disappointed to see him go, but look forward to watching him on \ntelevision on Wednesday nights.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to honor Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  We all know that the 20th century was the American Century. It was \nalso the century in which, primarily in his service in the U.S. Senate, \nStrom Thurmond left his indelible mark on the history of this nation.\n  There are not many Members of this body today who bring the breadth \nof his experience to the floor. Senator Thurmond began his career as a \nfarmer, teacher, and athletic coach. He was Superintendent of Education \nin his home county. He was town and county attorney. He was state \nsenator in his great state of South Carolina. He was a judge. He served \nin the Second World War, and was part of the Normandy invasion with the \n82nd Airborne. He was governor of South Carolina. Then, in 1954, he was \nelected to the United States Senate.\n  The long list of these accomplishments would take most Americans 300 \nyears to accumulate. Senator Thurmond has gotten them all under his \nbelt in a mere 100. And he has raised a family, to boot.\n\n  Through it all, Senator Thurmond has grown not only as a legislator \nbut as a human being. When we honor him, we pay tribute to human \nbeings' capacity for growth. After running for President, as I \nmentioned, as a state's rights candidate, he later supported the \nrenewal of the Voting Rights Act and observance of the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Holiday on behalf of his state. That transformation sent a \npowerful message that all of us could become better Americans and \nbetter individuals--and that the United States of America, for all its \nblessings, can always become a better nation.\n  I also wish to honor another Member the Senate will miss, my good \nfriend from Texas, Senator Phil Gramm. Senator Gramm has only served \nsince 1984, not since 1954 like Senator Thurmond, but his achievements \nhave been remarkable indeed.\n  Senator Gramm, who came to the Senate with a Ph.D. in economics and a \ndistinguished career in teaching, has become one of this Chamber's \nforemost experts on fiscal policy, one of its clearest voices on \ndefense and foreign policy, and one of the most stalwart defenders of \nindividual liberties.\n  He has a wonderful intuitive understanding of the value of basic \nresearch and other technological innovation, and I have been proud to \nwork with him to increase both the Government's total funding \ncommitment to science and the effectiveness of the money we spend.\n  Senator Gramm is an ideologue--and I mean that in the best sense of \nthe word. He fervently defends his beliefs against all challenges. \nSenator Gramm relishes debate. Here on the floor, you can see it in his \neyes and hear it in his voice. And let me add--and I say this \nreluctantly, having been at the receiving end of more than a few of his \nmissives--that he is quite good at it. In that way, he has continued \nand advanced one of the great traditions of this body. Yes, compromise \nis what makes governments great and marriages happy; we all know that. \nBut without firm principles and intellectual passion to guide us, \nwithout ideals we are not willing to sacrifice, we would never know \nwhat is worth compromising. And Senator Gramm has never forgotten why \nhe is here or what he is fighting for.\n  I wish him luck in the private sector, where he will continue to \nserve the nation and will, much to his liking, make much more money in \nthe process.\n  The Senate is losing many giants at the end of this term. Let me now \nsay a few words about Jesse Helms of North Carolina--a Navy veteran in \nthe Second World War, a respected journalist, a businessman, a city \ncouncilman, and since 1973, a legendary legislator in the Senate.\n  As a Member of this body, Senator Helms has done too much to mention \nhere today. But he is most respected for his leadership of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee.\n  There, he has proven to be a tireless defender of the interests of \nAmerica--and an advocate of the inalienable rights of people all over \nthe world to the basic freedoms and opportunities we enjoy. I have \nalways admired his steadfastness and his strength. And I have always \nknown that the goals we seek--a strong America that advances democracy \nand increases prosperity around the world--are the same.\n  And we have at least one other thing in common. Senator Helms' name \nwas placed in nomination for Vice President of the United States--this \nwas at the GOP convention in Kansas City in 1976. Although he asked the \nconvention to withdraw his name, he nevertheless received 99 delegate \nvotes. A few years later, I could have used those votes.\n  Another Senator retiring after a distinguished career--in his case \nbecause he is trading the U.S. Capitol for the Governor's mansion in \nhis great home state of Alaska--is Senator Frank Murkowski. Hopefully \nhis new challenge will afford him more opportunities to enjoy life with \nhis lovely wife Nancy, his six children and his 11 grandchildren.\n  For four terms of office, Senator Murkowski has served the people of \nhis state with vigorous energy and rigorous attention to detail since \nbeing elected to the Senate in 1980. He delivers for the people of \nAlaska--and they appreciate it. I am confident he will continue to lead \nwith distinction as governor.\n  My friend and colleague Senator Max Cleland gave elegant departing \nremarks yesterday on this floor. Those remarks reminded me how much the \nSenate will miss his buoyant personality, his eloquent words, his \nprincipled service to the people of Georgia, and his transcendent \nfaith.\n  I was privileged to serve alongside Senator Cleland on the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, where he was always courageous, \nindependent, and tenacious. I also had the good fortune of working with \nhim on the Armed Services Committee and the Small Business Committee. I \ncould not have wished for a kinder or more decent man to call my \ncolleague.\n  Senator Cleland also was an early supporter of and essential \ncontributor to the bill establishing a Department of Homeland Security \nthat we reported out of committee in May. Therefore, the historic bill \nwe passed yesterday, and the Department it will create to protect the \nAmerican people from terrorism here at home, is due in no small measure \nto his efforts.\n  But Senator Cleland will be remembered for the spirit he brought to \nthis Senate as much as for the many things he accomplished here. His \ngrit, His wit. His honesty. His willingness to take risks. His never-\nfailing sense of humor. I wish Max the best of luck.\n  Mr. President, let me also take a moment to honor my friend and \ncolleague Senator Jean Carnahan who has added to a long and storied \ncareer by serving the people of Missouri with care, skill, and devotion \nover the last 2 years.\n  Senator Carnahan was not only the proud occupant of Harry Truman's \nseat, but was an able custodian of Harry Truman's legacy. She \nlegislated with an independent mind and a pragmatic personal \nphilosophy, always putting the well-being of Missouri's working \nfamilies first.\n  I have been fortunate enough to serve alongside Senator Carnahan not \nonly on the Governmental Affairs Committee, where she quickly proved to \nbe an invaluable asset, but on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nSenator Carnahan doesn't only talk about bipartisanship. She practices \nit. I'm proud to call her a fellow New Democrat, and even more proud to \ncall her a friend.\n\n[[Page S11710]]\n\n  We are losing many women and men of principle from this body; I hope \nan equal number replace them. I will fondly remember Senator Bob Smith \nfor his unwavering adherence to the values of his faith and his family. \nAnd I admired Senator Smith's hard work on the Environmental and Public \nWorks Committee in defense of New Hampshire's environment and this \nnation's. Bob is a man of honor and I was proud to serve with him.\n  Many of us strive for eloquence here on the floor. But few of us are \nas consistently passionate and persuasive as another departing \ncolleagues, Robert Torricelli, who served seven terms in the House of \nRepresentatives and then here in the Senate since 1996. As a fellow \nnortheastern and fellow member of the Senate Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I will miss his wisdom and great sense of purpose. He is \nextremely gifted and gave great service for New Jersey and America.\n  Finally, Mr. President, a special word for our dear departed \ncolleague Senator Paul Wellstone--who I want to describe in the best \nway I know how, as a mensch--a man, a very good man. He radiated \ndecency and kindness and commitment to make the world a better place. \nThat was so not just in what he said and did on camera, but in what he \nsaid and did in quiet moments, small moments, private moments.\n  Much has been made of the fact that Paul was a teacher. And it is \nfitting. I think about all the lessons that Paul Wellstone the \npolitical scientist taught to his students, and how every one must have \ncome alive when he ran for office--and won--in 1990. That inspiration \nwill last for generations.\n  Paul Wellstone taught his students, by example, that Americans who \nwant change can do much more than carp or complain. They can and should \nenter and shape the system. They can and should be a part of the \ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people.\n  Senator Wellstone uplifted the Senate and uplifted our democracy, and \nhe did it with the clarity of his conscience and the power of his \nprinciples and passions.\n  It's no wonder Paul titled his book The Conscience of a Liberal, \nafter Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. Paul had \nread Senator Goldwater's book as a boy, and though he found himself at \nthe opposite end of the political spectrum, Paul admired Goldwater's \ndecency, his honesty, and his conviction.\n  The name ``Paul'' comes from the Roman family name ``Paulus,'' which \nmeant ``small'' or ``humble'' in Latin. And Paul was physically small. \nHe was spiritually humble. But the scope of his ideals and of his \nservice was monumental.\n  In The Ethics of the Fathers, a tome of Jewish law, it is written: \n``It is not your obligation to complete the task [of perfecting the \nworld], but neither are you free to desist [from doing all you can].''\n  Paula Wellstone, as a Senator, a father, a husband, and a man, lived \nthese words and lived them well. May he rest alongside his wife and \ndaughter in peace.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11710-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LONG-TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education in a brief colloquy on an \nissue that is very important to frail older persons and individuals \nwith disabilities who reside in nursing homes and other long-term care \nfacilities.\n  My colleague should be congratulated for the additional funds that \nhis subcommittee has provided in recent years for the Long-Term Care \nOmbudsman Program, under the Older Americans Act. Our colleagues, \nSenator Kohl, and Senator Specter, should also be recognized for their \nsupport of the ombudsman program. The Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education Appropriations bill that you introduced for Fiscal Year \n2003 proposes a much needed $3 million increase to provide more \nombusdmen to help address the growing quality problems in nursing homes \nand assisted living facilities.\n  I would like to discuss with the chairman and my distinguished \ncolleague and ranking minority member of the Finance Committee our \nstrong support for this program and the National Long-Term Care \nOmbudsman Resource Center that so effectively serves State and local \nombudsmen across the Nation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the Special \nCommittee on Aging is correct in describing our efforts to steadily \nincrease the capacity of State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Programs. This \nvery effective program is available to the 2.8 million residents of \nover 60,000 facilities including licensed assisted living. It makes a \nbig difference in the quality of life for residents by resolving their \ncomplaints 231,889 about resident care and residents' rights, visiting \nfacilities on a regular basis, and by advising residents, their \nfamilies, and facility staff. We have also supported funding for the \nvery effective Ombudsman Resource Center, which has been housed at the \nNational Citizens' Coalition for Nursing Home Reform since 1993. I \nwould like to see an increase for this important Center.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise in support of my two colleagues' \nviewpoints on the value of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program and its \nnational resource center. The hearings that my colleague from Louisiana \nand I have conducted over the years have provided significant evidence \nthat the ombudsman program is critical in protecting the rights of \nolder and disabled individuals living in long-term care facilities.\n  Training and technical assistance are among the critical variables in \ndetermining the quality of services that ombudsmen are able to provide. \nAdditional funds appropriated for the National Long-Term Care Ombudsman \nResource Center would be used to increase the capacity of the Center to \ndevelop and coordinate training systems and other skills-building \nopportunities for State, local and volunteer ombudsmen. The Center has \nan exemplary track record and this will improve program consistency \namong states and enhance program effectiveness.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague. The Center's \nwork is critical to millions of residents of long-term care facilities \nand their families. I am hopeful that when we finally pass a fiscal \nyear 2003 Labor, HHS, Education appropriations bill that we will \nprovide appropriate support for the Center and report language that \nensures the continued quality training and assistance for omsbudmen \nthat has been so ably provided through the Center.\n  It is my view that the Center must continue to be housed in an \nindependent nonprofit citizens-based organization that has the \nimprovement of care in long-term care facilities as its primary \npurpose. Such an organization should include long-term care ombudsmen \nand consumers in its governance and have a minimum of 5 years of \nexperience on a national basis of providing long-term care ombudsmen \nwith technical assistance, training, and information.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I concur with that assessment. We know \nthat there is a growing demand for ombudsman services and too few \nombudsmen and volunteers to regularly visit all of the nursing homes \nand assisted living facilities. And we know that training and resources \ncare essential. The Center provides individualized support to State and \nlocal ombudsmen on specific, complicated long-term care questions and \nprovides training at state and regional conferences. The need to expand \nthese supportive services is growing rapidly.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I believe that we must put our energies \ntoward ensuring that we protect the rights of nursing home residents \nand help them to resolve problems with the quality of the care that \nthey receive. I am committed to working with my colleagues on this goal \nfor fiscal year 2003 and beyond. I am also supportive of the notion \nthat we need to ensure that the resource center continues to be housed \nin an organization as described by my colleague.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support of the work of our \nsubcommittee. I look forward to working with my distinguished \ncolleagues to ensure that these programs continue to serve older adults \nand disabled individuals.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11711-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11711-S11712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11711]]\n                      CONFIRMATION OF JOHN ROGERS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Senate last week confirmed \nProfessor John Rogers to one of the seven vacant seats on the Sixth \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Professor Rogers' career has been marked by \nexcellence and achievement, and he will be a fine addition to the Sixth \nCircuit.\n  He was elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford. At the University of \nMichigan law school, he was a member of the prestigious Order of the \nCoif. He has twice served in the Appellate Section of the Civil \nDivision of the Department of Justice, earning a Special Commendation \nfor Outstanding Service. He has been on the faculty of the University \nof Kentucky College of Law since 1978, where he is the Thomas P. Lewis \nProfessor of Law. Professor Rogers has also twice served as a Fulbright \nProfessor in China. Finally, it is worth noting that Professor Rogers \nhas dedicated a good part of his life to the service of his country as \na member of the field artillery in the United States Army Reserves. He \nis retired with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.\n  Professor Rogers, in addition to having the enthusiastic support of \nboth Senator Bunning and myself, has earned a unanimous rating of \nqualified by the American Bar Association. I am confident that he will \nmake the citizens of the Commonwealth proud, and that he will provide \nbadly-needed relief to the woefully understaffed Sixth Circuit Court of \nAppeals.\n  As I have said repeatedly, I appreciate the fair manner in which \nChairman Leahy treated Kentucky judicial nominees, particularly \nnominees to the district courts in Kentucky. However, some of his \nstatements on the floor Monday evidence a serious misunderstanding of \nthe genesis of the Sixth Circuit vacancy crisis and of Professor \nRogers' judicial record and philosophy.\n  As many people know, the Sixth Circuit has been in dire straits, and \nalthough some of my Democrat colleagues have tried mightily to do so, \nthe blame for this sorry situation cannot be laid at the feet of a \nRepublican-controlled Senate.\n  At the beginning of this year, half of the sixteen seats on the Sixth \nCircuit were vacant. But contrary to the assertions of my friend from \nVermont, half of those vacancies arose in the first year of President \nBush's presidency. Judges Gilbert F. Merritt, Alan E. Norris, Richard \nF. Suhrheinrich, and Eugene F. Siler all took senior status in 2001--\nafter President Bush came into office.\n  With respect to another vacancy on the Sixth Circuit, my friend from \nVermont notes that the Senate did not act on President Clinton's \nnomination of Mr. Kent Markus. Mr. Markus was nominated to fill the \nvacancy that arose from Judge David A. Nelson taking senior status. The \nSenate was unable to act on this vacancy, however, because President \nClinton did not nominate Mr. Markus until his final year in office, \nwhen only nine months remained until the presidential election.\n  As to a sixth vacancy, that created by the retirement of Judge James \nL. Ryan, President Clinton did not even submit a nomination.\n  As to the remaining two vacancies, it is my understanding that the \nRepublican Senate could not confirm the nominees to these seats, Ms. \nHelene White and Ms. Katherine McCree Lewis, because the Clinton \nAdministration did not properly consult on their nominations. As a \nresult, these nominations faced home-state opposition that prevented \nthe Senate from moving them forward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Wall Street Journal \non the subject of these nominations be printed in the Record at the end \nof my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit I)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the situation with Ms. White and Ms. \nLewis is obviously quite different from the situation of Mr. Jeffrey \nSutton and Justice Deborah Cook, whom President Bush has nominated to \nfill two of the six remaining vacancies on the Sixth Circuit. Both Mr. \nSutton and Justice Cook have strong home-state support. Furthermore, \nthey are part of the President's first group of judicial nominees that \nhe submitted to the Senate in May of last year. Nevertheless, neither \nhas been able to obtain a hearing. I am confident that in the next \nCongress the Judiciary Committee will promptly act on their \nnominations.\n  Far from treating President Clinton poorly with respect to his \njudicial nominees, the Republican Senate treated him quite well, \nparticularly on nominations to the Sixth Circuit. President Clinton got \nthree hundred and seventy-seven of his judicial nominees confirmed, \nonly five shy of President Reagan's all-time record. This is quite \nimpressive in and of itself. It is even more impressive when one \nconsiders that President Clinton got these nominees confirmed when \nRepublicans controlled the Senate for seventy-five percent of his term. \nBy contrast, President Reagan got his judicial nominations confirmed \nwhen his own party controlled the Senate for seventy-five percent of \nhis term. Thus, a Republican Senate treated Presidents Reagan and \nClinton equally well.\n  As part of his near-record total, President Clinton got five Sixth \nCircuit nominees confirmed. Judges Martha Craig Daughtery, R. Guy Cole, \nJr., Karen Nelson Moore, Ronald Lee Gilman, and Eric L. Clay were all \nClinton nominees who were confirmed to the Sixth Circuit. This is also \na fairly impressive statistic, particularly when compared to President \nBush, who has only gotten two of his Sixth Circuit nominees confirmed, \nincluding Professor Rogers. But President Clinton's Sixth Circuit \naccomplishment is even more impressive when one considers that a \nRepublican Senate confirmed four out of the five, or eighty percent, of \nthose nominations. Only Judge Daughtery was confirmed by a Democrat \nSenate.\n  Indeed, because the Republican Senate confirmed so many nominees to \nthe Sixth Circuit, Democrat appointees outnumbered Republican \nappointees by a ratio of three to one at the beginning of this year: \nthere were six Democrat-appointed judges on the Sixth Circuit and only \ntwo Republican-appointed judges. President Clinton might have had even \nmore judicial nominees confirmed to the Sixth Circuit if his \nadministration had consulted properly on the White and Lewis \nnominations.\n  With respect to the Rogers' nomination, Professor Rogers has not been \na judicial activist, as the Chairman claims. The law review article on \nwhich my friend from Vermont relies for this sweeping assertion was a \ntheoretical piece discussing an esoteric subject that scholars have \ndebated since the great Learned Hand. It was Professor Rogers' lone \nforay into the topic.\n  Far from arguing that inferior courts should somehow try to overrule \nhigher court precedent--if that were even possible--Professor Rogers \nargues just the opposite: that lower courts have a duty to follow all \nprecedent, including precedents with which they disagree. My friend \nfrom Vermont may want to read page 185 of the article where Professor \nRogers writes that our legal system ``would not work well if lower \ncourts persisted in their own sincere legal analyses regardless of the \ndecisions of higher courts.'' Professor Rogers goes on to write that it \n``follows that judges may, indeed should, follow the law as appellate \ncourts determine it, in order to apply--per their oaths--the law of the \nsystem that set up their courts.''\n  Over the course of his long and distinguished career, Professor \nRogers has consistently demonstrated a strong and abiding fidelity to \nprecedent. A judicial activist, by contrast, would be a label more \nappropriately applied to someone like Clinton appointee William \nSessions, a district court judge from Vermont, who recently declared \nthat the federal death penalty statute is unconstitutional in all its \napplications, which would preclude using it against mass murderers and \nserial killers. Or it could apply to Clinton appointee Jed Rakoff, a \ndistrict court judge who also ruled the federal death penalty \nunconstitutional, which prompted even the Washington Post to complain \nabout such judicial activism in a piece entitled ``Right Answer, Wrong \nBranch.''\n  Or that label might apply to Clinton appointee Shira Scheindlin. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, in an article entitled ``Osama's \nFavorite Judge,'' a Jordanian named Osama Awadallah knew two of the 9/\n11 hijackers and met with one at least forty times. His name\n\n[[Page S11712]]\n\nwas found in the car parked at Dulles Airport by one of the hijackers \nof American Airlines Flight 77. Photos of his better-known namesake--\nOsama bin Laden--were found in Mr. Awadallah's apartment. Under the \nlaw, a material witness may be detained if he has relevant information \nand is a flight risk.\n  Federal prosecutors thought that Osama Awadallah easily met both \nparts of that test and therefore detained him. While detained Mr. \nAwadallah was indicted for perjury. But Judge Scheindlin dismissed the \nperjury charges and released Mr. Awadallah. She reasoned that the \nconvening of a federal grand jury investigating a crime was not a \n``criminal proceeding'' and therefore it was unconstitutional to detain \nMr. Awadallah. This was quite a surprise to federal prosecutors who for \ndecades had used the material witness law in the context of grand jury \nproceedings for everyone from mobsters to mass murderer Timothy \nMcVeigh.\n  Or that label might apply to Clinton appointees Tashima, Hawkins, \nPaez, and Berzon, all of whom discovered in the Constitution the right \nof prisoners serving life sentences to procreate via artificial \ninsemination. Fortunately, there were enough judges on the Ninth \nCircuit to conclude that the Constitution does not include a ``right to \nprocreate from prison via FedEx.''\n  There are other Clinton nominees to whom one could apply the label \n``judicial activist.'' That label cannot, however, fairly be applied to \nProfessor Rogers.\n  The Chairman also implies that Professor Rogers is an activist \nbecause of his views on the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade. But \nProfessor Rogers has never ruled on that subject. In fact, he has never \neven written on it, except for his one assignment as a line attorney in \nthe Justice Department in helping draft an amicus brief. If daring to \nnote some of the flawed analytical underpinnings of Roe makes one a \njudicial activist, then Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg must be one. In a \n1985 article, she noted that ``Roe sparked public opposition and \nacademic criticism, in part, I believe, because the Court ventured too \nfar in the change it ordered and presented an incomplete justification \nfor its action.'' She also recognized that in Roe ``heavy-handed \njudicial intervention was difficult to justify and appears to have \nprovoked, not resolved, conflict.'' Other liberal scholars have also \nrecognized serious flaws in Roe's analysis.\n  In conclusion, Professor Rogers possesses the intellect, integrity, \nand commitment to public service that will make him a fine addition to \nthe Sixth Circuit. His confirmation will provide some badly-needed \nrelief to my constituents and other citizens in the Sixth Circuit, and \nI am confident that he will make Kentucky and his country proud. And \nwhile I believe my friend from Vermont misapprehends the cause of the \nvacancy crisis on the Sixth Circuit and Professor Rogers' judicial \nphilosophy and record, I appreciate him moving the Rogers' nomination \nand other Kentucky nominees through the process. He correctly notes \nthat there are now no judicial vacancies in Kentucky, and I thank him \nagain for helping the Commonwealth in that respect.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 4, 2001]\n\n                           Judges and Grudges\n\n\n              Michigan's Democratic senators seek payback\n\n                          (By Thomas J. Bray)\n\n       On Thursday, the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which \n     handles federal appeals from Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio and \n     Tennessee, will meet en banc to hear oral arguments on \n     whether the University of Michigan's use of racial \n     preferences in administrations is constitutional. Such a \n     hearing, in which all of the court's active judges, rather \n     than the usual three-judge panel, hear the case, is highly \n     unusual.\n       But then the number of judges on the Sixth Circuit is bit \n     unusual, too. Though there are normally 16 active judges \n     assigned to the appeals court, only nine of the seats are \n     currently filled. Moreover, the number will fall to eight at \n     the end of the year when one judge retires.\n       Nominations to fill seats in the Sixth Circuit have are \n     being stymied by bitter partisan wangling in the Senate. And \n     there appears to be little prospect of breaking the deadlock. \n     Michigan's two Democratic senators, Carl Levin and Deborah \n     Stabenow, have put a hold on three of President Bush's \n     nominees from that state. (Mr. Bush hasn't yet named a \n     candidate for a fourth seat traditionally held by a \n     Michiganian.) Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has \n     refused even to hold hearings on the nominations.\n       Echoing their party's rationale for foot-dragging on \n     judicial nominations from all across the country, Sens. Levin \n     and Stabenow complain that when Republicans controlled the \n     Judiciary Committee in the warning days of the Clinton \n     administration, they arbitrarily refused to act on the \n     nominations of state appellate judge Helen White and Detroit \n     lawyer Kathleen McCree Lewis. ``This was despite the fact \n     that no concerns were raised about either woman's \n     qualifications,'' the two senators wrote in a letter last \n     weekend to the Detroit News.\n       That leaves the implication that the White and Lewis \n     nominations were stalled because of sheer partisanship, thus \n     justifying retaliation now that the Senate is in Democratic \n     hands. But the story is a bit more complicated.\n       Helene White happens to be the wife of Carl Legion's cousin \n     Charles Levin, a former member of the Michigan Supreme Court. \n     In 1996, Judge White was threatening to run as an independent \n     for the state Supreme Court. This horrified Michigan \n     Democrats, who feared that she might draw off a big chunk of \n     the liberal vote. The White House, according to state \n     political sources, was persuaded to forestall that \n     possibility by nominating her for a seat on the Sixth \n     Circuit. (The Democratic candidate went on the lose anyway.)\n       But her nomination outraged then-Sen. Spencer Abraham, a \n     Michigan Republican who is now secretary of energy. Mr. \n     Abraham traded his help for getting three Michigan nominees \n     to the federal courts approved by the GOP Senate in exchange \n     for Clinton-judge pickers holding off on further nominations.\n       When the White House was ahead with the White nomination \n     anyway, sen. Abraham made no secret of his feeling that he \n     had been double-crossed. He then placed his hold on the White \n     nomination and later the Lewis nomination.\n       All of this came well into the Clinton tenure. Newly \n     elected presidents, including Mr. Clinton, have generally \n     received speedy accommodation for their initial nominees. \n     Blocking nominees so early makes it appear the Democrats are \n     motivated by little more than partisanship stemming from \n     disappointment at the outcome of the 2000 election and the \n     desire to impose an ideological litmus test on judicial \n     nominees.\n       Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, a member of the Judiciary \n     Committee, let the cat out of the bag shortly after the \n     Democrats took over the Senate. The committee, he announced, \n     would be justified in opposing nominees ``whose views fall \n     outside the mainstream''--in other words, anybody with whom \n     he and his Democratic colleagues disagreed.\n       The three blocked Bush nominees to the Sixth Circuit \n     include a highly qualified federal district judged from \n     western Michigan, a female state trial judge and a state \n     appeals-court judge of Arab descent. At a time when Democrats \n     are loudly complaining about insensitivity toward Arab and \n     Muslim visa-holders, the last nomination might seem \n     particularly timely. A federal district judge in Detroit is \n     now hearing charges against three Arab aliens charged with \n     visa violations who authorities say may have connections to \n     al Qaeda.\n       There currently are 110 vacancies among the nation's 862 \n     district and appeals courts judgeships. The gap has so far \n     been filled by semiretired senior judges, through they aren't \n     allowed to join in en banc court proceedings.\n       An indignant Sen. Leahy is hauling Attorney General John \n     Ashcroft before his committee this week to answer questions \n     about the constitutionality of his investigative techniques \n     as well as the use of military commissions to conduct speedy \n     trials of captured foreign terrorists. If Mr. Leahy and his \n     colleagues are so keen on having the regular courts do this \n     job, maybe they should be asked why they are still sitting on \n     so many of the president's nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11712-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11712-S11714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              OPPOSING THE LONG-TERM CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the continuing \nresolution because I believe it is irresponsible for Congress to \nadjourn without fulfilling our constitutional obligations. I have in \nthe past allowed short-term continuing resolutions to fund our \nGovernment in order to give my colleagues time to complete the \nappropriations process. But I cannot support the long-term continuing \nresolution which will simply allow Congress to go home for the rest of \nthe year before our job is complete.\n  As our Nation stands on the verge of going to war, it is beyond me \nhow we can simply pass a bill to keep government spending at last \nyear's levels. Yesterday's Washington Post reports that fire crews, \npolice officers, emergency workers and others who would be the first on \nthe scene in the event of a new terrorist attack haven't received any \nof the money that the President's budget promised them. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11713]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 19, 2002]\n\n                Spending Bill Delays Crimp War on Terror\n\n\n                Congress's Inaction Slows Domestic Plans\n\n                         (By Jonathan Weisman)\n\n       With their political attention focused on establishing a \n     Department of Homeland Security, Congress and the White House \n     have given up funding many of the department's proposed \n     functions, at least in the short run. As a result, programs \n     such as trucking security, bioterrorism defense and customs \n     operations are strapped for cash, perhaps well into next \n     year.\n       Congress's decision to fund the government at 2002 levels \n     until Jan. 11 could mean federal, state and local agencies \n     expecting large increases for emergency response, new \n     equipment and other needs will not see additional money until \n     spring, halfway through the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. \n     Budget experts say Congress is unlikely to pass any 2003 \n     nondefense spending bills until February at the earliest.\n       ``After the attacks of September 11, many of us anticipated \n     with urgency what should have been recognized by Congress--\n     that all this money would have been passed by October 1,'' \n     said Matthew R. Bettenhausen, director of homeland security \n     for Illinois. ``Now, it's not going to be until calendar year \n     '03 that they even consider the president's proposals.''\n       Spokesmen for various Federal agencies say their \n     departments are functioning fine under the temporary funding \n     measures, known as continuing resolutions. White House budget \n     officials say they can shore up programs as needed by \n     shifting funds from where they are not needed, or tapping \n     unspent money from the last fiscal year.\n       But Federal officials speaking on condition of anonymity \n     say the stalemate will have serious consequences. The \n     director of the National Institutes of Health told Congress \n     in October that if his agency did not receive requested \n     funding increases soon, he would have to scale back \n     bioterrorism research grants scheduled to be awarded in \n     December and January. Biodefense ``is one program that was \n     slated to markedly increase in 2003, so a continuing \n     resolution there for any length of time will greatly impair \n     that program,'' Director Elias A. Zerhouni warned.\n       Congress has provided the entire Federal Government's \n     bioterrorism program with $1.5 billion, a fraction of the \n     president's $4.3 billion request, said G. William Hoagland, \n     Republican staff director of the Senate Budget Committee.\n       The Customs Service has reached agreements with nine \n     countries to inspect massive shipping containers heading to \n     the United States from 15 of the world's 20 largest ports, \n     but it will likely have to postpone the deployment of agents \n     that had been scheduled for January.\n       The Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security \n     Administration has frozen hiring, even as it tries to ramp up \n     security at the nation's nuclear weapons plants and \n     laboratories. In a Nov. 15 memo, the agency's acting \n     administrator, Linton F. Brooks, told agency chiefs that \n     Congress's actions had presented ``a serious management \n     challenge'' that forced him to impose the freeze to avoid \n     large reductions in force later in the fiscal year.\n       Major computer purchases to bolster the president's border \n     security initiative are on hold. And the newly established \n     Transportation Security Administration, operating on $466 \n     million less than it expected for the next two months, has \n     had to withhold $20 million in truck security grants, a \n     senior Transportation Department official said.\n       The agency also has deferred reimbursements to the airlines \n     for cockpit door retrofits. TSA employees scattered around \n     429 airports are without computers or administrative support. \n     And if Congress does not act quickly in January, when TSA \n     employees must receive a mandatory 3.1 percent pay raise, the \n     agency will have to furlough hundreds of its workers.\n       ``There are a lot of agencies that are going to be in the \n     soup on this thing,'' said one administration official, who \n     refused to be identified. ``But the biggest problems are at \n     TSA. They're going to be clobbered.''\n       Rep. David R. Obey (Wis.), the ranking Democrat on the \n     House Appropriations Committee, called the performance ``a \n     disgrace'' and ``a spectacular abdication of \n     responsibility.'' House Appropriations Committee Chairman \n     C.W. Bill Young (R-Fla.) was less forceful but conceded that \n     Congress's action was ``not the best way to fund the \n     government.''\n       Homeland security is just one area that fell victim to \n     Congress's failure to pass new appropriations bills. House \n     Republicans were bitterly divided all year between moderates, \n     who wanted to spend more on nondefense domestic programs, and \n     conservatives, who wanted to stick to the president's austere \n     spending limits. In the end, the House passed only two of the \n     11 annual nondefense appropriations bills.\n       Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee pushed \n     through all 13 of their spending bills at levels well above \n     House levels, but they managed to get only one nondefense \n     spending bill through the full Senate.\n       To be sure, some homeland defense functions are moving \n     forward. The temporary spending resolution funds the \n     government at 2002 levels, but it also carries forward \n     emergency spending approved shortly after Sept. 11, 2001. For \n     example, the $151 million fund that Congress provided the \n     Food and Drug Administration for an emergency food safety \n     program will remain flush. The stopgap spending resolution, \n     expected to pass the Senate this week, also allows the \n     president to redirect $640 million from other programs to the \n     newly created Homeland Security Department.\n       And in some cases, more money would do little good for \n     agencies still struggling to come to grips with their new \n     security responsibilities. Congress has failed to provide the \n     U.S. Border Patrol with funds it would need to hire 570 \n     agents that lawmakers have requested. But, said patrol \n     spokesman Mario Villarreal, the agency's recruiting efforts \n     could not reach last year's goal of 10,551 Border Patrol \n     agents, in part because about 750 agents quit to become air \n     marshals for the TSA.\n       Still, Congress's failures have left bitter feelings, \n     especially with organizations that backed politicians in \n     exchange for promises they fear will be broken.\n       ``It's going to be my members, wherever the next \n     [terrorist] event is, God forbid, that are the first on the \n     scene, and we have a federal government that has been unable \n     to put any money on the ground to help them,'' said Harold A. \n     Schaitberger, president of the International Association of \n     Fire Fighters.\n       And for state governments facing severe fiscal crises, the \n     failure of Congress to provide federal help has been \n     particularly ill-timed, said Philip G. Cabaud Jr., Delaware's \n     homeland security adviser.\n       President Bush and Congress can claim great success in \n     establishing the framework for the nation's eventual response \n     to terrorist threats. Before lawmakers officially close the \n     107th Congress, they will likely have established a \n     Department of Homeland Security and approved port security, \n     border security and bioterrorism measures. But none has been \n     fully funded.\n       The president's budget promised that $3.5 billion would \n     begin flowing in October to ``first responders,'' but fire \n     crews, police officers and emergency workers are still \n     waiting for even a penny.\n       One executive of the American College of Emergency \n     Physicians recalled an invitation to the White House in June \n     to watch Bush sign the Bioterrorism Preparedness Act, which \n     authorized Congress to send $520 million to hospital \n     emergency rooms. So far, though, only about $135 million has \n     been made available, and the official said her organization \n     has seen none of it.\n       Two years ago, Congress began providing $360 million for \n     federal grants to local firehouses. The House promised to \n     increase that number to $400 million this year. The Senate \n     promised $900 million. So far, firefighters have gotten \n     nothing.\n       ``There has been a tremendous amount of rhetoric and a \n     tremendous amount of utilization [by politicians] of fire \n     services whose new status was purchased at such a high \n     cost,'' said Garry L. Briese, executive director of the \n     International Association of Fire Chiefs. ``But their actions \n     do not reflect the words.'' End of story\n       Mr. President, it's not just our counter terrorism \n     operations that need to be funded. Our domestic priorities \n     are also hurting. For example, the Administration has boasted \n     about the education bill, the No Child Left Behind Act, which \n     the president signed in 2002. Yet we haven't come close to \n     funding the programs authorized in the bill. Leaving town \n     without funding these and other priorities is irresponsible.\n       We have also failed to act on the Medicare give-back bill \n     (S. 3018), leaving physicians, rural hospitals, nursing \n     homes, ambulance providers and pathologists without adequate \n     reimbursements from the federal government. Adjourning \n     without ensuring proper Medicare reimbursements to these \n     providers means they will have to choose between helping \n     patients while operating at a financial loss or discontinuing \n     services. What an unfair choice to leave those who help our \n     senior citizens!\n       Adjourning now will also leave states like Arkansas in the \n     lurch. The Senate Finance Committee passed a three-year \n     reauthorization of welfare, but we didn't complete this bill \n     on the Senate floor. Arkansas has one of the six state \n     legislatures that meet biennially and is one of the 19 states \n     that must pass two-year budgets. Our legislature meets early \n     next year. How will they be able to plan their budget if they \n     don't know what federal money they will be getting for their \n     TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) program? TANF \n     is one of the major federal programs designed to help needy \n     families with children. An estimated 5.5 million parents and \n     children depend on welfare benefits for a monthly cash check. \n     An additional 1 million families do not receive a cash \n     payment, but depend on TANF for child care and/or \n     transportation subsidies which are essential to enable \n     parents to work and move toward self-sufficiency. How can we \n     leave 6.5 million people in the lurch?\n       Lastly Mr. President, it took headlines and plummeting \n     stock shares to alert the nation to the vast fraud and greed \n     which had inflated the Wall-Street stock bubble. The \n     government and the Congress had no clue what was going on and \n     the public suffered. In order to remedy this problem the \n     Congress overwhelmingly approved the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This \n     new law authorized a 77 percent increase in SEC funding to \n     $776 million.\n\n[[Page S11714]]\n\n     The increase was included in both the Sarbanes bill here in \n     the Senate and in the House-passed H.R. 3764. But now we are \n     learning that the White House doesn't want to fund the full \n     authorization and is ready to propose nearly a third less \n     than that. That is outrageous and I think the public should \n     pay attention to this issue. Unless the authorization is \n     funded it is meaningless. Meaningless, Mr. President, a \n     hollow position crafted for an age of thirty second sound \n     bites. The public should not allow this to go on.\n       Congress should fund the priorities we have authorized. \n     That is why I oppose the long-term continuing resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11714-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CYPRUS' MEMBERSHIP TO THE EUROPEAN UNION\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the Senate has recently passed by unanimous \nconsent a resolution, S. Con. Res. 122, that I, along with Senators \nBiden and Sarbanes introduced expressing support for Cyprus' membership \nin the European Union, EU. This is a timely and significant statement \nof support for the Senate to make on the cusp of Cyprus' membership and \nI would like to thank Senators Biden and Sarbanes for their efforts \ntoward achieving the passage of S. Con. Res. 122.\n  Just this past month, Cyprus moved yet another step closer to its \ngoal of EU membership. At the end of October, the 15 European nations \nmet in Brussels and endorsed the recommendations of the European \nCommission that Cyprus and nine other countries become EU members in \n2004. It was agreed that Cyprus had fulfilled the political criteria \nfor accession and will be able to meet the economic criteria and assume \nthe obligations of membership. It is expected that an official \ninvitation for membership will be expanded this December, with \naccession in 2004.\n  The EU countries did reaffirm the call for continuing efforts by \nPresident Clerides and Turkish-Cypriots to work toward a solution to \nthe Cyprus problem by the end of the year. However, as was stated at \nthe Helsinki Summit in 1999, such a solution is not a precondition for \nCyprus' membership.\n  After 27 years Cyprus remains a divided nation. However, as an EU \nmember, the entire island of Cyprus will see economic benefits. All \nCypriots will have access to new markets, a freer exchange of goods and \nservices, balanced and sustainable development as well as the free \nmovement of persons, goods and services, and capital.\n  But EU membership is not only about economic prosperity it is also \nabout human rights. The EU guarantees citizens of its members human, \nlegal and civil rights as well as the means and legal recourse \nnecessary to secure the full application of these fundamental \nindividual rights.\n  Moreover, Cyprus' EU membership will be, and has been, a catalyst for \nthe solution to the Cyprus problem as the mere prospect of membership \nhas already yielded progress. That Cypriot President Clerides and \nTurkish-Cypriot leader Denktash have been meeting since January in \ndirect talks to seek a resolution of the division of Cyprus is seen as \nevidence of the positive leverage exacted by expected EU accession.\n  As a result of these continuous meetings, other international efforts \nhave occurred such as the recent submission by the U.N. Secretary \nGeneral of a comprehensive proposal for the solution of the Cyprus \nproblem. If it were not for Turkey's desire to also be an EU member \nknowing that other EU members could block this goal it is questionable \nwhether these talks would even be taking place. That, along with \nimproved economic prosperity and guaranteed human rights, is why it was \nvital that the Senate go on record as supporting Cyprus' EU membership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11714-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11714-S11715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     INDIAN TRUST FUNDS MANAGEMENT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief statement for \nthe Record regarding an issue of significant importance to me, and that \nis the fiduciary and trust responsibility of the United States toward \nNative Americans for management of trust assets and trust funds.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 2212, the Indian Trust Asset and \nTrust Fund Management and Reform Act of 2002. This legislation would \nhave amended the 1994 American Indian Trust Fund Management Reform Act \nto initiate further reform of the administration and management of the \nassets and funds held by the United States in trust for federally \nrecognized Indian tribes and individual Indians. I was pleased to be \njoined in this effort by my distinguished colleagues, the two Senators \nfrom South Dakota, Mr. Daschle and Mr. Johnson, and I appreciate the \ntime and effort they have expended as we have tried to move the bill \ntoward enactment.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator \nInouye, for holding a hearing on S. 2212 in July. As a result of the \ntestimony received in the hearing and the comments from many of the \nIndian tribes that would be affected by this legislation, we developed \nan amendment in the nature of a substitute which significantly improved \nthe original bill. Many tribal leaders shared comments and offered \nrecommendations to us in the process and were grateful for their \nefforts.\n  By sponsoring this legislation, Senators Daschle, Johnson, and I \nintended to express congressional support and provide direction for \nreform of the Federal Government's management of Indian trust funds and \nassets, which has for some time been subject to intense criticism and \nscrutiny by the Federal courts. High-level Government officials have \nbeen held in civil contempt twice by the U.S. District Court here in \nWashington, DC, for their abject breach of fiduciary duties as well as \nthe continuing failure to comply with statutory mandates and court \norders.\n  S. 2212 focused on two primary changes to the 1994 American Indian \nTrust Fund Management Reform Act, the underlying law governing Indian \ntrust funds management. First, it would have created a single line of \nauthority in the Interior Department by establishing a Deputy Secretary \nfor Trust Management and Reform; and second, the bill would have \nstrengthened provisions for Indian tribes and beneficiaries to directly \nmanage or comanage with the Interior Secretary trust funds and assets, \nbased on successful self-determination policies.\n  Based on comments received from tribes, we amended S. 2212 to affirm \nthe fiduciary standards to be applied to the management of Indian trust \nfunds and assets, as well as to abolish the Office of Special Trustee \nand establish the Office of Trust Reform under the new Deputy \nSecretary. The Advisory Committee to the Special Trustee would have \nbeen replaced with a task force composed of representatives of the \ntribes and the Department who would work with the new Deputy Secretary \nto develop recommendations for further necessary changes to the laws \ngoverning the management of trust assets and trust funds.\n  The changes represented in S. 2212 were modest, but important. It \ncould have formed the basis for a stronger partnership between the \ntribal beneficiaries and the Interior Department, instituting \ncongressional requirements for development of consensus policies \ngoverning trust standards and additional management reforms. Such a \npartnership would have set the Department and the tribes on a course \ntoward resolution of the problems that have plagued the management of \nthe trust funds and assets for more than a century.\n  Unfortunately, we are at the end of the 107th Congress and no further \naction will be taken on S. 2212. A sufficient consensus could not be \nreached among the tribes as well as between the tribes and the \nDepartment of the Interior to allow us to move forward to enact the \nbill. By failing to enact legislation like S. 2212 this year, the \nCongress is not fulfilling its responsibility to the Indian tribes and \nindividuals who have suffered from decades of Federal mismanagement.\n  For most of this year, tribal representatives have been working on a \nrange of possible reforms through a special task force established by \nSecretary Norton after the tribes resoundingly rejected her \nadministrative reform proposal during 2001. Despite the efforts of the \ntribes, the discussions with the Interior Department culminated in an \nimpasse and an end to the Department's participation in the task force.\n  The Department's latest action is unfortunate, but it is certainly \nnot the first time the tribes and the Department have been unable to \nagree. It should not pose an insurmountable hurdle for the Congress to \nact. In fact,\n\n[[Page S11715]]\n\nit merely adds impetus to the need for amendments to the 1994 act, \nparticularly to ensure through legislative language that the Interior \nDepartment would be required to consult and work with the affected \nbeneficiaries on any reforms or changes to its management. Court \nrequirements may now compel the Interior Department to once again \ndevelop its own management reforms without the consultation or \nagreement of the affected beneficiaries.\n  The sponsors of S. 2212 were told that we shouldn't act on this \nlegislation in this session because of the lack of agreement between \nthe tribes and the Department of the Interior. At the same time, \nseveral efforts ensued by the Department and some tribal \nrepresentatives to add legislative riders to appropriations bills or \nother must-pass legislation. These were efforts I could not support as \nI continue to abide by the principle of legislating through the open \nprocesses of the Congress.\n  It is certainly true that no one fully agreed with everything in S. \n2212. That fact suggests to me that the bill deserved our full and fair \nconsideration because it represented a balanced approach. S. 2212 was \nintended to foster a process of further reform in the years ahead and \nnot to impose some sort of ``quick fix'' or ``final remedy'' that is \nnot fully embraced by all interested and affected parties.\n  Senators Daschle, Johnson, and I worked very hard to achieve \nconsensus on S. 2212 and while we garnered significant tribal support \nfor this legislative remedy, we abided by the wishes of the tribal task \nforce leadership to withhold from further action on the bill. Without \nlegislative reform this year, I am very much concerned that trust \nduties will effectively be redefined and reassigned by the courts and \nthe Department without the input or approval of the Congress and the \naffected beneficiaries.\n  I have no doubt that the Congress will be urged to act again in the \n108th Congress as the matter of trust fund management will continue to \nrequire legislative review and reform. I believe a significant \nopportunity may have been lost by not enacting S. 2212, but I remain \ncommitted to ensure that the Federal Government's responsibility to the \nindividual and tribal beneficiaries will be fulfilled.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11715-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, as the 107th Congress nears its conclusion, \nI rise to join my colleagues in remembering our beloved colleague, \nSenator Paul Wellstone. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Wellstone \nfamily, Paul's staff, and the people of Minnesota. We are all saddened \nby the tragic deaths of Paul and Sheila Wellstone, their daughter, \nMarcia Wellstone Markuson, and the Wellstone staffers and pilots.\n  America will sorely miss Paul Wellstone and his passionate advocacy \non behalf of those in our communities and our country who too often \nfeel that no one in Washington hears their voice. Paul Wellstone was \ntheir voice, he was their champion, driven by his unwavering conviction \nthat government can and should be a force for good in people's lives. \nPaul was a caring, persistent, and passionate advocate for veterans, \nchildren, the mentally ill, and working families. He was committed to \nensuring that all Americans had the opportunity to make a better life \nfor themselves and their families, and that wherever possible, \ngovernment act as a positive instrument to advance opportunity and \nequality for all Americans in education, job training, access to health \ncare, and the availability of quality health care. He was driven by his \ncommitment to civil rights and equal justice. Whether speaking on the \nSenate floor or to a workers' rally, retracing Robert F. Kennedy's tour \nof America's poorest communities, or visiting veterans hospitalized in \nMinnesota, Paul lived his convictions and values. Whether you agreed or \ndisagreed with Paul Wellstone on an issue, there was never any doubt \nabout his integrity, the passion and commitment he brought to his work, \nand the deep pride he felt in serving the people of Minnesota in the \nSenate.\n  Paul and I were both first elected to the Senate in November 1990. I \nhad been appointed to the Senate a few months earlier, but we were both \nthe new kids on the block. From the outset, with his incandescent \npersonality, exacting integrity, commitment to the values he espoused \nand the ability to speak passionately and eloquently about the issues \nhe cared so deeply about Paul distinguished himself as an exceptional \nSenator and an extraordinary human being.\n  Over the course of his tenure in the Senate, Paul became a dear \nfriend. Because of the chronic discomfort he experienced as a \nconsequence of his lifetime love of the sport of wrestling, he was \ninterested in my experiences with hip replacement surgery. At the start \nof the 107th Congress, our offices were next to one another. His \nboundless energy, enthusiasm, and good spirits were always welcome and \nbrightened the day for everyone he greeted on his way to and from his \noffice. I remember one conversation on a long bus ride back from a \nDemocratic retreat in Pennsylvania. My eldest son, Danny, had joined \nMillie and me for the weekend, and he struck up a quick friendship with \nPaul and Sheila. Over the course of ride back to Washington, we \ndiscussed philosophy and politics, the upcoming midterm elections, \ndestiny, and the power of living in consonance with your values and \nbeliefs. I listened as Paul and my son agreed on the importance of \nliving life to the fullest and living every day as if it is your last. \nThat day stays with me because that is precisely the way Paul Wellstone \nlived his life. He celebrated life. He loved his job and his \nconstituents. He adored Sheila and his children and grandchildren. He \nalways made the time to greet, talk to, or offer words of encouragement \nto everyone he encountered as he went about his day. To me, this is \nPaul's greatest legacy, the lives he touched, the people he inspired, \nthe spirits he lifted with his message of hope and justice.\n  Paul had hoped to visit Hawaii after the November election and had \nspoken to my son Danny about bringing his entire family for some well-\ndeserved rest and relaxation. Paul and Sheila never had the opportunity \nto visit Hawaii with their children and grandchildren as we talked \nabout, but they truly lived aloha. For aloha is love. And love is the \nspirit that brings people together in harmony. In its true sense, aloha \nhas to be transmitted to others, especially to each other, and aloha \nreally is in the giving, not the taking. When you give, you are sharing \naloha. This is how Paul and Sheila Wellstone lived their lives and it \nis why we in the Senate family miss Paul and Sheila terribly. I want to \nbid Paul and Sheila Wellstone a fond aloha. May God bless them and the \nWellstone family. Na Iehowa 'oe e ho'omaika'i mai, a e malama mai--The \nLord bless you and keep you.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to add my \nvoice to those who have spoken in honor of our late colleague Senator \nPaul Wellstone.\n  In the 4 years we served together, Paul and I didn't always vote the \nsame way. But we shared the most important value of all: We wanted to \ndo best for the people who sent us to the Senate to represent them. On \na full range\n\n[[Page S11716]]\n\nof issues, from education to health care to veterans affairs, Paul \nfought tirelessly for what he believed was best for the people of \nMinnesota and the United States.\n  I admired Paul's conviction and passion in presenting his viewpoints \nand arguing his case. I admired his honesty and conscientiousness in \nstanding up for what he believed. Most of all, I admired the goodwill \nand sense of fairness that he brought to this body. I hope that even \nthough we won't always agree in our debates here, we can always keep \nalive that same spirit of goodwill, fairness, and openness.\n  Paul Wellstone wasn't from the South, but he possessed all the \nqualities of a Southern gentleman. He was never rude or mean-spirited \ntoward those who disagreed with him, and he was unfailingly civil to \nboth his allies and his adversaries. I feel fortunate to have had him \nas a colleague and blessed to have had him as a friend. He will be \nsorely missed.\n  I would like to pay tribute also to the two members of Paul's \nfamily--his wife Sheila and his daughter Marcia--who perished with him \non October 25. Furthermore, three members of Paul's campaign staff--\nWill McLaughlin, Tom Lapic, and Mary McEvoy--and two pilots--Richard \nConroy and Michael Guess--lost their lives in that accident. My deepest \nsympathies and my prayers go out to their families and friends in this \ntime of loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11716-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ENHANCED PROTECTION OF OUR CULTURAL HERITAGE ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am pleased that the Senate late last night passed S. \n2598, the Enhanced Protection of Our Cultural Heritage, EPOCH, Act of \n2002, which I introduced earlier this year with Senators Inouye, \nClinton, Bingaman, and Boxer. This legislation increases the maximum \npenalties for violations of three existing statutes that protect the \ncultural and archaeological history of the American people, \nparticularly Native Americans. The U.S. Sentencing Commission \nrecommended the statutory changes contained in this bill, which would \ncomplement the Commission's strengthening of Federal sentencing \nguidelines to ensure more stringent penalties for criminals who steal \nfrom our public lands.\n  This bill increases the maximum penalities for the Archaeological \nResources Protection Act, ARPA, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 470ee, the Native \nAmerican Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA, 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 1170, and for 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1163, which prohibits theft from \nIndian tribal organizations. All three statutes currently impose a 5-\nyear maximum sentence, and each includes a lower maximum for a first \noffense of the statute and/or a violation of the statute involving \nproperty of less than a specified value. The bill would create a 10-\nyear maximum sentence for each statute, while eliminating the lower \nmaximums under ARPA and NAGPRA for first offenses.\n  Such maximum sentences would be consistent with similar Federal \nstatutes. For example, the 1994 law proscribing museum theft carriers a \n10-year maximum sentence, as do the general statutes punishing theft \nand the destruction of Government property. Moreover, increasing the \nmaximum sentences will give judges and the Sentencing Commission \ngreater discretion to impose punishments appropriate to the amount of \ndestruction a defendant has done.\n  Making these changes will also enable the Sentencing Commission's \nrecent sentencing guidelines to be fully implemented. The Commission \nhas increased sentencing guidelines for cultural heritage crimes, but \nthe statutory maximum penalties contained in current law will prevent \njudges from issuing sentences in the upper range of the new guidelines. \nThose new guidelines have the enthusiastic support of the Justice and \nInterior Departments, the Society for American Archaeology, the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation, numerous Native American \nnations, and many others.\n  Two of the three laws this legislation amends protect Native American \nlands and property. The third, ARPA, protects both public and Indian \nlands, and provides significant protection to my State of Vermont. For \nexample, ARPA can be used to prosecute those who would steal artifacts \nfrom the wrecked military vessels at the bottom of Lake Champlain that \ndate to the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. U.S. attorneys can \nalso use ARPA to prosecute criminals who take items that are at least \n100 years old from a protected site on Vermont State property without a \npermit, and then transport those goods into another State. In addition, \nARPA protects artifacts found on the approximately 5 percent of Vermont \nland that is Federal property, land that includes many ``ghost towns'' \nthat have long been abandoned but are an important part of our history.\n  Those who would pillage the rich cultural heritage of this Nation and \nits people are committing serious crimes. These artifacts are the \nlegacy of all Americans and should not be degraded as garage sale \ncommodities or as fodder for private enrichment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11716-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11716-S11718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ACCURACY IN STATISTICS AND THE DEBATE OVER BIPARTISAN TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance \nof accuracy in the debate over bipartisan tax relief.\n  I was very pleased to work with over one-fourth of the Senate \nDemocratic Caucus in passing the largest tax cut in a generation. That \nlegislation has been the subject of a coordinated attack by the \nDemocratic leadership and some of its allies in the media. For almost a \nyear and a half, I have responded to these attacks in committee, on the \nSenate floor, and in the media.\n  The basic premise of my responses has been that participants ought to \nbe intellectually honest in the data used in the debate. Reasonable \nfolks can differ on whether bipartisan tax relief is a good idea or \nnot. We ought to conduct that debate in a fair and open manner.\n  Apparently, my responses caught the eye of a key opinion maker, Mr. \nPaul Krugman of the New York Times. Mr. Krugman is a regular columnist \nand focuses mainly on economic policy. Mr. Krugman took aim at me and \nmy statements in a column, dated October 18, 2002. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of that op-ed be included in the Record.\n  Mr. Krugman defended the often-mentioned but seldom-sourced statistic \non distribution of the benefits of the tax relief package. It's the \nstatistic we hear over and over again. The statistic claims that 40 \npercent of the benefits of the tax relief package go to the top 1 \npercent of taxpayers.\n  Mr. Krugman claims that I did not have an alternative answer to the \n40 percent statistics.\n  I responded in a letter to the editor, dated October 24, 2002.\n  My letter sources data from the unbiased, official scorekeeper of tax \npolicy for Congress, the Joint Committee on Taxation. This data had \nbeen placed in the record in the statements Mr. Krugman criticized. \nThat data, updated for the last year the tax cut is distributed, 2006, \nshows that the top 1 percent of taxpayers will receive a lower share of \nthe benefits of the tax cut, 27 percent, than their burden, 33 percent. \nThe remaining difference of 6 percent is distributed to taxpayers \nwithin comes below $100,000. That's why Joint Tax concludes that the \nbipartisan tax relief makes the Tax Code more progressive.\n  By the way, this fact is not incidental. It reveals a key ingredient \nto our bipartisan success in 2001.\n  My Democratic partners in the bipartisan bill insisted that we make \nthe Tax Code more progressive as a condition for their support. That \nwas a condition that I shared with them. We would not have produced the \nbill in the Senate without their support.\n  Mr. Krugman struck back at me again in a column dated October 29, \n2002. He claimed my letter was ``misleading'' because I did not include \nthe benefits of death tax relief in the analysis. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a copy of that op-ed be included in the Record.\n  I prepared a response to Mr. Krugman and submitted it to the New York \nTimes editor. Unfortunately, the Times policy only permits two \nresponses per person per year. So, Mr. Krugman can attack me every week \nif he wants to and my responses are limited. So, Mr. Krugman and the \nTimes policy left me with the recourse of responding on the Senate \nfloor. Otherwise, his charge would stand unanswered. That would be \nwrong.\n  Joint Tax does not distribute the death tax benefit because the \nanalysis\n\n[[Page S11717]]\n\nrequires a conceptual leap. Economists have attempted to distribute the \ndeath tax benefit.\n  For instance, the Clinton Treasury performed an analysis at about the \nsame time the former President was readying a veto on a tax bill that \ncontained death tax relief. Joint Tax attempted to distribute the same \nkind of analysis in the early 1990s, but abandoned it after finding \nproblems with it.\n  If you only read Mr. Krugman's columns, you would think that this \nanalysis is straight forward. It is not. Basically, to get to where Mr. \nKrugman and his allies want to go, you have to make a conceptual leap. \nYou have to assume that heirs of an estate have the same income tax \nprofile as the dead person. So, you need to ignore the reality that, \nfor instance, tax-exempt organizations, can be heirs of an estate. You \nneed to ignore the reality that, as a general matter, no two sets of \nheirs look the same for income tax purposes. For these reasons, an \nunbiased official source, like Joint Tax, does not distribute the death \ntax. That was the point I was not permitted to make in a response.\n  For the sake of argument, however, let's give Mr. Krugman the benefit \nof the doubt. Let's stack the deck further in his favor by assuming \nthat all of the death tax relief provided in 2006 inures to the benefit \nof the top 1 percent. Let's perform this calculation even though it is \nanalytically unsound. If you add that revenue loss, about $4.6 billion \nfor 2006, into Joint Tax's distribution table, you will find that the \ntop 1 percent receive 29 percent of the benefits of the tax relief \npackage. This compares with the 27 percent official Joint Tax figure. \nRecall that the top 1 percent bear 33 percent of the income tax burden. \nIn this case, the 4 percent difference, once again, though to a smaller \ndegree, increases the progressivity of the Federal tax system.\n  Mr. Krugman also cites an alternative tax burden, total Federal \ntaxes, as the appropriate measure. Joint Tax's distribution analysis \nincludes the Federal tax burden and as the projection for the last year \nshows the total Federal tax system was made more progressive.\n  Mr. President, I agree with Mr. Krugman on some things. We need to \nchange the tone in Washington. If the tone is to change, all \nparticipants, including public servants, like myself, and opinion \nmakers, like Mr. Krugman, must participate in the change.\n  Several things must happen if the tone in Washington is to change. \nThe first thing that needs to happen is everyone must debate in an \nintellectually honest manner. This means when a statistic is used, the \nsource should be referenced. Mr. Krugman's op-ed is the rare exception \nwhen the source of the 40 percent figure has been revealed. Over the \nlast 18 months, in countless Congressional debates, in press reports, \nand other venues, the 40 percent figure has been used without \nattribution. At every point when I have debated the other side of this \nissue, I have provided the source of my statistics.\n  The source of the data is important because, in an honest debate, any \nbiases should be revealed. The source of Mr. Krugman's statistic is Bob \nMcIntyre of the Citizens for Tax Justice. I respect Mr. McIntyre as a \nspirited liberal advocate of his version of tax reform. Mr. McIntyre's \norganization has an agenda. It is a tax policy agenda that tends to be \non the left side of the political spectrum. There are competing \norganizations on the right side of the political spectrum such as the \nHeritage Foundation. These organizations also produce data on tax \nlegislation. I doubt Mr. Krugman would ever use alternative analyses. \nIf he did use these analyses, I would expect him to cite the source.\n  There are also unbiased sources of data. an honest debate ought to \nbring out that data and distinguish it from data produced from biased \nsources. The Joint Committee on Taxation, established in 1926, is an \nunbiased source of data on tax policy. By definition, Congress' \nofficial tax policy scorekeeper, Joint Tax works for the House and \nSenate. Joint Tax works for both sides of the aisle. Senator Max \nBaucus, a Democrat from Montana, is the current Chairman of Joint Tax. \nLast year, Congressman Bill Thomas, a Republican from California, was \nChairman.\n  Opponents of the bipartisan tax relief package, like Mr. Krugman, do \nnot use this objective source of data.\n  If we are to change the tone in Washington, not only do we need to be \nhonest about statistics, but we should put statistics in the proper \ncontext. Mr. Krugman uses the tax benefit figure in isolation. Mr. \nKrugman ignores the context of tax burden. Joint Tax's distribution \nanalysis for 2006, shows that taxpayers who received the greatest \nreduction in their tax burden were those with incomes between $10,000 \nand $40,000. For instance, taxpayers with incomes between $10,000 and \n$20,000 will enjoy a reduction in their tax burden of 13.6 percent. \nTaxpayers with incomes over $200,000 will see their tax burden reduced \nby 6.1 percent. This example, drawn from Joint Tax, not a conservative \nthink tank, puts the benefits of the tax cut in context.\n  I agree with Mr. Krugman's objective. I also agree with many of his \nsentiments about my late friend, Senator Paul Wellstone. Senator \nWellstone liked a good and vigorous debate. He did so in an \nintellectually honest manner. Let's change the tone in Washington. Mr. \nKrugman has a role as an opinion maker who opposes last year's \nbipartisan tax relief package. I welcome a lively exchange with him and \nothers of his view. All I ask is that we have that exchange in \nintellectually honest terms.\n  So I describe a real difference in the approach of midwestern \ntransparent Iowans and that of an ivory tower easterner.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the aforementioned materials in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC.\n\n                                                 October 30, 2002.\n     Re ``For the People,'' by Paul Krugman (column, Oct. 29): I \n         continue to call for unbiased tax data in policy debates.\n\n     To the Editor,\n     The New York Times.\n     New York, NY.\n\n                     Maybe You Can Take It With You\n\n       I share many of Mr. Krugman's sentiments about my late \n     neighbor and friend, Senator Paul Wellstone. As the Senate's \n     only working farmer, I was a ready partner of Senator \n     Wellstone in efforts to help family farmers.\n       Mr. Krugman described the data in my letter as \n     ``misleading.'' His dispute lies not with me, but with \n     Congress' official, unbiased, tax policy scorekeeper, the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation. Joint Tax says ``estate and gift \n     taxes are not included due to uncertainty concerning the \n     incidence of those taxes.''\n       The uncertainty arises, in part, because estate tax relief \n     goes to the estate's heirs, not the dead person. For income \n     tax purposes, generally the person earning income is alive to \n     enjoy it. Attempts to distribute the estate tax benefit are, \n     at best, a very rough calculation. In effect, those who take \n     Mr. Krugman's view, believe the dead person benefits from \n     estate tax relief. Only those in the ivory towers of academia \n     believe you can take tax relief to the grave.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Senator Chuck Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Finance Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 29, 2002]\n\n                             For the People\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       Ghoulish but true: as Minnesota mourns the death of Senator \n     Paul Wellstone, many of the state's residents have been \n     receiving fliers bearing a picture of a tombstone. The flier, \n     sent out by a conservative business group, denounce the late \n     senator's support for maintaining the estate tax. Under the \n     tombstone, the text reads in part: ``Paul Wellstone not only \n     wants to tax you and your business to death . . . he wants to \n     tax you in the hereafter.''\n       To be fair, the people who mailed out those fliers--which \n     are carefully worded so that the cost of the mailing doesn't \n     officially count as a campaign contribution--didn't know how \n     tasteless they would now appear. Yet in a sense the mass \n     mailing is a fitting epitaph; it reminds us what Paul \n     Wellstone stood for, and how brave he was to take that stand. \n     Sometimes it seems as if Americans have forgotten what \n     courage means. Here's a hint: talking tough doesn't make you \n     a hero; you have to take personal risks. And I'm not just \n     taking about physical risks--though it's striking how few of \n     our biggest flag wavers have ever put themselves in harm's \n     way. What we should demand of our representatives in \n     Washington is the willingness to take political risks--to \n     make a stand on principle, even if it means taking on \n     powerful interest groups.\n       Paul Wellstone took risks. He was, everyone acknowledges, a \n     political who truly voted his convictions, who supported what \n     he thought was right, not what he thought would help him get \n     re-elected. He took risky stands on many issues: agree or \n     disagree, you have to admit that his vote against \n     authorization for an Iraq war was a singularly brave act. Yet \n     the most consistent theme in\n\n[[Page S11718]]\n\n     his record was economic--his courageous support for the \n     interests of ordinary Americans against the growing power of \n     our emerging plutocracy.\n       In our money-dominated politics, that's a dangerous \n     position to take. When Mr. Wellstone first ran for the \n     Senate, his opponent outspent him seven to one. According to \n     one of his advisers, the success of that ramshackle campaign, \n     run from a rickety green school bus, ``made politics safe for \n     populists again.''\n       If only. Almost every politician in modern American \n     pretends to be a populist; indeed, it's a general rule that \n     the more slavishly a politician supports the interests of \n     wealthy individuals and big corporations, the folksier his \n     manner. But being a genuine populist, someone who really \n     tries to stand up against what Mr. Wellstone called ``Robin \n     Hood in reverse'' policies, isn't easy: you must face the \n     power not just of money, but of sustained and shameless \n     hypocrisy.\n       And that's why those fliers are a perfect illustration of \n     what Paul Wellstone was fighting.\n       On one side, the inclusion of estate tax repeal in last \n     year's federal tax cut is the most striking example to date \n     of how our political system serves the interests of the \n     wealthy. After all, the estate tax affects only a small \n     minority of families; the bulk of the tax is paid by a tiny \n     elite. In fact, estate tax repeal favors the wealthy to such \n     an extent that defenders of last year's tax cut--like Senator \n     Charles Grassley, who published a misleading letter in \n     Friday's Times--always carefully omit it from calculations of \n     who benefits. (The letter talked only about the income tax; \n     had he included the effects of estate tax repeal, he would \n     have been forced to admit that more than 40 percent of the \n     benefits of that tax cut go to the wealthiest 1 percent of \n     the population.) To eliminate the estate tax in the face of \n     budget deficits means making the rich richer even as we slash \n     essential services for the middle class and the poor.\n       On the other side, the estate tax debate illustrates the \n     pervasive hypocrisy of our politics. For repeal of the \n     ``death tax'' has been cast, incredibly, as a populist issue. \n     Thanks to sustained, lavishly financed propaganda--of which \n     that anti-Wellstone flier was a classic example--millions of \n     Americans imagine, wrongly, that the estate tax mainly \n     affects small businesses and farms, and that its repeal will \n     help ordinary people. And who pays for the propaganda? Guess. \n     It's amazing what money can buy.\n       In an age of fake populists, Paul Wellstone was the real \n     thing. Now he's gone. Will others have the courage to carry \n     on?\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 25, 2002]\n\n                          A Tax Cut for Whom?\n\n       To the Editor: Re ``Springtime for Hitler,'' by Paul \n     Krugman (column, Oct. 18): I stand by my call for unbiased \n     tax data in policy debates. Some observers claim that 40 \n     percent of last year's tax cuts went to the top 1 percent of \n     taxpayers. The Joint Committee on Taxation, Congress's \n     official, unbiased source, says the top 1 percent will \n     receive 27 percent of the income tax cuts in 2006, the latest \n     projection available. Taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 and \n     less will receive the majority of the tax-cut benefits, with \n     67 percent.\n       The real story is that despite those cuts, the top 1 \n     percent of taxpayers will still pay 33 percent of federal \n     income taxes. They will receive a lower share of the income \n     tax cut, 27 percent, than their burden, 33 percent.\n       The joint committee says the taxpayers who will receive the \n     greatest reduction in their tax burden have incomes between \n     $10,000 and $40,000. Those with incomes between $10,000 and \n     $20,000 will enjoy a reduction of 13.6 percent. Those with \n     incomes of more than $200,000 will see their burden reduced \n     by 6.1 percent. Intellectual honesty demands putting tax data \n     in context.\n     Chuck Grassley.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 18, 2002]\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n                         Springtime for Hitler\n\n       You may recall that George W. Bush promised, among other \n     things, to change the tone in Washington. He made good on \n     that promise: the tone has certainly changed.\n       As far as I know, in the past it wasn't considered \n     appropriate for the occupant of the White House to declare \n     that members of the opposition party weren't interested in \n     the nation's security. And it certainly wasn't usual to \n     compare anyone who wants to tax the rich--or even anyone who \n     estimates the share of last year's tax cut that went to the \n     wealthy--to Adolf Hitler.\n       O.K., maybe we should discount remarks by Senator Phil \n     Gramm. When Mr. Gramm declared that a proposal to impose a \n     one-time capital gains levy on people who renounce U.S. \n     citizenship in order to avoid paying taxes was ``right out of \n     Nazi Germany,'' even the ranking Republican on the Senate \n     Finance committee, Charles Grassley, objected to the \n     comparison.\n       But Mr. Grassley must have thought better of his objection, \n     since just a few weeks later he decided to use the Hitler \n     analogy himself: ``I am sure voters will get their fill of \n     statistics claiming that the Bush tax cut hands out 40 \n     percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. \n     This is not merely misleading, it is outright false. Some \n     folks must be under the impression that as long as something \n     is repeated often enough, it will become true. That was how \n     Adolf Hitler got to the top.''\n       For the record, Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax \n     Justice--the original source of that 40 percent estimate--is \n     no Adolf Hitler. The amazing thing is that Mr. Grassley is \n     sometimes described as a moderate. his remarks as just one \n     more indicator that we have entered an era of extreme \n     partisanship--one that leaves no room for the acknowledgment \n     of politically inconvenient facts. For the claim that Mr. \n     Grassley describes as ``outright false'' is, in fact, almost \n     certainly true; in a rational world it wouldn't even be a \n     matter for argument.\n       You might imagine that Mr. Grassley has in hand an \n     alternative answer to the question ``How much of the tax cut \n     will go to the top 1 percent?''--that the administration has, \n     at some point, produced a number showing that the wealthy \n     aren't getting a big share of the benefits. In fact, however, \n     administration officials have never answered that question. \n     When pressed, they have always insisted on answering some \n     other question.\n       But last year the Treasury Department did release a table \n     showing, somewhat inadvertently, that more than 25 percent of \n     the income tax cut will go to people making more than \n     $200,000 per year. This number doesn't include the effects of \n     estate tax repeal; in 1999 only 2 percent of estates paid any \n     tax, and half of that tax was paid by only 0.16 percent of \n     estates. The number also probably doesn't take account of the \n     alternative minimum tax, which will snatch away most of the \n     income tax cut for upper-middle-class families, but won't \n     affect the rich.\n       Put all this together and it becomes clear that, such \n     enough, something like 40 percent of the tax cut--it could be \n     a bit less, but probably it's considerably more--will go to 1 \n     percent of the population. And the administration's \n     systematic evasiveness on the question of who benefits from \n     the tax cut amounts to a plea of nolo contendere.\n       Which brings us back to the new tone in Washington.\n       When Ronald Reagan cut taxes on rich people, he didn't deny \n     that that was what he was doing. You could agree or disagree \n     with the supply-side economic theory he used to justify his \n     actions, but he didn't pretend that he was increasing the \n     progressivity of the tax system.\n       The strategy used to sell the Bush tax cut was simply to \n     deny the facts--and to lash out at anyone who tried to point \n     them out. And it's a strategy that, having worked there, is \n     now being applied across the board.\n       Michael Kinsley recently wrote that ``The Bush campaign for \n     was against Iraq has been insulting to American citizens, not \n     just because it has been dishonest, but because it has been \n     unserious. A lie is insulting; an obvious lie is doubly \n     insulting.'' All I can say is, now he notices? It's been like \n     that all along on economic policy.\n       You see, some folks must be under the impression that as \n     long as something is repeated often enough, it will become \n     true. That was how George W. Bush got to the top.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11718-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11718-S11719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           BASELINE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 SPENDING FOR TEA-21\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, as we wrap up business for the 107th \nCongress, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with my \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and budget Committee colleagues \nregarding an issue that will set the groundwork for reauthorization of \nthe surface transportation program next Congress. Specifically, what \nthe baseline figure will be for the program. Will it reflect the fiscal \nyear 2003 enacted spending level or the pending CR level.\n  As my colleagues know, although Section 137 of Public Law 107-240, \nMaking Further Continuing Appropriations for fiscal year 2003, provides \nthat the highway program be funded at the fiscal year 2002 level of \n$31.8 billion, section 137 limits total annual obligations for the \nprogram to not more than $27.7 billion. Given that the fiscal year 2003 \nenacted level for surface transportation may not be known until after \nthe President's fiscal year 2004 budget proposal is submitted, I have a \nconcern that we could be faced with an artificially low baseline \nfigure. I hope we can reach agreement now that it would be the \nintention of the Budget Committee to use the highest possible figure as \nthe baseline for fiscal year 2003 when developing their fiscal year \n2004 resolution. Ideally I would like to see a baseline of $31.8 \nbillion.\n  At a minimum I hope that next year's Budget Resolution will ensure \nthat all revenues into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund \nwill be available to the EPW Committee for authorization with the \nexisting budgetary protections.\n  I know we can all agree that a strong surface transportation program \ncreates and preserves jobs, and thereby boosts the economy. Beginning \nreauthorization discussions with a low baseline figure stunts the value \nof the economic\n\n[[Page S11719]]\n\nactivity that we can realize with a robust program.\n  If my colleagues would care to comment, I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator for yielding for my comments. I \nagree with my colleague Senator Inhofe and I look forward to working \nwith him on this major transportation reauthorization bill. He is \ncorrect that beginning reauthorization discussions with a low baseline \nwill hinder our efforts in crafting a truly robust national program \nwhich will provide strong economic and transportation benefits for all \nregions. I would be happy to yield back to my colleague Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I agree with my colleagues. The transportation bill will be \none of the most important pieces of legislation taken up by the next \nCongress. The series of reauthorization hearings we held this past year \nmade clear the importance of a well-functioning transportation system \nto our nation's economy and quality of life. These hearings also laid \nout the challenges our transportation system faces due to increasing \ncongestion, safety concerns, the deterioration of our infrastructure, \nand the rapid projected growth in freight movements. Finding the \nnecessary funds to address these problems will be our toughest \nreauthorization challenge and I hope that we can work closely with the \nBudget Committee to ensure that we devote the maximum resources \npossible to maintaining and improving our transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  Mr. BOND. Senator Inhofe accurately states that transportation \ndollars have a direct effect on jobs and the economy in this country. \nFor example, earlier this year there was a proposed $8.6 billion \nreduction in fiscal year 2003 proposed spending from fiscal year 2002 \nenacted level for highways. This would cost an estimated 6,600 jobs in \nMissouri alone. Fortunately, the Environment and Public Works Committee \nin working with our colleagues on the Senate Transportation \nAppropriation Subcommittee have proposed full funding for fiscal year \n2003.\n  More importantly, we need to recognize that our nation's \ntransportation infrastructure is also an issue of safety. There is no \nquestion that increased investment in our nation's transportation \nsystem saves lives. For these reasons and more, I stand with my \ncolleagues on Environment and Public Works in doing everything in our \npower to maintain a robust highway program as we go into \nreauthorization.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleagues comments and agree with them \nthat the revenues collected through the federal gas tax should be used \nto maintain and improve our transportation infrastructure. I will work \nwith my colleagues to ensure this is the case.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11719-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATIONS TO JUDGE SERGIO GUTIERREZ\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I congratulate and honor a man whose \ncontributions are an example to all of us. Idaho's Judge Sergio \nGutierrez was recently recognized by Hispanic Business magazine as one \nthe 100 most influential Hispanics.\n  Judge Gutierrez holds the distinction of being the first Hispanic \njudge in Idaho. A judge since 1993, he was appointed to the Idaho Court \nof Appeals in January of this year by Gov. Dirk Kempthorne. Sergio \nGutierrez does a tremendous job as a judge, but his contributions go \nfar beyond those he has made in his official capacity. Judge Gutierrez \nhas worked to fight drugs, register voters, curb gang violence, and \npromote education, and he sits on the Governor's Coordinating Council \nfor Families and Children. I am also honored that he serves as a member \nof my Hispanic advisory group in Idaho. His wisdom and advice have been \ninvaluable assets as we have worked together to meet the needs of \nIdaho's Hispanic population.\n  It is hard to believe Judge Gutierrez was once a ninth grade dropout. \nHowever, with perseverance, he attained his GED, worked his way through \ncollege, and went on to graduate cum laude from Boise State University, \nlater earning a law degree from Hastings Law School.\n  Judge Gutierrez believes in people, and he goes out of his way to \nhelp others overcome unfortunate circumstances that otherwise would \nlimit their success. As a judge, he takes the opportunity to counsel \nwith those who come into his court room. He often invites defendants \ninto his chambers to discuss their futures, including drug \nrehabilitation, job training, and education. This is not a common \npractice among judges, but it has proven to be effective in the lives \nof the individuals whom Judge Gutierrez has touched.\n  I am proud to know Judge Sergio Gutierrez, and I would like to thank \nHispanic Business magazine and its readers for recognizing this \ntalented man. I would also like to thank Judge Gutierrez on behalf of \nthe people of Idaho for the contributions he has made to our State and \nits people. He is truly an inspiring example for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11719-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11719-S11722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A REMARKABLE AMERICAN: ROBERT INGRAM\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, as my father always said, there are two \ntypes of people, talkers and doers. Anyone who knows Robert Ingram will \nagree with me that he is a ``doer extraordinaire.'' Bob, of course, is \nthe distinguished Chief Operating Officer and President, Pharmaceutical \nOperations of GlaxoSmithKline, GSK.\n  A few weeks ago, October 15, Bob announced his intention to retire at \nyear's end from his daily responsibilities as the second-highest \nexecutive officer at GSK, the world's premier pharmaceutical company. \nThrough the years, GSK and more importantly, countless people around \nthe world have benefitted immeasurably from Bob Ingram's compassion, \nenergy, vision and intelligence.\n  In recent years, many politicians have engaged in a virtual sport, \nunjustifiably criticizing pharmaceutical companies and the senior \nexecutives who lead them. Thankfully, the American people have seen \nthough many of these attacks for what they are, political expediency.\n  Americans are sophisticated enough to know that politicians do not \ndevelop life-saving and life-improving medications. Rather, it is the \nresearch-based pharmaceutical and biotech industries that invest \nbillions of dollars each year to develop products that both extend our \nlives and improve the quality of life for billions of citizens around \nthe world.\n  Bob Ingram has served as a beacon, consistently, respectfully and \nthoughtfully explaining the public health tradeoffs involved in \nimplementing proposed new pharmaceutical regulations. It would be \nimpossible to overstate his enormous contribution to reasoned discourse \non this critical subject.\n  Bob Ingram has long understood that the ultimate victims of an \ninefficient and unproductive industry are the patients who will lack a \nsafe and effective pharmaceutical therapy for the ailment that afflicts \nthem not the pharmaceutical companies or their stockholders as some \nwould have you believe.\n  Compassion requires that one stand up in support of what is proper. \nThe measure of a leader is that he is willing to do so when that view \nis not popular. Bob Ingram has worked tirelessly as such a leader.\n  Fortunately, Bob's retirement from his day to day responsibilities at \nGSK will not mean that he is retiring from his role as an effective and \noutspoken advocate for the industry. Softening the blow somewhat is the \nknowledge that Bob will continue to fight for the well-being of \npatients as GSK's representative to the board of the Pharmaceutical \nResearch and Manufacturer's Association.\n  Bob, his dear wife Jeannie, and GSK employees have long been involved \nin promoting service to others. Together with GSK's Chief Executive \nOfficer, JP Garnier, Bob Ingram has done much to ensure that GSK serves \nas a global leader, launching effective medical programs that benefit \nmillions of people throughout the world. The Orange Card discount \nprogram is a prime example of GSK's responsiveness and industry \nleadership in the United States.\n  Through GSK's Global Community Partnership programs, the Global \nAlliance to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis, a 20-year initiative to \ncontribute hundreds of millions of doses of medication to rid the world \nof LF, the world's most disfiguring and disabling\n\n[[Page S11720]]\n\ndisease, contributions of HIV/AIDS and anti-malarial medications as \nwell as numerous other global, national, state and local initiatives, \nGSK employees have contributed greatly to the improvement of the human \ncondition and human spirit.\n  Bob's life is a testament to the importance of setting the right \npriorities. He is a success professionally because his actions have \ndemonstrated an extraordinary sense of personal responsibility to the \nimprovement of the lives of others less fortunate.\n  Raised in rural Illinois, Bob Ingram is highly respected as one of \nNorth Carolina's leading citizens. He has devoted countless thousands \nof hours to worthy civic, community and professional organizations. For \nexample, Bob led GSK's effort to provide a founders grant to the Emily \nKrzyzewski Durham family community center, he supported the Durham hill \nlearning center and has helped numerous other local civic organizations \naround North Carolina.\n  The list of worthy national causes Bob has generously helped is so \nextensive that I will not attempt to recite them all. Bob's role as \nChair of the CEO Roundtable on Cancer, his Presidency of the American \nCancer Society Foundation, and his leadership in the fight to find a \ncure for cystic fibrosis, CF, merit particular note.\n  These past several years, Dot Helms and I have considered ourselves \nfortunate to call Bob and Jeannie Ingram our friends.\n  I am grateful for the positive contributions Bob has made during his \ntenure at GSK. His advice and support have been invaluable. His \ndedication to ensuring that people everywhere can benefit from advanced \npharmaceutical therapies and his commitment to innovative programs that \nexpand access to pharmaceuticals will continue to pay dividends to \nliterally billions of people throughout the world for many years to \ncome. Bob has achieved a remarkable, and I hope unfinished, legacy.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a transcript of Bob Ingram's comments at \nthe National Press Club on July 18, 2002 and an article entitled ``A \nRetirement that hurts RTP'' from the October 16, 2002 edition of the \nRaleigh News and Observer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Comments by Bob Ingram, National Press Club, Washington, DC, July 18, \n                                  2002\n\n       Thank you, Mr. (John) Aubuchon, for your kind introduction \n     and for providing me with an opportunity to address this \n     important audience.\n       I'd also like to thank all of you for joining us this \n     afternoon. I know you've heard a lot of criticism about the \n     pharmaceutical industry and drug pricing. Today, I'd like to \n     set the record straight.\n       It's hard to predict where the current debate over health \n     care will eventually end up, or what the consequences will \n     be. And I'm inclined not to predict such things unless I end \n     up like Lord Kelvin, an English Scientist and president of \n     the Royal Society, who has gone down in history for saying: \n     ``Radio has no future. Heavier-than-air flying machines are \n     impossible. X-rays will prove to be a hoax. I have not the \n     smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation other than \n     ballooning.'' Now there's a man of conviction, but you \n     certainly wouldn't want him betting for you at the racetrack.\n       That said, we Americans have a lot riding on the outcome of \n     society's debate over how to control our healthcare costs--\n     nothing less than the future health of ourselves and our \n     children.\n       A key question in this current debate is: How much should \n     we be spending on prescription drugs? Drug costs are \n     skyrocketing, and payors are asking, how much is too much? \n     Unfortunately, in focusing the debate almost solely on cost, \n     it's easy to lose sight of the patient. Payors increasingly \n     demand less expensive medicines, but it's easy to forget that \n     a tiny pill often represents a scientific miracle in its \n     ability to save lives and improve quality of life. As \n     patients, we assume the research intensive pharmaceutical \n     industry will find better treatments for cancer, and \n     Alzheimer's and Parkinson's--but we don't recognize that \n     paying for that research also means paying at the pharmacy \n     counter. Do we spend more on pharmaceuticals today than we \n     did years ago? Yes. In fact, our critics would say that we \n     are spending too much on branded drugs.\n       But I would argue that rather than spending less, we should \n     be investing more as a society on pharmaceuticals, because \n     medicines actually represent the best value in healthcare \n     today--for patients, and for payors.\n       Let's look at this issue of cost a little more carefully.\n       Between 1996 and 2000, national health spending for \n     medicines increased 115 percent while overall health care \n     costs increased 25 percent. Seems outrageous, doesn't it?\n       But let's put this in perspective. Total health care \n     increased $260 billion during that time to a total of $1.3 \n     trillion. Spending on pharmaceuticals was less than a 10th of \n     that--$122 billion. In fact, of every dollar the government \n     spends on health care, only 9 cents is spent on medicines--\n     compared to 55 cents for doctors and hospitals. And that 9 \n     cents includes the services of your pharmacist, plus current \n     R efforts in our science labs. Unfortunately, people often \n     confuse increased spending on drugs with increased prices for \n     medicines.\n       The truth is that rising pressure on payor budgets is due \n     to increased volume--more people using more and better \n     medicines--not price increases on medicines. Pharmaceutical \n     sales increased 19 percent in 2001 over 2000, but over 14% of \n     that increase was volume growth. Less than 5 percent was due \n     to price. So what accounts for the growth in volume? In great \n     part, the very success of medicines in improving health and \n     quality of life.\n       Those of you who are 45 or 50 . . . back at the turn of the \n     last century, you'd be at the end of your life. But today, \n     the majority of us can expect to blow out the candles on our \n     80th birthday cake. And we are part of a rapidly expanding \n     group. Thirty-five million Americans are now over age 65; in \n     just 30 years, that number will double to 70 million. Of \n     course, if you're like me, you're tempted to ask why, if \n     medicine has made so much progress in the past 50 years, how \n     come I felt so much better 50 years ago.\n       Well the truth is, we Americans aren't just living longer; \n     we are generally living healthier lives. Twenty years ago, in \n     1982, the average age of an elderly person entering a nursing \n     home was 65. Today that age is 83. Many of you have elderly \n     parents, and are perhaps caregivers. How important is it to \n     you, and to your parents, that a few small pills can keep \n     your loved ones living independently in the homes they've \n     raised their families in, for as long as possible? But \n     there's a cost to longer life, better health, and maintained \n     independence--and somebody has to pay.\n       Industry critics say we can't afford this increased \n     spending on pharmaceuticals. But what we really can't afford \n     is the far greater cost of catastrophic care for heart \n     disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's and other illnesses--costs \n     that will grow substantially as the population grows. \n     Let's consider diabetes.\n       Right now, we are facing an epidemic of Type II diabetes. \n     Over 16 million Americans have Type II--the 5th leading cause \n     of deaths by disease in the U.S. Another 16 million are \n     estimated to have pre-diabetes, but most are not taking steps \n     to avoid full onset.\n       We genuinely hope people will adopt preventive lifestyles \n     to avoid the need for medicines. But those patients who do \n     suffer with this chronic and progressive disease have a lot \n     to look forward to Fatigue. Foot ulcers and gangrene leading \n     to amputation. Blindness. Kidney failure. Heart disease. \n     Stroke. Premature death. That's frightening for patients. But \n     what will really frighten those responsible for paying for \n     treatment is the alarming rise in the number of patients--and \n     therefore costs--expected over the next 50 years. By then, at \n     current rates, the number of patients with Type II diabetes \n     will increase by 200 percent--skyrocketing our country's \n     costs for dealing with Type II diabetes.\n       Today, we pay $100 billion a year to cover the human and \n     economic cost to society from just this one disease--a huge \n     proportion of which is spend for hospital care. When you \n     consider the aging population, the increasing incidence of \n     diabetes, and the huge cost associated with it, unless we \n     come up with better answers, we'll break the bank with just \n     one disease. That's what we can't afford.\n       But real hope lies in pharmaceuticals. Before 1995, doctors \n     didn't have many options available. They relied primarily on \n     insulin injections or sulfonylureas, as well as prevention. \n     Just 7 years later, there are four new classes of oral \n     diabetes medications on the market that help slow the \n     progression of the disease, and prevent or delay the onset of \n     its more serious and costly complications. Most importantly, \n     these medicines ease patient suffering. And spending on these \n     valuable medicines is only a fraction of the cost of fighting \n     diabetes--just 2 percent in 1997. Can we afford to pay for \n     new and better prescription medicines that fight diabetes? I \n     would argue we can't afford not to. We have proven time and \n     again that paying for medicines is the most cost effective \n     way of fighting disease.\n       Take AIDS. Remember how, in the early 80's, full-blown AIDS \n     was a death sentence for patients? Many died within two years \n     of diagnosis. By 1996, AIDS had dropped out of the top 10 \n     leading causes of death in the United States. Why?\n       In 1984, scientists at Burroughs Wellcome brought new hope \n     to patients with AZT--the first treatment to fight HIV/AIDS. \n     In the first 16 months after AZT came to market, hospital \n     inpatient care dropped by nearly half (43%). Today, with a \n     score of medicines on the market, if patients take their \n     combination therapy as prescribed, they don' die of AIDS. \n     Critics say these medicines cost a lot of money. And they do. \n     Combination therapy--using several AIDS medicines at once to \n     fight the disease--costs approximately $11,000 a year per \n     patient. But before such therapies were available, an AIDS \n     patient could account for $100,000 a year in hospital bills--\n     until they died from the disease.\n\n[[Page S11721]]\n\n     Are we spending more today on AIDS medicines? Yes, but we are \n     saving millions in the overall cost of medical care. And \n     people with AIDS are living--and they are productive members \n     of their communities. Instead of planning for their funerals, \n     they are planning for the rest of their lives.\n       Then there's stroke.\n       Breakthrough clot-busting medicines can stop some strokes \n     before permanent brain damage occurs. The end result not only \n     saves lives, but also saves dollars--$1,700 in drug therapy \n     versus over $6,000 per patient in treatment costs. More \n     promising yet, increased drug use may prevent some strokes \n     entirely. A study by the Agency for Health Care Policy and \n     Research says that greater use of a blood-thinning drug would \n     prevent 40,000 strokes a year, saving $600 million per year. \n     Yet stroke remains the 3rd leading cause of death for senior \n     citizens and the first leading cause of disability. Without \n     future breakthroughs from the research intensive \n     pharmaceutical industry, we face huge future human and cost \n     implications from this disease.\n       Are we spending more money on drugs to prevent and treat \n     strokes? Absolutely. Is it worth it? Absolutely--both in \n     terms of lowered costs and, more importantly, reduced patient \n     suffering. Are we continuing to search for new and better \n     treatment for stroke? Absolutely. But stroke is notoriously \n     one of the most challenging types of pharmaceutical research \n     and development to undertake. The incentives have to be there \n     to justify the huge investment required in such high risk \n     research. But if you're an insurance company, or an employer, \n     or a federal or state government budget officer, you see the \n     money spent on medicines going up and up, and a ballooning \n     senior population in the offing, and you think, we've got to \n     get this spending under control.\n       Your first response? Find any way you can to cut the \n     pharmacy budget. You can do that a number of ways--price \n     caps, supplementary rebates, formularies, for example--\n     but the result can be unexpected.\n       Years ago, the state of New Hampshire learned this lesson \n     the hard way. The government capped prescription drug \n     spending, and saved an average $57 a year on drugs for \n     schizophrenia patients. But the law of unintended \n     consequences kicked in, and they added $1,500 a year in costs \n     for visits to mental-health clinics and emergency rooms.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, that's what my mother called penny-\n     wise and pound-foolish. Pharmaceuticals are actually the best \n     value in health care, and rather than spending less, we \n     should be investing more on medicines. Penny-wise squeezing \n     of pharmaceutical costs only results in pound-foolish \n     expansion of costs for more expensive health care procedures. \n     Do we spend more on pharmaceuticals today than we did years \n     ago? Yes. But we can't afford to forget that the money paid \n     for medicines today fuels investment in R for the medicines \n     of tomorrow.\n       You're all familiar with the floppy disks or CDs you use to \n     load software on your computer. You also probably know that \n     these disks cost less than a dollar to buy at your local \n     office supply store. Why then does your software often cost \n     hundreds of dollars? Well, for the same reason that a little \n     white pill costs so much at the pharmacy. Just as in the case \n     of new medicines that improve your health, hundreds of \n     highly-skilled people took many years to invent and develop \n     that new software for your computer. You're not just buying a \n     bit of plastic. You're buying creativity, and years of \n     research and development that went into developing the \n     software for your computer--and the new medicines that \n     improve your health.\n       In our case that's an investment of $800 million, 10-12 \n     years of R, and the failure of 5,000 to 10,000 compounds \n     along the way--just to bring one new innovative medicine to \n     market. But it's government and academia that discover drugs, \n     right? Not exactly. Of the top 100 most commonly used \n     medicines in the U.S., 93 were discovered and/or developed by \n     research-based pharmaceutical companies. Certainly, \n     government and academia play a vital role in scientific \n     research. They push the frontiers of science, and while we do \n     that in pharmaceutical research companies too, we have the \n     practical expertise to link what we know about disease and \n     the human body to develop medicines that improve human \n     health. For example, the public sector discovered the \n     presence of beta adrenergic receptors in the heart and blood \n     vessels. But it took the pharmaceutical research industry to \n     convert that scientific knowledge into new medicines that \n     treat heart disease, high blood pressure and stroke--the \n     beta-blockers that are keeping a number of us, and our \n     parents, alive today.\n       GSK alone invests $4 billion a year in research and \n     development. The hope for patients who are or will suffer \n     from diabetes, AIDS, Parkinson's, stroke, Alzheimer's, Cystic \n     Fibrosis and countless other diseases lies in the powerhouse \n     of innovative pharmaceutical industry research--and in the \n     partnerships between industry, government and academia. \n     Recently many of you have read or seen news items about an \n     insurance industry-sponsored study claiming that all this \n     research effort doesn't result in better drugs, but only \n     drugs of minimal value--so-called me-too drugs. Breakthrough \n     medicines are fantastic--when you find them--but they are \n     rare, and very hard to achieve. Believe me, no one sets out \n     to discover or develop a medicine that has no advantage over \n     current therapy.\n       I sometimes say working in a pharmaceutical company is a \n     lot like playing golf: It costs a lot and takes a long time \n     to play. You will likely never hit a hole in one. And you \n     always feel like you're playing with a handicap. But you \n     can't escape the fact that science is slow and incremental. \n     More often than not, after years of testing, you learn that \n     your medicine isn't a breakthrough; but it may offer fewer \n     side effects, work a little faster, or come in a pill that is \n     easier for patients to swallow. These incremental advances--\n     while not breakthroughs--can and do provide real value for \n     patients. Sometimes we find new uses for old drugs. Take \n     Coreg--a GSK treatment for heart failure. Coreg is a beta-\n     blocker, a class of drugs which at one time was restricted to \n     treating hypertension because it was thought to cause heart \n     failure in patients. But clinical trials showed Coreg \n     actually benefited patients with congestive heart failure.\n       These trials were so successful that the only ethical thing \n     to do was to stop the trial and give the medicine to all \n     patients, even those who were on placebo. If you work for an \n     insurance company, you might view Coreg as a me-too drug. If \n     you're a patient, you'd likely view it as a lifesaver. Our \n     critics say that we should concentrate only on new chemicals, \n     and forget such incremental gains. But consider this. Merck \n     and GSK both have AIDS vaccines in development. One may work, \n     neither may work, or both may work.\n       But right now we don't know which could be the miracle \n     vaccine that makes it first to market and which would be the \n     follower--a so-called me-too. Tell me. Which of these \n     research programs should we kill for the purpose of \n     controlling costs? Personally, for those at risk of AIDS, I \n     hope both programs are a success, and that physicians and \n     patients have a choice of two AIDS vaccines competing with \n     one another in the marketplace. Of course, when we do come up \n     with a new idea and patent it, our critics claim that we \n     abuse the patient system for the purpose of keeping generic \n     drugs off the market. Let me set the record straight. There \n     is clearly a place for generics in our health care system.\n       I have no problem competing with generics in the \n     marketplace--but only after our patent expires. There's a \n     great deal of confusion about patents in the public mind, and \n     that's understandable, because it's complex subject. First \n     off, no innovator pharmaceutical company realizes a full 20 \n     years of patent life on a medicine granted under the law. By \n     the time that medicine makes it through the regulatory \n     process, we only have about 11 years left on our 20 year \n     patent to realize a return on that investment and fund \n     current R Other industries, by contrast, generally enjoy \n     18 years of patent life on their products.\n       Second, the Hatch Waxman Act of 1984 basically crated the \n     generic industry by outlining a delicate balance between the \n     need, on the one hand, to bring low cost copies to market \n     after a medicine's patent expires, and on the other hand, to \n     protect incentives for pharmaceutical research and \n     innovation. History has proven one thing--thanks to the Hatch \n     Waxman Act, the modern generic drug industry is healthy and \n     growing. In fact, generics now account for nearly half of all \n     prescriptions filled in the United States. Yet as part of \n     that delicate balance, generic drug companies were given a \n     special treatment unlike any other industry. They have access \n     to patent protected date before the patent expires.\n       So a generic company can copy our scientists' work, develop \n     their plans to manufacture their version of our medicine, and \n     have it ready to ship the day the patent expires. In every \n     other industry, a copier has to wait until the patent expires \n     on a technology before they can even think about planning to \n     copy that product. The problem is, generic companies don't \n     want to wait until the patents expire. They have taken to \n     challenging innovator patents in an attempt to declare those \n     patent invalid so they can come to market sooner.\n       In the case of our anti-depressant, Paxil, the first \n     generic company challenged our patents just five and a half \n     years into what should have been a 14-year patent term. In \n     the next 3 years, seven other generic companies entered the \n     fray.\n       Ladies and gentlemen, this kind of abuse of the Hatch-\n     Waxman Act means lots of time and money wasted on litigation, \n     costs that eventually get reflected in the price of \n     medicines. The first generic company to market often gets 6 \n     months of exclusivity to sell their version of our product \n     without competition from other generics--so contesting \n     patents is worth it to those companies.\n       It's a much simpler and lower risk business strategy for \n     [generic companies to] hire lawyers and challenge patents in \n     the courts than to invest in science and final new innovative \n     medicines.\n       Speaking for GSK, I'd be willing to consider giving up the \n     defensive litigation provisions available to the research \n     intensive industry under Hatch Waxman if the generic \n     companies agree to drop the special provisions they have to \n     come to market. Current reform efforts threaten to destroy \n     the balance that protects innovation while enabling the \n     generics to operate. In letter to Senator Kennedy, Richard \n     Epstein, the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service \n     Professor of Law at the University of Chicago, said it best: \n     ``The current regime...confess competition with confiscation \n     of property rights.'' It's important to remember that generic \n     companies do not discover new medicines yet it's the \n     innovative pharmaceutical research industry that is at risk. \n     In fact, the patient\n\n[[Page S11722]]\n\n     with a disease that needs a better treatment is at risk as \n     well.\n       Let me close with where I started--with the idea that by \n     focusing strictly on costs we are focusing on the wrong \n     thing. Instead, we should be focusing on the patient. We need \n     to be able to discover, develop, and deliver a better \n     medicine that meets patient needs. To the degree we do that, \n     we succeed. To the degree we don't do that, we fail. And when \n     we fail, we fail patients who are suffering from disease. And \n     we fail the society that looks to us for better treatments. I \n     hope I've demonstrated that medicines offer the greatest \n     value for better patient health and quality of life. But we \n     do understand that if you can't afford your medicine, any \n     price is too high. And that's why we at GSK--and at a number \n     of other research-intensive pharmaceutical companies--are \n     looking for ways to improve patient access to medicines, not \n     only in developing countries, but here at home as well.\n       That's why we offer medicines to the most needy patients \n     through our patient assistance programs. Last year, the \n     innovative pharmaceutical industry helped to fill 6.5 million \n     prescriptions for more than 2.4 million needy patients. That \n     adds up to more than $1 billion worth of medicine provided \n     free of charge. That's also why GlaxoSmithKline led the way \n     in improving access to medicines for low-income seniors in \n     the US.\n       GSK's Orange Card--the first savings card for seniors in \n     the industry--offers low income seniors savings of 20-40% or \n     more on more their GSK medicines. We now have over 100,000 \n     seniors participating in this savings program. The Together \n     Rx card does the same, but offers saving on more than 150 \n     medicines from 7 different pharmaceutical companies. In less \n     than six weeks after availability, over 1 million patients \n     had requested enrollment forms for this program. Both cards \n     are free, and easy to obtain and use. But such programs \n     are only a stopgap until comprehensive Medicare reform can \n     pass Congress.\n       Of course skeptics will say that passage of real Medicare \n     reform is a bit like the story of the doctor who went to \n     heaven and met God. God granted him one question, so the \n     physician asked, ``Will health-care reform ever occur?'' ``I \n     have good news and bad news,'' God replied. ``The answer is \n     yes, there will be health care reform. The bad news is, it \n     won't be in my lifetime.'' We in the research intensive \n     industry hope passage of a meaningful benefit does occur, not \n     just in our lifetime, but in this election year.\n       We understand passing reform of this magnitude in an \n     election year can be a challenge. But we strongly favor \n     adding a drug benefit to Medicare, because we believe \n     patients should have coverage for health care--including \n     prescription drugs. The House has already passed a bill which \n     we supported. We hope that the Senate, in an election year, \n     would put patients first and also pass meaningful reform, \n     like that embodied in the tripartisan bill that Democrats, \n     Republicans and Independents are supporting. That bill \n     provides a meaningful benefit, but allows competition to take \n     place in the free market. That type of arrangement allows \n     real price competition, in the marketplace, but does not \n     stifle innovation and research. That's where we stand now. We \n     must come to grips with the cost side of the value equation \n     if we are to restore balance and realize the true value of \n     the medical innovations we have the opportunity to enjoy.\n       If we at GSK are ever inclined to forget the value of our \n     medicines, we have to look no further for a reminder than the \n     patients we serve today. I was astonished by an e-mail we \n     received from a woman who takes Advair--our newest asthma \n     medicine. She wrote; ``I started taking Advair approximately \n     August 24th. I really began feeling great--my breathing had \n     improved immensely. On September 11th, I was in 2 World Trade \n     Center when the impossible happened. I really believe that \n     because of this medication I was able to make my way down 59 \n     stories through Manhattan and across the Brooklyn Bridge. \n     Please give my thanks to those who developed this life saving \n     medicine.''\n       This letter means a lot to me, and to all of us at GSK--\n     particularly our scientists who dedicate their lives to \n     discovering and developing new medicines like Advair.\n       Just yesterday, a Wall Street Journal editorial cited one \n     of our industry's best critics, Sen. Edward Kennedy, saying \n     that ``something has to be done about the `soaring cost of \n     prescription drugs' else the `miracle cures' promised by the \n     biotech revolution will remain priced `out of the reach of \n     ordinary Americans.' '' The editorial went on to say: \n     ``Miracles they may be, but they don't fall from heaven. They \n     will be developed for a profit, or they won't be developed at \n     all.''\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From Newsobserver.com, Oct. 16, 2002]\n\n                      A Retirement That Hurts RTP\n\n                            (By David Ranii)\n\n       Research Triangle Park.--Robert Ingram, the No. 2 executive \n     at giant GlaxoSmithKline and the most visible pharmaceutical \n     industry leader in the Triangle, is retiring at the end of \n     this year.\n       Ingram, who in December turns 60, mandatory retirement age \n     for GSK executives, is the former chief executive officer of \n     London-based Glaxo Wellcome and was named chief operating \n     officer and president of worldwide pharmaceutical operations \n     after Glaxo merged with SmithKline Beecham nearly two years \n     ago.\n       David Stout, now president of the U.S. pharmaceuticals \n     business, will replace Ingram as head of worldwide \n     pharmaceuticals.\n       ``I think Bob is one of the most outstanding pharmaceutical \n     executives in the United States,'' said John Plachetka, chief \n     executive of Durham pharmaceutical company Pozen. ``He is so \n     well known and well respected--not just in our industry but \n     in Washington.''\n       As the highest-ranking former Glaxo executive remaining at \n     GSK, Ingram's imminent retirement can be viewed as \n     reinforcing the complaints of some employees that what was \n     billed as a merger of equals has turned out to be a de facto \n     takeover by SmithKline Beecham. Glaxo's former chairman, \n     Richard Sykes, retired from GSK earlier this year. Ingram \n     will continue to work with the company as part-time vice \n     chairman and special adviser.\n       Ingram's retirement sets off a domino effect among senior \n     executives at GSK, which is based in London and has twin U.S. \n     headquarters in Research Triangle Park and Philadelphia.\n       Unlike Ingram, whose office is in RTP, Stout, 48, will move \n     to Philadelphia when he takes charge. Stout hails from the \n     Smithkline Beecham side of the business and was based in \n     Philadelphia before being named to his current post in \n     January 2001.\n       Ingram said he has ``a high degree of confidence in David's \n     ability.''\n       Stout's successor as head of the U.S. pharmaceuticals \n     business will be Christopher Viehbacher, 42, president of \n     pharmaceuticals in Europe, who will move from Paris to RTP. \n     Andre Witty, Asia Pacific senior vice president, has been \n     named Viehbacher's successor. Both Viehbacher and Witty were \n     with GSK before the merger.\n       After Ingram retires, six of the 14 top-tier executives at \n     the company, what the company calls its corporate executive \n     team, will have Glaxo Wellcome pedigrees, while the other \n     eight will share a SmithKline Beecham heritage. Ingram, \n     meanwhile, will continue to participate in executive team \n     meetings even after he retires, said GSK spokeswoman Mary \n     Anne Rhyne.\n       The chief operating officer position being vacated by \n     Ingram isn't being filled.\n       Ingram, who began his pharmaceutical career as a sales \n     representative, said that when he left Merck & Co. to join \n     Glaxo in 1990, he realized that the one downside was that \n     Glaxo, like many British companies, had a mandatory \n     retirement age of 60 for top executives. ``Time, \n     unfortunately, marches on, as they say,'' he said.\n       Ingram said that, although he doesn't have a noncompete \n     clause in his new arrangement with GSK, he isn't interested \n     in being CEO of another pharmaceutical company. ``I will say \n     I have been approached to do that,'' he said. ``It is \n     flattering.''\n       ``There is certainly a possibility,'' he added, ``that I \n     might take on some nonexecutive chairmanships.''\n       Ingram, who is well known in political circles, also said \n     he has no plans to run for political office. ``I think my \n     wife would shoot me if I even considered it,'' he said.\n       Ingram has earned kudos for being an effective advocate for \n     GSK and the industry in Washington, and he also has developed \n     a relationship with President Bush and his family. At a \n     black-tie GOP fund-raiser held in Washington in June that \n     netted about $30 million, Ingram was called upon to offer the \n     presidential toast.\n       In recognition of Ingram's Washington clout, he will remain \n     GSK's representative on the board of the industry trade \n     group, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers' \n     Association, after his retirement.\n       ``Bob Ingram is one of the giants of the pharmaceutical \n     industry, and we are pleased that he will continue to play a \n     major role on the PhRMA Board,'' Alan Homer, the \n     association's president, said in a statement. ``Bob's \n     sensitivity and caring for the needs of others, especially \n     patients, is unparalleled.\n       Dr. Charles Sanders, a former chairman and chief executive \n     of the U.S. operations of what is now GSK, praised Ingram's \n     leadership. ``Bob has been through two mergers, first with \n     Burroughs Wellcome and then with SmithKline Beecham,'' said \n     Sanders. ``I think he has handled it very well. it is very \n     difficult to merge companies.''\n       Ingram, who lives in Durham, said he understands that some \n     GSK employees keep score regarding how many former Glaxo \n     Wellcome executives are in leadership positions compared with \n     their counterparts from SmithKline Beecham. But that's not \n     how the corporate executive team looks at things, he said.\n       ``It is one company: GSK,'' he said. ``Our competition \n     isn't internal. The last time I checked, we had plenty of \n     competition [elsewhere].''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11722-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11722-S11723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FOSTERING DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES AND VALUES IN UKRAINE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President. I wish to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues the Civitas International Civic Education Exchange Program, \na cooperative project of civic education organizations in the United \nStates and other nations. The goal of the project is to exchange ideas, \nexperiences, and curricular programs to further the development of \ncivic competence and responsibility among youth in emerging\n\n[[Page S11723]]\n\nand established democracies. The program is administered by the Center \nfor Civic Education and funded by the U.S. Department of Education \nunder the Education for Democracy Act approved by the United States \nCongress.\n  Recently may office was pleased to meet with a delegation of \neducators participating in the Civitas exchange program from Ukraine \nwho have spent time in Alabama working on a curriculum for teaching \nUkrainian history and civic education. The Ukraine delegation is \npartnered with the Alabama Center for Law and Civic Education in \nBirmingham, which has an outstanding reputation for delivering high \nquality civic education programs under the leadership of Executive \nDirector Jan Cowin and Associate Director Wade Black. The American \nleaders of the delegation included two other Alabama natives, Louis \nSmith, Professor, School of Education, University of Western Alabama \nand his wife Carole Smith, visiting lecturer, Mississippi State \nUniversity. I wish to commend all four of these Alabama educators for \ntheir excellent work in promoting educational excellence in our state.\n  The Ukraine delegates include Larysa Seredyak, Teacher of History and \nCivics in Lviv; Anatoliy Kovtonyuk, Teacher of History, Law, and \nPhilosophy in Zhytomyr; Volodymyr Gorbatenko, Professor, Koretskyi \nState and Law Institute of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine \nand Professor of Politology and Sociology in Kyiv; Grygoriy Freyman, \nAssistant Professor, World History, Luhansk Pedagogical University and \nTeacher of History and Law in Luhansk; and Nataliya Yuikhymovych, \nTranslator and Interpreter in Lviv.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article in \nthe Montgomery Advertiser about a recent visit by this distinguished \nUkrainian delegation to a class of sixth graders at Dalraida Elementary \nSchool. It demonstrates how our teachers and students can benefit from \nthese international programs through joint educational projects. Above \nall, it shows how we can work cooperatively with other nations to \npromote fundamental democratic principles, understanding and values \namong our youth.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Montgomery Advertiser, Nov. 9, 2002]\n\n                    Students quiz Ukrainian teachers\n\n                           (By Ken L. Spear)\n\n       The schoolchildren bombarded the visiting Ukrainian \n     classroom teachers with loads of questions:\n       ``Do you have elections for political office?'' ``Do y'all \n     own, like dogs and horses?'' ``Does your school have \n     computers?'' ``What is your grading system?'' ``When kids get \n     in trouble, what does the principal do?''\n       The inquiries are a part of the Dalraida Elementary sixth-\n     graders' quest to seek a solution to a common problem while \n     crossing international borders.\n       They are in the early stages of a civic project with their \n     peers from Village School in Synkiv in the Ukraine.\n       Students here already are talking about how to bridge the \n     digital divide and raising the money necessary to make it \n     happen. There's one computer for the entire Village School.\n       ``They should have better communication with everybody,'' \n     said Dairaida's ilyan Unyhkov, whose parents are Russian \n     natives. ``Plus we need to make allies. If we're not friends, \n     we may still get into war.''\n       ``The may help us,'' classmate J'Darius Powell added.\n       Designed for grades five through eight, the ``We the People \n     . . . Project Citizen'' curriculum not only teaches students \n     about government, but the tools and skills necessary to solve \n     problems in their communities. That includes learning how to \n     monitor and influence public policy, and crafting an action \n     plan.\n       Civic participation isn't a foreign concept to the \n     Ukrainian sixth-graders. Two years ago, The Village School \n     joined the ranks of Project Citizen schools. Students there \n     have led projects, such as the restoration of memorials from \n     World Wars I and II that have been neglected by the Soviets \n     and the clean up of community rivers and streams.\n       The group of educators is visiting Alabama as part of its \n     mission to develop a ``common national definition'' and a \n     curriculum for teaching Ukrainian history and civics \n     education, said Wade Black, associate director of the Alabama \n     Center for Law and Civic Education at Samford University.\n       A final version of the curriculum is expected to be \n     submitted by next summer to the European Union, which is \n     similar to Samford University's law and civic education \n     center.\n       Ukraine declared independence in 1991. Under Soviet rule \n     prior to that, citizens weren't taught their history and had \n     no access to a curriculum.\n       ``It parallels with black history,'' Black said. ``They \n     want to write a history that unifies the country and defines \n     what it means to be Ukrainian.''\n       While Project Citizen is an international program, only 25 \n     Alabama schools, scouting troops and church groups are \n     involved. Proration of the education budget forced some \n     schools to cut the program.\n       ``If they could just see the difference it makes in kids' \n     lives,'' said Teri Gisi, faculty adviser for Dairaida's \n     program. ``They see what a difference they can make.''\n       Dalraida got its hands-on civics lesson when students \n     revisited a 15-year battle to get a sidewalk down a 1\\1/2\\-\n     mile stretch of Johnstown Drive. The sixth-graders devised a \n     plan, appealed to the City Council and was granted a \n     sidewalk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11723-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11723-S11725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE QUIET EROSION OF OUR FEDERAL LANDS IN ALASKA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, every year we get to this point at the end \nof a Congress where many bills get packaged together and move through \nunder unanimous consent. Usually this process works well and gives each \nof us an opportunity to work out concerns we might have about any \nparticular bill. Unfortunately, last night two bills were approved that \nshould have received much greater scrutiny by the full Senate. Instead, \nthey squeaked through because the proponents cleverly bundled them with \nover 100 other uncontroversial, local-interest bills.\n  Together, the Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act and the \nUniversity of Alaska lands bill will give away huge chunks of our \nfederal lands in Alaska. Individually, they represent what I fear will \nbe facing us in the near future--the quiet erosion of our federal lands \nfor the benefit of private interests. These bills turn over more than \n260,000 acres of federal lands in Alaska without addressing fundamental \npublic concerns about public access, logging, roadless areas and the \nimpact on fish and wildlife.\n  Both of these bills are opposed by many Alaska and national \nenvironmental organizations.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record two letters, \ndated July 16, 2002 and September 4, 2002, outlining some of their \nconcerns that were not heard as these bills were being rushed to the \nfloor and passed last night.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Alaska Coalition, Alaska Conservation Voters/Alaska Conservation \n Alliance, Alaska Rainforest Campaign, Alaska Wilderness League, Earth \n  Justice, Eyak Preservation Council, Mineral Policy Center, National \n   Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, Natural Resources \nDefense Council, League of Conservation Voters, Scenic America, Sierra \n  Club, Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, The Endangered Species \n             Coalition, The Wilderness Society, U.S. PIRG,\n\n                                                    July 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman: We are writing you to urge you to \n     oppose S. 2222, the Cape Fox Entitlement Adjustment Act of \n     2002. Introduced earlier this year by Senator Frank Murkowski \n     (R-AK), and currently being considered by the Energy and \n     Natural Resources Committee, this bill is an attempt to \n     benefit special interests by giving away valuable Tongass \n     National Forest lands--lands owned by all Americans. Opposed \n     by many Southeast Alaskans, S. 2222 attempts to trade the \n     Tongass for commercial development including clear cutting \n     and mining.\n       This bill proposes to give Cape Fox and Sealaska \n     Corporations more than 11,000 acres of valuable Tongass \n     National Forest lands in Berners Bay near Juneau in return \n     for 3,000 acres of mostly roaded and clearcut lands near \n     Ketchikan and certain subsurface rights. With the transfer of \n     the publicly owned lands, the Corporations gain the rights to \n     log, subdivide, sell, or develop this swath of land on the \n     northwest side of Berners Bay. Despite the importance of \n     Berners Bay to Alaskan residents, Senator Murkowski has not \n     held a local hearing on the land exchange issue in Juneau. \n     This bill is bad public policy and should not see the light \n     of day.\n       Berners Bay is one of Juneau's most important recreation \n     areas for kayaking, hunting, camping, bird watching, \n     commercial touring and many other activities. The traded \n     lands could be closed to public access, beautiful views and \n     hunting grounds replaced with stumps and no trespassing \n     signs. The Bay contains abundant wildlife, including four \n     species of salmon, wolves and brown and black bears. It is an \n     important stopover for migratory birds as well as foraging \n     grounds for Steller sea lions.\n       The Alaska Department of Fish and Game, City and Borough of \n     Juneau, and commercial\n\n[[Page S11724]]\n\n     fishermen have long supported protection of Berners Bay's \n     high value fisheries and vast recreational opportunities. \n     Additionally, the Auk Kwaan tribe, original settlers of the \n     area, recognizes Berners Bay as an integral part of their \n     traditional territory. These ancestral lands contain village \n     site, burial grounds, and the sacred Spirit Mountain. Berners \n     Bay is a critically important wild area for southeast Alaska \n     residents and visitors alike.\n       The public lands to be given away include Slate Lake, where \n     the Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation anticipates dumping mine \n     tailings from its proposed Kensington gold mine. Slates Lake \n     is perched above a productive salmon stream in Berners Bay. \n     Giving away these lands would risk contaminating the land and \n     harming its irreplaceable natural resources.\n       Again, we urge you to oppose S. 2222. Please do not \n     schedule a mark-up of this bill by the committee. The Tongass \n     National Forest is a national treasure that deserves to be \n     treated with care and in the best interest of the American \n     people.\n           Sincerely,\n         Tim Bristol, Executive Director, Alaska Coalition; Tim \n           Atkinson, Executive Director, Alaska Conservation \n           Voters; Michael Finkelstein, Campaign Director,, Alaska \n           Rainforest Campaign; Cindy Shogan, Executive Director, \n           Alaska Wilderness League; Dune Lankard, Executive \n           Director, Eyak Preservation Council; Vawter Parker, \n           Executive Director, Earth Justice; Deb Callahan, \n           President, League of Conservation Voters; Stephen \n           D'Esposito, President, Mineral Policy Center; Bob \n           Perciasepe, Senior Vice President, National Audubon \n           Society; Jamie Rappaport Clark, Senior Vice President, \n           National Wildlife Federation; John Adams, President, \n           Natural Resources Defense Council; Meg Maquire, \n           President, Scenic America; Carl Pope, Executive \n           Director, Sierra Club; Jeremy Anderson, Executive \n           Director, Southeast Alaska Conservation Council; Bill \n           Meadows, President, The Wilderness Society; Brock \n           Evans, Executive Director, The Endangered Species \n           Coalition; Gene Karpinski, Executive Director, U.S. \n           Public Research Group.\n                                  ____\n\n\nAlaska Coalition, Alaska Rainforest Campaign, Alaska Wilderness League, \n   Earth Justice, Eyak Preservation Council, League of Conservation \n Voters, Mineral Policy Center, National Wildlife Federation, Natural \n      Resources Defense Council, The Wilderness Society, US PIRG,\n\n                                                September 4, 2002.\n     The Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid, We are writing to urge you to keep S. \n     2222, the Cape Fox Land Entitlement Adjustment Act of 2002, \n     off the floor of the United States Senate. This bill was \n     introduced earlier this year by Senator Frank Murkowski (AK-\n     R), and passed through the Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee in late July.\n       Even with the changes in language made during the mark-up \n     process, this bill is an attempt to benefit special interests \n     by giving away valuable Tongass National Forest lands, which \n     are owned by all Americans. Opposed by many Southeast \n     Alaskans, S. 2222 attempts to trade Tongass lands for \n     commercial development including clearcutting and mining.\n       This bill proposes to give Cape Fox and Sealaska \n     Corporations more than 11,000 acres of valuable Tongass \n     National Forest lands in Berners Bay near Juneau in return \n     for 3,000 acres of mostly roaded and clearcut lands near \n     Ketchikan and certain subsurface rights.

We believe that a public \n     appraisal should be required before this legislation is \n     allowed to proceed. This bill is bad public policy, and is \n     another attempt by Senator Murkowski to appease special \n     interests during his governor's race.\n       Berners Bay is one of Juneau's most important recreation \n     areas for kayaking, hunting, camping, bird watching, \n     commercial touring and many other activities.

Mr. President, S. 2222 would privatize 12,000 acres of \nTongass National Forest land in Berners Bay, a popular recreation area \nfor residents of Juneau, Alaska. The two corporations--Sealaska and \nCape Fox Corporations--that would receive title to the National Forest \nlands have a history of closing public access to their lands and \nheavily logging them. Most of the logs have been exported directly to \nAsia without any domestic processing. The provisions for old-growth \nreserves in the reported version of S. 2222 offer little protection. \nThe vast majority of old-growth forest on the newly privatized National \nForest lands could still be heavily logged and the logs shipped \nstraight to Asia with no domestic manufacturing.\n  Trading land to two Native corporations is not the only reason \nproponents so desperately wanted this bill to move this year though. \nThe bill will also make it much easier for a mining corporation to open \na gold mine adjacent to the national forest land being traded. The \nproposed Kensington mine is currently permitted to store its mine \ntailings on its own land. But the mine wants to reduce its operating \ncosts by instead dumping its mine tailings in a pristine lake that \nconveniently is within the 12,000 acres being traded. EPA and the State \nof Alaska have written opinions suggesting that dumping tailings in \nthis lake is likely illegal under the Clean Water Act.\n  The potential environmental impact of the mine tailings dump and \nlogging operation on the land will have long-term effects on an \nextremely rich salmon producing area. Berners Bay also contains \nabundant wildlife, such as wolves and brown and black bears that will \nbe impacted by the increased activity in the area and water pollution \ngenerated by the mine and logging operations. By privatizing the land, \nthe public will have little knowledge or say in how the mine and \nlogging operations affect the recreational, hunting, fishing and \necological values of the bay.\n  The fishing and tourism industries, both key to Southeast Alaska, \nwill be largely shut out of any oversight of the operations even though \nit will likely have a direct impact on their financial well-being.\n  The environmental and economic concerns about these land exchanges \nshould raise enough red flags to demand much greater scrutiny from this \nbody. On top of that, these bills also raise serious questions about \nthe cost to taxpayers nationally of privatizing our public resources. \nIn return for the 12,000 acres transferred to Cape Fox, taxpayers would \nget 3,000 acres of largely clearcut private lands and certain \nsubsurface rights. There is no safeguard in the bill allowing the \npublic to actually have a say in whether this is a good, or even fair, \ndeal for taxpayers. The University of Alaska land exchange would turn \nover at least 250,000 acres of federal lands without a public process \nfor approving or rejecting which lands actually get transferred. \nInstead, it is solely left to the Secretary of the Interior to decide.\n  Again, these two bills are troubling enough on their own because of \ntheir environmental and economic impacts. However, the idea of trading \naway public lands with little or no public input\n\n[[Page S11725]]\n\nand no economic or environmental analysis is even more troubling. Over \nthe years, our federal agencies and this body have done an admirable \njob of protecting these lands for the public, not for private \ninterests. We should not start reversing that record now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11725-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ARKANSAS RIVERBED LAND\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I wish to express my thanks to the \nchairman and vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs \nwho have greatly assisted the effort to bring much needed finality to \nthe uncertainty created by litigation surrounding the ownership of the \nbed of the Arkansas River. A decision by the United States Supreme \nCourt in 1970 determined that parts of the bed of the Arkansas River \nwere included along with other land that was conveyed to Indian Nations \nbased on 19th century treaties between the United States and the Indian \nNations that were relocated from the East Coast of the United States to \nOklahoma or ``Indian Territory'' as it was then known.\n  Based on the Supreme Court's decision that Arkansas riverbed lands \nwere included within the treaties with Indian Nations, the United \nStates is subject to monetary damages for any breaches of its trust \nobligation with respect to this land. A suit has been brought on behalf \nof the Indian Nations asserting that such breaches of trust have \noccurred. The case is presently before the United States Court of \nFederal Claims.\n  With respect to such treaty lands, the Non-Intercourse Act of 1790 \nprevents the transfer of title without Congressional approval. Without \naction by Congress, claims to legal title on behalf of the Indian \nNations can continue to be raised with respect to these lands based on \nthe Federal Government's underlying trust obligation. The threat of \nsuch lawsuits is a serious hardship on those people who were simply \nunaware that they were living on land that was once part of the bed of \nthe Arkansas River. H.R. 3534 would eliminate title problems that are \nthe result of the Supreme Court's decision and resolve breach of trust \nclaims brought by the Indian Nations.\n  Several months ago, United Keetowah Band of Cherokee Indians, UKB, \nfiled a motion to intervene in the Court of Federal Claims lawsuit. \nAlthough this motion was denied, the Department of Justice expressed \nits reluctance to endorse H.R. 3534 unless it was drafted to precluded \nthe UKB from either bringing quiet title actions or from petitioning \nthe United States to bring such actions. In order to ensure that UKB \nwas not left without a remedy for pursuing its claims, the Justice \nDepartment proposed that the bill be amended to allow the UKB to pursue \nsuch claims in an action in the Court of Federal Claims. In addition, \nthe Justice Department suggested that H.R. 3534 be amended to reserve \nsome portion of the settlement proceeds until any claims that can be \nraised by the UKB are fully and finally litigated.\n  I am pleased to report that a compromise was reached on this issue. \nLike any compromise, everyone had to give something up in order for us \nto move forward. In that regard, I would like to express my \nappreciation to all of those who have worked so hard on this \ncompromise.\n  Under the proposed amendment to H.R. 3534 that is before the Senate, \nall tribal claims concerning Arkansas riverbed land are resolved \nthrough proceedings in the Court of Federal Claims or through the \nsettlement incorporated in H.R. 3534. This allows the United States \nCongress to remove the threat of quiet title actions brought by or on \nbehalf of an Indian tribe claiming title to land based on the Supreme \nCourt's decision. In other words, the UKB and each of the other tribes \nhave agreed to allow their claims to the riverbed to be addressed \nthrough the process established by H.R. 3534. In return, the UKB has \nasked that 10% of the settlement fund established by the bill will be \naside to satisfy any of the UKB's claims if the tribe is ultimately \nsuccessful in the Court of Federal Claims. In addition, if this amount \nis not sufficient to satisfy any judgment awarded to the tribe, the \npermanent judgment appropriation, section 1304 of title 31, is \nexplicitly made available to satisfy the remainder of any judgment \namount awarded to the UKB.\n  The UKB has also requested one additional consideration. The UKB \nrecognizes that the purpose of the legislation is to preclude the \nTribe from bringing or asking the United States to bring a lawsuit \nmaking a direct claim that asserts right, title, or an interest in \nArkansas riverbed arising out of the Supreme Court's opinion. However, \nthe Tribe wishes to make it clear that nothing in H.R. 3534 is intended \nor is to be construed to address, resolve, or prejudice the underlying \nbasis of a claim that they would have been able to make if H.R. 3534 \nwas not enacted. In other words, the UKB have asked that the \nlegislation include a provision to make it clear that H.R. 3534 does \nnot alter the character, nature, or basis of any claim or right that \nthe tribe could have made before the effective date of this \nlegislation. We have done so.\n\n  I wish to express my appreciation for the assistance of the Chairman \nof the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator Inouye, who has provided \nimportant procedural assistance to allow the bill to be moved \nexpeditiously now that we have an agreement between all of the Indian \ntribes and the Departments of Interior and Justice.\n  In addition, I wish to acknowledge the good work of Senator Campbell, \nthe vice chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, who deserves a great \ndeal of the credit for bringing the final compromise on this matter to \nfruition. With that in mind, I would like to briefly engage in a \ncolloquy with him on this final compromise.\n  Does the vice chairman agree that section 9 of the proposed amendment \nensures that the law will only be construed to preclude claims for \ntitle to the Arkansas riverbed lands either by the UKB or on its \nbehalf; or from the UKB requesting that the Federal government bring \nsuch claims?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Based on the Senator's answer to my last question, it is \nclear that the UKB will no longer be able to make a claim to the \nriverbed lands. However, the bill still provides a means for the UKB to \nraise the riverbed claims it might otherwise have brought, but it now \ndirects that they must pursue these claims exclusively in the manner \nprovided in H.R. 3534; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. By including section 9, Congress is making it clear that \nother than this change in forums for riverbed matters, it is not \nCongress's intent to express any opinion or have any effect on the \nclaims the UKB might bring. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. That is correct. To my knowledge, Congress has not \nreviewed or considered these claims. Furthermore, it is not necessary \nfor Congress to do because the bill does not address the individual \nclaims of the UKB, it merely ensures that the Tribe's claims to the \nriverbed are only pursued in the manner provided in H.R. 3534. Section \n9 is included to make it clear that the bill is not to be construed to \naddress the merits of any particular claim by the UKB; instead the bill \nis only concerned with how those riverbed claims may be pursued.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator for his assistance in this very \nimportant matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11725-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11725-S11727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SMALL WEBCASTER SETTLEMENT ACT OF 2002\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking the \nimportant step of passing the Helms-Leahy substitute amendment to H.R. \n5469, the ``Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002.'' This legislation \nreflects hard choices made in hard negotiations under hard \ncircumstances. I commend House Judiciary Chairman Sensen-\nbrenner and Representative Conyers for bringing this legislation to a \nsuccessful conclusion and passage in the House of Representatives in a \ntimely fashion to make a difference in the prospects of many small \nwebcasters. I also thank Senator Helms and his staff for working \nconstructively in the lame duck session of this Congress to get the \nbill done.\n  The Internet is an American invention that has become the emblem of \nthe Information Age and an engine for bringing American content into \nhomes and businesses around the globe. I have long been an enthusiast \nand champion of the Internet and of the creative spirits who are the \nsource of the music, films, books, news, and entertainment\n\n[[Page S11726]]\n\ncontent that enrich our lives, energize our economy and influence our \nculture. As a citizen, I am impressed by the innovation of new online \nentrepreneurs, and as a Senator, I want to do everything possible to \npromote the full realization of the Internet's potential. A flourishing \nInternet with clear, fair and enforceable rules governing how content \nmay be used will benefit all of us, including the entrepreneurs who \nwant us to become new customers and the artists who create the content \nwe value.\n  The advent of webcasting, streaming music online rather than \nbroadcasting it over the air as traditional radio stations do, has \nmarked one of the more exciting and quickly growing of the new \nindustries that have sprung up on the Web. Many of the new webcasters, \nunconstrained by the technological limitations of traditional radio \ntransmission, can and do serve listeners across the country and around \nthe world. They provide music in specialized niches not available over \nthe air. They feature new and fringe artists who do not enjoy the few \nspots in the Top 40. And they can bring music of all types to listeners \nwho, for whatever reason, are not being catered to by traditional \nbroadcasters.\n  We have been mindful on the Judiciary Committee that as the Internet \nis a boon to customers, we must not neglect the artists who create and \nthe businesses which produce the digital works that make the online \nworld so fascinating and worth visiting. With each legislative effort \nto provide clear, fair and enforceable intellectual property rules for \nthe Internet, a fundamental principle to which we have adhered is that \nartists and producers of digital works merit compensation for the value \nderived from the use of their work.\n  In 1995, we enacted the Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings \nAct, which created an intellectual property right in digital sound \nrecordings, giving copyright owners the right to receive royalties when \ntheir copyrighted sound recordings were digitally transmitted by \nothers. Therefore when their copyrighted sound recordings are digitally \ntransmitted, royalties are due. In the 1998 Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act, DMCA, we made clear that this law applied to webcasters \nand that they would have to pay these royalties. At the same time, we \ncreated a compulsory license so that webcasters could be sure of the \nuse of these digital works. We directed that the appropriate royalty \nrate could be negotiated by the parties or determined by a Copyright \nArbitration Royalty Panel, or CARP, at the Library of Congress.\n\n  Despite some privately negotiated agreements, no industry-wide \nagreement on royalty rates was reached and therefore a CARP proceeding \nwas instituted that concluded on February 20, 2002. The CARP decision \nset the royalty rate to be paid by commercial webcasters, no matter \ntheir size, at .14 cents per song per listener, with royalty payments \nretroactive to October 1998, when the DMCA was passed.\n  At a Judiciary Committee hearing I convened on this issue on May 15, \n2002, nobody seemed happy with the outcome of the arbitration and, in \nfact, all the parties appealed. The recording industry and artist \nrepresentatives feel that the royalty rate, which was based on the \nnumber of performances and listeners, rather than on a percentage-of-\nrevenue model, was too low to adequately compensate the creative \nefforts of the artists and the financial investments of the labels. \nMany webcasters declared that the per-performance approach, and the \nrate attached to it, would bankrupt small operations and drain the \nlarge ones. I said then that such an outcome would be highly \nunfortunate not only for the webcasters but also for the artists, the \nlabels and the consumers, who all would lose important legitimate \nchannels to connect music and music lovers online.\n  On appeal, the Librarian in June 2002, cut the rate in half, to .07 \ncents per song per listener for commercial webcasters. Nevertheless, \nmany webcasters, who had been operating during the four year period \nbetween 1998 and 2002, were taken by surprise at the amount of their \nroyalty liability. The retroactive fees were to be paid in full by \nOctober 20 and would have resulted in many small webcasters in \nparticular, going out of business.\n  In order to avoid many webcasting streams going silent on October 20, \nwhen retroactive royalty payments were due, I urged all sides to avoid \nmore expense and time and reach a negotiated outcome more satisfactory \nto all participants than the Librarian's decision. I also monitored \nclosely the progress of negotiations between the RIAA and webcasters. \nOn July 31, I sent a letter with Senator Hatch to Sound Exchange, which \nwas created by the RIAA to act as the agent for copyright holders in \nnegotiating the voluntary licenses with webcasters under the DMCA and \nto serve as the receiving agent for royalties under the CARP process. \nThe letter posed questions on the status of the reported on-going \nnegotiations between RIAA/Sound Exchange and the smaller webcasters, \nthe terms being proposed and considered, and how likely the outcome of \nthose negotiations would be to produce viable deals for smaller \nwebcasters, while still satisfying the copyright community.\n  Reports on the progress of these negotiations were disappointing, \nwhich makes this legislation all the more important. As a general \nprinciple, marketplace negotiations are the appropriate mechanism for \ndetermining the allocation of compensation among interested parties \nunder copyright law. Yet, we have made exceptions to this general \nprinciple, as reflected in this legislation and the very compulsory \nlicense provisions it amends.\n  The legislation reflects a compromise for all the parties directly \naffected by this legislation--small webcasters, noncommercial \nwebcasters, and hobbyists that could not survive with the rates set by \nthe Librarian, and copyright owners and performers who under this bill \nwill give certain eligible webcasters an alternative royalty payment \nscheme. this legislation does not represent a complete victory for any \nof these stakeholders. Artists and music labels may believe that they \nare foregoing significant royalties under this legislation and I \nappreciate that there are those in the webcasting business, who are \neither not covered or not sufficiently helped by the bill, who believe \nthat this legislation should do more. As one analyst the Radio and \nInternet Newsletter stated, in the October 11, 2002 issue, ``Clearly, \nthe `Small Webcaster Amendments Act of 2002' a/k/a H.R. 5469 is an \nimperfect bill that doesn't fix everything for everybody; Still, \noverall, does it do more good than harm for more people? My belief is \nthat many are helped one way or the other and virtually no one is \nassured of being hurt. Thus, the answer, the whole, would be yes.''\n  I know that most webcasters share my belief that artists and labels \nshould be fairly compensated for the use of their creative works. This \nlegislation provides both compensation to the copyright owners and \nhelps to support the webcasting industry by offering more variable \npayment options to small webcasters than the one-size-firts-all per \nperformance rate set out in the original CARP and Librarian decisions. \nThe rates, terms and record-keeping provisions are applicable only to \nthe parties that qualify for and elect to be governed by this \nalternative royalty structure and no broad principles should be \nextrapolated from the rates, terms and record-keeping provisions \ncontained in the bill. The Copyright Office is presently engaged in a \nrule-making on record-keeping and this bill does not supplant that \nongoing process.\n  After the House passed H.R. 5469 on October 7, 2002, I have worked \nwith Senator Hatch to clear the bill for passage through the Senate and \naddress concerns raised on both sides of the aisle. While the bill was \nfinally cleared for passage by all the Democratic Senators on October \n17, passage of the legislation was blocked before the lame-duck \nsession. I am pleased to have worked with Senator Helms on a substitute \nthat resolves some of the concerns raised about the original House-\npassed bill.\n  The Helms-Leahy substitute makes the following changes in H.R. 5469:\n  First, it authorizes SoundExchange to enter into agreements with \ngroups representing small webcasters and noncommercial webcasters. Such \nagreements will be available generally to any party which qualifies \nunder their terms as an option to the rates adopted by the Copyright \nOffice. The rates and terms of such agreements will be binding on all \ncopyright holders once the\n\n[[Page S11727]]\n\nagreement has been published in the Federal Register by the Copyright \nOffice. Such deals are authorized to cover the retroactive fees, as \nwell as those going forward.\n  Second, the substitute amendment imposes a 6 month moratorium on fee \ncollections from noncommercial entities, to allow for negotiations with \nsuch entities. This provision is particularly important for \nnoncommercial webcasters, such as those operating at colleges and \nuniversities. The Librarian's decision contained an anomaly under which \nnonprofit entities that held FCC licenses were given a lower per \nperformance rate than were commercial entities, but no such provision \nwas made for noncommercial entities that were not FCC licensees. The \nbill provides a moratorium on the collection of royalties in order for \nan alternative agreement to be reached.\n\n  It also authorizes Sound Exchange to postpone retroactive royalty \ncollections from small webcasters with whom it is negotiating deals. \nThe original House-passed bill recognized the retroactive burden on \nmany of the small commercial webcasters by allowing them to make their \npayments based on a percentage of revenue or percentage of expense, but \nalso allows both small commercial and noncommercial webcasters to pay \nthese retroactive fees in three payments over he span of a year.\n  Third, the substitute amendment adopts language making clear that \nsuch deals are not precedent in any judicial proceeding or in future \nCARPs.\n  Fourth, the substitute amendment provides for direct payment to \nartists and deductibility of expenses from the proceeds of the \nroyalties.\n  Finally, the substitute amendment authorizes a GAO/Copyright Office \nstudy on the impact of agreements between third parties and webcasters \nand the effect that such agreements should have on percentage of \nexpense royalty rates. This authorization does not contain any \npreliminary findings or sense of the Congress language as to how such \nstudy should be resolved.\n  The agreement to be negotiated between Sound Exchange and small \nwebcasters will likely reflect the rates and terms set forth in the \noriginal House-passed bill. These terms provide an option of paying a \npercentage of revenue and stay in business. As one Vermont webcaster \ntold me, ``Although the percentage of revenue is too high, at least we \nhave the option. A percentage of revenue deal with enable [us] to stay \nin business moving forward, grow our audience, and compete.''\n  The Librarian of Congress royalty rate is based on a per performance \nformula, which has the unfortunate effect of requiring webcasters to \npay high fees for their use of music, even before the audience of the \nwebcaster has grown to a sufficient size to attract any appreciable \nadvertising revenues. Without any percentage of revenue option (as the \nlegislation allows), the webcasting industry would be closed to all but \nthose with the substantial resources necessary to subsidize the \nbusiness until the advertising revenues caught up to the per \nperformance royalty rate.\n  A number of concerns have been raised that the rate and terms of the \nagreements authorized under the substitute amendment do not constitute \nevidence of any rates, rate structure, fees, definitions, conditions or \nterms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace between a \nwilling buyer and willing seller. The concern stems from the DMCA's \nstatutory license fee standard directing the CARP to establish rates \nand terms ``that most clearly represent the rates and terms that would \nhave been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer and a \nwilling seller,'' rather than a determination of ``reasonable copyright \nroyalty rates'' according to a set of balancing factors. This new \nwebcasting standard may be having the unfortunate and unintended result \nthat webcasters and copyright owners are concerned that the rates and \nterms of any voluntary licensing agreements will be applied industry-\nwide. The new webcasting standard appears to be making all sides \ncautious and reluctant to enter into, rather than facilitating, \nvoluntary licensing agreements.\n  Passage of this legislation does not mean that our work is done. As \nthis webcasting issue has unfolded, I have heard complaints from all \nsides about the fairness and completeness of procedures employed in the \narbitration. Indeed, the concerns of many small webcasters were never \nheard, since the cost of participating in the proceedings was \nprohibitively expensive and their ability to participate for free was \nbarred by procedural rules. One thing is clear: Compulsory licenses are \nno panacea and their implementation may only invite more congressional \nintervention. To avoid repeated requests for the Congress or the courts \nto intercede, we must make sure the procedures and standards used to \nestablish the royalty rates for the webcasting and other compulsory \nlicenses produce fair, workable results. Next year, we should focus \nattention on reforming the CARP process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11727-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11727-S11728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n IN CELEBRATION OF THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF CAB CALLOWAY SCHOOL OF THE \n                      ARTS IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 10th \nanniversary of the Cab Calloway School of the Arts in Wilmington, the \nfirst public arts school in the State of Delaware. Since the late Cab \nCalloway cut the ribbon for the school's grand opening on November 23, \n1992, the school has expanded from a small middle school with vocal \ndetractors to an overwhelmingly successful experiment in public school \nchoice, boasting an enrollment of 760 6th to 12th graders. If their \nfirst decade is any indication of what they will offer in the future, \nwe have much to look forward to.\n  Cab Calloway School of the Arts works to provide young people from \ndiverse backgrounds with intensive training in the arts and a \ncomprehensive academic curriculum that will prepare them for success in \nhigher education and employment. They are succeeding.\n  The school's halls are filled with talented faculty, skilled \nsupervisors, and dedicated staff. Its students have been awarded \nnumerous accolades and recognition for their art, writing, theatre, \nacademics, vocal and band performances, as well as academics.\n  Cab Calloway's students continue to defy the odds, meeting or \nexceeding our State's standards in reading, writing and math. Last \nyear, the school's 10th graders ranked among the very highest in the \nState in reading and writing comprehension. Mixing academics with \nfreedom of expression and strong parental support has boosted their \nstudents' self-confidence and given us all something to feel good \nabout.\n  When I served as Governor of Delaware, Cab Calloway's students \nperformed, at my request, at the Hotel DuPont for the Governor's \nNational Association. They helped me celebrate my second inauguration \nas Governor at the Wilmington Grand Opera House and have since been \nnamed to the Governor's School of Excellence. They continue to make me \nproud.\n  Cab Calloway School of the Arts has represented the State of Delaware \nat The Kennedy Center in Washington DC, and its students have performed \nat the Delaware Mentoring Council Celebrations in Wilmington and Dover, \nattended by GEN. Colin Powell.\n  These days I work closely with Hillary Clinton in the Senate. When I \nbrought her to tour the Cab Calloway School of the Arts in 1996, she \nwas our First Lady, and I made sure that a tour showcasing the best of \nDelaware included the innovative school. We talked about the importance \nof school choice and the inroads made possible by a school dedicated to \nproviding a cultural and academic experience that instills character \nand a greater appreciation of the arts.\n  As Governor of Delaware, and now as Senator, I have shared with \npeople across America the story of Cab's success. I tell them about \nteachers such as Marty Lassman, who daily demonstrate unparalleled \ncommitment and patience, the support staff that is there when needed, \nthe students who again and again exceed expectations, and the parents \nand family members who understand they have an obligation to be full \npartners in the education of their children. Together, they serve as an \ninspiration and an example to communities across the country.\n\n[[Page S11728]]\n\n  Delaware is a small State, but we are building a growing record of \nachievement in public school education. Statewide, scores have again \nincreased in all grades and across the board in reading and math, as we \nbegin to close the achievement gap.\n  Much of what we have accomplished in Delaware, and at the Cab \nCalloway School of the Arts, serves as a model for our Nation.\n  I thank the staff and students of the school, both past and present, \nfor their efforts to create a more meaningful experience for our \nstudents, and I wish Cab Calloway School of the Arts a very happy 10th \nanniversary.\n  I rise today to offer my full support to future generations of \nstudents and educators at Cab Calloway School of the Arts and \ncongratulate this extraordinary school on a remarkable decade of \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11728-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING NATHANIEL BANKSTON UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. DASCHLE.

His dedication to ``getting the job done'' \ncauses him to reach out to both all parties, regardless of affiliation. \nHe is a respected member of the community, having served as president \nof the Louisiana Registrars of Voters Associations, member on the Board \nof Trustees of the Louisiana Registrars of Voters Retirement System, \nand president of the East Baton Rouge Parish Board of Election \nSupervisors. He is a lifelong resident of Louisiana, having graduated \nfrom southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond, LA, in 1972.\n  He has spent his entire life striving to make Louisiana a better \nplace, and it is with a heavy heart that I see him retire.

Mr. Cohen began a pizza \nbusiness by purchasing his first Arni's restaurant in 1965. Through a \nmixture of expansions and franchising, Mr. Cohen embodied the principle \nof free enterprise by populating 13 different cities in Indiana with \nnearly two dozen of his restaurants. Mr. Cohen's undying love for his \ncommunity and baseball prompted him to create a softball league for the \ncommunity of West Lafayette, where he played with and managed the team. \nAlways a community-minded individual, Arni Cohen also offered his \nrestaurants to upstart musicians and comedians, allowing them to pave \ntheir way into show business. Mr. Cohen's years in the Army and his \nyears as a city council member illustrate his commitment to serving his \ncountry and community.\n  Family and friends remember Arni Cohen as a charitable person, always \nsmiling, and eager to offer a kind word to everyone. Mr. Cohen loved \nhis community, honorably serving it for 37 years. His dedication and \nkindness to his community are a credit to his family and to the State \nof Indiana.\n  It is my privilege to pay tribute to Arni Cohen for his commitment \nand service by honoring him in the official record of the Senate. I \nsend my heartfelt condolences to his family, friends, and the community \nof West Lafayette.\n  When I reflect upon the lives of men such as Arni Cohen, who \ndedicated his life to serving others, I am reminded of the principles \nof public service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11728-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         RETIREMENT OF RON KING\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

The DOE Idaho \nOperations Office oversees manangement of the Idaho National \nEngineering and Environmental Laboratory, INEEL, and for almost 10 \nyears Ron has served, with distinction, as the director of \ncommunications.\n  Ron's service to his country began with a career in United States \nNavy, which included various intelligence and administrative positions. \nAfter retiring from the U.S. Navy in 1979, Ron continued to work with \nthe Navy as a Government and contractor employee. Ron's public service \nculminated with his service to the Department of Energy with posting in \nMontana and Idaho.\n  As Director of Communications, Ron served as the interface between \nthe DOE and various stakeholders such as State of Idaho officials, the \nIdaho congressional delegation, tribal governments, community groups, \nacademic institutions and media outlets.

Further, failing to pass H.R. 333, the \nversion of bankruptcy reform that the House did pass last Friday was \nnot taken up for Senate consideration this past week for several \nreasons. However there are much needed reforms in the bankruptcy bill \nand one in particular that I would like to discuss today.\n  It is my understanding that the final bill passed by the House did \ncontain a number of technical corrections that were agreed to on a \nbipartisan, bicameral basis after inadvertent drafting errors were \ndiscovered following the conclusion of the work of the conference \ncommittee on H.R. 333. One such error involved the effective date \nprovision of section 1234. Section 1234 was not a new provision of law \nbut a reiteration of current law. This section made clear that a claim \nthat is in bona fide dispute over the existence of liability, or the \namount of that liability, cannot be used as the basis for bringing an \ninvoluntary bankruptcy action. This clarification is consistent with \nthe 1984 legislative history of this portion of Section 303 of the \nBankruptcy Code. It also tracks the decisions of all five Courts of \nAppeal that have ruled on the bona fide dispute bar to the bringing of \ninvoluntary bankruptcy actions.\n  Section 1234 restated and strengthened congressional intent that an \ninvoluntary bankruptcy action should not be employed by litigants \nseeking to gain more leverage than they would have if they disputed \ncontract performance in the proper judicial forum. The respondent in a \nbona fide dispute over liability for a claim or the amount thereof \nshould not be disadvantaged by the stigma and expense of an involuntary \nbankruptcy proceeding, nor should our overcrowded bankruptcy courts be \nburdened with such disputes. In as much as section 1234 restated \nexisting law, it was given immediate effect upon enactment--but, due to \na drafting error, it would not have applied to cases now pending before \nthe bankruptcy courts. This mistake would have had a particularly \nperverse effect in the five Federal circuits that have correctly ruled \nthat bona fide dispute standard applies to both liability and the \namount thereof; no circuit court has reached a contrary conclusion.\n  As soon as the conferees became aware of this mistake, they worked to \nfashion a correction contained in a concurrent resolution to be adopted \nsimultaneously with the conference report. That and other enrolling \nchanges were incorporated in the bankruptcy bill passed by the House \nlast Friday. The involuntary bankruptcy provision was contained in \nsection 1233 of that measure, which stated that ``This section and the \namendments made by this\n\n[[Page S11729]]\n\nsection shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and \nshall apply with respect to cases commenced under Title 11 of the \nUnited States Code before, on, and after such a date.''\n  As the author of both the 1984 amendment that established the bona \nfide dispute proviso of section 303 of the Code and 2001 Senate \namendment that became section 1234 of the conference report and section \n1233 of the House-passed bill, I intend to seek to secure the same \nclarification and reiteration of current law in the 108th \nCongress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11729-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. LEON Y. SADLER, III\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ncongratulations to Dr. Leon Y. Sadler, III, originally of Camden, AL, \nnow of Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for his receipt of the Outstanding \nCommitment to Teaching Award given by the University of Alabama.\n  Dr. Sadler comes from a well respected Wilcox County family who for \ngenerations have provided the area with leadership. His grandfather, \nMr. ``Duck'' Sadler was a superb businessman, and farmer. Indeed, my \nfather purchased his International Harvester dealership from him in the \nlate 1950s. Dr. Sadler's father was a brilliant lawyer who did superb \nlegal work for over a half century, operating from his modest office in \nCamden. Dr. Sadler's brother, Tom, graduated one year ahead of me at \nWilcox County High School, obtained his engineering degree from \nMassachusetts of Technology and, likewise, excelled in engineering.\n  Leon earned a B.S. in Engineering from Georgia Institute of \nTechnology, and his master's degree and Ph.D. at the University of \nAlabama. He joined the Department of Chemical Engineering at the \nUniversity of Alabama in 1978 after working for Olin Chemical \nCorporation and the United States Bureau of Mines. His publications are \nnumerous and his research has led to his being rewarded three patents. \nHe is also the recipient of numerous awards including Reichold-Shumaker \nProfessorship of Chemical Engineering; Department of Engineering 140th \nAnniversary Outstanding Fellow Award; Rau Beta Pi Outstanding College \nof Engineering Faculty Award and Alabama Society of Professional \nEngineers State of Alabama Engineering Educator of the Year for 2001, \nto name a few. His excellence as a teacher of chemical engineering is \nbest enunciated by one of his students who said about Leon:\n\n       Not only does he use his great technical skills to educate \n     his students to be better suited for industry, but he also \n     employs his personal skills to illustrate to students how to \n     be better suited for the ``real world.'' He never fails to \n     provide students with the means to learn, as well as the \n     tools to succeed in a competitive field.\n\n  I knew Leon as a student in the public schools of Wilcox County. He \ngraduated several years ahead of me. While a terrific student, Leon was \nalso a good basketball player. On one occasion, he undertook to coach a \ngroup of us who attended the Methodist Youth Fellowship in a basketball \nleague. In fact, we had an ecumenical Methodist Youth Fellowship, with \nPresbyterians and other church members attending. We thought he was a \nwonderful coach and that we would be a successful team. Unfortunately, \nhe had chosen by far the shortest team in the league and though we \nlearned much about the game, a winning season we did not have.\n  Leon married his high school classmate, Dana McNeil, a wonderful and \nsparkling person who maintained a successful career in real estate. She \nhas been his loving partner throughout their marriage of many years. \nThey have two wonderful sons, Leon IV and Cobb.\n  In recent years, I had the chance to reestablish a close relationship \nwith Leon and Dana. Spending time with them has been a most pleasant \nexperience. He and Dana have had me stay with them in their fine home \nin Tuscaloosa and treated me with genuine hospitality. I have cherished \nthose visits and our talks about friends and family and our roots. In \nthis highly mobile world, it is important that we stay close to our \nfriends and to our heritage.\n  Everyone has such a great love and affection for Leon. Though \nbrilliant and dedicated, he never lost his humility and humanity. \nPeople love him and love being with him. His friends are many and very, \nvery loyal--just as he is to them.\n  Leon is now suffering an erosion of his physical abilities as the \nresult of the progression of Lou Gehrig's disease. I visited him, Dana \nand Jim Wilburn recently and enjoyed it greatly. Among other things, we \ntalked of my re-election effort which was just a few weeks off. Leon, \nnow unable to speak, with a smile on his face, wrote on his small \nerasable board the words, ``You're going to win.'' That was an \nencouraging comment and, as it turned out, he was correct.\n  Leon Y. Sadler, III has achieved excellence in a rigorous and \ndemanding specialty, Assistant Professor of Chemical Engineering. He \nhas been a blessing to his fellow man. He has remembered his roots and \nfriends from Wilcox County. He loves his wife and family and is proud \nof all their accomplishments. To an unusual degree, he loves America, \nunderstands her greatness, keeps up with current affairs, and does all \nhe can to keep her on the right path.\n  Teachers are important people. In addition to their professional \nexcellence, teachers help young people learn how to live--in the words \nof his student, ``. . . how to be better suited for the `real world' \n''. Indeed. I extend my congratulations to Dr. Sadler for this \nimportant teaching award, presented by one of the great universities in \nthe world, the University of Alabama. The presentation of the award on \nSeptember 18, 2002, brought credit on both Dr. Sadler and the \nUniversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11729-2", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING REVEREND HAROLD JONES\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am saddened to report the \npassing of one of South Dakota's most exceptional spiritual leaders, \nRev. Harold Jones.\n  Harold was the first Native American to serve as a bishop in a \nChristian denomination. He was a widely respected leader, and was \ngreatly admired by his peers for his dedication to the people he served \nand guided. His tremendous contributions to the community and \ngroundbreaking achievements set him apart from other outstanding \nspiritual leaders.\n  Born in 1909 and raised on the Santee Reservation in Nebraska, Harold \nlost his parents at an early age and was raised by his grandparents, \nwho brought him up as a Christian. He attended school at Seabury-\nWestern Seminary in Illinois. After graduating, Harold spent 13 years \nat the Pine Ridge Mission and 12 years at Holy Trinity Parish in \nWahpeton, ND. He also served at the Cheyenne River Agency, Gettysburg, \nDupree, Pine Ridge, and Rapid City, SD and Fort Defiance, AZ. Harold \nwas consecrated as a bishop suffragan of the Episcopal Diocese of South \nDakota on January 11, 1972. The ecumenical ceremony was witnessed by \n1,000 people in the Catholic Church's St. Joseph Cathedral in Sioux \nFalls.\n  As a Native American, Harold's entry into the church did not occur \nwithout controversy and prejudice. While at seminary school in \nIllinois, Harold earned money by giving talks about life on South \nDakota Indian reservations to churches in the Chicago area. Outside \nthese churches signs often read, ``Come this Sunday and see a live \nIndian!'' Never deterred from following his chosen path, Harold \novercame the misconceptions and prejudices of others to become one of \nthe most respected and revered bishops in the country.\n  Harold's dedication to helping others serves as his greatest legacy. \nHis work continues to inspire all those who knew him. Our Nation and \nSouth Dakota are far better places because of Harold's life, and while \nwe miss him very much, the best way to honor his life is to emulate the \nlove and support he shared with others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11729-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11729-S11730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE LIFE OF JANET ADAMS VIGGIANI\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlate Janet Adams Viggiani--a native of Connecticut. I have known the \nViggiani family for many years as residents of our native State, as \nneighbors in East Haddam, and as friends. Janet became a strong \nadvocate for the public interest, an accomplished attorney, and an \neducator,\n\n[[Page S11730]]\n\nwho dedicated her professional life to helping young people and to \nmaking our Nation a more just and equitable land.\n  Born in Middletown, CT, Janet spent her early years in the Nutmeg \nState. After graduating summa cum laude from Smith College, she began \nwhat would become a lifetime of work motivated by a deep desire to \nserve others, particularly those who struggled mightily to overcome \nenormous adversity in their lives--such as illness, criminal abuse, and \ndiscrimination. She worked for the Nine To Five Organization for Women \nWorkers in Boston and for Brigham and Women's Hospital. She cofounded \nthe Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group, which has done so \nmuch to protect the rights and interests of working families. She also \ncofounded the New England Sexual Assault Network, which provided \nsupport for victims of some of society's most heinous crimes. Janet \nbecame assistant director of Radcliffe College's Career Services \nCenter, where she provided guidance to students searching for \nmeaningful careers. While working for her doctorate at the Harvard \nSchool of Education, Janet was named an assistant dean at Harvard \nCollege in 1988. She spent 3 years advising the college administration \non sexual harassment, sexual assault, tutor training, and gender \nequality issues in the classroom.\n  In 1996, Janet obtained a law degree from Harvard. After working on a \nvariety of employment discrimination cases in the private sector, Janet \nwas able to combine her love of law and education by taking a position \nat Simmons College, where she served as a legal counsel to the \npresident. In this capacity, Janet dealt with a variety of legal \nissues, including employment, gender and racial discrimination, \nintellectual property, and other student affairs.\n  Janet was taken from us too soon, but she touched the lives of many \npeople throughout her life. Her dedication to making our world a better \nplace inspired many people and serves as an example for all of us to \nfollow. My thoughts and prayers are with Janet's friends and family, \nparticularly with her parents, Carl and Jane of East Haddam, CT, her \nsister Frances, and her brother Carl. She will be deeply missed by all \nwho knew her.\n  Mr. President, I would like to submit for the Record an article \nwritten about Janet that appeared several days ago in the Middletown \nPress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Janet Viggiani\n\n       Janet Adams Viggiani, a lawyer, educator, human rights \n     advocate and former assistant dean for coeducation at Harvard \n     College, died at her home in Mancos, Colorado on Friday, \n     November 8, after a long illness. She was 48.\n       A co-founder of Massachusetts PIRG (Public Interest \n     Research Group) and the New England Sexual Assault Network, \n     she was named assistant dean at Harvard College in 1988 while \n     working for her doctorate at the Harvard School of Education. \n     As a dean, she dealt with issues of concern to women, sexual \n     harassment and assault, training of teaching fellows and \n     resident tutors in related matters, and advising the dean of \n     the college and the Harvard administrative board on policy \n     and procedure in these areas.\n       She was born in Middletown, Conn. October 15 1954, the \n     second child of Jane Mead Viggiani and Carl A. Viggiani, \n     professor of Romance languages and literature at Wesleyan \n     University. She spent her young years in nearby Middle Haddam \n     and attended East Hampton High School, where her career in \n     law was foreshadowed by her passionate public defense of \n     Black students unjustly accused of provoking violence in a \n     racial dispute. She completed high school at the Buxton \n     School in Mass.\n       After graduating from Smith College summa cum laude in \n     1978, she worked for the Nine-to-Five Organization for Women \n     Workers in Boston, for Brigham and Women's Hospital and for \n     Radcliffe Career Services as a counselor and then assistant \n     director.\n       At Harvard, in addition to her deanship, she held the post \n     of Allston Burr Senior Tutor of the college's Adams House, \n     where she was responsible for many aspects of the lives and \n     studies of 420 Harvard undergraduates.\n       In 1991, she received the degree of doctor education from \n     Harvard. However, the same year marked the onset of a cancer \n     that was to recur. Not knowing what the future held, she \n     bought a car and traveled across America for almost a year.\n       In the fall of 1993, with the cancer in remission, she \n     began a new career by entering Harvard Law School. She \n     received her law degree in 1996, passed the state bar, and \n     took a job with the Boston law firm of Hill & Barlow, where \n     she specialized in discrimination and employment law.\n       In 1999, she accepted an invitation from Simmons College \n     President Daniel Cheever to come to Simmons as the college \n     counsel and assistant to the president. In the educational \n     environment she enjoyed, she dealt with a wide range of legal \n     issues ranging from employment, student affairs and \n     intellectual property, to probate and criminal law.\n       In her year of travel across the country, she had \n     discovered the peace and beauty of the southwest corner of \n     Colorado. When the recurrence of cancer forced her retirement \n     from Simmons in 2001, she returned to that area and rented a \n     house in a pine forest where she spent her last year. She \n     remained active until the final weeks of her life, even \n     hiking at 13,000 feet in the nearby Rockies.\n       She is survived by her parents, of East Haddam; a sister, \n     Frances A. Viggiani of Brooklyn, New York; and a brother, \n     Carl A. Viggiani, Jr. of White Plains, New York.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11730-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11730-S11731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO ARMAND DERFNER\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we have numerous inspirations in \nour Charleston, SC, community, but finally one unsung hero was heralded \nin the Post and Courier article this past Saturday. Armand Derfner \nspent his life fighting for the underdog, dedicated to civil rights. As \na child of the Holocaust, his story is particularly inspirational. I \nask unanimous consent to print the article in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Post and Courier, Nov. 16, 2002]\n\n  Attorney's Lifelong Passion To Defend Underdog Has Taken Him to the \n                         Nation's Highest Court\n\n                       (By Jennifer Berry Hawes)\n\n       It's telling enough that Armand Derfner would win a \n     prestigious national award that honors an attorney who has \n     most contributed to the public interest in a precedent-\n     setting case.\n       What's just as telling: Derfner missed the fancy, Oscar-\n     like ceremony to get it.\n       Derfner and his wife, Mary Giles, were sitting on a tarmac \n     in Charleston because their flight was delayed.\n       Of course, he had a defense for cutting it too close. He \n     couldn't miss cross-examining a witness the day before. \n     Besides, Derfner just isn't a man of pomp.\n       The honor is called the 2002 Trial Lawyer of the Year \n     Award. It was given the summer by the Trial Lawyers for \n     Public Justice.\n       Derfner and three other attorneys were honored for this \n     year's huge settlement of their 27-year class-action lawsuit \n     over Mississippi's treatment of the state's black college \n     students and its traditionally black universities.\n       The state settled for $513 million. Now, even the suit's \n     settlement is being disputed: ``It's still going on!'' \n     Derfner grins.\n       Such a draining, drawn-out conflict could tax many people. \n     But a good debate of any sort delights Derfner. It's why such \n     an ardent liberal can enjoy life in conservative Charleston. \n     ``Armand always goes against the wind,'' says his longtime \n     friend Martin Gold.\n       As a Jewish kid growing up in New York, Derfner's friends \n     backed the Brooklyn Dodgers.\n       Derfner cheered the Giants, the working man's team.\n       Call it an early showing of a lifelong passion for \n     defending the underdog, a passion he's taken to courtrooms \n     around the nation--namely the South--arguing Civil rights \n     cases, taking several to its highest court.\n       He's argued before the U.S. Supreme Court five times, and \n     won them all. He's won several more cases that he didn't have \n     to argue before the justices. He's also testified several \n     times before Congress.\n       But in his hometown Charleston, he's better known for \n     challenging County Council's at-large system of elections, \n     arguing that the system discriminates against black voters. \n     He also defended the Charleston 5 and argued that County \n     Council violated the Constitution by posting the Ten \n     Commandments.\n       They can be unpopular positions. It's why Derfner needs a \n     sense of humor to work in a place like this.\n       In his office at Broad and Church streets, his thick legal \n     texts and filing cabinets tower near a pinball machine. And \n     this is no respectable pinball machine. It features The Fonz \n     and a buxom, redheaded Pinky Tuscadero. Get him playing and \n     Derfner, in slacks and a tie, grins like a 12-year-old in an \n     arcade.\n       ``Stuffy, he's not,'' former partner Ray McClain says with \n     a laugh. ``He's not someone with the slightest trace of \n     arrogance or condescension.''\n       Nor is he shy with his opinions. In 1999, amid the battle \n     flag debate, Derfner wrote this letter to the editor: ``I \n     believe the Confederate flag should keep flying over the \n     state Capitol. It is a useful reminder about the people \n     inside, like a warning label on a hazardous product or a sign \n     at the zoo saying, ``Beware of the Animals.''\n       While Derfner has a lighter side, talk about his work and \n     he turns intense.\n\n[[Page S11731]]\n\n       On his office wall hangs a sketch of a white hand uplifting \n     a black one. In Hebrew and English, it reads, ``Thou shalt \n     not stand idly by.''\n       And stand by he hasn't.\n\n\n                             FLEEING HITLER\n\n       His Jewish family lived in Poland as Hitler came to power. \n     With the rise of Nazi control in 1936, his parents fled their \n     home with forged Swedish passports. They traveled through \n     Germany and on to France, where they settled in Paris.\n       In 1938, his mother gave birth to Armand, her first child. \n     During Derfner's first year of life, Hitler's aggression \n     escalated, and his troops expanded their control. The next \n     year, the Nazis invaded Poland.\n       His parents, foreseeing that Hitler would not stop there, \n     tried to get passports to the United States--but couldn't.\n       Finally, as the Nazis began to invade France, Derfner's \n     mother got the passports. His father raced to the U.S. \n     Consulate to get American visas. But the consulate was packed \n     up and the workers heading out. One worker still there broke \n     open a locked desk drawer and stamped the visas.\n       It was June 12, 1940, Derfner's second birthday.\n       They left Paris by train just hours before the Nazi troops \n     arrived. By June 14, Nazis occupied the city.\n       The Derfners fled south and stopped in Bordeaux. They \n     crossed by train into Spain and then to Portugal, where they \n     boarded a Greek ship, the Nea Hellas, on its way to New York.\n       Exactly one month later, on July 12, they landed in New \n     York.\n       Derfner grew up mostly in New York, surrounded by fellow \n     Jewish immigrants with similar family stories. Many older \n     people he knew had numbers tattooed on their forearms.\n       Derfner's parents never again saw their families in Poland. \n     ``Everyone was killed in concentration camps,'' he says, \n     turning emotional.\n       Years later, Derfner would sit with his mother to look at \n     family pictures. On a good day, she could make it through \n     four or five names before breaking down. ``Everyone she'd \n     ever known was gone.\n       ``In my family, there's always been this sense that there \n     is supposed to be justice in the world, and we're supposed to \n     help people get it,'' he says. Even before the Holocaust, his \n     father's family had gone to Palestine in the 1920s to fight \n     the British. ``Maybe it's a family tradition.''\n       Today, Derfner's younger brother, Larry, is a journalist in \n     Israel who covers the conflict there for U.S. News & World \n     Report and the Jerusalem Post, an English-language newspaper. \n     His sister, Suzanne, is a lawyer for children with \n     disabilities in California.\n       After growing up, Derfner got his undergraduate degree from \n     Princeton and then graduated from Yale Law School in 1963, \n     Derfner--and the nation--was focused on the civil rights \n     movement.\n       He was among those who headed into law ``as an engine for \n     social change,'' McClain says.\n       In college, Derfner clerked for the chief judge of a U.S. \n     court of appeals and then landed a job at Covington & \n     Burling, among the most prestigious firms in Washington, DC. \n     He began traveling to Mississippi for stints to work in civil \n     rights cases.\n       When a civil rights law group needed a full-time attorney, \n     he packed up and moved south. Soon after, in 1968, he argued \n     his first case before the U.S. Supreme Court, an early Voting \n     Rights Act case.\n       Derfner was just 29, a young liberal standing before the \n     court's renowned liberals, Earl Warren and Hugo Black, who \n     grilled him good.\n       ``They were giants then,'' he recalls. ``And it was such an \n     exciting experience, so exciting to see the court looking at \n     laws and consulting in a way I though was so good for the \n     country.''\n\n\n                            old mississippi\n\n       When he moved to Mississippi, he was joined by his first \n     wife, Mary Frances. They'd met in Washington. She was from an \n     old Charleston family named Legare, he was a New York son of \n     Jewish immigrants.\n       Different as they could have been, they shared a passion \n     for civil rights. And they were about to become partners in \n     risky work.\n       When Derfner landed in Mississippi in the late 1960s, a man \n     he didn't know greeted him at the airport. ``Hello, Mr. \n     Derfner.'' He was followed day and night. And he was \n     threatened. His dog was poisoned. He was arrested and jailed \n     for contempt of court.\n       And while driving down a highway with May Frances one day, \n     a bullet smashed through the passenger window beside her, \n     shattering it, but missing them.\n       ``It was definitely a war zone,'' he says. ``I had a lot of \n     friends who were shot at, so I wasn't surprised.''\n       Yet he never unlisted his phone number. And Mary Frances \n     remained active in the work with him. They stayed for three \n     years.\n       ``After a while, I could see that the work was so intense \n     and so unrelenting that it has an effect. I began to feel \n     like it was time to take a break.''\n       They returned to Washington for several years. He was \n     thrilled to work on hot national issues, but at times the \n     work was abstract, less personal than toiling in legal \n     trenches, working hands-on with clients who needed help.\n       And the couple wanted to start a family.\n       Yet Mary Frances suffered from juvenile diabetes. As a \n     teenager, her doctor had said that she would die young and \n     couldn't bear children. When they met, she'd already begun \n     to feel the terrible disease's effects but didn't believe \n     the doctor's dire prediction.\n       ``She was active while being sick,'' Derfner smiles. ``Her \n     life was a miracle, too.''\n       Mary Frances drove, even played baseball. And she wanted to \n     have children.\n       But they didn't want to raise them in Washington and \n     preferred to move south, closer to family and the civil \n     rights work they loved. Her aunt was lieutenant governor, and \n     her grandfather had been instrumental in restoring what \n     became Charles Towne Landing.\n       In 1974, they made the move. Their first son, Joel, was a \n     baby then. When Joel was born, doctors warned that he might \n     not live because he was so premature. But he did.\n       And after they moved to Charleston, the Derfners welcomed \n     their second son, Jeremy. Doctors again warned that the \n     newborn might not live. He also survived.\n       Today, both sons live in New York. Joel, a Porter-Graud \n     School valdictorian and Harvard summa cum laude graduate, \n     composes musical theater. ``I expect to see his name up in \n     lights one of these days,'' Derfner says, smiling proudly.\n       Jeremy, named Porter-Gaud's best all-around, graduated from \n     Brown University summa cum laude, wrote for Slate magazine \n     and now is pursuing this Ph.D. at Columbia University.\n       When he moved to Charleston, Derfner joined a firm here \n     with McCain and Frank Epstein working on civil rights and \n     workers' rights cases. Twice he served as South Carolina's \n     representative to the American Civil Liberties Union's \n     national board.\n       Despite his liberal views in Charleston, Derfner says he \n     never felt unwelcome. That may be thanks in part to his \n     synagogue involvement and Mary Frances' family roots here.\n       then in 1981, the Derfners returned to Washington for a \n     third time to pursue a chance to extend the Voting Rights \n     Act.\n       Derfner toiled from an office near the U.S. Capitol and \n     taught at American University. He worked closely with \n     Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy and clashed with his home \n     state's Sen. Storm Thurmond.\n       ``He could be legitimately called one of the two or three \n     most experienced and most effective attorneys in the area of \n     voting rights in the country,'' McClain says.\n       But the Derfners returned, again, to Charleston. Soon \n     after, around 1990, Mary Frances's diabetes ravaged her body.\n       She died in 1992 when she was just 45.\n       Joel was in college, and Jeremy in high school at Porter-\n     Graud. ``I think they were raising me,'' Derfner says, \n     looking back on the painful time.\n       McClain recalls the years Derfner cared for his wife.\n       ``He was very devoted,'' McClain says. ``He grieved quite \n     deeply for Mary Frances.''\n\n\n                              joy in life\n\n       But then, in the mid-1990s, Derfner met a woman named Mary \n     Giles. She worked at the S.C. Historical Society, which has \n     archived some of Derfner's papers.\n       He became intrigued by this warm woman who found a \n     fascinating life behind potentially dry documents. They began \n     to date.\n       They married in 2000. Today, she works as archivist for the \n     Catholic Diocese of Charleston.\n       Talking about her, Derfner grins big, like a boy with a \n     giant crush. She's clearly returned joy to his life.\n       ``She's an extraordinarily warm person,'' he says. ``People \n     are bulldozed by how close you feel to her. I know I was.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11731-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11731-S11732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              ENROLLED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS SIGNED\n\n  At 1:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills and joint resolutions:\n\n       S. 1010.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for the \n     21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of American \n     volunteers abroad.\n       (2) The three goals codified in the Peace Corps Act which \n     have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, can work in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       (3) The Peace Corps has operated in 135 countries with \n     165,000 Peace Corps volunteers since its establishment.\n       (4) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows: to help people in developing nations meet basic \n     needs, to promote understanding of America's values and \n     ideals abroad, and to promote an understanding of other \n     peoples by Americans.\n       (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier international service \n     organization dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n       (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote peace, friendship, and international understanding.\n       (7) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n     no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should be used to \n     accomplish any other goal than the goals established by the \n     Peace Corps Act.\n       (8) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the talent pool of returned Peace Corps volunteers.\n       (9) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance.\n       (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service.\n       (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps shall not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       (14) In order to ensure that proposed expansion of the \n     Peace Corps preserves the integrity of the program and the \n     security of volunteers, the integrated Planning and Budget \n     System supported by the Office of Planning and Policy \n     Analysis should continue its focus on strategic planning.\n       (15) A streamlined, bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of\n\n[[Page S11737]]\n\n     distinguished returned Peace Corps volunteers and other \n     individuals, with diverse backgrounds and expertise, can be a \n     source of ideas and suggestions that may be useful to the \n     Director of the Peace Corps as he discharges his duties and \n     responsibilities as head of the agency.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nextend the availability of allotments for fiscal years 1998 through \n2001 under the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP); to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill improve and protect health insurance for out Nation's children. \nEarlier this year, I worked in a bipartisan manner to develop a \ncomprehensive proposal based on the basic and fundamental philosophy \nthat no child should go without needed health care. I was pleased at \nthat time to be joined by my good friends Senator Chafee, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Hatch to introduce the Children's Health Insurance \nImprovement and Protection Act of 2002.\n  Unfortunately, no action has been taken on that proposal and I am \nleft worrying that we will end the 107th session of Congress having \nforgotten our children. Therefore, I am introducing a proposal that \nwill at least protect the Children's Health Insurance Program for the \nnext 2 years.\n  The Children's Health Insurance Program, CHIP, has been an \nunqualified success. Last year, 4.6 million children were enrolled in \nCHIP and the percentage of children without health insurance has \ndeclined in recent years. In my State of West Virginia, the CHIP \nprogram provides health coverage to over 20,000 children. Health \ninsurance coverage is key to assuring children's access to appropriate \nand adequate health care, including preventive services. Research \ndemonstrates that uninsured children are more likely to lack a usual \nsource of care, to go without needed care, and to experience worse \nhealth outcomes than children with coverage. Uninsured children who are \ninjured are 30 percent less likely than insured children to receive \nmedical treatment and three times more likely not to get a needed \nprescription.\n  However, the continued success of the CHIP program is now in serious \njeopardy. On September 30 of this year $1.2 billion in unspent CHIP \nfunds was sent back to the General Treasury. In addition, some $1.5 \nbillion of these funds are projected to revert back to the Treasury \nnext September 30. If we do not act to protect this money for children \nand send money to the States that can use it, we will have failed our \nchildren. A 2-year fix is only a first step. There is more that we need \nto do. The Bush administration projects that 900,000 children will lose \ntheir health coverage between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, if Congress \ndoes not take appropriate action. This is because even as State \nenrollment and spending rapidly increases, Federal CHIP funding dropped \nby more than $1 billion this year and will be reduced in each of the \nnext 2 years. Known as the ``CHIP Dip,'' this reduction has no \nunderlying health policy justification; it was solely the result of the \nbudget compromises we had to make when enacting the balance budget deal \nin 1997.\n\n[[Page S11739]]\n\n  As a result, a number of States will have insufficient Federal \nfunding to sustain their enrollment and they will have no choice but to \nscale back or limit their CHIP programs. As enrollment is cut, the \nnumber of uninsured children will increase, and as a consequence, sick \nchildren will get sicker. The biggest problem that will result from \nenrollment cuts in the CHIP program are the future health problems of \nadults who as children could have received benefits under CHIP.\n  The bill I am introducing today is only a first step that we must \ntake this year. We need a comprehensive and reasonable approach to \nshore up CHIP financing in order to avert the devastating enrollment \ndecline and make sure that our children are protected into the future. \nWe need to put more money into this program. However, this legislation \nwill protect $1.2 billion that should be spent on children's health \ninsurance from being spent on roads and will put money in states that \ncan use it now to cover kids. It is the least we can do.\n  I urge Congress to enact this legislation and ensure the continued \nsuccess of the CHIP program and sustain the significant progress CHIP \nhas made in reducing the ranks of uninsured children. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3180\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 366\n\n       Whereas in November 2002, a number of government-controlled \n     television stations in Egypt began broadcasting a multi-part \n     series, ``Horseman Without a Horse'', based on the Protocols \n     of the Elders of Zion and conspiracy myths about Jewish \n     global domination;\n       Whereas the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are a notorious \n     forgery, written by Russian anti-Semites in the early 20th \n     century, which purport to reveal a plot for Jewish domination \n     of the world;\n       Whereas the Protocols of the Elders of Zion have been a \n     staple of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel propaganda for decades \n     and have long since been discredited by all reputable \n     scholars;\n       Whereas the broadcast of this series takes place in the \n     context of a sustained pattern of vitriolic anti-Semitic \n     commentary and depictions in the Egyptian government-\n     sponsored press, which has gone unanswered by the Government \n     of Egypt; and\n       Whereas the Department of State has urged Egypt and other \n     Arab states not to broadcast this program, saying ``We don't \n     think government TV stations should be broadcasting programs \n     that we consider racist and untrue'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns any publication or program that lends \n     legitimacy to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion;\n       (2) believes the use of such heinous propaganda, especially \n     in the Arab world, serves to incite popular sentiment against \n     Jewish people and the State of Israel rather than promoting \n     religious tolerance and preparing Arab populations for the \n     prospect of peace with Israel;\n       (3) commends the Department of State for its denunciation \n     of the ``Horseman Without a Horse'' television series and its \n     efforts to discourage Arab states from broadcasting it; and\n       (4) urges the Government of Egypt and other Arab \n     governments--\n\n[[Page S11741]]\n\n       (A) not to allow their government-controlled television \n     stations to broadcast this program or any other racist and \n     untrue material; and\n       (B) to speak out against such incitement by vigorously and \n     publicly condemning anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 367--RECOGNIZING THE COMMUNITY SERVICES OF ARCHIE \nEDWARDS BLUES HERITAGE FOUNDATION, DESIGNATING THE FORTNIGHT BEGINNING \n NOVEMBER 29, 2002, AS THE ``BLUES HERITAGE APPRECIATION FORTNIGHT'', \n     AND DESIGNATING FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 29, 2002, AS ``BLUES FRIDAY''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Barkley) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 367\n\n       Whereas Mr. Archie Edwards was a talented musician who \n     devoted his life to playing the blues and inspiring others to \n     learn and appreciate music;\n       Whereas Mr. Archie Edwards was a self-taught musician whose \n     music was acclaimed throughout the United States, Canada, and \n     Europe;\n       Whereas Mr. Archie Edwards, for 40 years, provided a haven \n     in the District of Columbia for all those who loved the blues \n     to play, listen, and socialize;\n       Whereas the Archie Edwards Blues Heritage Foundation is a \n     nonprofit organization dedicated to preserving Mr. Edwards' \n     memory and extending the positive influence of his music in \n     the Washington, D.C. community;\n       Whereas the Archie Edwards Blues Heritage Foundation is \n     committed to carrying on Mr. Edwards' legacy by maintaining \n     an open forum for people in the community to meet, learn, and \n     share the music he loved;\n       Whereas the Archie Edwards Blues Heritage Foundation \n     supports and expands community outreach programs that provide \n     entertainment and promote the blues to citizens in nursing \n     homes, schools, hospitals, and other venues; and\n       Whereas the Archie Edwards Blues Heritage Foundation \n     recognizes the importance that the blues has played in our \n     country's heritage and has preserved and promoted the blues \n     as a unique American art form: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the community services of the Archie Edwards \n     Blues Heritage Foundation;\n       (2) recognizes the importance of blues in the history of \n     American culture;\n       (3) designates the fortnight beginning November 29, 2002, \n     as the ``Blues Heritage Appreciation Fortnight''; and\n       (4) designates Friday, November 29, 2002, as ``Blues \n     Friday''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 368--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING \nTHE DECLINE OF WORLD COFFEE PRICES AND ITS IMPACT ON DEVELOPING NATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Specter, and Mrs. Feinstein) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 368\n\n       Whereas since 1997 the price of coffee has declined nearly \n     70 percent on the world market and has recently reached its \n     lowest level in a century;\n       Whereas the collapse of coffee prices has resulted in a \n     widespread humanitarian crisis for 25,000,000 coffee growers \n     and for more than 50 developing countries where coffee is a \n     critical source of rural employment and foreign exchange \n     earnings;\n       Whereas, according to a recent World Bank report, 600,000 \n     permanent and temporary coffee workers in Central America \n     have been left unemployed in the last two years;\n       Whereas the World Bank has referred to the coffee crisis as \n     ``the silent Mitch'', equating the impact of record-low \n     coffee prices upon Central American countries with the damage \n     done to such countries by Hurricane Mitch in 1998;\n       Whereas 6 of 14 immigrants who died in the Arizona desert \n     in May 2001 were small coffee farmers from Veracruz, Mexico;\n       Whereas The Washington Post, The New York Times, and The \n     Wall Street Journal report that cultivation of illicit crops \n     such as coca and opium poppy is increasing in traditional \n     coffee-growing countries, such as Colombia and Peru, which \n     have been adversely affected by low international coffee \n     prices;\n       Whereas the economies of some of the poorest countries in \n     the world, particularly those in Africa, are highly dependent \n     on trade in coffee;\n       Whereas coffee accounts for approximately 80 percent of \n     export revenues for Burundi, 54 percent of export revenues \n     for Ethiopia, 34 percent of export revenues for Uganda, and \n     31 percent of export revenues for Rwanda;\n       Whereas, according to the Oxfam International Report \n     ``Mugged: Poverty in your Coffee Cup'', in the Dak Lak \n     province of Vietnam, one of the lowest-cost coffee producers \n     in the world, the price farmers receive for their product \n     covers as little as 60 percent of their costs of production;\n       Whereas on February 1, 2002, the International Coffee \n     Organization (ICO) passed Resolution 407, which calls on \n     exporting member countries to observe minimum standards for \n     exportable coffee and to provide for the issuance of ICO \n     certificates of origin according to those standards and also \n     calls on importing member countries to ``make their best \n     endeavors to support the objectives of the programme'';\n       Whereas both the Speciality Coffee Association of America \n     (SCAA) and the National Coffee Association (NCA) support ICO \n     Resolution 407 and have publicly advocated for the United \n     States to rejoin the International Coffee Organization;\n       Whereas the United States Agency for International \n     Development (USAID) has already established coffee sector \n     assistance programs for Colombia, Bolivia, the Dominican \n     Republic, East Timor, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala, \n     Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Rwanda, Tanzania, \n     and Uganda; and\n       Whereas House Report 107-663, highlights the coffee price \n     crisis as a global issue and ``urges USAID to focus its rural \n     development and relief programs on regions severely affected \n     by the coffee crisis, especially in Colombia'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (A) the United States should adopt a global strategy to \n     respond to the coffee crisis with coordinated activities in \n     Latin America, Africa, and Asia to address the short-term \n     humanitarian needs and long-term rural development needs of \n     counties adversely affected by the collapse of coffee prices; \n     and\n       (B) the President should explore measures to support and \n     complement multilateral efforts to respond to the global \n     coffee crisis; and\n       (2) the Senate urges private sector coffee buyers and \n     roasters to work with the United States Government to find a \n     solution to the crisis which is economically, socially, and \n     environmentally sustainable for all interested parties, and \n     that will address the fundamental problem of oversupply in \n     the world coffee market.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 160--PROVIDING FOR THE SINE DIE \n    ADJOURNMENT OF THE ONE HUNDRED SEVENTH CONGRESS, SECOND SESSION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States, in keeping with \n     its trust responsibility to Indian tribes, to promote Indian \n     self-determination, religious freedom, political and cultural \n     integrity, and economic self-sufficiency, and to settle, \n     wherever possible, the water rights claims of Indian tribes \n     without lengthy and costly litigation.\n       (2) Quantification of rights to water and development of \n     facilities needed to use tribal water supplies effectively is \n     essential to the development of viable Indian reservation \n     communities, particularly in arid western States.\n       (3) On August 28, 1984, and by actions subsequent thereto, \n     the United States established a reservation for the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe in Apache County, Arizona upstream from the \n     confluence of the Little Colorado and Zuni Rivers for long-\n     standing religious and sustenance activities.\n       (4) The water rights of all water users in the Little \n     Colorado River basin in Arizona have been in litigation since \n     1979, in the Superior Court of the State of Arizona in and \n     for the County of Apache in Civil No. 6417, In re The General \n     Adjudication of All Rights to Use Water in the Little \n     Colorado River System and Source.\n       (5) Recognizing that the final resolution of the Zuni \n     Indian Tribe's water claims through litigation will take many \n     years and entail great expense to all parties, continue to \n     limit the Tribe's access to water with economic, social, and \n     cultural consequences to the Tribe, prolong uncertainty as to \n     the availability of water supplies, and seriously impair the \n     long-term economic planning and development of all parties, \n     the Tribe and neighboring non-Indians have sought to settle \n     their disputes to water and reduce the burdens of litigation.\n       (6) After more than 4 years of negotiations, which included \n     participation by representatives of the United States, the \n     Zuni Indian Tribe, the State of Arizona, and neighboring non-\n     Indian communities in the Little Colorado River basin, the \n     parties have entered into a Settlement Agreement to resolve \n     all of the Zuni Indian Tribe's water rights claims and to \n     assist the Tribe in acquiring surface water rights, to \n     provide for the Tribe's use of groundwater, and to provide \n     for the wetland restoration of the Tribe's lands in Arizona.\n       (7) To facilitate the wetland restoration project \n     contemplated under the Settlement Agreement, the Zuni Indian \n     Tribe acquired certain lands along the Little Colorado River \n     near or adjacent to its Reservation that are important for \n     the success of the project and will likely acquire a small \n     amount of similarly situated additional lands. The parties \n     have agreed not to object to the United States taking title \n     to certain of these lands into trust status; other lands \n     shall remain in tribal fee status. The parties have worked \n     extensively to resolve various governmental concerns \n     regarding use of and control over those lands, and to provide \n     a successful model for these types of situations, the State, \n     local, and tribal governments intend to enter into an \n     Intergovernmental Agreement that addresses the parties' \n     governmental concerns.\n       (8) Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, the neighboring \n     non-Indian entities will assist in the Tribe's acquisition of \n     surface water rights and development of groundwater, store \n     surface water supplies for the Zuni Indian Tribe, and make \n     substantial additional contributions to carry out the \n     Settlement Agreement's provisions.\n       (9) To advance the goals of Federal Indian policy and \n     consistent with the trust responsibility of the United States \n     to the Tribe, it is appropriate that the United States \n     participate in the implementation of the Settlement Agreement \n     and contribute funds for the rehabilitation of religious \n     riparian areas and other purposes to enable the Tribe to use \n     its water entitlement in developing its Reservation.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this subtitle are--\n       (1) to approve, ratify, and confirm the Settlement \n     Agreement entered into by the Tribe and neighboring non-\n     Indians;\n       (2) to authorize and direct the Secretary of the Interior \n     to execute and perform the Settlement Agreement and related \n     waivers;\n       (3) to authorize and direct the United States to take legal \n     title and hold such title to certain lands in trust for the \n     benefit of the Zuni Indian Tribe; and\n       (4) to authorize the actions, agreements, and \n     appropriations as provided for in the Settlement Agreement \n     and this subtitle.\n\n     SEC. 3103.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The General Allotment Act of 1887 (commonly known as \n     the `Dawes Act'), which authorized the allotment of Indian \n     reservations, did not allow Indian allotment owners to \n     provide for the testamentary disposition of the land that was \n     allotted to those owners.\n       (2) The Dawes Act provided that allotments would descend \n     according to State law of intestate succession based on the \n     location of the allotment.\n       (3) The Federal Government's reliance on the State law of \n     intestate succession with respect to the descendency of \n     allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian \n     tribes, their members, and the Federal Government. Those \n     problems include--\n       (A) the increasing fractionated ownership of trust and \n     restricted land as that land is inherited by successive \n     generations of owners as tenants in common;\n       (B) the application of different rules of intestate \n     succession to each of a decedent's interests in trust and \n     restricted land if that land is located within the boundaries \n     of more than 1 State, which application makes probate \n     planning unnecessarily difficult and impedes efforts to \n     provide probate planning assistance or advice;\n       (C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for trust \n     and restricted land which makes it difficult for Indian \n     tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; \n     and\n       (D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for \n     many of the essential elements of general probate law, either \n     directly or by reference, which is unfair to the owners of \n     trust and restricted land and their heirs and devisees and \n     which makes probate planning more difficult.\n       (4) Based on the problems identified in paragraph (3), a \n     uniform Federal probate code would likely--\n       (A) reduce the number of unnecessary fractionated interests \n     in trust or restricted land;\n       (B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning \n     assistance and advice;\n       (C) facilitate inter-tribal efforts to produce tribal \n     probate codes pursuant to section 206 of the Indian Land \n     Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and\n       (D) provide essential elements of general probate law that \n     are not applicable on the date of enactment of this subtitle \n     to interests in trust or restricted land.\n\n                    CHAPTER 1--INDIAN PROBATE REFORM\n\n     SEC. 10211.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Peace Corps Charter for the \n     21st Century Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Peace Corps was established in 1961 to promote \n     world peace and friendship through the service of American \n     volunteers abroad.\n       (2) The three goals codified in the Peace Corps Act which \n     have guided the Peace Corps and its volunteers over the \n     years, can work in concert to promote global acceptance of \n     the principles of international peace and nonviolent \n     coexistence among peoples of diverse cultures and systems of \n     government.\n       (3) The Peace Corps has operated in 135 countries with \n     165,000 Peace Corps volunteers since its establishment.\n       (4) The Peace Corps has sought to fulfill three goals, as \n     follows: to help people in developing nations meet basic \n     needs, to promote understanding of America's values and \n     ideals abroad, and to promote an understanding of other \n     peoples by Americans.\n       (5) After more than 40 years of operation, the Peace Corps \n     remains the world's premier international service \n     organization dedicated to promoting grassroots development.\n       (6) The Peace Corps remains committed to sending well \n     trained and well supported Peace Corps volunteers overseas to \n     promote peace, friendship, and international understanding.\n       (7) The Peace Corps is an independent agency, and therefore \n     no Peace Corps personnel or volunteers should be used to \n     accomplish any other goal than the goals established by the \n     Peace Corps Act.\n       (8) The Crisis Corps has been an effective tool in \n     harnessing the skills and talents for returned Peace Corps \n     volunteers and should be expanded to utilize to the maximum \n     extent the talent pool of returned Peace Corps volunteers.\n       (9) The Peace Corps is currently operating with an annual \n     budget of $275,000,000 in 70 countries with 7,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (10) There is deep misunderstanding and misinformation \n     about American values and ideals in many parts of the world, \n     particularly those with substantial Muslim populations, and a \n     greater Peace Corps presence in such places could foster \n     greater understanding and tolerance.\n       (11) Congress has declared that the Peace Corps should be \n     expanded to sponsor a minimum of 10,000 Peace Corps \n     volunteers.\n       (12) President George W. Bush has called for the doubling \n     of the number of Peace Corps volunteers in service.\n       (13) Any expansion of the Peace Corps shall not jeopardize \n     the quality of the Peace Corps volunteer experience, and \n     therefore can only be accomplished by an appropriate increase \n     in field and headquarters support staff.\n       (14) In order to ensure that proposed expansion of the \n     Peace Corps preserves the integrity of the program and the \n     security of volunteers, the integrated Planning and Budget \n     System supported by the Office of Planning and Policy \n     Analysis should continue its focus on strategic planning.\n       (15) A streamlined, bipartisan National Peace Corps \n     Advisory Council composed of distinguished returned Peace \n     Corps volunteers and other individuals, with diverse \n     backgrounds and expertise, can be a source of ideas and \n     suggestions that may be useful to the Director of the Peace \n     Corps as he discharges his duties and responsibilities as \n     head of the agency.\n\n     SEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et \n     seq.) was intended to provide Native American borrowers with \n     access to commercial sources of capital that otherwise would \n     not be available through the guarantee or insurance of loans \n     by the Secretary of the Interior;\n       (2) although the Secretary of the Interior has made loan \n     guarantees and insurance available, use of those guarantees \n     and that insurance by lenders to benefit Native American \n     business borrowers has been limited;\n       (3) 27 years after the date of enactment of the Indian \n     Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.), the promotion \n     and development of Native American-owned business remains an \n     essential foundation for growth of economic and social \n     stability of Native Americans;\n       (4) use by commercial lenders of the available loan \n     insurance and guarantees may be limited by liquidity and \n     other capital market-driven concerns; and\n       (5) it is in the best interest of the insured and \n     guaranteed loan program of the Department of the Interior--\n       (A) to encourage the orderly development and expansion of a \n     secondary market for loans guaranteed or insured by the \n     Secretary of the Interior; and\n       (B) to expand the number of lenders originating loans under \n     the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.).\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to reform and \n     clarify the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. 1451 et \n     seq.) in order to--\n       (1) stimulate the use by lenders of secondary market \n     investors for loans guaranteed or insured under a program \n     administered by the Secretary of the Interior;\n       (2) preserve the authority of the Secretary to administer \n     the program and regulate lenders;\n       (3) clarify that a good faith investor in loans insured or \n     guaranteed by the Secretary will receive appropriate \n     payments;\n       (4) provide for the appointment by the Secretary of a \n     qualified fiscal transfer agent to establish and administer a \n     system for the orderly transfer of those loans; and\n       (5)(A) authorize the Secretary to promulgate regulations to \n     encourage and expand a secondary market program for loans \n     guaranteed or insured by the Secretary; and\n       (B) allow the pooling of those loans as the secondary \n     market develops.\n\n     SEC. 103. AMENDMENTS TO INDIAN FINANCING ACT.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Loan Amounts Without Prior Approval.--\n     Section 204 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. \n     1484) is amended in the last sentence by striking \n     ``$100,000'' and inserting ``$250,000''.\n       (b) Sale or Assignment of Loans and Underlying Security.--\n     Section 205 of the Indian Financing Act of 1974 (25 U.S.C. \n     1485) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``Any loan guaranteed'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(a) In General.--Any loan guaranteed or insured'';

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Cherokee, Choctaw, and \n     Chickasaw Nations Claims Settlement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 602. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is the policy of the United States to promote tribal \n     self-determination and economic self-sufficiency and to \n     encourage the resolution of disputes over historical claims \n     through mutually agreed-to settlements between Indian Nations \n     and the United States.\n       (2) There are pending before the United States Court of \n     Federal Claims certain lawsuits against the United States \n     brought by the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations \n     seeking monetary damages for the alleged use and \n     mismanagement of tribal resources along the Arkansas River in \n     eastern Oklahoma.\n       (3) The Cherokee Nation, a federally recognized Indian \n     tribe with its present tribal headquarters south of \n     Tahlequah, Oklahoma, having adopted its most recent \n     constitution on June 26, 1976, and having entered into \n     various treaties with the United States, including but not \n     limited to the Treaty at Hopewell, executed on November 28, \n     1785 (7 Stat. 18), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., \n     executed on July 19, 1866 (14 Stat. 799), has maintained a \n     continuous government-to-government relationship with the \n     United States since the earliest years of the Union.\n       (4) The Choctaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian tribe \n     with its present tribal headquarters in Durant, Oklahoma, \n     having adopted its most recent constitution on July 9, 1983, \n     and having entered into various treaties with the United \n     States of America, including but not limited to the Treaty at \n     Hopewell, executed on January 3, 1786 (7 Stat. 21), and the \n     Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on April 28, 1866 (7 \n     Stat. 21), has maintained a continuous government-to-\n     government relationship with the United States since the \n     earliest years of the Union.\n       (5) The Chickasaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian \n     tribe with its present tribal headquarters in Ada, Oklahoma, \n     having adopted its most recent constitution on August 27, \n     1983, and having entered into various treaties with the \n     United States of America, including but not limited to the \n     Treaty at Hopewell, executed on January 10, 1786 (7 Stat. \n     24), and the Treaty at Washington, D.C., executed on April \n     28, 1866 (7 Stat. 21), has maintained a continuous \n     government-to-government relationship with the United States \n     since the earliest years of the Union.\n       (6) In the first half of the 19th century, the Cherokee, \n     Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations were forcibly removed from \n     their homelands in the southeastern United States to lands \n     west of the Mississippi in the Indian Territory that were \n     ceded to them by the United States. From the ``Three Forks'' \n     area near present day Muskogee, Oklahoma, downstream to the \n     point of confluence with the Canadian River, the Arkansas \n     River flowed entirely within the territory of the Cherokee \n     Nation. From that point of confluence downstream to the \n     Arkansas territorial line, the Arkansas River formed the \n     boundary between the Cherokee Nation on the left side of the \n     thread of the river and the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations on \n     the right.\n       (7) Pursuant to the Act of April 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 137), \n     tribal property not allotted to individuals or otherwise \n     disposed of, including the bed and banks of the Arkansas \n     River, passed to the\n\n[[Page S11777]]\n\n     United States in trust for the use and benefit of the \n     respective Indian Nations in accordance with their respective \n     interests therein.\n       (8) For more than 60 years after Oklahoma statehood, the \n     Bureau of Indian Affairs believed that Oklahoma owned the \n     Riverbed from the Arkansas State line to Three Forks, and \n     therefore took no action to protect the Indian Nations' \n     Riverbed resources such as oil, gas, and Drybed Lands \n     suitable for grazing and agriculture.\n       (9) Third parties with property near the Arkansas River \n     began to occupy the Indian Nations' Drybed Lands--lands that \n     were under water at the time of statehood but that are now \n     dry due to changes in the course of the river.\n       (10) In 1966, the Indian Nations sued the State of Oklahoma \n     to recover their lands. In 1970, the Supreme Court of the \n     United States decided in the case of Choctaw Nation vs. \n     Oklahoma (396 U.S. 620), that the Indian Nations retained \n     title to their respective portions of the Riverbed along the \n     navigable reach of the river.\n       (11) In 1987, the Supreme Court of the United States in the \n     case of United States vs. Cherokee Nation (480 U.S. 700) \n     decided that the riverbed lands did not gain an exemption \n     from the Federal Government's navigational servitude and that \n     the Cherokee Nation had no right to compensation for damage \n     to its interest by exercise of the Government's servitude.\n       (12) In 1989, the Indian Nations filed lawsuits against the \n     United States in the United States Court of Federal Claims \n     (Case Nos. 218-89L and 630-89L), seeking damages for the \n     United States' use and mismanagement of tribal trust \n     resources along the Arkansas River. Those actions are still \n     pending.\n       (13) In 1997, the United States filed quiet title \n     litigation against individuals occupying some of the Indian \n     Nations' Drybed Lands. That action, filed in the United \n     States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, \n     was dismissed without prejudice on technical grounds.\n       (14) Much of the Indian Nations' Drybed Lands have been \n     occupied by a large number of adjacent landowners in \n     Oklahoma. Without Federal legislation, further litigation \n     against thousands of such landowners would be likely and any \n     final resolution of disputes would take many years and entail \n     great expense to the United States, the Indian Nations, and \n     the individuals and entities occupying the Drybed Lands and \n     would seriously impair long-term economic planning and \n     development for all parties.\n       (15) The Councils of the Cherokee and Choctaw Nations and \n     the Legislature of the Chickasaw Nation have each enacted \n     tribal resolutions which would, contingent upon the passage \n     of this title and the satisfaction of its terms and in \n     exchange for the moneys appropriated hereunder--\n       (A) settle and forever release their respective claims \n     against the United States asserted by them in United States \n     Court of Federal Claims Case Nos. 218-89L and 630-89L; and\n       (B) forever disclaim any and all right, title, and interest \n     in and to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, as set forth in those \n     enactments of the respective councils of the Indian Nations.\n       (16) The resolutions adopted by the respective Councils of \n     the Cherokee, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations each provide \n     that, contingent upon the passage of the settlement \n     legislation and satisfaction of its terms, each Indian Nation \n     agrees to dismiss, release, and forever discharge its claims \n     asserted against the United States in the United State Court \n     of Federal Claims, Case Nos. 218-89L and 630-89L, and to \n     forever disclaim any right, title, or interest of the Indian \n     Nation in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, in exchange for the \n     funds appropriated and allocated to the Indian Nation under \n     the provisions of the settlement legislation, which funds the \n     Indian Nation agrees to accept in full satisfaction and \n     settlement of all claims against the United States for the \n     damages sought in the aforementioned claims asserted in the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims, and as full and fair \n     compensation for disclaiming its right, title, and interest \n     in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands.\n       (17) In those resolutions, each Indian Nation expressly \n     reserved all of its beneficial interest and title to all \n     other Riverbed lands, including minerals, as determined by \n     the Supreme Court in Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U.S. 620 \n     (1970), and further reserved any and all right, title, or \n     interest that each Nation may have in and to the water \n     flowing in the Arkansas River and its tributaries.\n\n     SEC. 603. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are to resolve all claims that \n     have been or could have been brought by the Cherokee, \n     Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations against the United States, and \n     to confirm that the Indian Nations are forever disclaiming \n     any right, title, or interest in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, \n     which are contiguous to the channel of the Arkansas River as \n     of the date of the enactment of this title in certain \n     townships in eastern Oklahoma.\n\n     SEC. 604. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this title, the following definitions \n     apply:\n       (1) Disclaimed drybed lands.--The term ``Disclaimed Drybed \n     Lands'' means all Drybed Lands along the Arkansas River that \n     are located in Township 10 North in Range 24 East, Townships \n     9 and 10 North in Range 25 East, Township 10 North in Range \n     26 East, and Townships 10 and 11 North in Range 27 East, in \n     the State Oklahoma.\n       (2) Drybed lands.--The term ``Drybed Lands'' means those \n     lands which, on the date of enactment of this title, lie \n     above and contiguous to the mean high water mark of the \n     Arkansas River in the State of Oklahoma. The term ``Drybed \n     Lands'' is intended to have the same meaning as the term \n     ``Upland Claim Area'' as used by the Bureau of Land \n     Management Cadastral Survey Geographic Team in its \n     preliminary survey of the Arkansas River. The term ``Drybed \n     Lands'' includes any lands so identified in the ``Holway \n     study.''\n       (3) Indian nation; indian nations.--The term ``Indian \n     Nation'' means the Cherokee Nation, Choctaw Nation, or \n     Chickasaw Nation, and the term ``Indian Nations'' means all 3 \n     tribes collectively.\n       (4) Riverbed.--The term ``Riverbed'' means the Drybed Lands \n     and the Wetbed Lands and includes all minerals therein.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (6) Wetbed lands.--The term ``Wetbed Lands'' means those \n     Riverbed lands which lie below the mean high water mark of \n     the Arkansas River in the State of Oklahoma as of the date of \n     the enactment of this title, exclusive of the Drybed Lands. \n     The term Wetbed Land is intended to have the same meaning as \n     the term ``Present Channel Claim Areas'' as utilized by the \n     Bureau of Land Management Cadastral Survey Geographic Team in \n     its preliminary survey of the Arkansas River.\n\n     SEC. 605. SETTLEMENT AND CLAIMS; APPROPRIATIONS; ALLOCATION \n                   OF FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Extinguishment of Claims.--Pursuant to their respective \n     tribal resolutions, and in exchange for the benefits \n     conferred under this title, the Indian Nations shall, on the \n     date of enactment of this title, enter into a consent decree \n     with the United States that waives, releases, and dismisses \n     all the claims they have asserted or could have asserted in \n     their cases numbered 218-89L and 630-89L pending in the \n     United States Court of Federal Claims against the United \n     States, including but not limited to claims arising out of \n     any and all of the Indian Nations' interests in the \n     Disclaimed Drybed Lands and arising out of construction, \n     maintenance and operation of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation \n     Way. The Indian Nations and the United States shall lodge the \n     consent decree with the Court of Federal Claims within 30 \n     days of the enactment of this title, and shall move for entry \n     of the consent decree at such time as all appropriations by \n     Congress pursuant to the authority of this title have been \n     made and deposited into the appropriate tribal trust fund \n     account of the Indian Nations as described in section 606. \n     Upon entry of the consent decree, all the Indian Nations' \n     claims and all their past, present, and future right, title, \n     and interest to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, shall be deemed \n     extinguished. No claims may be asserted in the future against \n     the United States pursuant to sections 1491, 1346(a)(2), or \n     1505 of title 28, United States Code, for actions taken or \n     failed to have been taken by the United States for events \n     occurring prior to the date of the extinguishment of claims \n     with respect to the Riverbed.\n       (b) Release of Tribal Claims to Certain Drybed Lands.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the deposit of all funds authorized \n     for appropriation under subsection (c) for an Indian Nation \n     into the appropriate trust fund account described in section \n     606--\n       (A) all claims now existing or which may arise in the \n     future with respect to the Disclaimed Drybed lands and all \n     right, title, and interest that the Indian Nations and the \n     United States as trustee on behalf of the Indian Nation may \n     have to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands, shall be deemed \n     extinguished;\n       (B) any interest of the Indian Nations or the United States \n     as trustee on their behalf in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands \n     shall further be extinguished pursuant to the Trade and \n     Intercourse Act of 1790, Act of July 22, 1790 (ch. 33, 1 \n     Stat. 137), and all subsequent amendments thereto (as \n     codified at 25 U.S.C. 177);\n       (C) to the extent parties other than the Indian Nations \n     have transferred interests in the Disclaimed Drybed Lands in \n     violation of the Trade and Intercourse Act, Congress does \n     hereby approve and ratify such transfers of interests in the \n     Disclaimed Drybed Lands to the extent that such transfers \n     otherwise are valid under law; and\n       (D) the Secretary is authorized to execute an appropriate \n     document citing this title, suitable for filing with the \n     county clerks, or such other county official as appropriate, \n     of those counties wherein the foregoing described lands are \n     located, disclaiming any tribal or Federal interest on behalf \n     of the Indian Nations in such Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The \n     Secretary is authorized to file with the counties a plat or \n     map of the disclaimed lands should the Secretary determine \n     that such filing will clarify the extent of lands disclaimed. \n     Such a plat or map may be filed regardless of whether the map \n     or plat has been previously approved for filing, whether or \n     not the map or plat has been filed, and regardless of whether \n     the map or plat constitutes a final determination by the \n     Secretary of the extent of the Indian Nations' original claim \n     to the Disclaimed Drybed Lands. The disclaimer filed by the \n     United States shall constitute a disclaimer of the Disclaimed \n     Drybed Lands for purposes of the Trade and Intercourse Act \n     (25 U.S.C. 177).\n       (2) Special provisions.--Notwithstanding any provision of \n     this title--\n       (A) the Indian Nations do not relinquish any right, title, \n     or interest in any lands which constitute the Wetbed Lands \n     subject to the navigational servitude exercised by the United \n     States on the Wetbed Lands. By virtue of the exercise of the \n     navigational servitude, the United States shall not be liable \n     to the Indian Nations for any loss they may have related to \n     the minerals in the Wetbed Lands;\n       (B) no provision of this title shall be construed to \n     extinguish or convey any water rights of the Indian Nations \n     in the Arkansas River or any other stream or the beneficial \n     interests or title of any of the Indian Nations in and to \n     lands held in trust by the United States on the date of \n     enactment of this title which lie above or below the mean \n     high water mark of the Arkansas River, except for the \n     Disclaimed Drybed Lands; and\n\n[[Page S11778]]\n\n       (C) the Indian Nations do not relinquish any right, title, \n     or interest in any lands or minerals of certain unallotted \n     tracts which are identified in the official records of the \n     Eastern Oklahoma Regional Office, Bureau of Indian Affairs. \n     The disclaimer to be filed by the Secretary of the Interior \n     under section 605(b)(1) of this title shall reflect the legal \n     description of the unallotted tracts retained by the Nations.\n       (3) Setoff.--In the event the Court of Federal Claims does \n     not enter the consent decree as set forth in subsection (a), \n     the United States shall be entitled to setoff against any \n     claims of the Indian Nations as set forth in subsection (a), \n     any funds transferred to the Indian Nations pursuant to \n     section 606, and any interest accrued thereon up to the date \n     of setoff.\n       (4) Quiet title actions.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, neither the United States nor any \n     department of the United States nor the Indian Nations shall \n     be made parties to any quiet title lawsuit or other lawsuit \n     to determine ownership of or an interest in the Disclaimed \n     Drybed Lands initiated by any private person or private \n     entity after execution of the disclaimer set out in section \n     605(b)(1). The United States will have no obligation to \n     undertake any future quiet title actions or actions for the \n     recovery of lands or funds relating to any Drybed Lands \n     retained by the Indian Nation or Indian Nations under this \n     title, including any lands which are Wetbed Lands on the date \n     of enactment of this title, but which subsequently lie above \n     the mean high water mark of the Arkansas River and the \n     failure or declination to initiate any quiet title action or \n     to manage any such Drybed Lands shall not constitute a breach \n     of trust by the United States or be compensable to the Indian \n     Nation or Indian Nations in any manner.\n       (5) Land to be conveyed in fee.--To the extent that the \n     United States determines that it is able to effectively \n     maintain the McClellan-Kerr Navigation Way without retaining \n     title to lands above the high water mark of the Arkansas \n     River as of the date of enactment of this title, said lands, \n     after being declared surplus, shall be conveyed in fee to the \n     Indian Nation within whose boundary the land is located. The \n     United States shall not be obligated to accept such property \n     in trust.\n       (c) Authorization for Settlement Appropriations.--There is \n     authorized to be appropriated an aggregate sum of $40,000,000 \n     as follows:\n       (1) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.\n       (2) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.\n       (3) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.\n       (4) $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2007.\n       (d) Allocation and Deposit of Funds.--After payment \n     pursuant to section 607, the remaining funds authorized for \n     appropriation under subsection (c) shall be allocated among \n     the Indian Nations as follows:\n       (1) 50 percent to be deposited into the trust fund account \n     established under section 606 for the Cherokee Nation.\n       (2) 37.5 percent to be deposited into the trust fund \n     account established under section 606 for the Choctaw Nation.\n       (3) 12.5 percent to be deposited into the trust fund \n     account established under section 606 for the Chickasaw \n     Nation.\n\n     SEC. 606. TRIBAL TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Establishment, Purpose, and Management of Trust \n     Funds.--\n       (1) Establishment.--There are hereby established in the \n     United States Treasury 3 separate tribal trust fund accounts \n     for the benefit of each of the Indian Nations, respectively, \n     for the purpose of receiving all appropriations made pursuant \n     to section 605(c), and allocated pursuant to section 605(d).\n       (2) Availability of amounts in trust fund accounts.--\n     Amounts in the tribal trust fund accounts established by this \n     section shall be available to the Secretary for management \n     and investment on behalf of the Indian Nations and \n     distribution to the Indian Nations in accordance with this \n     title.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Indian Probate Reform Act of \n     2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The General Allotment Act of 1887 (commonly known as \n     the `Dawes Act'), which authorized the allotment of Indian \n     reservations, did not allow Indian allotment owners to \n     provide for the testamentary disposition of the land that was \n     allotted to those owners.\n       (2) The Dawes Act provided that allotments would descend \n     according to State law of intestate succession based on the \n     location of the allotment.\n       (3) The Federal Government's reliance on the State law of \n     intestate succession with respect to the descendency of \n     allotments has resulted in numerous problems affecting Indian \n     tribes, their members, and the Federal Government. Those \n     problems include--\n       (A) the increasing fractionated ownership of trust and \n     restricted land as that land is inherited by successive \n     generations of owners as tenants in common;\n       (B) the application of different rules of intestate \n     succession to each of a decedent's interests in trust and \n     restricted land if that land is located within the boundaries \n     of more than 1 State, which application makes probate \n     planning unnecessarily difficult and impedes efforts to \n     provide probate planning assistance or advice;\n       (C) the absence of a uniform general probate code for trust \n     and restricted land which makes it difficult for Indian \n     tribes to work cooperatively to develop tribal probate codes; \n     and\n       (D) the failure of Federal law to address or provide for \n     many of the essential elements of general probate law, either \n     directly or by reference, which is unfair to the owners of \n     trust and restricted land and their heirs and devisees and \n     which makes probate planning more difficult.\n       (4) Based on the problems identified in paragraph (3), a \n     uniform Federal probate code would likely--\n       (A) reduce the number of unnecessary fractionated interests \n     in trust or restricted land;\n       (B) facilitate efforts to provide probate planning \n     assistance and advice;\n       (C) facilitate inter-tribal efforts to produce tribal \n     probate codes pursuant to section 206 of the Indian Land \n     Consolidation Act (25 U.S.C. 2205); and\n       (D) provide essential elements of general probate law that \n     are not applicable on the date of enactment of this subtitle \n     to interests in trust or restricted land.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 366\n\n       Whereas in November 2002, a number of government-controlled \n     television stations in Egypt began broadcasting a multi-part \n     series, ``Horseman Without a Horse'', based on the Protocols \n     of the Elders of Zion and conspiracy myths about Jewish \n     global domination;\n       Whereas the Protocols of the Elders of Zion are a notorious \n     forgery, written by Russian anti-Semites in the early 20th \n     century, which purport to reveal a plot for Jewish domination \n     of the world;\n       Whereas the Protocols of the Elders of Zion have been a \n     staple of anti-Semitic and anti-Israel propaganda for decades \n     and have long since been discredited by all reputable \n     scholars;\n       Whereas the broadcast of this series takes place in the \n     context of a sustained pattern of vitriolic anti-Semitic \n     commentary and depictions in the Egyptian government-\n     sponsored press, which has gone unanswered by the Government \n     of Egypt; and\n       Whereas the Department of State has urged Egypt and other \n     Arab states not to broadcast this program, saying ``We don't \n     think government TV stations should be broadcasting programs \n     that we consider racist and untrue'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns any publication or program that lends \n     legitimacy to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion;\n       (2) believes the use of such heinous propaganda, especially \n     in the Arab world, serves to incite popular sentiment against \n     Jewish people and the State of Israel rather than promoting \n     religious tolerance and preparing Arab populations for the \n     prospect of peace with Israel;\n       (3) commends the Department of State for its denunciation \n     of the ``Horseman Without a Horse'' television series and its \n     efforts to discourage Arab states from broadcasting it; and\n       (4) urges the Government of Egypt and other Arab \n     governments--\n       (A) not to allow their government-controlled television \n     stations to broadcast this program or any other racist and \n     untrue material; and\n       (B) to speak out against such incitement by vigorously and \n     publicly condemning anti-Semitism as a form of bigotry.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a \nresolution dealing with a problem we are facing in the Middle East--\nthat of resurgent anti-Semitism. I am joined by my friend and colleague \nfrom Oregon, Sen. Smith, in offering this resolution.\n  Right now, throughout this month, a multi-part series is being \nbroadcast on Egyptian state television entitled, ``Horseman Without a \nHorse.'' This program is based on a notorious anti-Semitic document \nknown as ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.''\n  ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion,'' written in the early 20th \ncentury by Russian anti-Semites, purports to be a record of secret \nmeetings at which Jewish leaders hatched a plan for global Jewish \ndomination. All reputable scholars have discredited the document, but \nit has proven tougher to stamp out than the most resilient weed.\n  Time and again, various anti-Semitic leaders have used the Protocols \nof the Elders of Zion to justify outrageous acts of persecution against \nthe Jewish people. The perpetrators of pogroms in Russia cited it. \nHitler used it. So did Stalin. It has become a staple of anti-Semitic \npropaganda.\n  The places these myths are most likely to surface nowadays are in the \nArab world. With depressing regularity, we see Jews portrayed in the \nArab media as bloodthirsty, conniving, and manipulative. The editorial \ncartoons of Jews that appear in Egyptian newspapers alone would be \nshocking to nearly any American who saw them.\n  Now comes a television program about Jewish plots to control the \nworld, broadcast nationwide on Egyptian government-sponsored television \nstations. It is likely the series will air in other Arab countries as \nwell.\n  Some would argue that this demonizations is an unavoidable hyproduct \nof the Arab-Israeli conflict. But perpetrating anti-Semitic myths is \nnever acceptable. Arab governments can be expected to have their \ndifferences with Israel, and to seek to resolve those differences \nthrough negotiations. They can even be expected to criticize Israeli \npolicies. But the gratuitous demonization of Jews serves on to incite \npopular sentiment against Jewish people, and by extension, the State of \nIsrael. Instead, these governments should be seeking to promote \nreligious tolerance, and to prepare their populations for peace with \nIsrael.\n  Egypt is a friend and ally of the United States. It is a significant \nrecipient of U.S. foreign assistance because successive administrations \nof both parties have found the alliance to serve our national \ninterests. But we have a right to expect better from our friends. We \nhave a right to expect that they will not intentionally promote false \nand racist views that incite religious intolerance. As the State \nDepartment spokesman, Richard Boucher, said recently, ``We don't think \ngovernment TV stations should be broadcasting programs that we consider \nracist and untrue.''\n  Anti-Semitism is a form of racism, and we need to condemn it whenever \nit occurs. The resolution I am offering today with Sen. Smith condemns \nany effort that lends legitimacy to the Protocols of the Elders of \nZion, supports the State Department's criticism of the Egyptian \ntelevision series ``Horseman Without a Horse'', and urges the \nGovernment of Egypt and other Arab governments to refrain from \nbroadcasting racist and untrue material, and to speak out against such \nincitement.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this import \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11791-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ARCHIE EDWARDS BLUES HERITAGE FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. REID.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 628, H.R. 5472.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 5472) to extend for 6 months the period for \n     which chapter 12 title 11 of the United States Code is \n     enacted.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing \nH.R. 5472, to extend family farmer bankruptcy protection until July 1, \n2003.\n  Unfortunately, too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo \nin bankruptcy courts across the country because Chapter 12 of the \nBankruptcy Code is still a temporary measure. This is the fifth time \nthat this Congress must act to restore or extend basic bankruptcy \nsafeguards for family farmers because Chapter 12 is still a temporary \nprovision despite its first passage into law in 1986. Our family \nfarmers do not deserve these lapses in bankruptcy law that could mean \nthe difference between foreclosure and farming.\n  In 2000 and 2001, for example, the Senate, then controlled by the \nother party, failed to take up a House-passed bill to retroactively \nrenew Chapter 12 and, as a result, family farmers lost Chapter 12 \nbankruptcy protection for 8 months. Another lapse of Chapter 12 lasted \nmore than 6 months in this Congress. Enough is enough. It is time for \nCongress to make Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code to \nprovide a stable safety net for our nation's family farmers.\n  I strongly supported Senator Carnahan's bipartisan amendment to make \nChapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy Code as part of the \nSenate-passed farm bill. The Senate unanimously approved the Carnahan \namendment by a 93-0 vote. Unfortunately, the House majority objected to \nincluding the Carnahan amendment in the farm bill conference report and \nagreed to an extension of Chapter 12 only through the end of this year.\n  In the bipartisan bankruptcy reform conference, we again tried to \nmake Chapter 12 permanent and update and expand its coverage. During \nour conference negotiations, we adopted most of the Senate-passed \nprovisions, including those authored by Senator Grassley to make \nChapter 12 permanent and those authored by Senator Feingold to \nstrengthen Chapter 12 to help our family farmers with the difficulties \nthey face. Just last week, however, the House majority again scuttled \nour bipartisan efforts by failing to pass the rule to consider the \nbipartisan conference report on the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and \nConsumer Protection Act.\n  This week, Senator Grassley and I introduced the family farmer \nprovisions in the bipartisan bankruptcy conference report in S. 3174, \nthe ``Protection of Family Farmers and Family Fisherman Act of 2002.'' \nOur bipartisan bill makes Chapter 12 a permanent part of the Bankruptcy \nCode so family farmer bankruptcy protection will no longer lapse and \nforce farmers into a legal limbo. Family farmers deserve these enhanced \nand permanent protections to help them prevent foreclosures and forced \nauctions. I know Senator Grassley, Senator Carnahan, Senator Feingold \nand others on both sides of the aisle strongly support permanent and \nexpanded bankruptcy protection for family farmers.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 3180) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. I am very pleased that H.R. 3180, \nlegislation to consent to certain amendments to the New Hampshire-\nVermont Interstate School Compact, has been adopted by the Senate. This \nlegislation was passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week \nand I am pleased my colleagues have joined me in supporting its passage \ntoday.\n  There are a handful of Vermont communities that share a school \ndistrict with their neighbors across the border in New Hampshire. \nCongress first approved of the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School \nCompact in 1969 to allow these interstate districts to be put in place. \nH.R. 3180 amends the original Compact by providing these interstate \ndistricts with local flexibility regarding how to conduct bond votes \nfor their school construction projects.\n  Last year, residents of the Dresden School District, one of two \ninterstate school districts formed under this Compact, voted to change \nthe way bond votes are conducted in their communities. The Vermont and \nNew Hampshire Legislatures approved these changes, as did the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives when it passed H.R. 3180, sponsored by \nRepresentative Charlie Bass of New Hampshire and my colleague from \nVermont, Representative Bernie Sanders, after a 425 to 0 vote to \nsuspend the rules.\n  This bill will allow local schools to make local choices about the \nbest way to spend their dollars. While I regret that this simple piece \nof legislation was not agreed to sooner, I applaud its passage today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11793-3", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        INDIAN PROGRAMS REAUTHORIZATION AND TECHNICAL AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering passage of H.R. 1989 and urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 \nU.S.C. 1801 et seq., the ``Act'', and the National Standards Guidelines \ndeveloped and implemented by the Secretary of Commerce set forth \nspecific standards for establishing, amending, and re-setting fishery \nrebuilding plans and timelines developed under that Act's rebuilding \nprovisions, codified in, among other provisions, 16 U.S.C. 1854(e). New \ninformation and scientific analyses become available through time, and \nthere can be a need to amend and adjust rebuilding plans and timelines \nbased on such new information and analyses. In certain instances, such \ninformation and analyses indicating that biomass rebuilding targets can \nand should be substantially increased. These increases in biomass \ntargets, especially in the midst of an on-going rebuilding plan, may, \nin appropriate circumstances, require flexibility to ensure that the \nrebuilding program accomplishes the full range of the Act's goals and \nnational standards. The Secretary of Commerce, who is charged with \nimplementing the Act, has the discretion to provide flexibility in a \nrebuilding plan or timeline when the biomass target for a fish species \nor stock is substantially increased. The flexibility confirmed in \nSection 604 of H.R. 1989 clarifies the Secretary's discretion contained \nin the Act and does not limit or otherwise constrain additional areas \nfor flexibility in rebuilding contained within the Act.\n  This section clarifies the flexibility that Congress provided the \nSecretary in the Sustainable Fisheries Act of 1996. This flexibility is \nnecessary due to the unanticipated event of biomass targets being \nsubstantially increased during a rebuilding period. Schedules for \nending overfishing and rebuilding overfished fisheries are required by \nthe Sustainable Fisheries Act and must be specified. The Sustainable \nFisheries Act does, however, provide the Councils and the Secretary \nwith a significant degree of flexibility in determining time frames for \nending overfishing and rebuilding depleted fisheries.\n  For instance, the requirement that schedules for ending overfishing \nand rebuilding fisheries be ``as short as possible'' and the \nconditional 10-year rebuilding period deadline provide valuable \nstandards to help guide the councils in the development of plans to end \noverfishing and rebuild fisheries. In drafting this provision, however, \nCongress clearly understood that fisheries are not managed in a vacuum \nand that rebuilding schedules should be based not only on the \nbiological and ecological conditions of the fishery, but also on the \nneeds of fishing communities as well as any international management \nmeasures that may apply. The relative weight of a particular factor \nwould depend on the circumstances facing a fishery and would be \ndetermined by the councils, but the biology and life history \ncharacteristics of a species will always be very important in \ndetermining the ultimate rebuilding schedule.\n\n  Properly construed, the Sustainable Fisheries Act rebuilding \nprovisions permit the councils to set a longer rebuilding schedule in \ncases where the stock or stocks at issue grow relatively slowly, and/or \nthe size of the stock is sufficiently small that even under conditions \nof moderate or no fishing mortality, rebuilding will necessarily take a \nsignificantly longer period of time.\n  In the case of a slower-growing species, the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct provisions allow a council to establish a rebuilding schedule \nlonger than 10 years to accommodate the life history characteristics, \nincluding growth rates, of the species. The term ``biology of the stock \nof fish'' was included in section 304(e)(4)(A)(ii) so that councils \nwould have the ability to devise individual rebuilding schedules in \nharmony with the biological parameters of a fish population's growth \ncapacity.\n  Section 304(e)(4)(A)(ii) also enables the Councils to establish \nrebuilding schedules longer than 10 years if the stock or stocks in \nquestion are managed under an international agreement to which the U.S. \nis a party, and any management measures or recommendations approved \npursuant to such an agreement contain a rebuilding schedule longer than \n10 years. In such circumstances, the rebuilding schedule developed \nunder Section 304(e)(4), as well as other management provisions under \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act, must be consistent with the rebuilding \nschedule and associated management measures and recommendations under \nthe international agreement.\n  In drafting section 304(e)(4)(A), Congress wanted to ensure that U.S. \nharvesters of species managed under an international regime were not \nsaddled with a disproportionate conservation burden and not placed at a \ncompetitive disadvantage compared to their counterparts from other \ncountries that are parties to the regime.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senators Kerry and \nHollings have two amendments at the desk. I ask it be in order to \nconsider the amendments en bloc; the amendments be agreed to en bloc; \nthe motions to reconsider be laid on the table en bloc; the committee-\nreported substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table; the bill as amended, be read three \ntimes, passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; and \nconsideration of these amendments appear separately in the Record and \nany statements be printed in the Record, with no intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4982) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 4982\n\n    (Purpose: To provide authority for the acceptance of voluntary \n                               services)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I rise this evening as Chairman of the \nOceans, Atmosphere and Fisheries Subcommittee to offer a few remarks \nconcerning H.R. 1989, to which I am offering a Senate amendment, along \nwith the ranking member of the Subcommittee Ms. Snowe.\n  The Senate amendment includes a number of provisions that will help \nfishermen around this country. Our amendment contains two important \nprovisions that will help identify and address overcapacity in our \nfisheries. The first is a report from the Secretary of Commerce \nidentifying the top 20 fisheries in the United States with excess \ncapacity. In order to restore and maintain sustainable fisheries, we \nneed to ensure we understand and develop a plan to address overcapacity \nthat may be undermining our efforts to rebuild our stocks. By ranking \nthe fisheries with the most serious capacity problems, we can target \nresources at reducing capacity in these fisheries and allow some \nfishermen to retire with dignity.\n  This amendment also includes a provision that would require the \nSecretary of Commerce in coordination with the New England Fisheries \nManagement Council to provide technical assistance and use all tools at \nhis disposal--including the Coastal Zone Management Act planning \nprocedures--to help industry develop a capacity reduction program for \nNew England groundfish. Funding has already been provided for such an \nindustry-funded buyout, but now our industry must consider what kind of \nplan makes sense for our fishing communities. We simply have too many \nfishermen chasing too few fish in New England. I know the entire New \nEngland delegation has enormous sympathy for our hard-working \nfishermen, and we want to help these families as they struggle against \na tide of regulations. The first step to assisting these families is to \nevaluate and plan for the opportunities that will be available once our \nfisheries are rebuilt. Then people can make some informed decisions \nabout retiring from the fishery. It is my hope that the Secretary in \ncoordination with New England Fishery Management Council can develop \nsuch a plan.\n  This amendment also contains a provision that clarifies the \nflexibility that Congress provided the Secretary of Commerce in the \n1996 reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. Current law requires \nstocks identified as overfished to be rebuilt within 10 years, except \nthat additional time is provided where the biology of the stocks, other \nenvironmental conditions, or international management measures dictate \notherwise. Ms. Snowe and I have included a provision clarifying that \nunder existing law the Secretary of Commerce may extend rebuilding \nbeyond 10 years if the rebuilding target we are working towards \nincreases by 100 percent or more over the original target set by the \nSecretary at the start of the rebuilding plan. The extension should \nonly be granted as long as the fishery meets or exceeds the original \ntarget and if the Secretary certifies that the overfishing requirements \nof the Act are met and that rebuilding will continue to occur.\n  We are not endorsing any backsliding on conservation, nor encouraging \noverfishing, but trying to deal with primarily a logistical problem: a \nmid-course increase in the targets based on new scientific information. \nRecently the National Marine Fisheries Service re-analysis of \nbiological reference points resulted in more than doubling our \nrebuilding targets on several species in the Northeast multispecies \nfishery during year 3 of a 10-year rebuilding plan. This development \ngenerated confusion in the region, but we believe there is a simple \nresponse. Under the law, we believe the Secretary of Commerce has the \nauthority to provide a biologically-based and reasonable time extension \nfor these stocks, provided it is as short as possible, rebuilding \ncontinues, overfishing does not occur, and the original targets are \nmet. This is only a commonsense response to this situation--a \ntransition rule, if you will. A substantial change in biomass targets \nin the middle of a rebuilding plan was never envisioned when NMFS wrote \nthe implementing regulations, but such a response would be consistent \nwith the Act.\n  This amendment also contains a provision that would aid in \nimplementing the industry-funded buyout in the West Coast groundfish \nfishery which Congress authorized last year. I know that my colleagues \nfrom Oregon, Washington and California care very much about this \nprovision. I am happy that we could accommodate them with this \nlegislation and help the fishing communities on the West Coast that are \nreeling from severe overfishing on stocks that are long lived, slow \ngrowing and slow to reproduce.\n  Finally, this amendment includes important provisions authorizing \nnational approaches to cooperative research, independent peer review of \ndata collection and assessment methods, fisheries training and \noutreach, and cooperative enforcement. All of these proposals are based \non programs that have worked in practice or from recommendations made \nto Congress by the National Research Council. These provisions will \nimprove the management of our fisheries by improving the science that \nunderlies fishery management decisions or by enhancing local law \nenforcement efforts. These provisions will also ensure that the fishing \nindustry has a seat at the table in discussions about fishery science \nand management. We have long supported the need to bridge the science \ngap so that scientists and fishermen can engage in productive dialogue \non fishery management. This is essential to developing cooperative \nplans to achieving a common goal: sustainable fisheries for our \ncommunities.\n  The amendment (No. 4983) was agreed to.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 1989), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this year we mark the 57th anniversary \nof the end of the Holocaust. There are as many as 10,000 survivors of \nthe Holocaust in my home State of Illinois, and over 100,000 in the \nentire United States, with an average age of over 80.\n  Last year, Congress passed legislation I introduced exempting \nrestitution paid to Holocaust victims and their families from Federal \nincome tax. Unfortunately, this had to be done as an amendment to the \n2001 tax relief bill, all of the provisions of which expire at the end \nof the year 2010. In other words, under current law, the tax exemption \nafforded to Holocaust restitution payments by last year's legislation \nwill expire on December 21, 2010.\n  According to current estimates, there will be over 90,000 Holocaust \nsurvivors in the year 2010, and over 35,000 in 2020. Without the \nassurance of permanence in Federal tax policy towards Holocaust \nrestitution payments, victims of the Holocaust and their families will \nsuffer significant risk and uncertainty in tax planning and other \nimportant personal decisions.\n  The Federal Government should not make one dime on Holocaust \nrestitution, ever. The legislation we pass today--the Holocaust \nRestitution Tax Fairness Act of 2002--addresses this problem by \nensuring that Holocaust restitution and compensation payments will \nnever be taxed by the federal government.\n\n[[Page S11797]]\n\n  I want to thank the sixteen Senators who cosponsored this bill, as \nwell as Representative Clay Shaw, who spearheaded House passage of the \nHouse version of this bill earlier this year. I also want to thank the \nAnti-Defamation League, B'nai B'rith International, the Conference on \nJewish Material Claims, the International Commission on Holocaust Era \nInsurance Claims, the American Jewish Committee, the Union of Orthodox \nJewish Congregations of America, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, \nand the American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors--the largest \norganization of Holocaust survivors in America. The support of these \ngroups was critical in shepherding this legislation through the Senate.\n  After more than 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and their \nfamilies are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. In passing this \nlegislation today, Congress has done its part to protect the proceeds--\nand make that protection permanent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11797-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11797]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REPEALING THE SUNSET OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF \n                       RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4883, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4883) to reauthorize the Hydrographic Services \n     Improvement Act of 1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on H.R. 4883, a \nbill to reauthorize the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act of 1998. \nThis legislation authorizes programs supporting NOAA's strategic \nmissions to promote safe navigation and sustain healthy coasts. I am \nespecially supportive of this bill because it improves the hydrographic \nservices around our Nation and authorizes the activities of the \nCommissioned Corps of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA Corps.\n  Last week Congress approved the conference report on the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act, which will enhance security in our \nNation's ports. H.R. 4883 authorizes some key provisions to support \nthat effort by authorizing and increasing the number of officers in our \nNOAA Corps and supporting establishment of real time hydrographic \nmonitoring systems to enhance navigation and safety. NOAA's \nhydrographic programs share data and work closely with the U.S. Coast \nGuard and U.S. Navy, and such collaborations have increased since \nSeptember 11, 2001. Accurate navigation information supports safe and \nefficient military deployment and seaport evacuation. About 90 percent \nof all military equipment and supplies for overseas operations are \nshipped out of U.S. ports.\n  Seaports have always been an integral part of our Nation's commerce. \nToday, more than 95 percent of foreign trade by weight moves by sea, \nand trade is projected to double by 2020. Vessels are twice as large as \nthey were 50 years ago, testing the capabilities of many ports. \nIncreased ferry, cruise line, and recreational boating activities \ncontribute a rise in seaport congestion. Each year there are about \n3,500 commercial and 7,000 recreational boating accidents.\n  The safe and efficient movement of products depends upon the marine \ntransportation system. Advanced, highly accurate hydrographic, \noceanographic and related data improve mariners' situational, three-\ndimensional awareness, which increases efficiency, reduces risk, and \nsafeguards the marine environment. Such advanced data and services are \nan integral part of implementing an internationally compliant \nelectronic chart display and information system.\n  I am especially supportive and pleased that this bill includes \nlanguage to reauthorize the NOAA Corps. The NOAA Corps, the smallest of \nthe seven uniformed services of the United States, plays a very \nimportant role at NOAA and for the Nation. The service, consisting of \napproximately 265 commissioned officers, provides NOAA with \nprofessionals trained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, \nmeteorology, fisheries, science, and other related disciplines. The \nofficers serve in assignments within the five major line offices of \nNOAA: National Ocean Service, NOS; National Weather Service, NWS; \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS; Oceanic and Atmospheric \nResearch OAR; and National Environmental Satellite, Data, and \nInformation Service, NESDIS. Officers operate ships, fly aircraft into \nhurricanes, lead mobile field parties, manage research projects, \nconduct diving operations, and serve in staff positions throughout \nNOAA. In addition they conduct hydrographic surveys along our Nation's \ncoast in order to make our waters safe for marine commerce.\n  The NOAA Corps is essential to NOAA's coverage of our seas and our \nskies; in hours of crisis, NOAA employees have been found issuing the \ntornado warnings that saved hundreds of lives from a deadly storm, \nflying into the eyes of hurricanes to gather information about possible \nlandfall, fighting to free three gray whales trapped in the ice, \nfielding a massive scientific operation to guide the recovery from an \noil spill, and monitoring via satellites the movement of hurricanes and \nother severe storms, volcanic ash and wildfires that threaten \ncommunities.\n\n[[Page S11798]]\n\n  As marine professionals, the NOAA Corps personnel may be transferred \nto the military services in times of national emergency, and this bill \ndescribes a number of technical areas designed to bring the NOAA Corps \ninto line with Department of Defense standards in terms of rank, \npromotion and pay grade. This bill authorizes a gradual increase in the \nnumber of officers to accommodate the growing needs associated with new \nNavigation Response Teams that will be established and located in ports \naround the country.\n  Finally, this legislation amends the Oceans Act of 2000 to ensure \nthat the commission remains in existence 90 days after the date of the \nfinal submission of the report. This will allow the commission to \nprovide advice to Congress on its report and on the President's \nimplementation plan, but will not affect the due date established in \nthe Act for submission of the Commission's report. The amendment would \nalso authorize appropriations of $8.5 million; this increase reflects \nthe resources necessary to hold nine regional meetings--three more than \nmandated by the Oceans Act. These regional meetings are essential to \nensuring the views of all citizens are reflected in the work of the \nCommission, and I have fully supported this regional outreach effort, \nand the excellent work of the Ocean Commission and its staff.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the House of Representatives for \nworking with me to create a bill that does so much to enhance the \nsafety and navigation along our coasts.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, the legislation before the Senate, H.R. \n4883, the Hydrographic Services Improvement Act Amendments of 2002, \nincludes important provisions to reauthorize the NOAA Chesapeake Bay \nOffice, NCBO. This office which was first established in 1992 pursuant \nto Public Law 102-567, has been the focal point for all of NOAA's \nactivities within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and a vital part of the \neffort to achieve the long-term goal of the Bay Program--restoring the \nBay's living resources to healthy and balanced levels.\n  During the past 10 years, the NCBO has made great strides in \nrealizing the objectives of the NOAA Authorization Act of 1992 and the \noverall Bay Program living resource goals. Working with other Bay \nProgram partners, important progress has been made in surveying and \nassessing fishery resources in the Bay, developing fishery management \nplans for selected species, undertaking habitat restoration projects, \nremoving barriers to fish passage, and undertaking important remote \nsensing and data analysis activities. But NOAA's responsibilities to \nthe Bay restoration effort are far from complete. Some populations of \nmajor species of fish and shellfish in Chesapeake Bay such as shad and \noysters, remain severely depressed, while others, such as blue crab are \nat risk. Baywide, some 16 of 25 ecologically important species are in \ndecline or severe decline, due to disease, habitat loss, overfishing \nand other factors. The underwater grasses that once sustained these \nfisheries are only at a fraction of their historic levels. Research and \nmonitoring must be continued and enhanced to track living resource \ntrends, evaluate the responses of the estuary's biota to changes in \ntheir environment and establish clear management goals and progress \nindicators for restoring the productivity, diversity and abundance of \nthese species. Likewise, education to improve understanding by \nelementary and secondary students and teachers of the living resources \nin the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem is a top priority.\n  In order to ensure NOAA's continued full participation in the Bay's \nrestoration and in meeting with goals and objectives of Chesapeake \n2000, in the 106th Congress I introduced legislation, together with \nseveral of my colleagues, to reauthorize the NOAA Bay Program office \nand provide the office with additional resources and authority. No \naction was taken on that legislation so in the 107th Congress, Senators \nWarner, Mikulski, Allen and I introduced new legislation to reauthorize \nthe NCBO. A similar measure was introduced in the House by \nRepresentative Gilchrest and the entire Maryland House delegation and \nprovisions of these bills are included in section 401 of the \nlegislation before us. The provisions authorize and direct NOAA to \nundertake a special 5-year study, in cooperation with the scientific \ncommunity of the Chesapeake Bay and appropriate other Federal agencies, \nto develop the knowledge base required for understanding multispecies \ninteractions and developing multispecies management plans. NOAA is also \nauthorized to carry out a small-scale fishery and habitat restoration \ngrant and technical assistance program to help citizens organizations \nand local governments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed undertake \nhabitat, fish, and shellfish restoration projects. The legislation \nauthorizes $6 million a year specifically to fund the NOAA Chesapeake \nBay office and carry out these two activities. And I want to emphasize \nthat this authorization level is intended to address only NCBO's base \nbudget and these two initiatives and that additional funds are provided \nfor the work that the NCBO conducts in oyster reef restoration, oyster \ndisease research, education and training and blue crab research.\n  I am disappointed however that the legislation did not include two \nother provisions which we sought to create an internet-based Coastal \nPredictions Center for the Chesapeake Bay and to formally authorize the \nNOAA Chesapeake Bay Office's Bay Watershed Education and Training, B-\nWET, Program that we established last year. Moreover, it is critical \nthat the funding levels for the NOAA Bay Program activities continue to \ngrow to meet these needs and NOAA's responsibilities in oyster and SAV \nrestoration efforts, among other initiatives. If we are to achieve the \nultimate, long-term goal of the Bay Program--protecting, restoring and \nmaintaining the health of the living resources of the Bay--additional \nfinancial resources must be provided. I plan to introduce new \nlegislation in the 108th Congress to address these shortcomings and \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on the Commerce Committee in \nthis regard.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few comments \nconcerning H.R. 4883, a bill to reauthorize the Hydrographic Services \nImprovement Act of 1998. I am especially supportive of this bill's \ninclusion of language to reauthorize the Commissioned Corps of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA Corps. The NOAA \nCorps plays a very important role in NOAA and to our Nation.\n  The NOAA Corps is the smallest of the seven uniformed services of the \nUnited States. The service, consisting of approximately 299 \ncommissioned officers, is an integral part of NOAA, an agency under the \nU.S. Department of Commerce.\n  The NOAA Corps traces its roots back to the former U.S. Coast and \nGeodetic Survey, which dates back to 1807 and President Thomas \nJefferson. The NOAA Corps today provides a cadre of professionals \ntrained in engineering, earth sciences, oceanography, meteorology, \nfisheries science, and other related disciplines. The officers serve in \nassignments within the five major Line Offices of NOAA: National Ocean \nService, NOS; National Weather Service, NWS; National Marine Fisheries \nService, NMFS; Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, OAR; and National \nEnvironmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service, NESDIS. \nOfficers operate ships, fly aircraft into hurricanes, lead mobile field \nparties, manage research projects, conduct diving operations, and serve \nin staff positions throughout NOAA. In addition they conduct \nhydrographic surveys along our nation's coast in order to make our \nwaters safe for marine commerce.\n  As Chairman of the Oceans, Atmosphere and Fisheries Subcommittee \nallow me to explain a little about NOAA. NOAA provides timely and \nprecise weather, water and climate forecasts, to monitoring the \nenvironment, to managing fisheries and building healthy coastlines, to \nmaking our nation more competitive through safe navigation and \nexamining changes in the oceans, NOAA is on the front lines for \nAmerica.\n  In hours of crisis, NOAA employees have been found issuing the \ntornado warnings that saved hundreds of lives from a deadly storm, \nflying into the eyes of hurricanes to gather information about possible \nlandfall, fighting to free three grey whales trapped in the ice, \nfielding a massive scientific operation on the shores to guide the \ncomeback from an oil spill, and monitoring by satellites the movement \nof hurricanes and other severe storms, volcanic\n\n[[Page S11799]]\n\nash and wildfires that threaten communities.\n  In 1882 the U.S.S. Albatross, the first government research vessel \nbuilt exclusively for fisheries and oceanographic research, launched \nboth a future for NOAA's research programs and a fleet of research \nvessels. Today, NOAA scientists along with their university partners, \nwork to better understand the world in which we live. NOAA research is \nwhere much of the work is done that results in better weather \nforecasts, longer warning lead times for natural disasters, new \nproducts from the sea, and a greater understanding of our climate, \natmosphere and oceans. NOAA research is done not only in what many \nwould consider traditional laboratories, but also aboard ships, aloft \nin planes, and beneath the sea in the world's only undersea habitat. \nNOAA research tools can be as high-tech as supercomputers or as basic \nas rain gauges. The officers of the NOAA Corps operate NOAA's fleet of \nresearch vessels and aircraft. Those of us on the Commerce Committee \nlike to think of NOAA as the little agency that does a lot. The NOAA \nCorps is an integral part of the NOAA team that brings all of these \nvaluable services to the American public.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, a bill that should have passed this year is \nH.R. 3100, the Community Renewal Act. We could pass this bill tonight. \nWe could have passed it last night or the night\n\n[[Page S11801]]\n\nbefore. But some in the minority have objected to its consideration. \nThis is too bad.\n  I will not offer the UC tonight, other than to say that Senator \nClinton has worked very hard on this bill to get it cleared on our \nside. It is a bipartisan bill that would allow HUD-designated renewal \ncommunities to take advantage of more recent 2000 census data in \ndetermining their boundaries.\n  This bill is important for more States than New York. Senator Clinton \nhas been the leader on this issue, but it is an important piece of \nlegislation. It affects not only New York but Tennessee, Alabama, \nKentucky, Colorado, Louisiana, Ohio, Texas, Mississippi, Washington, \nand other States.\n  Senator Clinton cleared this bill with the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Finance Committee, Senators Baucus and Grassley. That was \nnot enough. It is regrettable despite all our efforts Republicans could \nnot clear this fine legislation. I commend the Senator from New York \nfor her good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/11/20/senate-section/article/S11801-1", "month": "11", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT SINE DIE OR RECESS\n\n  Mr. REID.
